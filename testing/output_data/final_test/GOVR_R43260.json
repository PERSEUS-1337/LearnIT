    "content": "Recent controversies surrounding government foreign surveillance have led to calls for a more rigorous judiciary review of surveillance requests under FISA. Suggestions include making FISC proceedings more adversarial by introducing a public advocate to argue against government requests. This concept is unique in the American legal system, with few comparable analogues. The proposal for a public advocate in FISA proceedings is a novel concept in American law, raising constitutional questions. The report will explore the legal role of a public advocate, how they can be constitutionally appointed, and whether their presence in federal court aligns with the US Constitution. The adversarial process in the United States legal system involves attorneys presenting evidence to a neutral decision maker. Ex parte proceedings, where only one party addresses the court without opposition, are rare exceptions, typically seen in pretrial criminal procedures like grand jury proceedings and FISA court cases. FISA proceedings are primarily ex parte, authorized for electronic surveillance and searches for foreign intelligence. Calls for a more adversarial process have arisen due to concerns about lack of scrutiny. Some argue for a more adversarial process in FISA proceedings to protect civil liberties. Various proposals suggest titles like \"Special Advocate\" or \"Public Advocate\" to oppose government surveillance requests. Ideas differ on the structure of this office within the executive branch. Some proposals suggest establishing a public advocate office within the executive or judicial branch to provide adversarial representation in FISA proceedings. Various government actors have been suggested to appoint the attorney to lead this office. Government office to serve as devil's advocate in favor of requiring FISC court to appoint private attorneys for FISA proceedings. Reform proposals aim to make proceedings more adversarial with a public advocate representing privacy and civil liberties interests. Public advocate proposals for FISA court proceedings involve the advocate having various responsibilities, such as intervening in cases, briefing the court, conducting discovery, filing motions for relief, and appealing rulings. The advocate is envisioned to be independent from the President and the FISC, potentially in a separate DOJ division or an independent agency with removal protections. Public advocate proposals for FISA court proceedings involve the advocate having various responsibilities, such as intervening in cases, briefing the court, conducting discovery, filing motions for relief, and appealing rulings. The advocate is envisioned to be independent from the President and the FISC, potentially in a separate DOJ division or an independent agency with removal protections. The advocate would have nearly unfettered discretion with respect to types of argumentation and general strategy. The constitutional implications of including a public advocate in FISA proceedings depend on whether the advocate is a sovereign entity subject to the constraints of the Constitution. In FISA proceedings, the role of an opposition advocate is debated, with arguments that they are not a government actor but rather represent privacy interests. The advocate's adversarial relationship with the government is compared to a public defender in a criminal case, suggesting they operate outside the traditional branches of government and are not bound by constitutional constraints. The role of an opposition advocate in FISA proceedings is debated, with arguments that they represent privacy interests and are not a government actor. They are compared to a public defender, operating independently and not bound by constitutional constraints. Congress's disavowal of a federally created entity's status as a government agent in a statute is not controlling. The criteria for determining if an entity qualifies as a federal entity include whether the government created it by special law, for governmental objectives, and retains authority to appoint directors. Proposals for a public advocate office meet the first and third criteria, but the key question is whether they serve a governmental objective. A public advocate office serves a governmental objective by carrying out activities that benefit the general public, such as providing library services and higher education facilities. The office would seek injunctive or declaratory relief for violations of government laws, making it a governmental entity focused on protecting the privacy interests of the public. A permanent public advocate would ensure privacy interests in foreign intelligence proceedings are respected, representing a generalized interest before the FISC. The role of a FISA advocate is different from a public defender in criminal cases. It is unclear if a private party representing civil liberties before the FISC can be considered part of the government. The Lebron test determines if an entity is part of the government, with a permanent corporate entity being more likely to be considered as such. A temporary, private FISA advocate may not be seen as a governmental actor. Establishing a permanent office of a FISA public advocate raises constitutional questions regarding adherence to the Appointments Clause. The Appointments Clause of Article II of the Constitution requires the President to nominate and appoint certain officers with the Senate's advice and consent. Principal officers are appointed this way, while Congress may choose to appoint inferior officers themselves. The Appointments Clause allows Congress to appoint \"inferior officers\" to preserve political accountability. The key question is whether the public advocate qualifies as an officer of the United States. The Supreme Court has clarified that employees are subordinate to officers and do not invoke the constitutional requirements of the Appointments Clause. The Court has clarified that an office or officer entails tenure, duration, emolument, and duties, which are continuing and permanent. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Court analyzed the appointment of members of the Federal Election Commission to oversee federal elections, focusing on the composition of the FEC and the Appointments Clause requirements. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is composed of six members appointed by different branches of government. The FEC's duties include information flow, promoting act goals, and ensuring compliance with the statute. The Court determined that the FEC exercises executive power due to its non-investigative and informative functions. The Supreme Court ruled that the method of appointment for FEC commissioners violated the Appointments Clause as they were considered \"Officers of the United States\" and must be appointed in accordance with the clause. The Court determined that FEC commissioners were inferior officers requiring Senate confirmation or appointment by the President, courts, or department heads. The Supreme Court found that FEC commissioners, as \"Officers of the United States,\" must be appointed in accordance with the Appointments Clause. The Court did not extensively analyze the meaning of \"significant authority\" but referred to an opinion from the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel discussing essential elements of a public office subject to the clause. This includes the delegation of sovereign powers by legal authority. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) outlined two key elements for a position to be considered \"continuing\" under the Appointments Clause. The first element is that the position must possess delegated sovereign authority that is permanent and not limited by time. The second element involves a temporary delegation of sovereign authority, which depends on three factors for qualification. These factors include the position not being personal, having authority that can bind the rights of others, and being subject to revision only according to state laws. The central issue is whether a proposed FISA advocate would exercise \"significant authority\" on behalf of the United States, potentially making them an \"officer\" subject to the Appointments Clause. Many proposals suggest the advocate would have a continuing role in representing the sovereign authority of the United States. Many proposals for a public advocate in the FISA court aim to give the advocate permanent authority to litigate for privacy and civil liberties interests of the public. This could potentially make them an \"officer\" subject to the Appointments Clause, similar to the role of members of the FEC in conducting litigation. A public advocate with the authority to challenge foreign surveillance applications must be an officer of the United States, similar to roles like district court clerks or election supervisors. While temporary appointments from the private sector may not violate the Appointments Clause, most public advocate legislation would establish a significant government position. The public advocate legislation aims to establish a non-personal position with a broad and continuous role in reviewing FISA court requests and actively opposing them. The question arises whether this advocate would be considered a principal or inferior officer under the Appointments Clause, which requires Senate confirmation for principal officers. The Supreme Court has struggled to clearly distinguish between principal and inferior officers for Appointments Clause purposes. In Morrison v. Olson, the Court used a multi-factor test to determine officer status, while Justice Scalia argued that subordination to a principal officer should be the guiding factor. In Edmond v. United States, the Court leaned towards Scalia's view, emphasizing the relationship in defining an inferior officer. The Supreme Court has defined \"inferior officer\" as someone whose work is supervised by higher-ranking officers appointed by the President with Senate approval. This was confirmed in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, where oversight board members were considered inferior officers because they were overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Court's focus is on whether an officer's conduct can be controlled by a politically accountable superior appointed by the President and Senate. The proposals for creating a FISA advocate aim to establish an independent officer accountable through presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. The advocate would be considered a principal officer and would not be supervised by other entities within the executive branch. Some proposals include \"for cause\" removal protections to prevent interference from other government offices. The creation of a FISA advocate aims to establish an independent officer with significant authority in litigating in the FISA courts. This advocate would be autonomous and not supervised by other government offices, requiring appointment by the President with Senate confirmation to ensure political accountability. If the Supreme Court shifts to the multi-factor approach in Morrison, a public advocate could be considered an inferior officer with limited duties and tenure. The appointment of the advocate by the courts raises constitutional and separation of powers concerns. The Court has recognized that Congress's decision to vest the appointment power in the courts would be in violation of the Appointments Clause if there was some \"incongruity\" between the functions normally performed by the courts and the duty to appoint. In Morrison, the Court found no incongruity with having a court appoint an independent counsel, as \"courts are especially well qualified to appoint prosecutors.\" One could argue that the FISA advocate would be analogous to the independent counsel position in Morrison, in that the position would be one in which the government is concerned with avoiding a conflict of interest with the executive branch's prerogatives regarding foreign surveillance. The appointment of a public advocate by the judiciary for foreign surveillance is seen as logical, given the expertise of federal courts like the FISA court. However, concerns arise regarding the appointment process lacking an ineligibility provision, potentially leading to incongruity between the FISA court's functions and appointment power. The appointment of a public advocate for foreign surveillance by the judiciary is questioned due to incongruity between the FISA court's functions and appointment power, as federal courts lack competence in national security and foreign affairs. This raises legal concerns under the Appointments Clause and Article III of the Constitution. Some commentators question if a FISA public advocate can argue both sides of a case, casting doubt on court oversight. Two arguments analyze how a public advocate can be included in FISA proceedings without violating Article III. One argument questions if FISA proceedings are subject to Article III limitations. The federal judiciary's powers, defined in Article III, are limited to adjudicating cases and controversies. Rules like standing, mootness, and ripeness ensure courts only hear matters within their jurisdiction to prevent overstepping constitutional boundaries and encroaching on other branches' powers. The Court's case-or-controversy requirement necessitates litigant adverseness, ensuring a live dispute with concrete legal interests. Adversity in legal interests, rather than two adverse parties, is key. This principle was upheld in cases like Pope v. United States and United States v. Johnson. In United States v. Johnson, the Supreme Court dismissed a suit due to the absence of a genuine adversary issue between the parties. In Muskrat v. United States, the Court rejected a case challenging the constitutionality of a statute, stating it was an attempt to provide a judicial determination on an act of Congress, not an exercise of judicial power. The federal judiciary's role in FISA proceedings may not need to independently satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement, as seen in Morrison v. Olson and Mistretta v. United States. In Morrison, the Court tested the constitutionality of the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 created a Special Division of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, allowing for the appointment of an independent counsel with defined duties. The Court determined that these duties did not exceed Article III constraints, citing the non-adjudicatory functions performed by federal judges. Federal courts have traditionally supervised grand juries, assisted in their investigative function, compelled witness testimony if necessary, issued search warrants, and reviewed applications for wiretaps. In Mistretta v. United States, the Court upheld placing Article III judges on the United States Sentencing Commission, stating that Congress can assign administrative or rulemaking duties to courts or auxiliary bodies within the Judicial Branch. The Judicial Branch can perform administrative duties necessary for executing judgments, as stated by Chief Justice Marshall. Article III courts can issue search warrants and wiretap orders, as seen in Morrison and Mistretta. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review upheld FISA proceedings in line with Morrison and Mistretta, stating that FISA Court responsibilities align with Article III case-or-controversy requirements. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review upheld FISA proceedings, stating that they are incidental to the federal judiciary's Article III powers, similar to the roles of the Special Division in Morrison and the United States Sentencing Commission in Mistretta. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review upheld FISA proceedings as incidental to Article III powers, similar to the Special Division in Morrison and the United States Sentencing Commission in Mistretta. This suggests that constraints like standing, mootness, ripeness, and political questions may not apply in non-adjudicatory functions of the federal judiciary. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review upheld FISA proceedings as incidental to federal judicial powers, similar to other non-adjudicatory functions. FISA proceedings differ from traditional warrant procedures as they lack the same level of judicial process for contesting results. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review upheld FISA proceedings as incidental to federal judicial powers, similar to other non-adjudicatory functions. Targets of FISA orders are generally not notified of the surveillance and lack a statutory method of contesting their legality. Unlike traditional warrant proceedings, information obtained from FISA surveillance is rarely used in criminal prosecutions that could satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement. FISA proceedings, while not adversarial, involve the federal judiciary in a non-traditional role, potentially exceeding their Article III powers. A public advocate in FISA proceedings could align with the traditional understanding of Article III powers, as long as they meet general requirements like standing. The DOJ supports this view based on the traditional understanding of Article III. The DOJ argued during the late 1970s FISA debates that the proposed FISA proceedings satisfied Article III's case-or-controversy requirement by having \"adversity in fact\" or \"possible adverse parties\" present, such as the United States' interest in conducting surveillance and the target's interest in not being surveilled. They also contended that the FISA orders were similar enough to traditional warrants to be constitutional. The DOJ argued during the late 1970s FISA debates that the FISA orders were analogous to traditional warrants to uphold their constitutionality. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York and the District Court for the Southern District of California accepted this argument, stating that FISC proceedings involving electronic surveillance applications under FISA are in a form that judges can act on, and the ex parte nature of FISC proceedings is consistent with Article III. The FISA Court operates under Title III on an ex parte basis, retaining inherent powers like any court considering a warrant. The question arises whether a FISA advocate can participate constitutionally in the proceedings, potentially limited by Article III requirements. The Supreme Court has consistently required a party to show personal injury when invoking federal court jurisdiction for judicial resolution. To establish constitutional standing in federal court, a party must show a concrete and particularized injury that is actual or imminent, not hypothetical. There must be a causal connection between the injury and the challenged conduct, and it must be likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. This ensures that those with a direct stake in the case have access to seek relief from the court. In federal court, standing requires a concrete injury that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision, ensuring those with a direct stake can seek relief. Third parties without standing can still participate in adversarial proceedings if one party meets standing requirements, as seen in Bowsher v. Synar. In federal court, standing requires a concrete injury likely to be redressed by a favorable decision, allowing third parties without standing to participate if one party meets requirements. Standingless intervenors can support active parties but have limited roles in ongoing cases. For example, in Diamond v. Charles, they can file briefs and participate in arguments but cannot seek judicial relief if no party with standing seeks identical relief. In federal court, standing requires a concrete injury likely to be redressed by a favorable decision, allowing third parties without standing to participate if one party meets requirements. Standingless intervenors can support active parties but have limited roles in ongoing cases. Third parties can participate in ongoing matters in an Article III court, but their ability to seek relief and take independent action is restricted. Article III prohibits a federal court from providing judicial relief beyond what an existing party with standing has sought. In federal court, standing requires a concrete injury likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. Third parties without standing can participate if one party meets requirements. Standingless intervenors can support active parties but have limited roles in ongoing cases. Article III prohibits a federal court from providing judicial relief beyond what an existing party with standing has sought. The role of an amicus in federal court proceedings is unclear, with some courts limiting their participation to providing a different perspective, impartial information, or legal observations. Other courts have allowed amici to play a broader role, including conducting discovery and enforcing judgments. If courts expand the role of amici beyond providing non-partisan legal accounts, it could have implications for Article III proceedings. The amicus in federal court proceedings can have a limited role in providing non-partisan legal accounts or a broader role, potentially allowing third parties to bypass Article III standing requirements. A public advocate with a limited role, such as providing briefing on general interest topics, may not violate Article III. However, if the advocate takes on a broader role, they may need to meet traditional standing requirements. The FISC recently allowed a public interest group to submit an amicus brief but denied broader motions from the group. The court denied the public interest group's motions for reconsideration, establishing a docket for the United States' next application on bulk telephony metadata collection, filing a public legal brief, and ordering a hearing en banc. The FISC stated that the relief requested by the group exceeded the appropriate limits of an amicus curiae. The FISA advocate would need to satisfy Article III's standing requirements to intervene in a case, as there is likely no existing party seeking the same relief. It is unlikely that the advocate personally suffered any injury from government surveillance activities, making standing an obstacle to challenging such programs. Congress cannot bypass Article III's standing requirements. The FISA advocate faces challenges in meeting Article III's standing requirements to intervene in cases involving government surveillance. Congress cannot override these requirements, and the advocate may need to rely on third-party standing to participate. Standing-to-sue involves constitutional and prudential limitations on federal-court jurisdiction. The prudential standing requirements in federal-court jurisdiction state that a party cannot base their claim on the legal rights of third parties. There is an exception when there is a close relation to the third party and hindrance to protect their interests. These rules can be modified by Congress but are assumed to apply unless expressly negated in statute. Legislation must explicitly grant the public advocate the right to litigate on behalf of third parties. Even if Congress removes prudential standing requirements, Article III still requires a party to have suffered an injury-in-fact. A public advocate seeking relief for third parties may need to meet Article III's standing requirements. There is a standing law allowing individuals to assert the rights of absent third parties without showing their own injury-in-fact. Under the doctrine of representational standing, certain relationships can allow litigants to assert the rights of absent third parties. For example, through associational standing, an association can sue on behalf of its members if their interests align with the organization's purpose and individual members don't need to participate in the lawsuit. States can also have standing to litigate as parens partiae to protect certain interests. The standing doctrine allows states to litigate as parens partiae to protect quasi-sovereign interests. An assignee of a claim can assert the injury suffered by the assignor. Two strands of representational standing relevant to FISA public advocate seeking relief are \"next friend\" standing and the \"agency theory\" of standing. \"Next friend\" standing allows a qualifying party to bring claims on behalf of another party with proper standing. Whitmore v. set limits on next friend standing. The Court in Whitmore v. Arkansas set limits on next friend standing, explaining that a 'next friend' pursues a cause on behalf of another without becoming a party to the case. Federal statutes do not authorize 'next friends' participation, and the scope of standing is limited by habeas corpus statutes. The Supreme Court in Whitmore v. Arkansas established two prerequisites for 'next friend' standing: the 'next friend' must provide a valid reason why the real party cannot appear, and must genuinely act in the best interests of the person they represent. These limitations prevent abuse of 'next friend' standing to bypass jurisdictional limits. The Court in Whitmore concluded that the petitioner failed to show that Simmons was \"unable to proceed on his own behalf\" and dismissed the next friend claim for lack of standing. Next friend standing may be challenging for a public advocate to seek relief on behalf of the public-at-large, as it still requires the real party to suffer an injury-in-fact. It is unclear if foreign surveillance conduct results in a concrete injury to the general public. Additionally, the FISA advocate's real parties may be capable of protecting their own rights. The FISA advocate represents parties capable of protecting their own rights and prosecuting an action. Unlike a typical next friend, they do not represent individuals with disabilities. The inaccessibility to FISA courts for targets of government surveillance is different from the typical next friend standing context. Members of the general public may not be aware of their rights being violated. Members of the general public may have access to courts to assert privacy concerns regarding government surveillance. Judicial review in challenges to foreign surveillance efforts is not farfetched, making it difficult for a public advocate to argue against court access. Difficulty may arise in demonstrating a significant relationship with absent parties, and it is unclear if FISA advocate proposals involve seeking relief for specific individuals or groups. Federal courts are hesitant to grant \"next friend\" standing to those unable to identify a real party. Courts are reluctant to grant \"next friend\" standing to individuals who cannot identify a real party in interest and only claim to represent a large group of unidentified individuals. The advocate likely has no prior relationship with the majority of the real parties in interest, making their relationship insufficient. The FISA advocate's proceedings would likely lack communication with the real parties due to the secrecy and confidentiality obligations of the FISA judicial review process. The FISA advocate may struggle to establish a necessary relationship with the real parties in interest to qualify as a \"next friend\" in court, as communication and consent may be lacking. The burden is on the advocate to clearly justify their status and the court's jurisdiction over their claims. The FISA advocate may find it challenging to establish a relationship with the real parties in interest to qualify as a \"next friend\" in court. Communication and consent may be lacking, making it difficult for the advocate to justify their status and the court's jurisdiction over their claims. The FISA advocate faces challenges in establishing a relationship with the real parties in interest to qualify as a \"next friend\" in court. The concept of a FISA public interest advocate is novel in American law, and there are arguments against granting them standing in federal court to adjudicate prayers for relief on behalf of absent third parties. The best argument for establishing an office of the FISA advocate is that they would be acting under statutory authorization, distinguishing them from previous cases. The FISA advocate, acting under statutory authorization, has a legal obligation to represent the privacy rights of the public or targets of government surveillance. This obligation allows the advocate to vindicate the rights of third parties through litigation, as they are dedicated to the best interests of those they represent. The FISA advocate, with statutory authorization, represents the privacy rights of the public or surveillance targets. However, empowering the advocate as a \"next friend\" for the general public may not address concerns about asserting the interests of absent third parties without a relationship. Whitmore's ruling did not hinge on lacking statutory authority, and courts limiting \"next friend\" standing have done so when Congress allows third-party rights under the habeas statute. The scope of \"next friend\" standing is limited by the habeas corpus statute. The Supreme Court's Whitmore decision emphasized limits on \"next friend\" standing to prevent circumvention of Article III jurisdictional limits. Allowing a FISA advocate to represent public privacy interests could violate these core concerns. The office aims to protect individual rights and advocate for privacy and civil liberties interests. Congress's ability to grant a public advocate standing as a \"next friend\" raises concerns about expanding judicial power and potentially overriding jurisdictional limits. The statutory authorization of a public advocate as a \"next friend\" may not alleviate Article III concerns. However, the advocate could potentially seek relief in a FISA proceeding as an agent of a party with standing, under the \"agency theory\" of standing. Agency theory of standing in Article III courts requires a litigant to be authorized by a third party to seek judicial relief, aligning the litigant's interest with the principal's. The Supreme Court case of Hollingworth v. Perry exemplified these limits in an Equal Protection challenge to Proposition 8 in California. The Supreme Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry considered whether the official \"proponents\" of Proposition 8 had standing to appeal the district court's decision. They rejected the argument that the proponents had a particularized injury and also dismissed the claim that the plaintiffs were authorized to litigate on behalf of the State of California. The Court found that California law did not authorize the petitioners to act as agents of the people, but only allowed them to argue in defense of Proposition 8. The Supreme Court in Hollingsworth v. Perry ruled that the proponents of Proposition 8 did not have standing to appeal the district court's decision. They were merely allowed to argue in defense of Proposition 8, not acting as de facto public officials. The Court emphasized that to seek judicial relief on behalf of a third party, a litigant must be officially authorized by that party and exhibit basic features of an agency relationship. The advocate seeking judicial relief must be the real party in interest and officially authorized by a specific party, not representing a generalized interest like the public-at-large. This is in line with the Supreme Court's ruling in Hollingsworth v. Perry regarding standing to appeal court decisions. The privacy advocate would likely not have constitutional standing in government surveillance cases under FISA, as there is no agency relationship with the injured party. Hollingsworth v. Perry emphasizes the need for the advocate to be officially authorized by a specific party, not representing a generalized interest. A public advocate for FISA proceedings could potentially have standing to seek judicial relief before the FISC as an agent of the government, but there may be challenges in establishing this relationship. The argument for a permanent government official as a FISA advocate is challenged by proposals for a private attorney appointed ad hoc by the FISC. There is a distinction between a government entity seeking relief and advocating for personal rights outside the government. Many advocate proposals envision independence from the government to represent public privacy rights against the government's position. The concept of a FISA advocate being independent from the government and arguing against the government's position is discussed, with questions raised about the advocate's role as an agent of the government. The constitutionality of allowing the FISA advocate to seek judicial relief before the FISC is also considered. The constitutionality of allowing the FISA advocate to seek judicial relief in federal court raises questions about separation of powers and the \"case-or-controversy\" requirement, as federal courts do not entertain suits against oneself. The Supreme Court has emphasized the uniqueness of the government appearing multiple times in court. The United States is the sole sovereign entity for constitutional standing purposes, raising concerns about government agencies litigating against each other in federal court over conflicting views on sovereign interests. The Supreme Court warns against courts becoming mediators for administrative disputes, emphasizing that mere claims of intra-branch disputes do not automatically bar federal jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has cautioned that courts must look beyond names symbolizing parties to determine justiciable cases. In United States v. ICC, the Court allowed the government to sue the ICC in federal court over a dispute involving the government's interests conflicting with private entities, such as railroads. The Supreme Court emphasized in Newport News Shipbuilding that justiciable cases can involve conflicts between government agencies and private entities, such as railroads. In United States v. Nixon, the Court ruled that disputes between the Watergate special prosecutor and the Chief Executive fell within the traditional scope of Article III power. Other justiciable intra-branch disputes have arisen, including when one agency is sued by another agency enforcing federal labor laws. The Supreme Court has not provided a formal test for when an Article III court can adjudicate a dispute between two government agencies. Proposals allowing FISA courts to resolve disputes between a public advocate and the DOJ's National Security Division may raise Article III justiciability concerns. The dispute could be seen as between the general public and the government over foreign surveillance efforts, but this interpretation may conflict with recent Supreme Court decisions. The ICC case conflicts with recent Supreme Court interpretations regarding government participation in the market regulated by FISA. The ICC case involved a clear legal conflict between identifiable parties over monetary injury, unlike a dispute over legal relief sought by a public advocate. The assumption that the general public has standing to challenge foreign surveillance practices and that the government can represent a real party in interest without a legally recognized relationship raises concerns. The dispute between the general public and the executive branch over foreign surveillance is more of a political argument settled by elected branches, rather than a justiciable controversy. Congress assigning a government agent to assert a legal right against another governmental entity could potentially involve federal courts in political disputes, conflicting with Article III. This differs from cases where federal courts adjudicate intra-branch disputes. The dispute between the FISA advocate and the Justice Department revolves around conflicting sovereign interests - foreign surveillance for national security vs. privacy rights. Intra-branch litigation on foreign surveillance raises constitutional issues, potentially violating Article II. Having federal courts arbitrate such disputes may go against the principle of not adjudicating disputes within a single legal entity. The dispute over foreign surveillance involves conflicting sovereign interests - national security vs. privacy rights. Intra-branch litigation on this issue may raise constitutional concerns regarding Article II. Congress can create independent agencies with limited executive control, but the unique role of the Executive in national security may still be relevant. In the context of national security, the Executive's role in protecting national security is considered a \"purely executive\" function that may not be challenged by other government agents. Congress has subordinated independent agencies to executive control in matters related to the President's powers and foreign concerns. Allowing an independent FISA advocate to seek judicial relief that could interfere with the President's foreign surveillance powers raises separation of power issues. Congress has the power to regulate foreign affairs, but empowering an independent agency to override the President's authority raises concerns. Empowering an independent agency to seek judicial relief that could override a foreign intelligence operation sought by the President may be seen as interfering with core executive powers. The role of independent agencies in foreign affairs activities may pose a constitutional question, with politics potentially adjudicating the issue. Some proposals suggest creating a public advocate for FISA courts in the judicial branch. Creating a public advocate for FISA courts in the judicial branch may raise separation of powers concerns, as seen in the Mistretta case regarding independent agencies within the judiciary. The proposal could potentially expand judicial powers beyond constitutional bounds or undermine the integrity of the Judicial Branch. A public advocate in the judicial branch for FISA courts may raise separation of powers concerns, similar to the Mistretta case. This could potentially expand judicial powers beyond constitutional bounds or undermine the integrity of the Judicial Branch. The Sentencing Commission formalized judges' everyday business in sentencing decisions. Public advocate proposals could enhance the judicial branch's role in enforcing the law, but concerns exist about courts litigating on behalf of the US for civil liberties. Placing a public advocate in the judicial branch may conflict with the impartiality of federal courts. The Supreme Court has recognized that Congress can assign certain \"extrajudicial activities\" to the judicial branch, but locating an advocate who opposes government foreign surveillance efforts in the judicial branch may compromise its impartiality and expertise. The lack of precedent on housing an agency with independent litigating authority within the judiciary raises constitutional concerns about separation of powers. Suggestions include automatic review of FISC decisions by higher courts to address concerns about public advocates seeking relief from federal courts. The possibility of federal appellate courts hearing appeals not initiated by a party is questionable due to the dearth of federal law allowing for automatic appeals. The lack of federal law allowing for automatic appeals raises concerns about federal appellate courts hearing appeals not initiated by a party, potentially ruling outside of a case or controversy. State courts have not allowed cases to proceed on automatic appeal when only an amicus wishes for it to continue, raising constitutional concerns about the judiciary's power to decide cases conclusively. The judiciary's power to render dispositive judgments cannot be overridden by Congress, as it cannot prescribe rules of decision in cases pending before the courts. Congressional enactments that automatically suspend court orders threaten the courts' duty to decide cases properly. The Supreme Court has allowed temporary suspension of court orders based on changes in substantive law. Some proposals aim to increase appellate review of FISC decisions, such as allowing certification of pure questions of law for review by another court. This could be seen as Congress usurping the judicial function of deciding cases with finality. When a question is certified on a state law issue, the responding court does not assume jurisdiction over the parties or subject matter. The certifying court retains the right to determine actual controversies between litigants. Allowing federal courts to respond to certified questions may raise constitutional issues, as it could be seen as issuing advisory opinions. Reviewing the entire case record with a certification could address concerns about answering abstract or hypothetical questions. A court accepting a question of law on certification in an ongoing case may still be consistent with Article III requirements. The means by which a certification occurs could raise concerns about non-party relief and standing to seek judicial relief. The federal court must only exercise its judicial power in favor of a party with a shown injury likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. In enacting FISA in 1978, Congress attempted to provide procedural mechanisms for appeals in cases involving government surveillance requests. However, the discretion of when an appeal of a FISC order can occur is currently in the hands of the court that issued the opinion, potentially limiting the number of appeals from non-parties. In 1978, Congress enacted FISA to involve federal courts in approving executive branch foreign surveillance requests while balancing constitutional demands and secrecy. Lower courts have largely upheld the legality of FISA's judicial review process, despite ongoing debates. Proposed public advocate measures aim to reform the FISA judicial review process following revelations about federal foreign surveillance tools in 2013. Proposed public advocate measures aim to reform the FISA judicial review process by adding a public advocate in FISA proceedings to ensure differing points of view are presented to the FISA courts. The legality of any public advocate proposal enacted into law may ultimately be a matter to be resolved by the courts, as concerns have been raised about potential constitutional issues. Any proposal altering the FISA court review process should consider the constitutional limits imposed. The inclusion of a public advocate in the FISA process may face challenges based on constitutional constraints, which could lead to judicial review. The details of public advocate proposals vary widely, with some suggesting a permanent advocate with broad oversight powers. The inclusion of a public advocate in the FISA court review process may face constitutional challenges, with proposals varying in scope and oversight powers. The role of the advocate in a proposal could impact the likelihood of raising constitutional issues, and alternative methods may also help ensure thorough scrutiny of government surveillance applications. The government's surveillance applications undergo thorough scrutiny, avoiding constitutional concerns raised by broad public advocate proposals."
