Congress finds that North Korean negotiators in the Six-Party diplomatic process did not act in good faith by refusing to agree to a transparent verification process for denuclearization. International press reports indicate North Korea's support to Iran in missile technology and nuclear development, as well as providing Hezbollah and Hamas with missile technology and tunneling techniques to attack Israel. North Korea assisted Syria in building a nuclear reactor destroyed by Israel in 2007. North Korean negotiators refuse to address the abduction of civilians from Japan, South Korea, and other countries. Defectors reported the torture and murder of Reverend Kim Dong-shik in North Korea. Congress has expressed its view that US nonhumanitarian assistance to North Korea should be contingent on human rights improvements, release of abductees, family reunification, labor camp reform, and decriminalization of political expression. The North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2008 acknowledges the deplorable human rights conditions in North Korea and the vulnerability of North Korean refugees. Congress has determined that any missile test by North Korea would violate UN Security Council resolutions. The North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2008 acknowledges the deplorable human rights conditions in North Korea and the vulnerability of North Korean refugees. Congress has determined that any missile test by North Korea would violate UN Security Council resolutions. North Korea must re-establish commitments to a moratorium on missile launching, with resulting sanctions imposed under resolution 1718 coming into full effect following a missile test or launch. A return to the Six-Party diplomatic process by North Korea must include a commitment to dismantling all nuclear programs. Japanese press reports suggest a delegation of Iranian missile experts. A delegation of around fifteen Iranian missile experts arrived in North Korea in March 2009 to assist with preparations for a rocket launch. They included senior officials from the Iranian rocket and satellite producer Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, carrying a letter from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il emphasizing cooperation on space technology. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. CONTINUATION OF RESTRICTIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF NORTH KOREA.\" is a statement regarding the continuation of restrictions against North Korea. Despite the Secretary of State's decision in 2008 to remove North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, restrictions imposed on the government due to its support for international terrorism remain in place unless the President certifies otherwise. North Korea is no longer involved in illegal transfer of missile or nuclear technology to countries supporting terrorism. They are also not engaged in training or supporting organizations like Hamas, Hezbollah, or the Japanese Red Army. Despite being removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism in 2008, restrictions remain unless certified otherwise by the President. North Korea has ceased engaging in counterfeiting US currency and trafficking illicit narcotics into the US, Japan, Australia, or other allied countries. North Korea has released detained journalists and abduction victims, as well as surviving South Korean POWs from the Korean War. North Korea has made provisions for family reunification meetings for Korean-American community members with relatives in North Korea and opened its penal system for visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross. North Korea has allowed family reunification meetings for Korean-American community members and visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross to its penal system. Additionally, the country has provided for health assessments of forcibly repatriated refugees and unrestricted contact between international and South Korean religious organizations and their counterparts in North Korea. Continuation of diplomatic nonrecognition of North Korea. Congress finds that the United States has not granted diplomatic recognition to North Korea since its establishment in 1948 as a client regime of the Soviet Union. This nonrecognition has been maintained for 59 years due to North Korea's attack on South Korea in 1950, leading to the Korean War and significant casualties. The diplomatic nonrecognition, including restrictions on establishing a permanent presence in North Korea, will continue until the President certifies to Congress otherwise. The President must certify to Congress that North Korea has met specified benchmarks. In response to a North Korean missile launch violating UN resolutions, the President will direct the US Representative to the UN to push for a resolution condemning the action and imposing sanctions."
