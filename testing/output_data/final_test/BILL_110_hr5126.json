    "content": "The \"Family Security and Small Business Stimulus Act of 2008\" is cited as the short title. It includes a provision for a reduction in individual income tax rates after 2007. The \"Family Security and Small Business Stimulus Act of 2008\" includes a provision for reducing individual income tax rates starting in 2008. The amendment changes the tax rates for different income brackets, with a 5 percent rate for income below a certain amount and a 15 percent rate for income above that amount but below a maximum threshold. The tax amendment reduces the 10-percent rate to 5-percent and makes the 5-percent bracket permanent. Section 6428 is amended for advance payment of the 5-percent rate bracket. The tax amendment accelerates the 5 percent income tax rate bracket benefit for 2008. The tax amendment allows a 5 percent credit against taxable income for eligible individuals in 2008. Eligible individuals exclude estates, trusts, nonresident aliens, and those for whom a deduction under section 151 is allowable to another taxpayer. Section 151 allows a credit for eligible individuals in a taxable year, with coordination with advance refunds of credit. Refunds or credits under subsection (e) reduce the credit, with joint returns splitting the refund or credit between individuals. Each eligible individual for their first taxable year in 2006 is treated as having made a payment against the tax imposed by chapter 1 in an amount equal to the advance refund amount for that year. The advance refund amount is based on what would have been allowed as a credit if certain conditions had applied. The IRS will refund or credit any overpayment promptly, ideally within 30 days, if the credit for a taxable year does not exceed the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus the credits allowable under part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The IRS will refund or credit any overpayment promptly, ideally within 30 days, if the credit for a taxable year does not exceed the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus the credits allowable under part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. No interest shall be allowed on any overpayment attributable to this subsection. The item relating to section 6428 in the table of sections for subchapter B of chapter 65 of such Code is amended. Sec. 6428 accelerates the 5 percent income tax rate bracket benefit for 2008, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2007. Additionally, there is an increase in expensing for small businesses. SEC. 3. INCREASE IN EXPENSING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES: The limit for expensing certain depreciable business assets is permanently increased to $125,000 ($375,000 for taxable years beginning after 2007 and before 2010). This amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2007."
