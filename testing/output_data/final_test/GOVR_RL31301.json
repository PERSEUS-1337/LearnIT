    "content": "The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7, H.J.Res. 2) signed into law on February 20, 2003, includes $74.25 billion in funding for USDA and related agencies, with $17.545 billion for discretionary programs. An additional $3.1 billion is allocated for supplemental disaster assistance for farmers and ranchers affected by natural disasters in 2001 or 2002. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) operates through approximately 30 internal agencies and offices with 100,000 employees, responsible for various activities beyond agriculture. USDA's FY2002 gross outlays were $79.95 billion, including regular and supplemental spending for homeland security post-9/11. In FY2002, USDA spending totaled $79.95 billion, with the largest portion allocated to food and nutrition programs ($37.5 billion) and farm and foreign agricultural services ($22.9 billion). Additionally, $7.0 billion was designated for natural resource and environment programs. In FY2002, USDA spending totaled $79.95 billion, with the largest portion allocated to food and nutrition programs ($37.5 billion) and farm and foreign agricultural services ($22.9 billion). $7.0 billion was designated for natural resource and environment programs, with three-fourths for the Forest Service and the rest for discretionary conservation programs for farm producers. Other USDA spending includes rural development, research and education, marketing and regulatory activities, meat and poultry inspection, and departmental administrative offices. The USDA's annual appropriations mainly cover farm commodity price and income support programs, food stamp and child nutrition programs, federal crop insurance program, and agricultural conservation and trade programs. While these programs have mandatory status, they often receive funds through the annual agriculture appropriations act. Additionally, the Commodity Credit Corporation is reimbursed for losses incurred in financing these programs. The USDA budget is divided into mandatory programs like commodity support and discretionary programs funded through annual appropriations acts. Major discretionary programs include Forest Service, rural development, agricultural credit, nutrition programs, food aid, and inspection programs. Forest Service funding is part of the Interior appropriations act. The USDA budget includes both mandatory and discretionary programs. Mandatory programs have eligibility rules and benefit formulas written into law, while discretionary programs are controlled by annual appropriations acts. Congress generally controls spending on mandatory programs, while discretionary programs are funded through specific dollar amounts approved each year. The USDA budget includes both mandatory and discretionary programs. Discretionary programs are controlled by annual appropriations acts. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees originate bills each year to decide funding for current and new programs. The Bush Administration requested $74.062 billion for FY2003, an increase from the FY2002 enacted appropriation. The Bush Administration requested nearly $500 million in supplemental appropriations for USDA, FDA, and CFTC in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The requested $17.421 billion for discretionary accounts was $1.145 billion above the total FY2002 discretionary appropriation. The 107th Congress adjourned without passing the FY2003 appropriations for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and related agencies. The 108th Congress considered FY2003 appropriations for USDA and related agencies in an omnibus bill. The House completed markups of the agriculture bill, with total appropriations of $74.306 billion in H.R. 5263, including $17.601 billion for discretionary programs. The House bill allocated $1.325 billion higher than FY2002 appropriations, including supplementals. The Senate passed an omnibus appropriations measure for FY2003, including the full-text of outstanding regular bills. Until enacted, USDA spending was governed by continuing resolutions. The Senate Appropriations Committee completed markup on the FY2003 agriculture appropriations bill, providing $74.66 billion in total funding. The bill included $17.98 billion for discretionary programs. The 107th Congress adjourned without finalizing the bill, which was later combined with other appropriations measures in January 2003. In January 2003, Senate appropriators combined the FY2003 agriculture appropriations bill with ten other unresolved appropriations bills into an omnibus package adopted as a substitute amendment to H.J.Res. 2. Funding levels for USDA and related agencies were close to S. 2801, with additional funds for farm assistance and emergency famine relief in Africa. The omnibus appropriations bill was completed on February 13, 2003. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill (H.J.Res. 2) was completed on February 13, 2003, combining 11 appropriations bills from the 107th Congress. The final law included a $3.1 billion disaster assistance package for farmers and ranchers. The budget authority for USDA and related agencies in P.L. 108-7 was $74.25 billion, with $17.55 billion for discretionary programs and $56.70 billion for mandatory programs. The discretionary appropriation was slightly below the House-reported level but above the Administration request. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill (H.J.Res. 2) was completed on February 13, 2003, with a total budget authority of $74.25 billion for USDA and related agencies. The discretionary appropriation was slightly below the Senate-passed level but $124 million above the Administration request. The bill also included $3.1 billion in disaster assistance, offset by a reduction in estimated spending for a mandatory conservation program. The omnibus measure included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission in discretionary programs, except for the WIC program. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill (H.J.Res. 2) allocated $74.25 billion for USDA and related agencies, slightly below the Senate-passed level but above the Administration request. Most spending for USDA's mandatory programs is funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation, which can borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury. This report tracks congressional action on FY2003 agriculture appropriations. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has the authority to borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury to finance ongoing programs such as farm commodity price support and conservation programs. The CCC must repay the borrowed funds but relies on congressional appropriations to cover its losses and maintain its borrowing authority. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) receives an indefinite appropriation to cover its funding needs, allowing it to receive necessary sums during the fiscal year for previous and current year losses. Without this appropriation, the CCC would exhaust its $30 billion borrowing limit. In FY2003, an indefinite appropriation of $16.285 billion was requested, compared to $20.279 billion in FY2002. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) concurs with the request for an indefinite appropriation of $16.285 billion for the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Additionally, a separate supplemental appropriation of $3.1 billion in P.L. 108-7 is allocated for farm disaster assistance, funded through the CCC's borrowing authority. This assistance is provided in response to severe drought conditions affecting agricultural producers in 2001 and 2002. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides $3.1 billion in farm disaster assistance through the Commodity Credit Corporation. The assistance is for crop disaster losses exceeding 35% in 2001 or 2002, regardless of declared disaster areas. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $3.1 billion in farm disaster assistance for crop losses exceeding 35% in either 2001 or 2002. Eligible producers can receive a payment equal to 50% of the commodity price for losses beyond the threshold. Producers who waived insurance will receive 45% of the price. Sugar and tobacco have separate disaster payment programs. Producers must choose between a 2001 or 2002 payment, not both. The total disaster payment, crop insurance, and crop value cannot exceed 95% of the crop's value without losses. Participants must purchase crop insurance for the next two years. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $3.1 billion in farm disaster assistance for crop losses exceeding 35% in either 2001 or 2002. Eligible producers can receive a payment equal to 50% of the commodity price for losses beyond the threshold. Producers who waived insurance will receive 45% of the price. Sugar and tobacco have separate disaster payment programs. Livestock Assistance is also provided with $250 million to compensate for 2001 or 2002 livestock forage or feed losses caused by a natural disaster. The program will be administered similarly to the 1999 Livestock Assistance Program. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $3.1 billion in farm disaster assistance for crop losses exceeding 35% in either 2001 or 2002. Eligible producers can receive payments for losses beyond the threshold. Other assistance includes disaster payments to sugar beet producers, payments to sugarcane producers and processors for hurricane losses, compensation for tobacco producers, and funds for Florida citrus growers affected by citrus canker quarantine. The federal crop insurance program is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offers free catastrophic insurance to producers of insurable crops. Producers can purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate through approved private insurance companies. The program is funded through appropriations for RMA salaries and expenses, as well as the Federal Crop Insurance Fund which covers premium subsidies and indemnity payments. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act allocated $70.708 million for RMA salaries and expenses. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act allocated $70.708 million for RMA salaries and expenses, which is slightly below the House-reported level. The reduction in funding request is due to one-time costs in FY2002 for implementing the Agricultural Risk Protection Act. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act allocated $70.708 million for RMA salaries and expenses, slightly below the House-reported level. The crop insurance program received legislative enhancements in 2000, leading to higher farmer participation. The FY2003 budget request proposed private insurance companies absorb more risk to prevent windfall profits. The FY2003 budget proposed private insurance companies absorb more risk in the crop insurance program to prevent windfall profits. P.L. 108-7 did not address this proposal, and no legislative action has occurred yet. Senate report language directed USDA to follow current procedures before making any risk-sharing changes. The Commodity Credit Corporation funds farm income support and disaster assistance programs, while USDA's Farm Service Agency administers farmer programs. The FSA administers various farm loan programs, conservation programs, and food assistance programs. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $976.7 million for FSA salaries and expenses, with an additional $70 million authorized from the Commodity Credit Corporation for farm disaster assistance costs. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act allocates $976.7 million for FSA salaries and expenses, with an additional $70 million for farm disaster assistance costs. The requested FY2003 appropriation of $993.6 million for FSA salaries and expenses reflects increased pay costs and lack of carryover funds from FY2002, without accounting for new activities from the 2002 farm bill. The recently enacted 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171) provides $50 million in new mandatory funding for FSA salaries and expenses to administer new programs. FSA serves as a lender of last resort for family farmers through farm loan programs, offering direct loans and guarantees for repayment. Loans are used for real estate purchases, operating expenses, and disaster recovery, some at subsidized interest rates. The omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides $228.3 million to subsidize the cost of total direct and guaranteed farm loans of $3.937 billion for FY2003. This funding allows FSA to make available nearly twice the level of direct operating loans compared to FY2002. In FY2003, FSA farm loan levels were higher due to supplemental funding provided in response to low farm commodity prices. USDA's agricultural trade and food aid activities are funded through appropriations and CCC borrowing authority. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act mainly deals with programs requiring appropriations. In FY2003, USDA's international activities received a program level of about $6.1 billion, up from $5.5 billion in FY2002. This increase was due to higher spending on food aid and Congress's rejection of food aid reforms proposed by the Administration. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) administers these programs, including P.L. 480 Food for Peace. In FY2003, USDA's international activities received a program level of about $6.1 billion, up from $5.5 billion in FY2002, with higher spending on food aid. P.L. 480 Food for Peace is shared between USDA and USAID, with USDA responsible for Title I providing loans to developing countries and USAID for commodity donations and bilateral food grants. P.L. 108-7 provides $129.9 million for FAS salaries and expenses, and $1.477 billion for USDA's international activities, including $1.343 billion for P.L. 480 food aid. In FY2003, USDA's international activities received $1.477 billion for various programs, including humanitarian commodity donations under P.L. 480 Title II. An additional $250 million was allocated for emergency relief activities. The total appropriation for international programs increased by $344 million compared to FY2002, with a focus on humanitarian food donations in response to urgent food needs in Sub-Saharan Africa and North. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act increased food aid appropriations in response to global food needs and the Administration's decision to phase out aid based on commodity surpluses. Proposed reductions in Section 416(b) are part of the Administration's review recommending all aid programs run through USAID instead of USDA. In FY2003, the Administration proposed increasing P.L. 480 Title II commodity donations to offset the phase-out of Section 416(b) donations. The budget excluded CCC funding for Food for Progress, limiting FFP activities to government-to-government programs. The 2002 farm bill complicated the phase-out of CCC-funded food aid programs, and P.L. 108-7 amended the FFP statute to require a minimum volume of 400,000 metric tons. P.L. 108-7 amended the FFP statute to require a minimum volume of 400,000 metric tons of commodities, including CCC funding. The President's FY2003 estimates for international programs now include $158 million of CCC funding for FFP. The use of commodity surpluses for U.S. food aid has been criticized by the European Union and other countries for circumventing WTO export subsidy reduction commitments. The issue of food aid and international agricultural trading rules is being pursued by U.S. trading partners in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations. The President's budget assumes $118 million for programming under Section 416(b) in FY2003, mainly surplus nonfat dry milk. In contrast, $175 million was funded in FY2002 and $948 million in FY2001. Many USDA international programs are funded through CCC borrowing authority, with the largest component being $4.225 billion of CCC export credit guarantees. The U.S. export credit programs, supported by an estimated $4.225 billion of CCC export credit guarantees, have been a point of contention in WTO agricultural trade negotiations. The EU and other trading partners argue that the program gives the U.S. an unfair competitive advantage in exporting certain agricultural commodities. Negotiations on export credit programs in the OECD have not been successful and were suspended. Any changes in the U.S. program will depend on market conditions and demands for credit. The U.S. export credit programs, supported by $4.225 billion of CCC export credit guarantees, have been a point of contention in WTO agricultural trade negotiations. Negotiations in the OECD were unsuccessful and suspended. Changes in the U.S. program would need to overcome strong congressional support. CCC-funded programs assist trade organizations in developing overseas markets for U.S. agricultural products. Authorized spending for MAP is $110 million and for FMDP is $34 million. EEP spending is limited to $28 million, resulting in savings of $450 million from the authorized level in the farm bill. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has scored no savings for proposed cuts to EEP funding due to negligible actual spending. The Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) is budgeted at $57 million, reflecting the maximum allowed under trade agreements. The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program (IFED) was established in the 2002 farm bill with $100 million allocated for FY2002 and \"such sums as necessary\" for subsequent years. The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program (IFED) began as a pilot project during the Clinton Administration, funded by $300 million in CCC funds and commodities. $100 million of CCC funds would be expended on IFED in FY2003. The natural resources and environment mission area within USDA is implemented through NRCS, FSA, and the Forest Service. Conservation spending combines discretionary spending, totaling just over $1 billion. Conservation spending includes discretionary spending of over $1 billion in the FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) and mandatory funding of almost $3.0 billion from the Commodity Credit Corporation. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171) authorizes $1 billion in new mandatory conservation spending, with overall funding expected to increase by 80% through FY2007. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides $1.028 billion for discretionary conservation programs within USDA, which is lower than the Administration's request. The largest program, Conservation Operations (CO), receives $825 million for technical assistance. This funding is a decrease from the previous year's appropriation. P.L. 108-7 provides $825 million for Conservation Operations (CO) in FY2003, less than the Administration's request of $841 million. The increase from the previous year is significant, with $48 million allocated for technical assistance in animal feeding operations to comply with clean water regulations. The law includes 114 earmarks for CO totaling over $110 million, some of which are new while others were specified in previous appropriations bills. Earmarks in bills from both chambers total about $90 million for specific projects or sites. The law P.L. 108-7 includes 83 earmarks totaling about $90 million, with the largest earmark of $21.5 million for the grazing lands conservation initiative. It also allocates funds for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, Watershed Surveys and Planning, and Watershed Rehabilitation Program. The Administration did not request any appropriation for these programs in FY2003. The Administration did not request funding for watershed programs in FY2003. Instead, they proposed consolidating three accounts into a $110 million Emergency Watershed Protection fund for immediate disaster assistance. The House recommended funding for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations and Watershed Surveys and Planning, while the Senate recommended funding for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations. The Senate recommended $105 million for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, $11.0 million for Watershed Surveys and Planning, and $30 million for Watershed Rehabilitation in P.L. 108-7. The bill includes provisions limiting spending for technical assistance and protecting threatened species. No funds were provided for the Emergency Conservation Program, despite Congress rejecting the Administration's proposal for a new funding approach based on past spending levels. The P.L.108-7 provides $51 million for the Resource Conservation and Development Program, exceeding the Administration's request. However, it does not allocate any funding for the Forestry Incentive Program. Technical assistance funding for mandatory programs remains limited under a cap set by the Commodity Credit Corporation charter. The Administration's proposal to address technical assistance funding for mandatory conservation programs in FY2003 was strongly rejected by Congress. The disaster assistance package in P.L. 108-7 specifically prohibits the use of discretionary funds for mandatory conservation programs. The Administration's FY2003 request did not include reauthorizations or increases for many conservation programs, except for maintaining $200 million for EQIP. Most mandatory conservation programs had reached their authorized limits or were unfunded. Agricultural disaster assistance in P.L. 108-7 is offset by limiting spending on the new Conservation Security program. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) in P.L. 108-7 is limited in funding, offsetting agricultural disaster assistance. The program aims to pay farmers for conservation practices on productive land, with a total funding limit of $3.773 billion over ten years. Additionally, other provisions in P.L. 108-7 restrict funding for certain conservation programs, such as the Wetlands Reserve Program. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act reduces funding for various conservation programs, including the Wetlands Reserve Program and the EQIP. It also prohibits the use of $45 million for the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program but provides $30 million in discretionary funding for it. The act does not address the Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers to retire environmentally sensitive land. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act allocates $2.506 billion for USDA's conservation programs, with increases in funding for programs like the Wetlands Reserve Program and EQIP as outlined in the 2002 farm bill. For more information on USDA conservation issues, refer to CRS Issue Brief IB96030 and for details on the farm bill conservation provisions, see CRS Report RL31486(pdf). The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $2.506 billion for USDA's research, education, and economics agencies, slightly higher than the Senate-passed bill and significantly more than the House-reported bill. The funding is $61 million above the FY2002 enacted level and supports agencies like the Agricultural Research Service, Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, and Economic Research Service. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $1.172 billion for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), with $1.053 billion supporting research programs and $119.5 million for modernizing facilities. This represents a $73 million increase for research programs from FY2002. Overall, ARS will receive $64 million less in FY2003 compared to FY2002 when including supplemental funding. P.L. 108-7 provides level funding for ARS research and an increase in funds for facilities construction. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $1.172 billion for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), with $1.053 billion for research programs and $119.5 million for facilities construction. The Senate and House measures allocated $95 million and $101 million for construction, respectively. The conference report supports all ARS research projects recommended by the Administration and blocks funds for a review of research quality. The National Academy of Sciences conducted a study on the impact of publicly funded research on U.S. agriculture instead of the requested review. The 2002 farm bill reauthorized the ARS study, while the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Response Act of 2002 authorized additional appropriations for bioterrorism-related research facilities. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act did not contain any appropriations for bioterrorism prevention research. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act allocated $1.125 billion for research and extension programs at land grant colleges of agriculture, a $97 million increase from FY2002. The funding is mainly for research and education programs ($79 million) and extension programs ($14 million), with a slight decrease in integrated research and extension programs. The legislation also provided funding for core research and extension programs at 1862 land grant institutions and forestry research. The final FY2003 spending act allocated $35.6 million for research at 1890 land grant colleges, $32.1 million for extension at 1890 colleges, and $453.5 million for extension at 1862 institutions. Special Research grants received $112.3 million, higher than the Administration's recommendation of $3.3 million. Additionally, $30 million was provided for earmarked grants under the \"Federal Administration\" portion of the CSREES budget. The FY2003 budget allocated $167.1 million for the National Research Initiative Competitive Research Grants program, surpassing the Senate and House proposals. The conference report also blocked the expenditure of $120 million in mandatory funds for the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-188) authorizes security improvements at land grant college facilities and on-farm biosecurity education programs. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act did not allocate any funds under this authority. P.L. 108-7 provided $69.1 million for the Economic Research Service (ERS) and $139.4 million for the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), slightly below the Senate-passed amount. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) allocated $139.4 million for the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), slightly below the Senate-passed amount of $140.9 million. The act also provided $759.8 million for the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), higher than the House-reported level, fully funding the President's budget request. In FY2003, FSIS received $730.6 million with an additional $101 million in user fees. P.L.108-7 allocated $5 million for FSIS to hire 50 personnel for enforcing the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. The Senate's call for stricter monitoring of foreign meat and poultry exporters was not included. USDA's marketing and regulatory programs aim to expand domestic and international marketing of U.S. agricultural products and protect animal and plant health. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides $868.1 million for USDA's marketing and regulatory agencies, slightly below the House-reported and Senate-passed amounts. The largest appropriation goes to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) for protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) allocates $735.5 million for APHIS, a decrease from FY2002. The requested amount was $775.3 million, but the final amount approved was lower. The Senate proposal for increased funding for border inspections was not included in the final appropriation. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) allocates $735.5 million for APHIS, a decrease from FY2002. The appropriation has been used for purchasing new equipment and training inspectors, with user fees funding the inspection service. The inspection function, equipment, Beagle Brigade, and employees have been transferred to the Department of Homeland Security. USDA retains control of user fees collected and will repay DHS for border inspection costs. Approximately $275 million in user fees is expected in FY2003, with appropriations for equipment, dogs, and training under the new Department's budget authority starting in FY2004. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) allocates funds for APHIS activities, including increases for animal health monitoring, surveillance against biological attacks, managing plant pests, Johne's disease, and Wildlife Services programs. It also provides funding for chronic wasting disease management and expanding laboratory testing capacity. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) provides funding for commercial labs with rapid testing capabilities. The House proposal to require joint budget requests for a CWD program was not adopted. Additional funds for CWD research were not included. The Agricultural Marketing Service receives $92.0 million for promoting U.S. agricultural products. $15.8 million is allocated for the pesticide data program. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides funding for various programs, including the Agricultural Marketing Service's Section 32 program. This program allocates funds for farm sector support through various activities, with most of the money going towards child nutrition programs and fisheries activities. The remaining funds cover farm commodity purchases, administrative expenses, and other obligations. The Department faced concerns about adequate funds for various activities, including emergency commodity purchases, after allocating $937 million for a livestock disaster assistance program in FY2003. Adjustments in USDA spending accounts were made to cover both the disaster program and traditional Section 32 activities. Additionally, a provision in the omnibus appropriations act required a $250 million transfer from the CCC to Section 32 for emergency surplus removal of agricultural commodities. Section 32 allows for emergency surplus removal of agricultural commodities. A provision in the agriculture appropriations section prohibits reprogramming funds without notifying the Appropriations Committees. GIPSA oversees standards, inspection, and grading for grain and commodities, as well as fair-trading practices. P.L. 108-7 provides $39.95 million for GIPSA activities. The Agriculture Appropriations Act P.L. 108-7 allocates $39.95 million for GIPSA activities in FY2003, lower than the proposed amounts. The Administration had requested $12.2 million, down from $33 million in FY2002, and had proposed new user fees to cover the shortfall, which were not included in the final law. The Act also includes a directive for a 2-year study on packer ownership of livestock. The mission of rural development agencies is to enhance rural communities by providing financial and technical resources in areas of greatest need. Three agencies, established by the Agricultural Reorganization Act of 1994, are responsible for this mission area: the Rural Housing Service, the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and the Rural Utilities Service. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations act provides $2.795 billion for rural economic and community development programs. The House-reported measure for rural development includes a budget request of $2.587 billion, supporting a loan authorization level of $12 billion. The Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP) consolidates funding for 12 rural development programs. The House proposed a loan authorization level of $9.677 billion, while the Senate proposed $9.857 billion. The Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP) under P.L. 108-7 provides $907.7 million in budget authority for three accounts, with varying funding levels for Community Facilities, Rural Utilities, and Rural Business Development accounts. The RCAP authorization under P.L. 108-7 provides funding for water and waste disposal grants in the Rural Utilities account, including earmarks for technical assistance grants. Funding is allocated for various programs, including those in Alaskan native villages, Federally Recognized Native American Tribes, the Delta Regional Authority, and colonias along the U.S.-Mexican border. The House proposal differs slightly from the Senate measure in terms of funding allocations. Funding for colonias is $5 million more than proposed by the Senate and the same as proposed by the House. P.L. 108-7 includes $30 million for grants to rural communities with high-energy costs and $25 million for facilities in rural communities with extreme unemployment. Additionally, $7 million is designated for the Rural Community Development Initiative, with $1 million for a demonstration program for Rural Cooperative Home Based Health Care. $37.6 million is allocated for Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities and Rural Economic Area Partnerships Zones. The Administration's budget did not request direct EZ/EC funding, and the Senate measure did not designate funding to the program. P.L.108-7 provides $305.5 million for the Rural Housing Insurance Fund Program account, supporting a total rural housing loan authorization level of $5.8 billion. This includes funding for various housing loan programs such as Section 502 loans, housing repair loans, site loans, credit sales of acquired land, and self-help housing and land development loans. P.L.108-7 concurs with the Senate's proposed funding levels for various housing loan programs, including $100 million for Section 538 multi-family loan guarantees and $4.5 million in loan subsidies. It provides $202 million in direct loan subsidies for Section 502 single family housing, $115 million in loan authorization for Section 515 housing, and $54 million for other housing programs. The Senate proposed $120 million for Section 515 rental housing in P.L. 108-7, which also includes $54 million in direct loan subsidies for Section 515 rental housing. The bill allows loans for new construction of Section 515 housing, despite the Administration's request against it. Additionally, P.L. 108-7 prioritizes long-term rehabilitation needs in multi-family housing and encourages cost comparisons with other federal programs. $10.8 million is allocated for Section 504 housing repairs, and $726 million for Section 521 rental assistance. P.L. 108-7 provides $726 million for Farm Labor Program grants and direct loans, $36.3 million for rural housing assistance grants, $35 million for mutual and self-help housing grants, and $12.5 million for Rural Electrification and Telecommunications Loan Program subsidies. Additionally, $11.6 million in rural housing loans is earmarked for empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and REAP Zones until June 2003. The Agreement in P.L. 108-7 includes a loan authorization level of $5.6 billion, $2.4 billion more than requested. It also includes $1 billion for guaranteed credit payments under the Rural Electrification Act. For the Rural Telephone Bank, the loan level is $174.6 million.
