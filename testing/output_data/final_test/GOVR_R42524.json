    "content": "Broadband deployment is crucial for regional economic development and job creation, especially in rural America where infrastructure costs are high and population densities are low. The federal government has historically supported rural telecommunications providers to improve broadband access, with an estimated $24 billion needed for further investment. Two federal programs currently fund broadband in rural areas. Two federal programs, the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and the Universal Service Fund (USF), direct money to fund broadband in rural areas. The 113th Congress may assess how to shape the evolution of these programs, with potential amendments to the RUS broadband loan program and significant reforms to the USF. Congress is overseeing these reforms in the current climate of budget deficit reduction. In the current climate of budget deficit reduction, Congress is evaluating federal investments in broadband to efficiently deploy it in rural America. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) offers various telecommunications and broadband programs, including loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations. Some programs focus on broadband infrastructure deployment, while others have evolved to support broadband-capable services. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) offers telecommunications and broadband programs to support rural areas. Issues and criticisms arise during congressional consideration of these programs. The goal is to assist rural communities in becoming self-sustaining and economically thriving. Despite efforts, broadband access in rural areas remains inadequate compared to urban areas. Broadband deployment in rural areas is lower due to lower population density compared to suburban and urban areas. The cost to serve customers in rural areas is higher, leading to less incentive for companies to invest in broadband. The definition of \"rural\" for eligibility of RUS broadband grants or loans is not standardized. The definition of \"rural\" for eligibility of RUS broadband grants or loans varies among programs, creating controversy. In the first round of BIP awards, a separate category for \"remote areas\" was defined as unserved rural areas at least 50 miles from non-rural areas, but was eliminated in the second round due to criticism. The remote area category was eliminated in the second round of RUS broadband grants due to criticism from Members of Congress. The definition of \"rural\" has sparked controversy in the Rural Broadband Loan program, with Congress changing the eligibility criteria three times. Defining rural communities for broadband assistance is a challenging issue for policymakers. The 2013 farm bill addressed the issue of defining \"rural area\" for USDA rural development programs, including the broadband program. The Senate bill proposed a uniform definition of \"rural area\" as any area with a population under 50,000 that is not an urbanized area adjacent to a city with a population over 50,000. This change aimed to expand eligibility for financial assistance beyond traditional rural and underserved communities. The current definition of a rural area eligible for broadband loans is towns with populations under 20,000. This new definition aims to increase the number of larger communities eligible for broadband assistance. Concerns have been raised about federal funding going to areas with existing broadband providers, especially in rural and sparsely populated areas where providers have less financial incentive to build networks. Urban and suburban areas typically have more existing broadband providers. The controversy surrounding broadband awards in areas with preexisting service has raised concerns about subsidizing competitors and diverting assistance from unserved areas in need. While competition among broadband providers in suburban and urban areas can drive down prices and improve services, the federal government's support for projects in areas with existing broadband service may hinder progress in underserved regions. The debate over broadband awards in areas with existing service has sparked concerns about subsidizing competitors and diverting assistance from underserved regions. Some argue that rural areas should benefit from competition to lower prices and improve service, which may require federal financial aid. Existing provider restrictions were addressed during the 2012 farm bill discussions, with organizations in the cable industry advocating for stronger limitations. The cable industry argues for stronger restrictions on existing providers to focus the loan program on unserved areas. Rural telecommunications providers oppose changes, citing limited opportunities under current rules. Proposed changes in the 2013 farm bill and debates in the House suggest modifications to the rural broadband loan program. The ARRA broadband stimulus program is no longer in effect. The ARRA broadband stimulus program, no longer active, provided grants, loans, and grant/loan combinations. The Rural Broadband Access Loan Program offers loans, not grants. Loans are preferred by federal budget perspective as they are paid back with interest and have smaller appropriations. For example, the Rural Broadband Access Loan Program had a loan subsidy of $6 million in FY2013, supporting a loan level of $64 million. The Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan program, funded at $690 million, typically requires no loan subsidy. The Rural Broadband Access Loan Program, funded at $690 million, typically requires no loan subsidy. The debate over loans versus grants in the farm bill and the reauthorization of the program has led to discussions on adding a new grant program and increasing the authorization level. The Senate bill does not specify the proportion of grants to loans, which is of interest to the Appropriations Committees aiming to reduce federal discretionary spending. The FCC has approved lower levels for the RUS broadband loan program than the authorization level. Since 1934, the FCC has aimed to provide a nationwide wire and radio communications service at reasonable charges, leading to the universal service concept. This concept ensures telecommunications services are available to all Americans, including those in rural areas, through cross subsidies. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 established a universal service fund to ensure access to advanced telecommunications services nationwide. This replaced the complex system of cross subsidies that supported universal service goals before the breakup of the Bell System. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 established a universal service fund to ensure access to telecommunications and information services nationwide, including for low-income consumers, rural areas, and schools at discounted rates. The policy debates in the last decade focused on incorporating broadband access into universal service objectives. Concerns arose about gaps in access, especially in rural areas. Policymakers believed the Universal Service Fund (USF) should help bridge this availability gap, despite its original design not directly supporting broadband. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 called for the FCC to develop a national broadband plan to ensure universal access to broadband capability. The National Broadband Plan, Connecting America, submitted to Congress in 2010, called for the Universal Service Fund (USF) to play a major role in ensuring broadband access for all Americans. The USF, established in 1997, is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) under the FCC's direction, providing subsidies for voice telecommunications services to high-cost carriers and economically needy individuals. The Universal Service Fund (USF) supports access to telecommunications services and broadband for various programs such as schools, libraries, and rural healthcare providers. In 2012, $8.7 billion was disbursed to all states and territories. The FCC has ordered the transformation of USF to focus on broadband deployment and adoption, phasing out the High Cost Program and introducing the Connect America Fund (CAF) with targeted Mobility and Remote Areas Funds. The Universal Service Fund (USF) is being transformed to focus on broadband deployment and adoption. The High Cost Program will be phased out and replaced by the Connect America Fund (CAF), which includes targeted Mobility and Remote Areas Funds. The goal is to transition the High Cost Program to support a broadband platform for multiple services in rural areas with higher costs. The High Cost Program is being phased out and replaced by the Connect America Fund (CAF) to support high-capacity broadband networks. The new fund includes the Mobility Fund and Remote Areas Fund, with a budget frozen at $4.5 billion. The Connect America Fund (CAF) has a budget frozen at $4.5 billion per year for 2012-2017 to support affordable voice and broadband services. It will replace existing support mechanisms in the High Cost Program for eligible carriers, with different transition paths for price cap and rate-of-return carriers. Price cap carriers will transition in two phases, starting on January 1. Phase I of the Connect America Fund (CAF) began on January 1, 2012, freezing legacy high-cost funding at 2011 levels (up to $1.8 billion annually) for price cap carriers. This frozen support is to be used for universal availability of voice and broadband services. An additional $300 million in incremental support is allocated for broadband deployment in unserved areas. Price cap carriers can access this support by deploying fixed broadband in underserved areas within their service territory, subject to specific criteria and build-out requirements. Phase I incremental support is available for price-cap carriers to deploy broadband in unserved areas, with specific speed requirements. Carriers must meet deployment schedules and complete all deployments within three years. $115 million of the $300 million available has been claimed, with $185 million remaining unclaimed. A second round of support will be offered in 2013, with rules detailed by the FCC in May of that year. The FCC announced a second round of Phase I incremental support, with $485 million available for underserved and unserved areas. Support amounts are set at $775 per location for unserved areas and $550 per location for underserved areas. This round is expected to be the last before transitioning to Phase II Price Cap annual support. Unused funds will be allocated to the Phase II Fund for distribution through competitive bidding. The FCC announced a second round of Phase I incremental support, with $485 million available for underserved and unserved areas. Carriers accepting support must offer broadband speeds of at least 4 Mbps download speed and 1 Mbps upload speed by the end of the third year. Incumbent carriers have the right of first refusal for model-derived support until the end of 2017, after which competitive bidding will be implemented. Rate-of-return carriers in rural areas will continue to receive support. Rate-of-return carriers in rural areas will continue to receive support, with some modifications, from current mechanisms pending full transition to the CAF through 2017. Legacy high-cost support is frozen at 2011 levels, with no additional incremental support specifically for broadband deployment in unserved areas. The High Cost Program is modified to improve efficiency and effectiveness of USF support, phasing out support in areas with unsubsidized broadband competitors and gradually reducing per-line support over three years. Rate-of-return carriers transitioning to CAF support will have flexibility in deploying broadband, offering 4 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload speeds upon customer request. They are not currently required to meet specific build-out or speed requirements, and will not necessarily serve the most expensive locations in their service territories. The transition of rate-of-return carriers to the CAF is still being determined, with details pending the completion of a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The CAF Mobility Fund provides funding for wireless providers to deploy 4G networks in unserved areas. Phase I awarded $300 million through a reverse auction, resulting in new deployment in 31 states and one territory. Winners must deploy 4G service within three years. The FCC is authorizing winning applications for the CAF Mobility Fund Phase I, which awarded $300 million for 4G network deployment in unserved areas. Winners must deploy 4G service within three years. A separate Tribal Mobility Fund Phase I will award up to $50 million for mobile voice and broadband in tribal areas lacking 3G service. Phase II of the Mobility Fund will provide ongoing support of up to $500 million per year for expanding mobile services, with $100 million annually set aside for Tribal Lands. The FCC is creating a new CAF Remote Areas Fund with a budget of at least $100 million per year to support high-cost areas. The fund will be open to all technologies, with satellite and unlicensed wireless services expected to participate. The FCC is seeking further comment on the implementation of the fund, with operations anticipated to begin in 2014. The FCC eliminated a rule in 2012 that provided high-cost support to wireless carriers, as new support mechanisms were put in place to target unserved areas more effectively. Carriers receiving support had funding levels frozen for six months. The FCC phased out high-cost support for wireless carriers in 2012, with funding levels frozen for six months and then phased out over a five-year period. The phase-out will stop if the Mobility Fund Phase II is not operational by June 30, 2014. A waiver process is established for carriers at risk of losing voice service. The FCC is considering the risk of losing access to broadband-capable networks in areas without alternative providers. Detailed financial and market data will be reviewed for waiver requests, with priority given to providers in Tribal Lands and insular areas. Universal service policies were expanded in the 1980s to target low-income subscribers through programs like Lifeline and Link Up. The Lifeline and Link Up programs were established in the 1980s to assist economically needy individuals with telephone service costs. The programs target low-income subscribers, with Lifeline helping with monthly service charges and Link Up aiding with initiation costs. The expansion of the Universal Service Fund (USF) to target low-income individuals, especially in rural areas with higher poverty rates, is significant. Financial reasons are a common barrier to broadband adoption, with 36% of non-adopters citing this as the main reason for not having broadband service at home. The FCC modified the Low Income Program to increase broadband adoption for low-income households by expanding the Lifeline Program and establishing a $9.25 monthly reimbursement rate. Safeguards were also put in place to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. The Lifeline Program was modernized to support bundled service plans combining voice and broadband, with a Broadband Adoption Pilot Program to increase broadband adoption among eligible subscribers. The FCC selected 14 projects for the Lifeline pilot program, covering rural, suburban, and urban areas in 21 states and Puerto Rico. Approximately $13.8 million in funding was authorized for the 18-month program starting on February 1, 2013. Universal service provisions in the 1996 act designate schools and libraries as beneficiaries of discounts, ensuring access to advanced telecommunications services. The FCC established the Schools and Libraries Division within the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) to administer the E-Rate program, providing discounts on services for education purposes to schools and libraries. The program supports connectivity through funding for telecommunications, internal connections, Internet access, and basic maintenance. Applicants are responsible for additional resources like end-user equipment and training. The E-Rate program, effective since January 1, 1998, offers discounts of 20% to 90% on services for eligible schools and libraries based on poverty levels and location. The FCC set a yearly cap of $2.25 billion for the program, adjusted for inflation. Anchor institutions like schools and libraries play a crucial role in providing broadband access to areas lacking connectivity. The FCC has upgraded the E-Rate Program to support broadband access goals, including allowing community use of E-Rate funded services outside of school hours and providing off-campus connectivity for K-12 students and library patrons. Additionally, Section 254(h) of the 1996 act ensures rural health care providers have access to necessary telecommunications services at comparable rates to urban areas. The FCC established the Rural Health Care Division (RHCD) within the USAC to administer the universal support program for health care providers in rural areas. Only public or non-profit providers are eligible for funding, with a $400 million annual cap for reduced rates on telecommunications and information services. The FCC established the Rural Health Care Division (RHCD) within the USAC to administer the universal support program for health care providers in rural areas. This program provides funding for information services necessary for health care provision to qualified individual health care providers or consortia. The telecommunications program ensures rural providers pay no more than urban counterparts for their telecommunications needs, while the Internet access program offers discounts on monthly Internet access. These programs are collectively known as the \"Primary Program.\" The FCC established the Rural Health Care Pilot Program in 2007 to help public and non-profit health care providers build broadband networks for telehealth services. The Pilot Program funds up to 85% of eligible costs for infrastructure deployment connecting rural and urban providers. It is now closed to new projects, with participants transitioning to the Healthcare Connect Fund created in 2012. This Fund aims to expand broadband access, particularly in rural areas, for eligible health care providers, absorbing the Internet Access Program and replacing the Pilot Program with a permanent one. The Healthcare Connect Fund replaces the Rural Health Care Pilot Program with a permanent program. It encourages consortia between rural and urban health care providers, offering a 65% discount on broadband services. The upfront payment for the Fund is $150 million annually, with applications expected to open in late summer 2013. Additionally, a Skilled Nursing Facilities Pilot Program will support broadband connections for rural facilities, with up to $50 million in funding over three years. The FCC decision to incorporate broadband and mobility mandates into the universal service concept will impact consumers and providers of telecommunications and broadband services. Policy issues include defining success, funding support, addressing rural disparities, and ensuring financial stability for small rural carriers dependent on USF subsidies. The USF reform aims to ensure universal availability of advanced broadband at comparable rates nationwide. The availability of advanced broadband at comparable rates nationwide is a major undertaking. Determining the success of this goal depends on how success is defined. While the universal service mandate for voice service is considered met, the US has not reached 100% penetration. As of July 2011, the telephone subscribership penetration rate was 95.6%, varying based on location, age, and income. The broadband deployment rates vary based on income categories, with households below $20,000 at 94.7% and those over $75,000 at 98.9%. The FCC's NBP reports that broadband is available in 95% of the nation, but adoption rates are only at 65% due to cost, digital literacy barriers, and perceived lack of relevance. The USF Order aims to address these issues, but details are still being resolved. Policymakers should also monitor performance metrics like speed, capacity, and latency. The USF Order requires telecommunications carriers to provide universal service support funded by mandatory contributions. Policymakers need to assess evolving standards for broadband access in terms of performance metrics like speed, capacity, and latency. The contribution factor for interstate and international telecommunications carriers has increased significantly over the years, reaching an all-time high of 17.9% in 2012. The growth is attributed to increased demand for USF services, technological changes, and a decrease in revenue base. The FCC's inclusion of broadband and mobility in the universal service definition has raised questions about modifying the funding mechanism to support this mandate. The FCC is considering comprehensive reforms to address the strained funding mechanism for nationwide broadband deployment as a universal service policy goal. Concerns have been raised about the contribution factor and the need for restructuring the funding mechanism. Rural America faces a \"rural-rural divide\" in broadband infrastructure access. The FCC is addressing the rural-rural divide in broadband access in rural America. Price-cap carriers serve areas with limited broadband access, while rate-of-return carriers deploy broadband with support from RUS loans and USF. The FCC established a $300 million support component in the Phase I CAF Fund to bridge the access gap. The FCC established a $300 million incremental support component in the Phase I CAF Fund for areas lacking broadband infrastructure, solely for price-cap carriers. Concern has been raised about the funding being limited to price-cap carriers, disadvantaging rural areas served by smaller rate-of-return carriers. Critics question why access to funding should be based on carrier classification rather than need, especially when $185 million of the total went unclaimed in 2012. Many rural rate-of-return carriers rely on USF subsidies, which could be impacted by upcoming reforms. RUS borrowers heavily depend on high-cost USF support, with the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan program relying on it for viability. The program mainly serves rural areas with populations under 5,000. Additionally, BIP and farm bill borrowers also utilize USF support mechanisms for broadband projects. Borrowers from RUS broadband programs and the FCC's USF share a common goal of increasing broadband infrastructure in rural areas, but their approaches differ. Potential USF reforms could impact the viability of RUS telecommunications and broadband loans, affecting carriers' financial health. Smaller carriers find the waiver process for economic stress due to reforms burdensome and restrictive. The RUS grants and loans invest in broadband infrastructure upfront, while the USF provides ongoing subsidies for telecommunications and broadband networks in high-cost areas. RUS programs focus on broadband infrastructure deployment in rural America, while the USF addresses broadband availability and end-user adoption. The RUS programs focus on investing in broadband infrastructure upfront, while the USF programs provide ongoing subsidies for telecommunications and broadband networks in high-cost areas. The principal difference between RUS programs and USF programs is that RUS funds end-user equipment, while USF funds connectivity. DLT grants serve as initial capital assets for equipment, instructional programming, technical assistance, or instruction for using eligible equipment that operate via telecommunications to rural end-users of telemedicine and distance learning. By contrast, the USF Schools and Libraries Program supports the conduit or pipeline for communications using telecommunications services and/or the Internet. The Rural Health Care Program and RUS programs provide discounts and funding for rural non-profit health care providers and broadband infrastructure. Congress aims to leverage federal programs like RUS and USF to achieve universal broadband service by 2020. The RUS and USF programs are the main federal sources of financial assistance for rural broadband deployment. The 113th Congress is addressing the modification of the Rural Broadband Loan and Loan Guarantee program, as outlined in the 2008 and 2013 farm bills. The House and Senate Committees on Agriculture play a key role in developing new farm bills every five years. The Appropriations Committees also contribute by considering annual appropriations for RUS broadband programs. The USF is undergoing significant reforms to achieve universal broadband service by 2020. The FCC is undergoing major reforms with oversight from Congress. Various committees are assessing the impact and progress of these reforms. Different interest groups may feel disadvantaged by the changes. The FCC is undergoing major reforms overseen by Congress, with various committees assessing the impact. Some interest groups may feel disadvantaged by the changes. Congress has the prerogative to modify reforms through legislation, such as amending the 1934 Communications Act. They may also need to evaluate how the RUS and USF broadband programs align in deploying broadband to rural areas, ensuring they target unserved areas effectively and minimize impacts on private providers. Congress should consider the cost-effectiveness and complementarity of these programs, as well as how changes to the USF program will affect broadband loans' viability. Changes to the USF program may impact the viability of broadband loans under the RUS programs."
