    "content": "Federal contracts will now require compliance with state workmen's compensation laws under the amended Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. This new section, SEC. 303H, emphasizes the importance of adhering to state workmen's compensation laws. Each federal contract must guarantee compliance with state workmen's compensation laws. Failure to comply may result in termination of work in the respective state. Failure to comply with state workmen's compensation laws may lead to termination of work in that state. The offending contractor or subcontractor must demonstrate compliance within a reasonable time, or the Government may complete the work and hold the contractor liable for any excess costs incurred. This section does not apply to contracts covered by the Defense Base Act or the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. In the event of a national emergency, this section may be suspended. In a national emergency, the President may suspend the operation of this section of the Act. The President has the authority to suspend the operation of the Act in a national emergency. Section 2332 requires compliance with State workmen's compensation laws for contracts made by agency heads, with termination of work if non-compliance is found. If a contractor or subcontractor is found to be non-compliant with workmen's compensation laws in a State where work is being carried out, the agency head can terminate their right to continue the work. If compliance is not demonstrated within a reasonable time, the agency head may complete the work, and the contractor and sureties will be liable for any excess costs. The contractor is liable for excess costs incurred by the Government due to termination, except for contracts under the Defense Base Act. The President can suspend this section in a national emergency. The amendments made by this section require compliance with State workmen's compensation laws for Federal contracts entered into after the enactment of this Act."
