The National Bone Marrow Registry Reauthorization Act of 1998 amends the Public Health Service Act to establish a registry with the purpose of increasing the number of transplants for recipients matched to unrelated donors of bone marrow. The registry will be under the direction of a board of directors meeting specific requirements. The board of directors for the National Bone Marrow Registry includes representatives from various centers, transplant recipients, individuals requiring transplants, family members, social science experts, and other members. Members can continue to serve after their term expires until a successor is appointed, and the board is structured so that approximately one-third of members' terms expire each year to ensure continuity. The National Bone Marrow Registry's board of directors includes representatives from different centers, transplant recipients, individuals in need of transplants, family members, social science experts, and other members. The board structure allows members to serve beyond their term until a successor is appointed, with approximately one-third of terms expiring each year for continuity. The program for Unrelated Marrow Transplants involves recruiting bone marrow donors, increasing representation of minority groups in the Registry, and conducting informational and educational activities. The National Bone Marrow Registry conducts informational and educational activities, updates information annually on potential donors, provides patient advocacy, offers case management services for potential donors matched to patients, and conducts surveys to improve services. The National Bone Marrow Registry aims to improve services by collecting and analyzing data on donor searches, patient outcomes, and transplant center costs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to report on the relationship between the registry and donor centers within a year of the Act's enactment. The National Bone Marrow Donor Registry is tasked with developing a plan to improve efficiencies in its relationship with donor centers, incorporating recommendations from a previous inspection. Additionally, amendments are made to the Public Health Service Act regarding recruitment, priorities, and information and education. The National Bone Marrow Donor Registry is implementing a recruitment program to increase representation of underrepresented populations in order to improve the chances of finding suitable donors. This includes prioritizing activities to address racial and ethnic minority groups.

The Office of Patient Advocacy provides individualized case management services to patients seeking bone marrow transplants, including case assessment and postsearch functions for those who have completed the donor search. The Office of Patient Advocacy assists patients in finding unrelated bone marrow donors by providing information and education on the transplant process. This includes standards for patient advocacy and the provision of appropriate information to patients and their families and physicians. Additionally, an annual report on pretransplant costs is required. The Registry must annually submit data on pretransplant costs to the Secretary, comparing transplant centers' charges to patients. Amendments to the Public Health Service Act are made to reflect these changes. SEC. 3. RECIPIENT REGISTRY. Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish a Bone Marrow Scientific Registry. The Secretary will establish a scientific registry for bone marrow transplant recipients from unrelated donors, including patient information and transplant procedures. The registry will provide annual reports on patient outcomes for each transplant center. The Secretary will establish a scientific registry for bone marrow transplant recipients from unrelated donors. The registry will provide annual reports on patient outcomes for each transplant center, using data collected and maintained by the registry. Each report will also include data on pretransplant costs. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Amends Title III of the Public Health Service Act to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1999 through 2003. SEC. 5. STUDY BY GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE. The Comptroller General of the United States will study the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry to determine the increase in representation of racial and ethnic minority groups among potential donors and the availability of bone marrow transplants for patients in need. The National Bone Marrow Donor Registry is being studied to assess the search for unrelated donors, completion rates of full search processes, implementation of required plans, and compliance with standards by various entities. A report on the findings of the study on the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry must be submitted to Congress by October 1, 2001, with a deadline of not before January 1, 2001. The Act requires compliance with new requirements for the office of patient advocacy under the Public Health Service Act within 180 days of the effective date.
