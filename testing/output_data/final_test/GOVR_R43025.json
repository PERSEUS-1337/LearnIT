    "content": "The Adoption Incentive program provides federal payments to state child welfare agencies to increase adoptions of children in need of permanent families. States have received close to $424 million in federal incentive payments since the program began in FY1999. The Adoption Incentive program has received $424 million in federal incentive payments. Legislation has been passed to extend the program through FY2016 and make changes to the incentive structure. The Adoption Incentive program, established in 2008, is set to undergo changes under H.R. 4980. These changes include focusing on permanency for children 9 years and older, providing incentive payments for moving children to legal guardianship, and emphasizing adoption or guardianship for older children. Additionally, the bill would extend $15 million in annual funding for Family Connection Grants for one year. The bill H.R. 4980 aims to make changes to the Adoption Incentive program established in 2008. It includes adjusting eligibility criteria for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance, ensuring siblings have the opportunity to live together in foster care, and requiring states to report savings from expanded federal support for Title IV-E adoption assistance. The 2008 law provides federal support for Title IV-E adoption assistance and requires states to use at least 30% of identified savings for post-adoption services. Legislation in the 113th Congress aims to reauthorize the Adoption Incentive Payments program and make child welfare-related changes. (Appendix A compares current law with reauthorization proposals, including Title II of H.R. 4980). The bill H.R. 4980 aims to adjust eligibility criteria for kinship guardianship assistance and ensure siblings can live together in foster care. The 2008 law provides federal support for Title IV-E adoption assistance and requires states to use at least 30% of identified savings for post-adoption services. Legislation in the 113th Congress aims to reauthorize the Adoption Incentive Payments program and make child welfare-related changes. On June 26, 2014, Representative Camp introduced the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (H.R. 4980) with bipartisan support. Title II of H.R. 4980, introduced by Representative Camp along with Senators Wyden and Hatch, reflects agreements between House and Senate negotiators. It incorporates provisions from H.R. 3205 and S. 1870, which were passed by the House and approved by the Senate Finance Committee, respectively. These bills aimed to extend Adoption Incentive Payments and make amendments to child welfare law. In the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to extend Adoption Incentive Payments and make amendments to child welfare law. Key bills included the Guardians for Children Act, Investing in Permanency for Youth in Foster Care Act, Removing Barriers to Adoption and Supporting Families Act, Supporting Adoptive Families Act, and the Sibling Connections Act. Title II of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (H.R. 4980) renews funding authority for the Adoption and Legal Guardianship Incentive Payments program at $43 million annually through FY2016, aligning it with other child welfare programs under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act. Despite funding authority expiration, Congress provided $37.9 million in FY2014 for these payments. Title II of H.R. 4980 renews funding for child welfare programs under Title IV-B, expanding incentive payments for exits from foster care to legal guardianship and focusing on moving children to permanent homes via adoption or guardianship. It introduces new award categories for foster child adoptions and guardianships, splitting the \"older child adoptions\" category and adding foster child guardianships. H.R. 4980 introduces new award categories for adoptions and foster child guardianships of children aged 9-13 and 14 or older. It eliminates the category for adoptions of children under 9 with special needs and bases awards on improvements in adoption rates. The award determination for adoptions and foster child guardianships is based on the lower rate of the current year or the average rate of the three previous fiscal years. Comparing percentages instead of absolute numbers ensures that states with declining caseloads but strong performance still have access to incentive payments, while states with increasing caseloads must show improved permanency efforts for increased adoptions or guardianships. H.R. 4980 proposes changes to adoption incentive payments, basing awards on improved rates of adoptions and guardianships rather than just increased numbers. The new system would provide varying award amounts for different categories, such as $5,000 for foster child adoptions and $7,500 for pre-adolescent adoptions. This shift aims to incentivize states to focus on improving permanency efforts rather than simply increasing placements. H.R. 4980 proposes changes to adoption incentive payments, with varying award amounts based on improved rates of adoptions and guardianships. For pre-adolescent adoptions, the incentive is $7,500, and for older children, it is $10,000. The bill requires that foster children must leave foster care for placement with a legal guardian to qualify for the program. States must report to the Department of Health and Human Services that legal guardianship is the best permanency option for the child, with specific criteria to be met. H.R. 4980 proposes changes to adoption incentive payments, with varying award amounts based on improved rates of adoptions and guardianships. The bill would provide a \"timely adoption award\" in fiscal years when appropriations remain after all incentive payments for improved rates of adoptions and/or guardianships have been made. States would be eligible for this award if children who left foster care for adoption had been in foster care for less than 24 months on average. The bill H.R. 4980 proposes changes to adoption incentive payments, with a new incentive structure starting in FY2015. Incentive payments for this fiscal year will still follow the current law structure. In the second year of the reauthorization, states will receive half of the current law amount plus half of the new incentive structure amount. Under current law, states receive half of the current law amount plus half of the new incentive structure amount in the second year of the reauthorization. In the third year, the award structure from H.R. 4980 will be used exclusively to determine incentive payments. H.R. 4980 also allows states up to 36 months to use incentive funds, an increase from the current 24 months. Incentive payments must be spent on child and family services without counting towards the non-federal share of funding. H.R. 4980 would amend provisions of the Title IV-E program under the Social Security Act, requiring states to use incentive funds to supplement child welfare activities and document savings from expanding federal eligibility for adoption assistance. The eligibility expansion under H.R. 4980, phased in from FY2010 to FY2018, increased federal Title IV-E spending by $1.4 billion. States must calculate savings based on federal adoption assistance for eligible children and submit the methodology to HHS annually. H.R. 4980 requires states to annually submit their methodology for calculating savings on federal adoption assistance to HHS. States must spend at least 30% of identified savings on post-adoption and post-guardianship services, with two-thirds of that amount allocated to these services. The spending of savings should supplement existing funds for child welfare services under Title IV-B or Title. Title II of H.R. 4980 would amend the guardianship assistance provisions of the Title IV-E program to ensure that a child receiving kinship guardianship assistance continues to be eligible if their legal guardian dies or is incapacitated, as long as they are placed with a successor legal guardian named in the agreement. This eliminates the need for redetermination of eligibility under current law. The Title IV-E program would require redetermination of eligibility for kinship guardianship assistance if the legal guardian dies or is incapacitated. This would involve the child returning to foster care for at least six months. The change in eligibility criteria is estimated to save $7 million over 11 years. Additionally, H.R. 4980 would allocate $15 million for Family Connection Grants for kinship navigator programs and family treatment programs. H.R. 4980 aims to expand Family Connection grant funding eligibility to include institutions of higher education and provide support for foster parents caring for youth who are parents themselves. It would remove the provision ensuring a minimum of $5 million annually for kinship navigator programs, making funding available on an equal basis. Title II of H.R. 4980 expands the federal foster care program to include notifying parents of siblings of children removed from parental custody, defining \"sibling\" as per state law, or in cases of parental rights termination. Title II of H.R. 4980 expands the federal foster care program to collect data on children who enter foster care after being previously adopted or placed in legal guardianship, aiming to promote knowledge on ensuring strong, permanent families for children in foster care. The Subcommittee on Human Resources of the House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing on \"Increasing Adoptions from Foster Care\" to consider if changes were needed to encourage adoption from foster care, with witnesses discussing the importance of adoption for children to find permanent homes. Witnesses emphasized the importance of adoption for children to find permanent homes, especially older children and those with special needs. They supported reauthorization of the Adoption Incentive program and highlighted successful recruitment efforts for adoptive families. One model, \"Wendy's Wonderful Kids,\" showed promising results in placing children in permanent homes. The Wendy's Wonderful Kids model has been successful in finding permanent homes for older children and those with mental health disorders in foster care. Ohio has contracted to use this model statewide to place harder-to-adopt children aged 9 and older, leading to anticipated fiscal savings. The Wait No More campaign aims to raise awareness of the need for adoptive families, bringing together various agencies and support partners to host adoption events at churches nationwide. Adoption is emphasized as meeting the needs of the child. Speakers at the event emphasized that adoption should focus on meeting the needs of the child, not adults. They discussed common challenges for adoptees from foster care and strategies for successful outcomes. Witnesses highlighted the importance of post-adoption services, including specialized counselors for adoptive families. Some suggested that federal funding for adoptions should also support post-adoption services, and that states should use Adoption Incentive funds for this purpose. It was also mentioned that adopted children should not lose access to essential services available to them in foster care. Several witnesses at the event raised concerns about the assignment of the case plan goal \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" (APPLA) as a barrier to finding permanent families for youth in care. They suggested that efforts should always be made to find a permanent home for youth in care, even while preparing them for independent living. Other issues discussed included the reauthorization of the Family Connections grant program to support projects connecting youth with permanent families. Witnesses at a hearing suggested ways to support youth in foster care, such as increasing kinship support, family-finding efforts, and using Title IV-E funds for adoption casework. They also proposed expanding the Adoption Incentive program to reward states for helping youth find safe, permanent families. Additionally, there was a draft bill to re-authorize the Adoption Incentive Payments program and comments were sought on the Guardians for Children Act. The Promoting Adoption and Legal Guardianship for Children in Foster Care Act (H.R. 3205) was introduced by Representative Camp on September 27, 2013. The bill was passed by the full House on October 22, 2013, with overwhelming support. The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on April 23, 2013, to discuss reauthorization of the Adoption Incentive program and improvements in foster care provision, featuring the story of Antwone Fisher. Antwone Fisher shared his experience of being in foster care and emphasized the importance of child welfare agencies finding permanent families for children, ensuring their safety and well-being, and providing opportunities for them to prepare for adulthood. Other witnesses at the hearing also highlighted the need for youth to take charge of their lives through transition planning and individual development accounts. Additionally, a former child welfare agency director discussed moving towards a collaborative and family-centered approach in providing support for families in need. The Senate Finance Committee discussed reauthorizing Adoption Incentive Payments and making changes to federal child welfare policies, emphasizing the importance of involving family members in meeting the needs of children in foster care. The Chairman's Mark of the Supporting At-Risk Children Act included provisions to identify and notify adult relatives of children entering foster care. The Chairman's Mark, approved on a voice vote, included child welfare-related amendments. The bill was reported to the Senate as S. 1870 on December 19, 2013. Title I of S. 1870 was introduced as a stand-alone bill, the Strengthening and Finding Families for Children's Act (S. 1876). This bill was introduced by Senator Baucus and drew significantly from Title II of H.R. 4980. The report discusses congressional interest in adoption to move children from foster care to permanency, including the Adoption Incentive Payments program created in 1997 legislation. Foster care is a temporary living arrangement for children not safe in their own homes. Adoption is considered when reunification is not possible. Congress aims to encourage adoptions for children in foster care. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act was enacted to support ongoing subsidies for adoptees with special needs, ensuring they find permanent and loving homes. States can establish their own criteria for determining special needs in children who require new families. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA, P.L. 105-89) was enacted in 1997 to address concerns about the delay in moving children from foster care to permanent families. It tightened permanency planning timelines, required states to prioritize expeditious permanence for children in foster care, and allocated federal funds for adoption promotion and support services. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA, P.L. 105-89) was enacted in 1997 to expedite permanency for children in foster care. It allocated federal funds for adoption promotion and support services. In 2008, the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (P.L. 110-351) expanded federal adoption assistance eligibility by removing income criteria. Adoption is a legal process for a child to gain a new permanent family. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997 aims to expedite permanency for children in foster care by identifying suitable adoptive parents and terminating parental rights through a legal process known as TPR. This process has led to a significant increase in adoptions out of foster care and a reduction in the number of children waiting for adoption. The number of adoptions from foster care has increased significantly since the mid-1990s, with a peak of around 57,000 in FY2009. Despite a decline in the overall number of children in foster care, the number of adoptions has remained relatively high, at roughly 50,000 annually. Older children are less likely to be adopted compared to younger children. The rate of children adopted from foster care has more than doubled since the late 1990s, with roughly 13 adoptions per 100 children in foster care. Adoption is the case plan goal for 24% of children in foster care, some of whom are legally free for adoption. The number of children waiting for adoption has decreased in recent years, with 102,000 children waiting as of FY2012. The percentage of children leaving foster care for adoption has increased, with 49% of waiting children adopted in FY2012. This represents a slightly larger share of the overall foster care caseload in FY2012 compared to FY1998. The percentage of children in foster care waiting for adoption increased slightly from 22% in FY1998 to 26% in FY2012. This could be due to changes in state practices or efforts to reduce unnecessary entries into foster care. Adoption is a multi-step process that requires \"reasonable efforts\" for reunification before considering adoption. Federal law requires a state to petition a court for termination of parental rights if a child is abandoned or reunification efforts are not required. After 15 months in foster care, the state must petition for termination unless it's not in the child's best interest or services for reunification have not been provided. The state court then decides whether to grant termination based on state laws. Since FY2000, the time children spend in foster care before adoption has decreased by about a year, mainly due to quicker termination of parental rights (TPR). The process involves finding a suitable adoptive family, finalizing the adoption in court, and granting legal parental rights to the adoptive parents. The Adoption Incentive program aims to promote adoptions to provide permanent families for children in foster care. It offers special incentives for harder-to-place children, such as those with special needs or older children. The program, established in 1997 and amended twice, has helped decrease the time children spend in foster care before adoption, mainly due to quicker termination of parental rights. The Adoption Incentive program, established in 1997 and amended twice, aims to promote adoptions for children in foster care. Changes to the incentive structure have been made through reauthorizations, with states earning funds for various adoption outcomes such as increasing adoptions overall, adopting older children, those with special needs under age 9, and the adoption rate of children from foster care. The Adoption Incentive program, established in 1997, aims to promote adoptions for children in foster care. States earn funds for increasing adoptions overall, adopting older children, those with special needs under age 9, and improving the adoption rate of children from foster care. States earn $4,000 for each foster child adopted above their baseline number and $8,000 for each older child adoption above their baseline. The Adoption Incentive program rewards states for increasing adoptions overall, adopting older children, and those with special needs under age 9. States can earn $4,000 for each adoption of a special needs child above their baseline number, and additional funds for improving their adoption rate. States must finalize adoptions in FY2008-FY2012 to be eligible for Adoption Incentive payments. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 allows states to earn Adoption Incentive Payments for adoptions completed in FY2013 and provides funds for FY2014. States must provide necessary data via AFCARS to be eligible for payments and ensure health insurance coverage for adoptive children with special needs. No state may receive an award for an increase in special needs adoptions. The Adoption Incentive program awards states for increasing special needs adoptions of children under 9, but only if there is also an increase in foster child or older child adoptions. Payments have been made since FY1999, totaling over $423 million by FY2012. Funding was authorized through FY2013 at $43 million annually. The Adoption Incentive program awards states for increasing special needs adoptions of children under 9, with funding authorized through FY2013 at $43 million annually. Actual appropriations have been less than $40 million in recent years, with Congress providing $37.2 million for FY2013 and $37.9 million for FY2014. HHS prorates award amounts when funds are insufficient, paying initial amounts and later awarding remaining incentives when additional appropriations are received. When HHS initially awarded adoption incentives for FY2012, only $32.5 million was available, 74% of the full amount earned by states. Additional appropriations from Congress (P.L. 113-76) allowed HHS to award the remaining 26% ($11.4 million) to states. In total, $202 million in Adoption Incentive payments were distributed to 45 states for adoptions finalized in FY2008-FY2012. Five states did not receive incentives for adoptions during those years. Five states (Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Vermont, and New York) increased their adoption rates in certain years but did not receive incentive payments due to funding constraints. Two states (District of Columbia and Iowa) did not improve their adoption rates. Table 2 displays the total amounts paid to states under the current incentive structure by award year and category. States earned $94.7 million in incentive payments for increasing foster child adoptions finalized in FY2008-FY2012, with a total eligible amount of $10 million more than expected. The incentive category applies to children adopted from foster care, with states able to earn $4,000 for each adoption above the baseline year of FY2007. In FY2008-FY2012, states earned $94.7 million in incentive payments for increasing foster child adoptions, with $56.7 million tied to adoptions of children aged 9 or older. Adoptions of older children are less common but can earn states $8,000 per adoption in this category. States can earn $8,000 for each adoption of an older child above their FY2007 baseline. Some states received incentive payments for increasing older child adoptions from FY2008-FY2012. A portion of the incentive payments was linked to adoptions of children with special needs under the age of nine. States must earn awards in other categories to be eligible for payments in this category. States can earn $4,000 for each adoption of a special needs child under 9 years old above their baseline. Ten states increased their special needs adoptions above baseline from FY2008-FY2012 but were not eligible for payments in some years due to not earning awards in other categories. Overall, 10 states consistently increased special needs adoptions in those five years, while 30 states did so in at least one year. In FY2008-FY2012, states could earn incentive payments for increasing adoption rates, but only $1.7 million of the $11.5 million total amount was awarded due to limited appropriations. Adoption rates were based on the total number of foster child adoptions completed in a fiscal year. In FY2008-FY2012, states could earn incentive payments for increasing adoption rates based on the total number of foster child adoptions completed in a fiscal year. An award for an increased rate of adoption can ensure that an incentive may be earned by a state that continues to move children from foster care to adoption even as the total number of children in foster care declines. States had to exceed their highest adoption rate achieved since FY2002 to qualify for the award. States improved their adoption rates from FY2008 to FY2012, with an average of 13 adoptions for every 100 children in foster care in FY2012. Adoption Incentive funds can be used within a 24-month period for child welfare-related activities authorized under Title IV-B or Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. The Adoption Incentive funds can be used for child welfare activities such as investigating child abuse, placing children in foster care, reuniting children with parents, finding permanent homes through adoption or guardianship, and assisting youth in foster care with transitioning to adulthood. States cannot use these funds to meet matching requirements for other programs under Title IV-E and Title IV-B of the Social Security Act. Many states use these funds for adoption-related purposes. Many states use Adoption Incentive funds for adoption-related purposes such as post-adoption support services, recruitment of adoptive homes, training, and improving adoption casework. Other services funded include monthly adoption assistance payments, equipment for processing adoption records, and support for inter-jurisdictional adoption placement. Some states also use these funds for foster care-related activities. Some states use Adoption Incentive funds for various adoption-related activities, including post-adoption support services, recruitment of adoptive homes, training, and improving adoption casework. Others utilize the funds for foster care-related activities, permanency efforts, and services to families and children remaining in the home. Adoption Incentive funds may also be used for foster care maintenance payments and direct child protection services. The Adoption Incentive program provides funds for adoption-related activities and foster care efforts, including post-adoption support services, recruitment of adoptive homes, and improving adoption casework. Each child in foster care must have a permanency goal, with a hearing held every 12 months to determine the plan for leaving foster care. If the plan is not reunification, adoption, legal guardianship, or placement with a relative, then \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" may be considered. The Adoption Incentive program measures state performance based on a baseline to determine if adoptions have increased. Foster child adoption refers to finalizing adoptions of children in public foster care. Guardianhip is a legal relationship intended to be permanent and self-sustaining. The curr_chunk discusses the different types of adoptions, including older child adoption and special needs adoption, which involve transferring parental rights to the caretaker. Older child adoption refers to finalizing adoptions of children aged nine or older in public foster care. Special needs adoption involves adopting children who cannot be returned to their parents and require assistance due to specific factors or conditions. Special needs adoption involves adopting children who require assistance due to specific factors or conditions, such as age, sibling group membership, minority race/ethnicity, medical conditions, or disabilities. The state must make reasonable efforts to place the child for adoption without assistance, unless it is not in the child's best interest. Adoption of children under age 9 with special needs is finalized through a Title IV-E adoption assistance agreement between the state child welfare agency and the adoptive parents. In FY2007, adoptions in the state were reported via AFCARS. Termination of Parental Rights (TPR) is the legal severing of the parent-child relationship in a state court. Waiting for Adoption refers to children in foster care with a goal of adoption or whose parental rights have been terminated. Youth age 16 or older with a goal of \"emancipation\" are excluded. Table C-1 in Appendix C shows trends in adoptions with public child welfare agency involvement. The public child welfare agency is involved in adoptions and foster care, with a focus on harder to place children. Congress adjusts the Adoption Incentive program to encourage adoption, even as caseloads decline. The Adoption Incentive program for children in foster care and waiting for adoption was designed to ensure earning incentives, even as caseloads decreased, and protect the value of payments from inflation."
