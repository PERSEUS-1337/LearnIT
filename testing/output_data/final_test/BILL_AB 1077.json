    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts the following: Mutual water companies in the state have significantly improved water quality, service reliability, and transparency since 2013. They have also been leaders in promoting water conservation and efficiency during the drought emergency. These nonprofit entities serve as the sole water provider in their territories and should ensure shareholders and customers have a voice in company operations. Many small mutual water companies in California lack adequate meeting facilities and financial resources, making it challenging to provide safe and affordable water to their shareholders. Unlike large public agencies, these nonprofit organizations are solely responsible to their shareholders and customers. The Legislature believes mutual water companies should provide shareholder and customer access to meetings within operational constraints. Section 14305 of the Corporations Code is amended to ensure eligible persons can attend board meetings with 24 hours advance notice. The board of directors of a mutual water company may use teleconferencing to allow eligible persons access to meetings, even if attendance would otherwise be denied due to capacity constraints. If teleconferencing is used, all relevant documents must be provided to attendees before the meeting begins. The board of directors of a mutual water company can't prevent an eligible person from attending a meeting in person or by teleconference, as long as notice requirements are met. They may also allow attendance in person instead of using teleconferencing. The term \"teleconference\" for a mutual water company board meeting means any electronic means, like a phone or computer, that allows eligible persons to hear and interact with the board. The board of directors of a mutual water company can only meet in executive session for specific reasons such as pending litigation, contract formation, personnel matters, or member/shareholder discipline. Members can request to attend an executive session if they are facing discipline. An eligible person can attend a teleconference meeting without fulfilling the notice requirement. Matters discussed in executive session must be noted in the meeting minutes. The minutes of board meetings of a mutual water company must be available to eligible persons within 30 days of the meeting, along with the pro forma budget. Eligible persons can request these documents and must reimburse the company for the costs. Unless the bylaws state otherwise, eligible persons must receive notice of a meeting at least four days in advance, either by posting in a public place, mailing to those who requested it, or through electronic means. The notice must include the agenda for the meeting. An emergency meeting of the board of directors of a mutual water company can be called by the CEO or two board members in unforeseen urgent circumstances. Eligible persons have the right to speak at meetings, with a time limit set by the board. The board of directors of a mutual water company can only discuss agenda items at nonemergency meetings that were included in the notice. However, non-board members can speak on issues not on the agenda. Board members, officers, or staff can respond to statements, ask questions for clarification, make announcements, or give brief reports at meetings. The board of directors of a mutual water company can provide resources, request reports from officers or staff, and direct administrative tasks. They can also take action on items not on the agenda under certain conditions. In emergency situations, the board of directors can take immediate action without prior notice if a majority agrees or by a two-thirds vote if necessary action arises after the agenda is posted. The board of directors must openly identify agenda items to members before discussing them at a meeting. They are not allowed to take action on any business outside of a meeting, and electronic meetings are restricted except in specific circumstances. Electronic transmissions can be used for emergency meetings if all board members consent in writing and file the consents with the meeting minutes. An eligible person can take legal action against a mutual water company for violating this section and seek a judicial determination to nullify board actions. An eligible person must demand the board to cure or correct any alleged violations within 90 days of the action. The board has 30 days to either fix the issue and inform the demanding party or decide not to take action. Within 15 days of receiving the board's decision on whether to cure or correct a violation, the demanding party must start legal action. Failure to do so will result in being barred from taking action later. A board action alleged to violate the law is not void if it substantially complies. Subsequent actions by the board to correct a violation are not evidence of wrongdoing. An eligible person who wins a civil action under this section is entitled to attorney's fees and court costs. A mutual water company can only recover costs if the court deems the action frivolous. \"Eligible person\" includes shareholders, occupants of spaces supplied by the company, elected officials representing customers, and others allowed to participate in company meetings. A meeting is defined as a gathering of a majority of the board members to discuss any item of business within the board's authority. An item of business refers to actions within the board's authority, excluding those delegated to others. A teleconference meeting of a mutual water company's board must have a majority of members connected electronically, with at least one physical location for members to attend. Board members participating in the teleconference must be able to hear each other and members speaking on board matters. A mutual water company, as defined in Section 14300, operates a public water system."
