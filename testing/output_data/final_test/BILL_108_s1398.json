    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Act\". It includes findings related to environmental restoration in the Great Lakes region. Congress finds that the Great Lakes, the largest freshwater system in the world, remain in a degraded state despite improvements in water quality over the past 30 years. Evidence of this degradation includes a record number of beach closings, increased pollution in shoreline sediments, and actions taken by State and local authorities. The Great Lakes are sources of drinking water for 40 million people in the US and Canada. Despite efforts to restore water quality, no sites have been restored in the US. It is the responsibility of the Federal Government and State/local governments to ensure the Great Lakes remain clean and safe for drinking, fishing, and swimming. The Great Lakes need additional funding to address known threats and ensure they remain clean and safe for drinking, fishing, and swimming. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Board\" as the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Advisory Board, \"Council\" as the Great Lakes Federal Coordination Council, and \"Great Lake\" as including Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, Lake Ontario, Lake Superior, and their connecting channels. The Act defines key terms related to the Great Lakes, including the Great Lakes State, Program, and Program Office. The Great Lakes State refers to certain states bordering the Great Lakes, the Program refers to the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Grant Program, and the Program Office is the Great Lakes National Program Office of the EPA. SEC. 4. GREAT LAKES RESTORATION GRANTS. Establishment of the Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Grant Program to provide grants for various restoration projects in and around the Great Lakes, including contaminated sediment cleanup, wetland restoration, invasive species control, coastal habitat improvement, public access enhancement, water quality improvement, sustainable water use, and pollution reduction. The Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Grant Program provides funding for projects to restore, protect, and assist the recovery of the Great Lakes. Grants ensure projects in each Great Lakes State, with funding between 6-30% of total funds for tangible improvements in the watershed. The Great Lakes Environmental Restoration Grant Program provides funding for projects in the Great Lakes watershed that address priority issue areas identified by the Board. The Program Office gives weight to the Board's ranking of proposals, and if a top-ranked proposal is not funded, a written explanation is provided to the Board. The proposal was not funded due to funding limitations, which restrict the use of funds for certain activities such as road construction, research projects not benefiting the Great Lakes watershed, beautification projects not improving the watershed, and litigation expenses related to water pollution violations. Authorization of Appropriations: $600,000,000 is authorized annually from 2004 to 2013 to address violations of environmental laws. Federal funding for projects cannot exceed 80%, and in-kind contributions are accepted. The cost of projects funded under the authorization may be provided in cash or in kind. SEC. 5.

The Board reviews grant proposals and provides a list of approved applications to the Program Office. The Board recommends grant applications for funding, ranked by merit. SEC. 6. GREAT LAKES FEDERAL COORDINATING COUNCIL. The Great Lakes Federal Coordinating Council is established in the executive branch with membership including various Secretaries and agency heads. The Great Lakes Federal Coordinating Council, chaired by the Director of the Great Lakes National Program Office, may appoint additional members with significant responsibilities in environmental restoration and protection from the Federal Government. The Council meets at least three times a year to coordinate federal agencies' efforts in the Great Lakes' environmental restoration and protection. The Great Lakes Federal Coordinating Council, chaired by the Director of the Great Lakes National Program Office, appoints members with environmental responsibilities from the Federal Government.

SEC. 7. GREAT LAKES WATER QUALITY INDICATORS AND MONITORING. Section 118(c)(1) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to develop science-based indicators of water quality in the Great Lakes in cooperation with Canada and relevant federal agencies. The Program Office must establish a Federal network for monitoring and collecting data on Great Lakes water quality indicators within 4 years of enactment. Benchmark data must be collected within this timeframe. Subsequent reports on water quality must be submitted to Congress and made public every 2 years. The text chunk describes the water quality and environmental factors of the Great Lakes, including any changes and emerging problems. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Authorization of appropriations for Great Lakes water quality indicators and monitoring is outlined in the text chunk, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2004 through 2007."
