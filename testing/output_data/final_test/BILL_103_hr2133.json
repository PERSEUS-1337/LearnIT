    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International Nonproliferation Safeguards Reform Act of 1993\". The Congress acknowledges the potential of nuclear energy for both good and harm, recognizes the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in safeguarding against military use of civilian nuclear facilities, and emphasizes the importance of IAEA safeguards in preventing nuclear weapons proliferation. The ability of the IAEA to achieve its safeguards objectives is jeopardized by nations pursuing nuclear weapons options in violation of nonproliferation treaty commitments. Additionally, challenges arise from efforts to make large-scale commercial uses of weapons-grade nuclear material. The IAEA has taken on new safeguards responsibilities in various countries, including inspection activities and implementation of safeguards on reprocessing facilities. These responsibilities are expanding amidst changing political and technological conditions. Iraq's nuclear weapons development highlights the need for reforms in IAEA safeguards. The United States and other member states must provide adequate support for successful implementation of these reforms. Programs are being implemented to reform international nonproliferation safeguards. During fiscal years 1994 and 1995, the Secretary of State, guided by the President, will provide additional assistance to the IAEA for reforms in safeguards and contributions to the Technical Assistance and Cooperation Fund. Assistance for the latter purpose requires certification by the President to Congress on IAEA's steps. President certifies to Congress that IAEA is implementing reforms to enhance safeguards effectiveness, including improving access to nuclear facilities, increasing transparency in nuclear commerce, and exploring expanding scope. The IAEA is exploring ways to enhance safeguards effectiveness, including increasing access to nuclear facilities and improving transparency in nuclear commerce. They are also considering expanding the scope of safeguards to include all activities that could contribute to the acquisition of nuclear explosive devices. Additionally, they are looking into conducting less frequent inspections at facilities in member states that provide advance consent for short notice inspections. The curr_chunk discusses facilities falling under IAEA safeguards, accepting approved inspectors without limiting their number, and waiving visa requirements for them. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF FUNDING. $10,000,000 authorized for fiscal year 1994 and 1995 to Department of State for section 3(a), with $5,000,000 limit for section 3(b)(2). SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENT. The President must report to Congress on the steps taken to implement objectives, progress made, obstacles encountered, and measures to strengthen IAEA safeguards. Additionally, a report on funding must be submitted within one year of the enactment of the Act. The President must report to Congress on the steps taken to implement objectives, progress made, obstacles encountered, and measures to strengthen IAEA safeguards. A report assessing additional funds required for the IAEA and the United States' planned contributions over the next 5 fiscal years must be submitted within one year of the Act's enactment. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\nThe term \"IAEA\" refers to the International Atomic Energy Agency. A \"non-nuclear-weapon state\" is any country that is not a nuclear-weapon state as defined by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. A \"nuclear-weapon state\" is defined by the same treaty. \"Special fissionable material\" is defined by the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency."
