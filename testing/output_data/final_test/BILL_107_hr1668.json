The Congress acknowledges the significant contributions of the Adams family to the United States, including John Adams' role in shaping the nation's early history. John Adams was a key figure in the American Revolution, serving as the second President and advocating for freedom of conscience and the rule of law. Abigail Smith Adams also played a notable role in American history. Abigail Smith Adams, wife of former President John Adams and mother of former President John Quincy Adams, was a remarkable advocate for women's rights, liberty, and abolition. John Quincy Adams was a distinguished lawyer, legislator, diplomat, and multilingual individual who held various significant roles in government, including Secretary of State and chief negotiator of the Treaty of Ghent. John Quincy Adams, the sixth President and former President John Adams' son, was known as \"Old Man Eloquent\" for his fight against slavery. His wife, Louisa Catherine Johnson Adams, was an accomplished first lady who advocated for women's rights and opposed slavery. Their son, Charles Francis Adams, was a staunch abolitionist and received the Free Soil Party's vice-presidential nomination in 1848. Henry Adams, son of Charles Francis Adams, was a prominent writer, historian, and public intellectual. He authored notable works such as \"Democracy\" and \"The Education of Henry Adams\". The Adams family has contributed significantly to the nation through their civic consciousness, belief in democracy, and dedication to service for the common good. The Adams Memorial Foundation may establish a commemorative work in the District of Columbia to honor former President John Adams, correcting an oversight in the National Capital's memorials to past Presidents. The Adams Memorial Foundation plans to establish a commemorative work in the District of Columbia to honor former President John Adams, his wife Abigail Adams, and former President John Quincy Adams, in accordance with the Commemorative Works Act. Federal funds are prohibited for this project, with the foundation solely responsible for accepting contributions and covering expenses. Any excess funds will be deposited after all expenses are paid. If there is a balance of funds remaining after the establishment of the commemorative work for John Adams and his family, the Adams Memorial Foundation will send the amount to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit. The Act defines \"commemorative work\" and \"the District of Columbia and its environs\" as per the Commemorative Works Act."
