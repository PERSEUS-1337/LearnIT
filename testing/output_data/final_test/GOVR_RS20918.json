In the 110th Congress, H.R. 1204 (527 Transparency Act of 2007) aimed to require monthly reports for all political organizations reporting to the IRS. Failure to file timely reports would result in penalties and gift tax on contributions. The bill proposed notifying contributors of failures within 90 days of IRS determination and simultaneous filing with the FEC."
