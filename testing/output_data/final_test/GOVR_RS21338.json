    "content": "The Navy reorganized from CVBGs and ARGs to independently deployable, strike-capable formations due to the need for flexibility in deploying naval capability worldwide. This new Global Concept of Operations (CONOPS) allows for missions to be performed more efficiently with the increasing capabilities of Navy ships. The Navy reorganized from CVBGs and ARGs to Expeditionary Strike Groups (ESGs) and Surface Strike Groups (SSGs) under the Global Concept of Operations (CONOPS). This change increased the number of independently deployable strike groups to 20, including Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) and ESGs, with enhanced capabilities for missions worldwide. The Navy reorganized its deployment strategy to enhance flexibility and deterrence by increasing the number of independently deployable strike groups to 20, including Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) and Expeditionary Strike Groups (ESGs). This shift aimed to address the limitations of standard six-month deployments and provide the ability to surge naval forces quickly in response to regional contingencies. The Navy implemented the Fleet Response Plan (FRP) to increase flexibility in deployment plans, allowing for shorter or longer deployments as needed. The FRP keeps Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) and Expeditionary Strike Groups (ESGs) on alert for potential redeployment and maintains readiness for quick deployment in response to emergencies. This initiative enables the Navy to deploy up to 6 CSGs within 30 days. The Fleet Response Plan (FRP) allows the Navy to deploy up to 6 Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) within 30 days, with an additional CSG within another 60 days. The Navy has made progress in implementing FRP but needs to define clear missions, establish goals, measure performance, and align activities with resources. The Navy has made progress in implementing the Fleet Response Plan (FRP) by deploying carrier strike groups within specific timeframes. However, there are gaps in setting implementation goals for all forces, developing performance measures, and identifying necessary resources. Without addressing these issues, the Navy may struggle to assess readiness levels and achieve FRP goals effectively. The Navy has not fully considered the long-term risks and tradeoffs associated with changes made during the implementation of the Fleet Response Plan (FRP), such as extending intervals between carrier maintenance periods and lengthening operational cycles. The Navy has not performed a comprehensive assessment of how these changes might affect its ability to achieve readiness levels effectively. The Navy has not fully considered the long-term risks and tradeoffs of changes made during the implementation of the Fleet Response Plan (FRP). The Navy needs to develop realistic plans that accurately identify risk levels during gaps in aircraft carrier availability to inform senior leadership's decision-making. Forward homeporting can reduce transit times and increase ship days on station. The U.S. Navy forward homeports ships in Japan, Italy, Guam, and Bahrain to increase presence in overseas operating areas. Increasing ships in the Pacific can enhance response to contingencies in regions like the Korean Peninsula or Taiwan Strait. A 2002 report suggested homeporting 11 attack submarines at Guam. The Navy is implementing measures to provide at least six aircraft carriers and 60% of its submarines in the Pacific, which can be achieved by moving ships from Atlantic Fleet home ports to San Diego or the Puget Sound area. They have also experimented with long-duration deployments with crew rotation, known as Sea Swap, to reduce transit time and maintenance needs for deployed ships. Sea Swap can reduce the number of ships needed for overseas operations by 20% or more, but it may lead to wear and tear on ships, reduced crew ownership, and fewer port calls. Navy officials consider Sea Swap experiments successful in terms of ship maintenance, crew re-enlistment rates, and overall costs. The Center for Naval Analyses conducted a study on Sea Swap, finding that while successful in terms of ship maintenance and costs, crew members viewed the concept negatively. Changes were made to address crew dissatisfaction, and Navy officials considered expanding Sea Swap to reduce the fleet size. However, recent reports suggest the Navy may limit Sea Swap to smaller combatants like patrol craft, LCSs, and frigates. The Navy plans to use Sea Swap for patrol craft, LCSs, and frigates to keep two of its four SSGNs continuously deployed. A 2008 GAO report highlighted the need for a comprehensive management approach for rotational crewing to lead a successful transformation of crewing culture. Leadership and accountability for rotational crewing have not been clearly assigned, risking the effectiveness of the program. The Navy lacks high-level guidance for rotational crewing initiatives and has not consistently addressed it in ship-class concepts of operations. While some analyses have been conducted, a systematic method for analyzing and reporting findings on rotational crewing potential is lacking. Standardized data-collection plans and evaluations of life-cycle costs for rotational crewing alternatives have not been developed. Future ship rotational crewing options have not been adequately assessed. The Navy has not adequately assessed rotational crewing options for future ships, as required by DOD guidance. This lack of assessment results in incomplete force structure assessments and a lack of clarity on the number of ships needed. Lessons learned from rotational crewing experiences have not been consistently collected and shared, with some ship communities relying on informal processes. The Atlantic Sea Swap initiative used a systematic approach to capture lessons learned, but other ship communities did not follow suit. The Navy has not systematically recorded and shared lessons learned from rotational crewing efforts, risking repeating mistakes and missing opportunities for more effective implementation. Multiple crewing strategies, such as dual crewing for Navy ships, have been successful, with the potential for various crew combinations. The Navy's nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines have operated successfully with dual crews. The option of combining Sea Swap with multiple crewing was presented in a March 2002 CBO report. The Navy plans to use dual crewing for its first few LCSs and then switch to a \"4-3-1\" crewing strategy as the number of LCSs grows. This strategy involves using four crews for every three LCSs to keep one continuously deployed. The Navy is experimenting with this concept, first announced in 2006, to address potential disadvantages such as increased costs and wear and tear on the ships. The Navy is experimenting with global fleet stations (GFSs) using amphibious or high-speed sealift ships as cores for regional operations. LCSs may operate alongside these core ships for various missions. A pilot GFS in the Caribbean with the high-speed sealift ship Swift is ongoing, with plans for a year-long GFS in the Gulf of Guinea in late 2007. The GFS concept aims to enhance regional maritime security through joint, inter-agency, and multinational partnerships. The GFS concept involves self-contained headquarters for regional operations, capable of servicing ships, small craft, and aircraft. It offers classroom space, medical facilities, and combat support. This sea-based option supports national objectives and complements traditional CSG/ESG cycles. Congress oversight may focus on fleet size, ship types for Sea Swap, distribution of overhaul work, and additional ships for forward homeporting in the Pacific. The Navy is considering additional ships for forward homeporting in the Pacific."
