With automation advancing in healthcare, the industry will rely on NSF-funded researchers for information processing. NSF's research and assistance are crucial for preparing the industry to leverage advanced technology. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 136,000 Americans employed in information management in 2000. In 2000, 136,000 Americans were employed in information management in the healthcare industry, with a projected growth of 49 percent by 2010. There is no systematic plan for designing and implementing information tools for the healthcare workforce to transition to the information age. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the National Science Foundation. The term \"information\" pertains to healthcare information. The term \"institution of higher education\" is defined as per section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION RESEARCH. The Director, in consultation with other agencies, awards grants for research on improving information systems in areas like information studies, data security, and confidentiality. Grants are merit-reviewed and competitive, with authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2010-2012. The Director awards multiyear grants to institutions of higher education to establish Centers for Informatics Research. Grants are merit-reviewed and competitive, with specific funding allocated for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. The Centers for Informatics Research aim to conduct cutting-edge, multidisciplinary research in information technology. Institutions seeking funding must submit an application detailing research projects and promoting collaboration among professionals from different disciplines. The Center for Informatics Research aims to increase the number of information researchers and professionals by evaluating applications based on innovative approaches, research experience, and collaboration capacity. The Center for Informatics Research evaluates applications based on research capacity, collaboration potential with government or private entities, and support for student research. The Director convenes annual meetings to promote collaboration among Centers. $4,500,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2010. The Center for Informatics Research receives funding as follows:\n(A) $4,500,000 for fiscal year 2010;\n(B) $4,600,000 for fiscal year 2011;\n(C) $4,700,000 for fiscal year 2012; and\n(D) $4,800,000 for fiscal year 2013. SEC. 5. National Science Foundation information programs. The Director will establish a program to award grants to institutions of higher education to improve undergraduate and master's degree information programs, increase student enrollment in information fields, provide industry experience, and utilize distance learning. Grants will be awarded based on merit and competition, with funds used to enhance program capabilities. The program will award grants to institutions of higher education to enhance information education programs, including curriculum development, degree programs, research opportunities, and equipment acquisition for student instruction. The program aims to enhance information education programs by providing opportunities for faculty collaboration, establishing student internships, and creating bridge programs between community colleges. The program aims to enhance information education programs by providing opportunities for faculty collaboration, establishing student internships, and creating bridge programs between community colleges.
