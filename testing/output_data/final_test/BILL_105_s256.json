    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Cheese Exchange Oversight and Improvement Act of 1997\". It includes findings related to the Act. The National Cheese Exchange, located in Green Bay, Wisconsin, is the dominant cash market for bulk cheese in the United States. Despite only selling less than 1 percent of the cheese produced in the country, its price serves as a reference for up to 95 percent of commercial cheese transactions. A federally funded investigation revealed that the National Cheese Exchange is thinly traded, highly concentrated, unregulated, and susceptible to manipulation. The National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, Wisconsin is the main cash market for bulk cheese in the US, with its price influencing most commercial cheese transactions. However, it is thinly traded, highly concentrated, unregulated, and vulnerable to manipulation. The Coffee, Sugar, and Cocoa Exchange in New York trades cheese futures contracts but faces low trading volume due to concerns about market viability and manipulation. The National Cheese Exchange is unregulated by any federal or state agency, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission lacking authority to oversee it. The Commodity Exchange Act is amended to include a new section for the regulation of the National Cheese Exchange and similar cash markets by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The definition of a concentrated cash market includes the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and any thinly traded or highly illiquid market that serves as a reference price for a commodity, with trading concentrated among few buyers and sellers. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates concentrated cash markets that lack regulation, have a futures market for the same commodity, and may deter futures market use due to instability, illiquidity, or manipulation potential. The Commission oversees these markets until they no longer serve as a reference price for the majority of commercial transactions. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates concentrated cash markets without regulation, overseeing their operation and requiring submission of operating rules for approval within specific timeframes. The Commission notifies concentrated cash markets of regulation under this section, reviewing operating rules submitted by them promptly. Within 60 days, the Commission informs the market of the review result, approving or disapproving the rules. If disapproved, recommendations for changes are provided, along with a resubmission schedule. Beginning 1 year after enactment, concentrated cash markets must operate under approved rules reviewed by the Commission. Other markets notified of regulation must also comply with approved rules."
