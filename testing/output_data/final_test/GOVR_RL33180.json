    "content": "Following the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the AUMF granting the President authority to use force against those involved. President Bush established guidelines for detainment and treatment of foreign belligerents captured in the \"war on terror\" and created military commissions. Suspected belligerents were transferred to Guantanamo Bay for detention and potential prosecution. In 2004, the Supreme Court issued key rulings on the Executive's authority to detain individuals in the \"war on terror.\" In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, the Court found that the 2001 AUMF allowed for the preventive detention of enemy combatants captured during hostilities in Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens. The ruling stated that \"enemy combatants\" have the right to challenge their detention before a neutral decision-maker. The case of Rasul v. Bush established that federal courts have jurisdiction to consider habeas corpus petitions for persons detained at Guantanamo. The Court's rulings in Hamdi and Rasul led to the establishment of Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) for Guantanamo detainees and the filing of habeas cases in the U.S. District Court. Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA) to set standards for interrogation and prohibit cruel treatment of detainees. The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 bans cruel treatment of detainees but limits court jurisdiction over challenges by Guantanamo Bay detainees. The Supreme Court's ruling in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld allowed review of military commissions established under President Bush's 2001 order. The Court found that military tribunals under the President did not comply with UCMJ or the law of war, leading to the enactment of the Military Commissions Act of 2006. This act allowed the President to convene military commissions for unlawful alien combatants without following UCMJ rules and eliminated court jurisdiction over detainee causes of action, except for limited review under the DTA. The Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether the writ of habeas corpus extends to noncitizens held at Guantanamo in the 2008 case Boumediene v. Bush. The Court ruled in a 5-4 opinion that Guantanamo detainees are entitled to habeas corpus protections under the Constitution, rejecting the government's argument that they are not entitled to any constitutional rights. Detainees at Guantanamo can petition for habeas review of their detention as enemy combatants. The D.C. Circuit's ruling in 2009 effectively nullified the judicial process established by the DTA. Legal issues remain unsettled, including the scope of habeas review and the extent of constitutional provisions for noncitizens at Guantanamo. The Supreme Court was expected to address some of these issues in the case of Kiyemba v. Obama. The appellate court ruled that federal habeas courts cannot order the release of Guantanamo detainees into the US, even if they are unlawfully held. The Supreme Court later vacated this decision and remanded the case for further consideration. President Obama issued an Executive Order to close the Guantanamo detention facility within a year. The Obama Administration aimed to close the Guantanamo detention facility, but the deadline was not met. Legal challenges could arise if detainees are brought to the US, where they may have more constitutional protections. The government announced a new standard for detaining terrorist suspects in 2009. The Obama Administration announced a new standard for detaining terrorist suspects in 2009, no longer using the term \"enemy combatant.\" The new standard allows for the detention of members of Taliban, Al Qaeda, and associated forces, as well as those who provide substantial support to these groups. This standard does not rely on the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief independent of Congress's authorization. The scope of the Executive's detention authority has been the subject of ongoing litigation. In January 2010, a D.C. Circuit panel ruled in Al-Bihani v. Obama that support for an AUMF-targeted organization could justify military detention without proof of hostile acts. The panel applied the Bush Administration's standard, not the slightly more limited Obama Administration's standard, and disregarded the relevance of international law. The impact of this ruling is still uncertain. As of March 2010, courts found 11 detainees lawfully held under the AUMF, while 33 were held without authorization. In January 2010, the Obama Administration completed an assessment of Guantanamo detainees, with 50 to be held without trial, 35 to be prosecuted, and others to be transferred. However, the transfer of 30 Yemeni detainees was stalled due to security concerns. Congress opposed bringing detainees to the US for detention or release. The report covers early judicial developments, court cases, and the Detainee Treatment Act. The report analyzes the Detainee Treatment Act, as affected by the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and 2009, and its impact on detainee-related litigation in federal court. It discusses the Supreme Court's Boumediene decision invalidating Congress's attempt to revoke habeas jurisdiction, along with remaining issues and subsequent developments. The Bush Administration determined in 2002 that Taliban detainees are covered by the Geneva Conventions, while Al Qaeda detainees are not. For more information on detainee legislation in the 111th Congress, refer to CRS Report R40754 and R41011. The Bush Administration deemed all detainees as \"unlawful enemy combatants\" and claimed the right to detain them without trial. The Supreme Court found issues with the procedural rules for military commissions. Petitioners included Australians and Kuwaitis. The petitioners, two Australians and twelve Kuwaitis, were held in military custody at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. The Bush Administration argued that aliens in military custody have no right to litigation. The Supreme Court distinguished Rasul from Johnson v. Eisentrager, finding authority for federal court jurisdiction in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The Supreme Court allowed habeas corpus petitions from detainees at Guantanamo Bay, regardless of their citizenship or the territory's sovereignty. Justice Kennedy argued for jurisdiction based on Guantanamo being a U.S. territory and detainees held without legal proceedings. The Court emphasized habeas corpus as a key tool to challenge executive detentions, even if the statute is not presumed to apply extraterritorially. The Supreme Court ruled that detainees at Guantanamo Bay, regardless of citizenship, can file habeas corpus petitions due to the U.S. jurisdiction and control over the territory. This decision distinguished their case from Eisentrager, allowing them to challenge their detention. The Supreme Court's ruling allows Guantanamo detainees to file habeas corpus petitions as they are not nationals of countries at war with the U.S. and have been imprisoned without access to any tribunal. The Court's decision also permits detainees to bring claims based on other statutes before a federal court, leaving some questions unanswered. The Supreme Court's ruling allows Guantanamo detainees to file habeas corpus petitions and bring claims based on other statutes before a federal court. The Court did not address whether detainees held by the U.S. military abroad in locations where the U.S. does not have full jurisdiction would have access to U.S. courts. The Hamdan opinion suggests that detainees overseas may petition for habeas relief in U.S. courts, but it could be challenging to prove statutory or constitutional violations. The Court did not decide on the merits of the petitions. The Supreme Court's ruling allows Guantanamo detainees to file habeas corpus petitions in federal court, describing their custody as a violation of the Constitution. Lower courts will determine issues such as detention authorization, detainee identity, and evidence requirements. The Court did not address Congress's ability to limit federal court jurisdiction over habeas petitions, but Boumediene suggests complete elimination is unlikely without justification. The Pentagon established procedures for Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) in response to Supreme Court decisions in 2004 related to \"enemy combatants.\" CSRTs confirmed the status of at least 520 enemy combatants, and any new detainees at Guantanamo Bay would go before a CSRT. The CSRTs do not determine the legality of enemy combatants, leading to concerns about the adequacy of CSRT determinations for military jurisdiction. The Pentagon established Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) to confirm the status of enemy combatants. Military commissions now need to determine if a defendant is an unlawful enemy combatant to have jurisdiction. CSRTs are administrative, allowing detainees to present evidence to show they do not meet the criteria of an \"enemy combatant.\" Each detainee is represented by a military officer and can choose to participate. The CSRTs are conducted by a military officer, not a JAG Corps member, and the government presents evidence presumed to be genuine. The tribunal must assess if any statements were coerced and consider all evidence, including that which may contradict the detainee's designation. Detainees may receive unclassified evidence summaries, and their personal representative can view classified information to assist the tribunal. The tribunal reviews evidence to determine detainee status as \"enemy combatant\" and may recommend release if no longer a threat or in the interest of the US and allies. A separate process for periodic detainee status reviews was announced in March 2002, similar to the CSRT process. The detainee's classification as an \"enemy combatant\" can be reviewed by a new CSRT if new information arises. The detainee's State of nationality may provide information on their behalf. Detainees at Guantanamo have the right to challenge their detention in federal courts, but the extent of their rights under the Geneva Conventions remains unclear. The Justice Department argued that the Johnson v. Eisentrager decision limits relief for detainees. The Court decision in Johnson v. Eisentrager limits relief for detainees, with some judges disagreeing on detainee rights. Important decisions prior to the 2006 MCA enactment, including Boumediene v. Bush and Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, were reversed by the Supreme Court. The Fourth Circuit case involving an alien is also discussed. The Supreme Court granted the government's request to transfer an alien detainee from military custody to civilian authorities to face criminal charges, vacating an earlier judgment and dismissing the case as moot. U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon agreed that the President had the authority to detain foreign enemy combatants under the 2001 AUMF. Seven detainees captured outside Afghanistan sought relief from detention at Guantanamo Bay. Judge Leon agreed with the government that non-resident aliens detained under the 2001 AUMF have no constitutional rights, and rejected the petitioners' argument that their arrest outside of Afghanistan meant they could not be considered enemy combatants. The court ruled that the 2001 AUMF grants the President broad authority to detain enemy combatants without geographical limitations. The detainees were unable to argue violations of the Geneva Conventions or other treaties due to their non-self-executing nature. Judge Leon emphasized the limited role of the courts in cases involving non-resident aliens during ongoing armed conflicts, dismissing all seven petitions. The court dismissed all seven petitions, stating that there is no viable legal theory under international law for a federal court to issue a writ. On appeal, the Khalid case was combined with In re Guantanamo Detainee Cases as Boumediene v. Bush. U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green interpreted Rasul more broadly, affirming detainees' rights under the U.S. Constitution and international treaties, denying the government's motion to dismiss 11 challenges. Judge Green ruled that detainees are entitled to due process under the Fifth Amendment, finding that the CSRT procedures do not meet that standard. Judge Green rejected the government's argument that the CSRTs provided sufficient due process for detainees, citing two main defects: lack of access to material evidence and denial of assistance of counsel. This deprived detainees of a meaningful opportunity to challenge the evidence presented against them. Judge Green found that the CSRTs' handling of torture accusations and the broad definition of \"enemy combatant\" could violate detainees' due process rights. She objected to the definition as it could include individuals who never directly supported hostilities against the U.S. or its allies, making evidence unreliable and inadmissible. Judge Green criticized the broad definition of \"enemy combatant\" as it could include individuals who never directly supported hostilities against the U.S. or its allies. She argued that indefinite detention based solely on contacts with terrorist organizations would violate due process, even if authorized by the AUMF. This case was consolidated with the Khalid decision and heard as Boumediene v. Bush by the D.C. Circuit Court. Salim Ahmed Hamdan challenged the lawfulness of the Secretary of Defense's plan to try him for alleged war crimes before a military commission. U.S. District Judge Robertson ruled in his favor, stating that the military commission rules did not comply with existing statutory authority and that the Geneva Conventions apply to the conflict in Afghanistan, protecting all persons detained. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling in favor of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, stating that the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable. Judge Williams interpreted Common Article 3 to apply to conflicts with non-state actors regardless of geographical confinement. The Circuit Court also determined that military commission rules only need to be consistent with UCMJ articles specific to military commissions. After the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision, Congress passed the DTA, revoking federal court jurisdiction over Guantanamo detainees' habeas corpus petitions. The Supreme Court disagreed with Congress, asserting its jurisdiction to review such challenges. The Court also rejected the government's argument to dismiss the appeal based on military tribunal proceedings. The Supreme Court asserted its jurisdiction to review Guantanamo detainees' habeas corpus petitions, rejecting Congress's attempt to revoke federal court jurisdiction. The Court also found that the Geneva Conventions were brought within the scope of law to be applied by courts, despite the government's argument to dismiss the case. Justice Scalia, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito, dissented, arguing that the DTA should preclude the Court's review. The Supreme Court disagreed with the government's position on the authorization of military commissions, stating that the AUMF and DTA did not specifically authorize them. The Court recognized the President's war powers but did not see them as expanded beyond what was allowed by the UCMJ. The habeas corpus statute allows detainees to challenge their detention based on violations of laws, the Constitution, or treaties. The D.C. Circuit, however, held that the Geneva Conventions are relevant. The Supreme Court disagreed with the government's position on military commissions, stating that the Geneva Conventions are enforceable in federal courts. The Conventions are applicable as incorporated by UCMJ Article 21, providing protections even to members of Al Qaeda. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies, ensuring minimum protections for detainees. The Supreme Court found that the military commissions under M.C.O. No. 1 did not meet the criteria of being \"regularly constituted\" as required by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Justice Alito, Scalia, and Thomas dissented, arguing for deference to the President's interpretation. The Court declared the commissions under President Bush's Military Order to be \"illegal.\" The Supreme Court deemed President Bush's Military Order for military commissions to be illegal, suggesting changes to bring them in line with the law of war. The decision did not clarify the constitutional rights of detainees held outside U.S. territory. This ruling may impact the treatment of detainees in interrogations and trials, emphasizing the humane treatment required by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. The Supreme Court's decision on President Bush's Military Order deemed it illegal and suggested changes to align with the law of war. The Court emphasized the protection of detainees from violence, torture, and degrading treatment, extending these rights to non-citizens held overseas. The scope of relevant armed conflict remains unclear, with decisions limited to cases from hostilities in Afghanistan. The Supreme Court's decision on President Bush's Military Order emphasized the role of all three branches in protecting individual liberties during times of conflict. Justices applied Justice Jackson's framework, giving deference to the President with congressional authority. Differing views were based on interpretations of the AUMF and congressional acts regarding executive actions. The Military Commissions Act resolves issues on the President's authority to try detainees. The case of Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, a lawful alien resident detained in the US, raised unresolved questions on AUMF detainment. The Fourth Circuit initially ruled in favor of the petitioner but later reversed en banc. The Supreme Court vacated the en banc opinion after the petitioner was charged with a federal crime. Al-Marri, a Qatari student, was arrested in December 2001 in Peoria, IL, and held as a material witness for the 9/11 attacks. He was later charged with financial fraud and making false statements before being declared an \"enemy combatant\" and transferred to military custody in South Carolina. His habeas corpus petition challenging his designation was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In March 2005, Judge Floyd agreed with the government that al-Marri's detention was authorized by the AUMF. The case was transferred to a federal magistrate to examine the factual allegations supporting the government's detention of al-Marri as an enemy combatant. The government claimed al-Marri was associated with Al Qaeda and sent to the U.S. as a \"sleeper agent\" to facilitate terrorist activities. The magistrate judge recommended dismissing the petition based on the government's information, which al-Marri did not rebut. The district judge adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendations in full, rejecting the petitioner's argument that his capture away from a foreign battlefield precluded his designation as an \"enemy combatant.\" Al-Marri appealed, and the government moved to dismiss on the basis that section 7 of the 2006 MCA stripped the court of jurisdiction. The majority of the appellate panel found that al-Marri does not meet the statutory definition as an alien who \"has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.\" The majority ruled that al-Marri is not an \"enemy combatant\" under the AUMF or the law of war, and can only be held if charged with a crime, deported, obtained a material witness warrant, or detained under the USA PATRIOT Act. They rejected the government's argument that the President has the authority to order military detention within the U.S. based on the AUMF or inherent constitutional power. The court interpreted the Hamdi decision differently from the government's position. The court interpreted Hamdi and Padilla cases as confirming that the AUMF authorizes detention of individuals involved in armed conflict against the US in specific circumstances, similar to the Ex parte Quirin case involving enemy belligerents. The court ruled that eight German saboteurs could be tried by military commission as enemy belligerents, contrasting with the civilian status of al-Marri similar to Ex parte Milligan. Judge Hudson dissented, citing the broad language of the AUMF in authorizing the President to use force against those involved in the 9/11 attacks. The Fourth Circuit full bench rejected the earlier panel's decision in favor of the government's position that al-Marri fit the legal definition of \"enemy combatant,\" but also reversed the district court's decision that al-Marri was not entitled to present more evidence. Four judges argued against expanding the definition of \"enemy combatant\" beyond law-of-war principles. Judge Traxler's opinion supports remanding for evidentiary proceedings to place the burden on the Government to show due process protections are not burdensome. He agrees that the AUMF grants the President power to detain enemy combatants like al-Marri, including those associated with al Qaeda entering the US for hostile acts. Judge Traxler's opinion supports remanding for evidentiary proceedings to place the burden on the Government to show due process protections are not burdensome. He agrees that the AUMF grants the President power to detain enemy combatants like al-Marri, including those associated with al Qaeda entering the US for hostile acts. The definition of an enemy combatant includes individuals who align themselves with al Qaeda and travel to the United States for the purpose of engaging in terrorism, even if they did not take up arms against the country in a foreign combat zone. American citizens arrested in the US could also be treated as enemy combatants under similar circumstances. Judge Traxler did not believe al-Marri had been given due process to challenge his designation as an enemy combatant. He disagreed with the use of hearsay evidence to prove enemy combatant status. Judge Traxler disagreed with the relaxed evidentiary standards for individuals arrested in the US as enemy combatants. He believed that al-Marri, who was detained in the US, is entitled to habeas review and due process protections under the Constitution. The court must consider the circumstances and burdens faced by the government in defending the habeas petition. The Supreme Court agreed to review the case in December 2008. In December 2008, the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of the Al-Marri ruling regarding the President's authority to detain terrorist suspects. President Obama later instructed officials to review al-Marri's detention, leading to criminal charges being brought against him for supporting Al Qaeda. The United States then moved for the Supreme Court to dismiss al-Marri's appeal as moot. The Supreme Court granted the government's request to transfer al-Marri from military to civilian custody for his criminal trial. The Fourth Circuit's judgment was vacated, and the case was remanded with instructions to dismiss it as moot. Al-Marri later pled guilty to conspiracy to support Al Qaeda in federal court and was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison. This dismissal means the President's legal authority to detain terrorist suspects in the US has not been definitively determined. The legal authority to militarily detain terrorist suspects apprehended in the United States remains unsettled. Al-Marri was transferred to civilian custody for trial, leaving no terrorist suspects in military detention in the US. The Supreme Court may need to address the President's military detention authority in the future. The Detainee Treatment Act requires uniform interrogation standards and prohibits cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of detainees. The Detainee Treatment Act prohibits cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of detainees and provides legal defense to U.S. officers. It also limits detainees' ability to challenge their treatment in court and was added as a compromise to allow flexibility in dealing with terrorism. The Detainee Treatment Act prohibits cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of detainees and provides legal defense to U.S. officers. It includes a modified version of the \"Graham-Levin Amendment,\" requiring the Defense Department to submit procedural rules for determining detainees' status to certain congressional committees. The amendment assesses the probative value of statements obtained from detainees and eliminates federal courts' statutory authority. The Graham-Levin Amendment eliminated federal courts' jurisdiction over habeas claims by aliens at Guantanamo Bay, but allowed limited appeals of status determinations. The Supreme Court invalidated the provision but stated that the DTA appellate process remains intact. The D.C. Circuit ruled that the DTA appellate procedure is no longer valid, leaving habeas petitions as the only means of seeking review of detention. The DTA also allowed appeals to the Court of Appeals for final sentences by military commissions. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) authorized trials of certain detainees by military commission and amended provisions regarding appellate review and habeas corpus jurisdiction. Congress enacted the legislation in response to the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan, which limited the scope of review in capital cases and cases with severe penalties. The Military Commissions Act of 2009 (2009 MCA) modified rules for military commissions to resemble courts-martial proceedings. The 2006 MCA expanded the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA) to apply to all aliens detained as enemy combatants worldwide. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit declared the DTA appellate procedures defunct. The DTA appellate procedures were declared defunct by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in light of the Supreme Court's Boumediene decision. Challenges must now be brought through habeas review instead. CSRT records are relevant to habeas determinations. Appeals from military commission decisions go to the Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR) for matters of law only. The 2009 MCA allows the circuit court to review the sufficiency of evidence used in commission verdicts. The 2006 MCA revoked U.S. courts' jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions by aliens in U.S. custody as enemy combatants. It replaced the habeas provision added by the DTA with language stating that no court shall have jurisdiction to hear an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by an alien detained by the U.S. who has been determined to be properly detained as an enemy combatant. The 2006 MCA revoked U.S. courts' jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions by aliens in U.S. custody as enemy combatants. It replaced the habeas provision added by the DTA with language stating that no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any other action against the United States or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of confinement of an alien who is or was detained by the United States and has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination. This amendment took effect on the date of its enactment, and applied to \"all cases, without exception, pending on or after the date of [enactment] which relate to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of detention of an alien detained by the United States since September 11, 2001.\" In Boumediene v. Bush, the Supreme Court held that MCA \u00a7 7 acted as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, and authorized Guantanamo detainees to petition federal district courts for habeas review of CSRT. The DTA appeals provision allowed Guantanamo detainees to petition federal district courts for habeas review of their combatant status. Aliens detained despite being determined not enemy combatants couldn't challenge their detention or treatment, but could raise these issues in a habeas petition. The extent of relief courts can grant under habeas review is being litigated, with disputes over the application of the Geneva Convention. The 2006 MCA restricts the use of Geneva Conventions in habeas or civil proceedings, but the 2009 MCA removed this restriction. The Geneva Conventions cannot be used as a basis for a private right of action by aliens in military commission proceedings. The 2009 MCA removed language stating that the military commission structure complies with Geneva Convention requirements. It also grants the President authority to interpret the Geneva Conventions, a power traditionally held by courts. This provision's intended effect is unclear, as Congress is generally prohibited from exercising powers allocated to another branch of government. The Supreme Court's finding on the effect of a presidential pardon and the potential violation of separation of powers by granting the President authority to interpret treaty violations. The main focus is on establishing the President's authority to issue interpretative regulations by Executive Order, but the context for this additional authority is unclear. One possible intent is for the President to interpret the Geneva Convention for diplomatic purposes, although this seems unlikely given the President's existing power in this area. The President's authority to interpret treaty violations and issue regulations by Executive Order is being discussed. One possible interpretation is to apply the Geneva Conventions to specific situations, but it is unclear how this would be significant. Another likely intent is to allow the President to establish standards of behavior for federal agency employees and agents through regulations. The 2006 MCA may authorize the President to issue regulations for agency personnel to comply with the Geneva Conventions, potentially amending existing procedures. The government moved to dismiss habeas petitions for Guantanamo Bay detainees and an enemy combatant in South Carolina after the MCA was enacted. The 2006 MCA allows for the detention of U.S. citizens as enemy belligerents without trial, raising concerns about habeas corpus rights. The 2009 MCA expanded military commission jurisdiction to alien \"unprivileged enemy belligerents.\" In 2004, the Supreme Court ruled in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld that the President can detain U.S. citizens as enemy combatants under the AUMF, with combatant status subject to due process. The definition of \"enemy combatant\" was limited to those involved in armed conflict in Afghanistan. The Fourth Circuit later applied this definition to a U.S. citizen arrested in the U.S. after returning from Afghanistan. The executive branch could detain a U.S. citizen as an enemy belligerent under the 2009 MCA, which does not explicitly limit its scope to aliens. The citizen could challenge their detention through habeas corpus, but would not be able to assert rights based on the Geneva Convention. U.S. citizens could be affected by the 2006 and 2009 MCAs. The 2006 and 2009 MCAs could impact U.S. citizens, even though they are not directly applicable to them. The definition of \"enemy belligerent\" in the 2009 MCA may only apply to alien unprivileged enemy belligerents for military commission trials. This interpretation raises questions about the broader application of the term \"enemy belligerent\" and \"enemy combatant\" to include only those directly involved in hostilities against the U.S. The 2006 and 2009 MCAs may impact U.S. citizens, despite not directly applying to them. The definition of \"enemy belligerent\" in the 2009 MCA may only pertain to alien unprivileged enemy belligerents for military commission trials, raising questions about its broader application. Congress has not specified procedures for determining if U.S. citizens are subject to detention as enemy belligerents. The D.C. Circuit ruled that detainees could only challenge their confinement via habeas corpus review, nullifying the judicial review system established under the DTA. Issues included access to classified information and attorneys' access to clients. The D.C. Circuit rejected the government's attempt to limit court review to CSRT records, stating access to all information authorized by the Secretary of Defense was necessary to assess evidence. Petitioners' request for discovery was denied for lack of need to challenge CSRT rulings. The court denied the petitioners' motion to appoint a special master and promised to implement guidelines for handling classified information. Counsel for the detainees were presumed to have a \"need to know\" government information except for highly sensitive details. The court rejected the government's proposal regarding unclassified information and agreed to review legal mail from attorneys to detainees. The government's request for rehearing was denied. The court denied the government's request for rehearing, suggesting new CSRTs to reconfirm detainees' status with relevant documents retained. The government objected to turning over classified information, citing risks and burden, but the court rejected this argument. The court denied the government's request for rehearing, suggesting new CSRTs to reconfirm detainees' status with relevant documents retained. The government objected to turning over classified information, citing risks and burden, but the court rejected this argument. The government sought expedited review at the Supreme Court, but the D.C. Circuit declined, reinstating its decisions in Bismullah I and Bismullah II. The government petitioned for a rehearing, arguing that the Supreme Court's ruling in Boumediene nullified the system of circuit court review established by the DTA. In Boumediene, the D.C. Circuit ruled that detainees could seek habeas review of their detention, rendering the circuit court review under the DTA obsolete. Judge Ginsburg emphasized that the DTA was meant to be the exclusive means for detainees to challenge their detention, not a supplement to habeas corpus. In the aftermath of Boumediene, Judge Ginsburg stated that the DTA can no longer function as intended by Congress for judicial review of detainees' claims. Bismullah was later determined not to be an enemy combatant and was repatriated to Afghanistan. Additionally, new information was provided to Husaifa Parhat's counsel regarding his CSRT record, leading to a separate motion filed with the D.C. Circuit. In June 2008, a three-judge panel ruled in Parhat v. Gates that Parhat had been improperly deemed an \"enemy combatant\" by a CSRT due to his affiliation with a Uighur independence group associated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The court's opinion contained classified information, and only a redacted version has been released. The Circuit Court ruled in Parhat v. Gates that Parhat's affiliation with the ETIM did not support his classification as an \"enemy combatant\" by the CSRT. Parhat denied membership in the ETIM and claimed he traveled to Afghanistan to resist China, not the United States. The CSRT's determination lacked evidence and did not meet DOD standards for Combatant Status Review Tribunals. The Circuit Court found that the evidence presented by the government was insufficient to support the determination that Parhat was an enemy combatant. The government failed to demonstrate that Parhat was part of or supporting forces associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. The court found that the government's evidence, four intelligence documents describing ETIM activities and its ties to Al Qaeda and the Taliban, lacked underlying reporting and reliability assessments. Therefore, the CSRT's designation of Parhat as an enemy combatant was deemed improper. The court emphasized that hearsay evidence could potentially be used, but the basis for factual assertions must be submitted for assessment. The court found the evidence presented to the CSRT insufficient to support Parhat's designation as an enemy combatant. The court declined to order his release but suggested the government hold another CSRT with additional evidence. The court noted a potential argument for implicit release authority in determining the government's actions. The circuit court found the evidence insufficient to support Parhat's enemy combatant designation and suggested a new CSRT with more evidence. It hinted at implicit release authority in assessing the government's actions. The court's ruling in Parhat allowing habeas relief in federal court may be affected by the subsequent Bismullah decision nullifying the DTA review process. The government no longer considers Uighur detainees at Guantanamo as enemy combatants, but they remain in custody awaiting transfer. Some have been successfully transferred to other countries, while others remain at Guantanamo. The Uighurs filed habeas petitions requesting release into the US, with a judge ordering their release in 2008. The government filed an emergency motion with the D.C. Circuit to stay Judge Urbina's ruling ordering the release of the Uighur detainees into the United States. The circuit court granted the government's motion for expedited review and issued a stay on the transfer of the Uighurs. In February 2009, the circuit panel reversed the district court's decision, stating that habeas did not entitle the petitioners to be released into the United States. The Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal regarding the release of detainees into the United States. Some detainees have been resettled, but five remain at Guantanamo. The Supreme Court vacated the appellate court's ruling and remanded the case to consider new circumstances. It is uncertain if the appellate court will uphold the habeas courts' authority to release detainees into the United States. The petitioners in Boumediene, aliens detained at Guantanamo, sought habeas review of their detention, challenging the constitutionality of the 2006 MCA's \"court-stripping\" provision. The D.C. Circuit affirmed that the 2006 MCA eliminated federal courts' jurisdiction over the petitioners' habeas applications, citing precedent from Al Odah v. United States and Johnson v. Eisentrager. The D.C. Circuit affirmed that the 2006 MCA's elimination of habeas jurisdiction for aliens held in foreign territory did not violate the Constitution's Suspension Clause. However, the Supreme Court later granted certiorari in the cases of Boumediene and Al Odah, ruling in a 5-4 opinion that the petitioners had a constitutional right to habeas that was withdrawn by the 2006 MCA. The petitioners in Boumediene argued that they have a constitutional right to habeas, which was deprived by the 2006 MCA. The government contended that aliens designated as enemy combatants and detained outside the US have no constitutional rights, including habeas. The Court analyzed the history of the writ of habeas corpus. The Court emphasized the importance of the writ of habeas corpus for protecting individual liberty and maintaining the balance of governance between branches. The Suspension Clause was seen as a vital instrument to prevent abuses by the executive and legislative branches. The Court's interpretation was informed by the separation-of-powers doctrine and historical context. The Court interpreted the Suspension Clause as having full effect at Guantanamo, disagreeing with the government's position on the extraterritorial application of the Constitution for non-citizens. The Court emphasized a functional approach in assessing constitutional rights in territories under US control, rejecting a formalistic reading of the Eisentrager ruling on habeas for enemy aliens detained abroad. The Court applied a framework to assess the extraterritorial scope of the Suspension Clause in the case, noting differences from the Eisentrager decision. The petitioners in this case denied being enemy combatants, unlike the detainees in Eisentrager. The Court found that the procedural protections for Guantanamo detainees are limited compared to Eisentrager detainees tried by military commission, falling short of eliminating the need for habeas corpus review. The case lacked historical parallels, with Guantanamo detainees held in prolonged conflict, raising questions about their rights under the U.S. Constitution. The Court found that Guantanamo detainees have limited procedural protections compared to Eisentrager detainees, raising questions about their constitutional rights. The Court concluded that the Suspension Clause applies at Guantanamo, and assessed whether the MCA provided an adequate substitute for habeas corpus. The government argued that the MCA's review process was a constitutionally adequate substitute, but the Court did not offer a comprehensive summary of what constitutes an adequate substitute for habeas corpus. The Court emphasized the importance of habeas corpus, stating that it entitles a prisoner to challenge their detention based on errors in the law. It also highlighted the need for a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate unlawful detention and the possibility of conditional release. The scope of habeas review may vary depending on previous proceedings, and identified deficiencies in the CSRT process that limit a detainee's ability to present evidence. The Court highlighted constraints on detainees' ability to challenge the government's case at the CSRT stage, lack of counsel assistance, limited access to classified records, and minimal ability to confront witnesses. While not determining if CSRTs meet due process standards, the Court acknowledged a significant risk of error in tribunal findings, especially given the potential long-term detention consequences. The Court emphasized the importance of an effective remedy for petitioners in collateral proceedings, listing requirements for correcting errors in the CSRT process, assessing evidence against detainees, and considering exculpatory evidence. It deemed the DTA review process inadequate as a substitute for habeas review, citing constitutional flaws such as the inability to order release, challenge indefinite detention, review CSRT findings, or present exculpatory evidence. The Court found that the 2006 MCA \u00a7 7's application of the DTA review process failed to provide an adequate substitute for habeas, resulting in an unconstitutional suspension of the writ. Petitioners were allowed to immediately pursue habeas review in federal district court without first obtaining review of their CSRT designations from the D.C. Circuit. The Court emphasized the need for a prompt habeas hearing due to the length of their detention, except in cases of undue delay. The Court emphasized the need for prompt habeas hearings for detainees held as enemy combatants, except in cases of undue delay. Federal courts should generally refrain from considering habeas petitions until after the CSRT reviews their status. The government's interest in protecting intelligence sources should be accommodated to avoid widespread dissemination of classified information. Detainees at Guantanamo can now petition for habeas review of their status determinations. The Boumediene ruling extends the constitutional writ of habeas to Guantanamo detainees, allowing them to seek judicial review of treatment, confinement conditions, and planned transfers. Military commission trials at Guantanamo may be impacted as enemy combatants can now raise constitutional arguments. Aliens convicted of war crimes may seek habeas review of their designation as enemy combatants by the CSRT. Boumediene found DTA review procedures inadequate as a substitute for habeas. The Boumediene ruling extended the writ of habeas to Guantanamo detainees, allowing them to challenge their detention. The District Court will review habeas claims of over 200 detainees, coordinating cases under Senior Judge Thomas F. Hogan. Senior Judge Thomas F. Hogan has been assigned to coordinate and manage Guantanamo cases expeditiously as required by the Supreme Court in Boumediene v. Bush. District Court Judges Richard J. Leon and Emmet G. Sullivan have declined to transfer their cases for coordination, potentially leading to differing opinions on common issues. Litigation on detainees' habeas claims is ongoing, with some detainees ordered for release. President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13492 on January 22, 2009, mandating the closure of the Guantanamo detention facility within a year. Detainees are to be transferred to third countries, released, or moved to another U.S. detention facility. Officials must review all detentions to determine further action, including potential prosecution for criminal offenses. The Executive Order mandated the closure of the Guantanamo detention facility within a year, requiring the review of detainees for potential prosecution. Despite efforts to close the facility, congressional measures have limited the transfer of detainees to the United States. The closure of the Guantanamo detention facility was mandated by an Executive Order, but congressional measures have restricted the transfer of detainees to the United States for release or prosecution. The legal implications of transferring detainees to the US, including constitutional protections, remain uncertain. The closure of the Guantanamo detention facility was mandated by an Executive Order, but congressional measures have restricted the transfer of detainees to the United States for release or prosecution. The legal implications of transferring detainees to the US, including constitutional protections, remain uncertain. However, detainees transferred to the United States may have better legal grounds to challenge aspects of their detention that violate constitutional rights. In 2009, the Obama Administration introduced a new standard for detaining terrorist suspects without using the term \"enemy combatant.\" This new definition gives the President the authority to detain individuals involved in planning, authorizing, or committing terrorist acts. The President has the authority to detain individuals involved in planning, authorizing, or aiding terrorist attacks, as well as those who supported Taliban or al-Qaida forces. The Obama Administration's standard for detaining terrorist suspects is similar to the Bush Administration's \"enemy combatant\" definition. There are some differences in the approach to detaining members of the Taliban or Al Qaeda, regardless of their capture location. The Obama Administration's standard for detaining terrorist suspects requires \"substantial support\" for Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces, unlike the Bush Administration's broader criteria. This standard is based on the AUMF and does not solely rely on the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief. The Obama Administration's standard for detaining terrorist suspects requires \"substantial support\" for Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces, based on the AUMF. The Administration will not rely on inherent constitutional authority for detention, raising questions about the Executive's authority under the AUMF and traditional law-of-war principles. The scope of detention authority and defining \"substantial support\" may face judicial scrutiny. The Executive's detention authority under the AUMF and the law of war has been subject to conflicting rulings in the D.C. Circuit. In 2009, habeas courts reached different conclusions regarding the scope of the President's military detention authority, with some judges holding that the Executive can detain persons who were \"part of\" or \"substantially supported\" Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces. Other judges held that the Executive has authority to detain persons who were \"part of\" the Taliban, Al Qaeda, or associated forces, but lacks authority to detain non-members who provide \"support\" to such organizations. In January 2010, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals endorsed the Executive's detention authority standard, allowing the President to detain individuals who were \"part of or supporting Taliban or al Qaeda forces.\" The court stated that support or membership in a targeted organization could justify detention, without exploring the full extent of what constitutes support. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals endorsed the Executive's detention authority standard in January 2010, allowing the detention of individuals supporting Taliban or al Qaeda forces. The court did not fully explore the extent of what constitutes support, but noted that sufficient indicia of membership could justify detention. The panel's standard will be controlling for the D.C. Circuit unless overturned by higher courts or Congress. The Supreme Court decision in Boumediene found that the DTA violates the Constitution's Suspension Clause, leaving open constitutional questions on habeas corpus and detention rules for suspected terrorists. Habeas Corpus allows detainees to challenge their detention, with proposals for responding to Boumediene and constitutional considerations discussed. The habeas corpus writ allows detainees to challenge their detention by asking a court to explain the legal basis for their imprisonment. It is used to challenge executive detention without trial or bail and to address violations of constitutional rights. The court reviews the legality of the detention and the custodian's authority, not the guilt or innocence of the detainee. If the detention is unlawful, the detainee must be released. The Constitution allows for addressing trial irregularities on direct appeal, with the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus not to be suspended except in cases of public safety. The distinction between statutory and constitutional entitlement to habeas corpus complicates matters, as seen in the Boumediene case. The relevance of this distinction is not entirely clear. The distinction between statutory and constitutional entitlement to habeas corpus is unclear. The Constitution mandates Congress to provide efficient means for the Writ, but the scope of the writ's protection remains uncertain. Boumediene Court did not establish a specific date for judging the constitutional scope of the writ. It is uncertain if statutory enhancements of habeas review can be rolled back without violating the Suspension Clause. The Boumediene Court's opinion on the scope of the writ of habeas corpus suggests that Congress can impose procedural regulations but cannot completely revoke courts' jurisdiction over habeas petitions. Congress can withdraw habeas jurisdiction if an alternative means of relief is provided, ensuring prisoners have a meaningful opportunity to challenge their detention. The lower bounds of what constitutes a constitutional scope of the writ or an adequate substitute were not fully defined in the Court's opinion. A potential solution to affect the outcome of habeas cases brought by detainees could involve enacting a clear statutory definition of who may be detained and the purpose of the detention, along with a procedure to distinguish those who meet the definition. This approach may increase certainty in courts' decisions regarding the detention of alleged enemy combatants, although constitutionally based claims may still be unpredictable. Congress could suspend the writ for detainees, but it is uncertain if Congress's views on public safety requirements are justiciable. A reviewing court's assessment of the constitutionality of habeas-suspending legislation would likely be crucial. The court's assessment of the constitutionality of habeas-suspending legislation would likely focus on whether Al Qaeda's attacks qualify as a \"rebellion or invasion\" and if \"public safety\" justifies the suspension. Congress could limit judicial review of CSRT determinations by improving procedural protections for detainees. Attorney General Michael Mukasey suggested making habeas corpus the sole avenue for detainees to challenge their detention in civilian court and eliminating challenges to conditions of confinement or transfers out of U.S. custody. Attorney General Mukasey suggested limiting detainees' ability to challenge their detention in civilian court and preventing challenges to conditions of confinement or transfers out of U.S. custody. He also proposed prohibiting courts from ordering detainees to be brought to the U.S. for court proceedings and protecting intelligence information from disclosure to terrorist suspects. Additionally, he recommended delaying habeas petitions for detainees awaiting trial by military commission and reaffirming the authority to detain enemy combatants. Congress should establish procedures for habeas challenges by assigning one district court exclusive jurisdiction, adopting rules balancing detainees' rights and national security, and ensuring court proceedings do not interfere with the military mission. Other proposals include creating a national security court for preventive detention or using civilian/military courts to prosecute detainees unable to be released. The issue of prosecuting detainees in civilian court is complex due to jurisdictional limitations. Congress could either enact legislation to guide the courts or allow them to address the habeas petitions already docketed. The courts will need to determine the scope of the writ as it applies to detainees in Guantanamo and potentially elsewhere outside the United States. The Supreme Court identified deficiencies in the status review process at Guantanamo that necessitated habeas review of CSRT determinations, including lack of counsel, limitations on presenting evidence, and confronting witnesses. The district court will review habeas claims of Guantanamo detainees challenging the legality of detention and conditions of their confinement. The unresolved question of which constitutional rights apply to aliens detained abroad may impact the scope of challenges detainees can bring. The unresolved question of which constitutional rights apply to aliens detained abroad may impact the scope of challenges detainees can bring, especially if transferred to the United States. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the need for a judicial forum to vindicate all constitutional rights, but effective judicial remedies must generally be available in cases involving specific rights. The extent of constitutional rights for aliens outside the US remains a topic of debate. The right to liberty for aliens in the United States is well established, except when deprived of it through due process of law. Habeas challenges may allow detainees to challenge detention beyond just the adequacy of CSRT procedures. There is no requirement for detainees to receive a CSRT determination or a hearing within a certain period of time, potentially leaving some without effective means to challenge their detention. Some Guantanamo detainees released without new determination, raising questions about CSRT procedure importance. Detainees may also be transferred based on ARB reviews without appeal opportunity. Habeas review scope and standard for detainees subject to U.S. District Court orders. In U.S. District Court orders, the government must justify detainees' detention with evidence and disclose any relied upon information, including exculpatory evidence. Judge Hogan's order also covers handling of classified information. Judge Hogan's order requires the government to provide classified information to the petitioner's counsel if cleared, with no requirement to provide it to the petitioner himself. The order rescinds the need for an \"adequate substitute\" for disclosed classified information. In a previous case, the D.C. Circuit panel ruled that procedural protections for wartime detainees in habeas cases do not have to mirror those in traditional criminal law. In habeas cases involving challenges to wartime detention, a lower procedural standard may exist as national security interests are paramount. The government only needs to support detention with a \"preponderance of evidence\" standard. Habeas courts can consider hearsay evidence in assessing detention validity. The question is not the admissibility of hearsay but the weight of its reliability. Although challenges to prison conditions are less common under habeas review, federal courts have heard such cases. In federal prisons, individuals can seek relief through district courts using writs of mandamus to address complaints related to the Constitution. These challenges, based on various grounds including the First, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments, are often denied on procedural or merit-based grounds. The Boumediene Court did not address whether challenges to detention conditions fall within the constitutional scope of the writ for Guantanamo detainees. The scope of the writ as it applies to Guantanamo detainees includes challenges regarding conditions of detention, such as solitary confinement, transfers, and contact with relatives. Guantanamo detainees have used the All Writs Act to seek relief from the courts, particularly to prevent their transfer to other countries without notice. The use of the All Writs Act is considered an extraordinary remedy and is generally not invoked if there is an alternative remedy available. In April 2009, a D.C. Circuit panel interpreted Boumediene as invalidating the MCA's court-stripping provisions with respect to all habeas claims brought by Guantanamo detainees. The D.C. Circuit panel found that Guantanamo detainees could challenge their proposed transfer to another country in habeas courts, but challenges to conditions of confinement have been rejected. The rejection may be due to the belief that such claims do not stem from constitutional protections. In Kiyemba v. Obama, it was held that non-citizens were not entitled to due process protections under the Constitution. The Supreme Court vacated the appellate court's opinion in Kiyemba v. Obama and remanded the case for further consideration. The appellate court may reaffirm its ruling on the Constitution's application to Guantanamo detainees. If detainees are transferred to the US, they may have more ability to challenge their detention conditions. Detainees transferred to the US from Guantanamo may have better legal grounds to challenge aspects of their detention that violate constitutional rights. The court conducting habeas review can order parties to provide more information, hold hearings, and grant appropriate remedies. In contrast, the DTA review procedures do not address remedies for successful challenges. Detainees who prevail in a challenge may not have an express right to release or be informed of the decision. If deemed no longer an enemy combatant, they can be held until arrangements for transfer are made. New CSRTs may be convened without detainee participation, and the lack of court power to order release is a concern under the DTA. The government suggested that remand for new CSRT proceedings could be the appropriate remedy for errors of law or new evidence. The ongoing litigation concerns the available remedy for unlawfully held Guantanamo detainees, typically resulting in release. However, practical challenges arise in effectuating detainee transfers from the military facility in Cuba. The Supreme Court has recognized that habeas relief is an equitable remedy, and judges have discretion to craft appropriate remedies. In the immigration context, courts acknowledge the political branches' authority over entry into the US. A federal court previously ordered the release of Guantanamo detainees into the US when no longer considered enemy combatants, balancing political authority with detainees' right to an effective remedy for unauthorized detention. The D.C. Circuit panel reversed a district court's decision in the case of Kiyemba v. Obama, stating that federal courts lacked the authority to order a non-citizen detainee's entry and release into the United States. The majority opinion cited Supreme Court jurisprudence recognizing the political branches' exclusive power over immigration decisions. The Kiyemba majority held that the district court lacked the legal authority to override the Executive's determination not to admit the petitioners into the United States. They also found that aliens held at Guantanamo were not protected by the Due Process Clause of the Constitution, and the district court's order could not be based on a liberty interest owed to the petitioners under the Constitution. The majority stated that the district court's order was improper as it was based on the notion that where there is a legal right, there must also be a remedy, which they believed did not reflect federal statutory or constitutional law. The Kiyemba majority held that the constitutional writ of habeas did not entitle Guantanamo detainees to be transferred and released into the United States, contrary to Judge Rogers' argument that this compromised the Great Writ as a check on arbitrary detention. She believed the Executive has no independent authority to detain aliens to prevent their entry into the US and that a habeas court can order conditional release of a detainee into the US when the Executive lacks such authority. The Supreme Court vacated the appellate court's opinion on the conditional release of Guantanamo detainees into the United States, remanding the case after some detainees were resettled in foreign countries. The Supreme Court remanded a case involving Guantanamo detainees back to the D.C. Circuit to review new developments. The Court had previously ruled in Boumediene that the writ of habeas applies to Guantanamo detainees, but the extent of constitutional protections for aliens detained in other foreign locations remains unresolved. In April 2009, a federal court ruled that the writ of habeas applies to some detainees at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. The Boumediene Court considers practical concerns in deciding the extraterritorial application of the writ, including the degree of U.S. control over the detainee's location and the costs and impact of habeas proceedings on military missions. The Boumediene Court considered practical concerns in deciding the extraterritorial application of the writ of habeas, including U.S. control over detainee location and impact on military missions. In April 2009, a federal court ruled that the writ of habeas may extend to non-Afghan detainees held at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. The ruling in Al Maqaleh extended the writ of habeas corpus to non-U.S. citizens detained outside of Afghanistan at Bagram, similar to Boumediene detainees. The writ applied to three petitioners, not Afghan citizens, but not to the fourth petitioner to avoid friction with the Afghan government. This decision is under appeal and could have significant implications if upheld. The ruling in Al Maqaleh extended habeas corpus to non-U.S. citizens at Bagram. The DOD announced changes to the review process for detainees at Bagram, granting them more rights. The possibility of detainees challenging military commission jurisdiction before trial is still uncertain. The Executive's policy of detaining wartime captives and suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay has raised legal questions about the powers of the President, Congress, and the courts. The Detainee Treatment Act was Congress's first attempt to limit these powers. The Detainee Treatment Act (DTA) was Congress's initial attempt to restrict the President's actions in the \"Global War on Terror\" and limit the role of the courts. The Supreme Court's decision to strike down the DTA provision regarding habeas jurisdiction suggests ongoing court involvement in Guantanamo detainee cases. However, the Court left open the possibility for Congress to implement measures to streamline habeas proceedings for terrorism-related detainees, considering relevant circumstances and exigencies. The courts rejected the Bush Administration's claim of inherent presidential authority to detain suspected individuals involved in international activities. The courts have interpreted the AUMF to determine presidential power in detaining individuals suspected of international terrorism. The Supreme Court upheld the detention of a \"narrow category\" of enemy belligerents, while other courts have considered a broader definition. However, a plurality of the Supreme Court warned against novel interpretations that could unravel permissible executive actions. The potential transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States could lead to increased constitutional protections for them, impacting executive policy, legislative proposals, and judicial decisions regarding their treatment and access to federal courts. If the detentions are found to be supported by statutory authorization, the key issue will be whether they comply with due process under the Constitution. Congress may need to consider legislation to support the executive branch's authority in the \"war on terror.\""
