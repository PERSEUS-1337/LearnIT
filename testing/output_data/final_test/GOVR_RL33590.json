    "content": "The Obama Administration's special envoy, Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, visited Pyongyang in December 2009 to secure North Korean commitments to resume nuclear negotiations and implement a 2005 agreement. Despite reaching some common understandings, specific commitments were not achieved during the two-day negotiations. North Korea indicated willingness to renew six party talks but not for negotiations, seeking bilateral meetings with the United States first. Topics discussed include a Korean peace agreement, normalization of diplomatic relations, economic and energy aid, and denuclearization. North Korea emphasized the importance of a peace treaty with the United States to demonstrate a reversal of hostile policies. This was highlighted during discussions on the normalization of diplomatic relations, economic aid, and denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. North Korea emphasized the importance of a peace treaty with the United States to demonstrate a reversal of hostile policies. South Korea's Foreign Minister stated that North Korean negotiators called for an end to U.S. and UN sanctions. The Obama Administration's position on a peace treaty involves North Korea taking irreversible steps towards denuclearization first. North Korea wants the denuclearization issue to be part of U.S.-North Korean peace treaty negotiations. The Obama Administration, like the Bush Administration, did not express willingness to negotiate on U.S. military forces as part of denuclearization talks with North Korea. Bosworth secured a commitment from North Korea to discuss their uranium enrichment program in future negotiations. North Korea admitted to having a uranium enrichment program in 2009. Bill Clinton secured the release of two American women imprisoned in North Korea. The Obama Administration had reached an agreement with North Korea prior to the release. The Obama Administration had used intermediaries to negotiate an agreement with North Korea prior to Bill Clinton's trip. North Korean media reported that Clinton apologized for the women's actions and delivered a message from President Obama to Kim Jong-il during their meeting. The White House denied the apology and message delivery. President Clinton's mission to North Korea in 2009 occurred amidst deteriorating U.S.-North Korean relations following North Korea's second nuclear bomb test. The bomb was estimated to have an explosive power of four to five kilotons, showing technical advances over their first test in 2006. North Korea's second nuclear test in 2009 showed technical advances over the first test. Following this, North Korea withdrew from six-party talks due to criticism from the UN Security Council for testing a long-range missile. The Security Council called for sanctions enforcement, while North Korea claimed the missile test was for launching a satellite. North Korea's missile test was a legitimate satellite launch into space. Prior to the test, North Korea warned of withdrawing from six-party talks if the Security Council took action against it. The announcement on April 13, 2009, stated an absolute rejection of the talks, threatening to restore nuclear facilities and reprocess nuclear fuel rods. This move indicated a more severe stance compared to previous boycotts of the talks. North Korea's Yongbyon facilities were shut down in mid-2007 as part of agreements with the Bush Administration. By early 2009, the disablement process was 80% completed. North Korea expelled technicians and monitors from the US and the International Atomic Energy Agency. There were signs of the reprocessing plant operating, capable of producing enough plutonium for one atomic bomb within four to six months. North Korea's ability to restart the plutonium reprocessing plant is a concern, as they could produce enough plutonium for one atomic bomb. Reassembling the nuclear reactor and fuel fabrication plant would take up to a year. North Korea also threatened to enrich uranium, another method to produce atomic bombs. The Obama Administration responded by seeking a U.N. Security Council resolution. The Obama Administration responded to North Korea's nuclear test by seeking a U.N. Security Council resolution. On June 12, 2009, Resolution 1874 was approved, imposing sanctions on North Korea including a ban on financial transactions related to weapons of mass destruction. This ban targets North Korea's state trading companies involved in transferring WMD technology and foreign exchange earnings. The U.S. officials emphasized the importance of freezing bank accounts to shut down these transactions. The Obama Administration is focusing on enforcing the ban on financial transactions related to weapons of mass destruction in discussions with other governments regarding Resolution 1874. In July 2009, Ambassador Philip Goldberg and Undersecretary of the Treasury Stuart Levey visited China, Malaysia, and Russia to coordinate sanctions against North Korea. The Security Council designated sanctions on North Korean trading companies, an Iran-based company, a North Korean bank, and officials in line with Resolution 1874. The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on one North Korean trading company in late June 2009. In late June 2009, sanctions were imposed on the North Korean trading company Namchongang Trading Corporation and the Iran-based Hong Kong Electronics. The U.S. Treasury Department targeted 17 North Korean trading companies and banks for sanctions. A Chinese firm halted construction of a joint copper mine with North Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation. U.N. member states are urged to search ships suspected of carrying North Korea-related weapons or WMD technology. If a suspect ship is on the high seas, member states are called upon to request the right to board and inspect. Resolution 1874 obligates the flag state of a suspect ship to direct the vessel to a nearby port for inspection and authorizes the seizure of banned items. The resolution prohibits bunkering services for ships with suspected cargo and requires cooperation from China and Southeast Asian states. Enforcement involves the U.S. Navy and the search of air cargo is less detailed compared to sea-borne cargo. Many experts believe North Korea uses air traffic more than sea. Many experts believe North Korea heavily relies on air traffic to transfer WMD, technology, and scientists. The key to inspecting North Korea's air cargo lies in the air traffic between North Korea and Iran, who collaborate on ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads. North Korea earns $1.5 billion annually from missile sales, with Iran being a major customer. Iran, Syria, and possibly Burma are involved in air traffic for the transfer of missiles and WMD technology. North Korea and Iran use the Pyongyang-Tehran air route for mutual visits of nuclear and missile officials. China plays a key role in searches of aircraft on this route. Obama Administration officials raised the air traffic issue with Chinese officials in 2009. The Obama Administration is cautious in searching for North Korea-related cargos, requiring evidence of weapons and WMDs. Three key developments since August 2008 have influenced the situation, including the failure to complete agreements with North Korea, Kim Jong-il's stroke, and the emergence of a collective leadership in North Korea. These factors continue to shape the Obama Administration's strategy towards the North Korean nuclear issue. The Bush Administration negotiated agreements with North Korea between February 2007 and October 2008, aiming to disable North Korea's plutonium installations at Yongbyon. North Korea issued tough negotiating demands for future nuclear negotiations with the United States after January 1, 2009. The agreements were not fully implemented by the October 31, 2008 deadline. The Bush Administration negotiated agreements with North Korea between February 2007 and October 2008 to disable North Korea's plutonium installations at Yongbyon. However, the agreements were not fully implemented due to a dispute over a verification system, specifically inspectors' rights to examine nuclear materials at Yongbyon. On June 26, 2008, measures were taken to implement the agreements, which included obligations for both North Korea and the Bush Administration. The shutting down of Yongbyon was a key provision of the 1994 Agreed Framework negotiated by the Clinton Administration. Between 1994 and 2002, Yongbyon ceased operations, but in 2002, the Bush Administration suspended U.S. obligations under the Agreed Framework due to concerns about North Korea's secret nuclear weapons program. North Korea restarted Yongbyon, producing weapons-grade plutonium until 2007 when the disablement process began. As of February 2009, 6,100 of 8,000 spent fuel rods had been removed from the reactor. As of February 2009, 6,100 of 8,000 spent fuel rods had been removed from North Korea's reactor. North Korea declared 30.8 kilograms of plutonium, but U.S. intelligence estimates suggest they have accumulated 50 to 60 kilograms. Other components of North Korea's nuclear programs were reportedly omitted from the declaration. North Korea's declaration lacks details on the number of atomic bombs, facilities for production and testing, and storage locations. It does not address the reported uranium enrichment program or nuclear collaboration with Iran and Syria. The confidential minute mentions these issues but North Korea does not admit to them. The U.S. obligations were to remove North Korea from the Trading with the Enemy Act and state sponsors of terrorism list. Removal from the Trading with the Enemy Act and the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism could allow U.S. companies to trade with North Korea and potentially invest in the country. This move may also grant North Korea access to frozen assets in the U.S. and remove restrictions on financial aid from international agencies. However, due to North Korea's economic system and distrust of foreign involvement, significant trade or investment relations with the U.S. seem unlikely to develop. North Korea sought removal from the terrorism support list to secure financial aid and improve diplomatic relations with the U.S. It also aimed to reduce U.S. support for Japan on the kidnapping issue and limit scrutiny of its activities in the Middle East. Numerous reports indicate North Korea's activities in the Middle East, including providing training and weapons to Hezbollah and collaborating with Iran on missiles and nuclear weapons. The first U.S.-North Korean agreement in 2007 obligated five other parties to provide North Korea with heavy fuel oil in exchange for disabling Yongbyon. North Korea submitted its nuclear program declaration in 2008. President Bush announced the removal of North Korea from the Trading with the Enemy Act and the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Congress was notified of the intent to remove North Korea, conditioned on their acceptance of U.S. verification of their nuclear programs. The six parties set a target date for further talks. On July 12, 2008, the six parties set a target date of October 31, 2008, for the disablement of Yongbyon and delivery of fuel oil. The Bush Administration did not remove North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism on August 11, 2008. North Korea rejected a draft protocol on verification of its nuclear programs, leading to a halt in the disablement process at Yongbyon. Following the U.S.-North Korean meeting at Singapore, the Bush Administration sought supplemental agreements with North Korea for verification mechanisms regarding its plutonium stockpile. In May 2008, an accord was negotiated for North Korea to provide over 18,000 documents on its plutonium program dating back to 1986. U.S. experts are currently examining these documents with no significant findings disclosed yet. The White House announced on June 26, 2008, that North Korea's removal from the terrorism support list would occur after 45 days. The Bush Administration negotiated verification mechanisms with North Korea regarding its plutonium stockpile. An agreement was reached in July 2008 on verification principles, including visits to facilities and interviews with technical personnel. Verification activities would be carried out by experts of the six parties, with the International Atomic Energy Agency playing an advisory role. The scope of verification proposals was scaled back after North Korea announced a restart of plutonium reprocessing. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill negotiated verification measures in Pyongyang in October 2008. In October 2008, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill negotiated a verification deal with North Korea focusing on inspections at Yongbyon. North Korea agreed to resume disablement, leading to the Bush Administration removing North Korea from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. The verification agreement included access to declared sites at Yongbyon and non-declared sites by mutual consent, with the inspection organization composed of the five non-North Korean members of the six-party talks making decisions unanimously. The verification agreement negotiated by Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill with North Korea focused on inspections at Yongbyon. The agreement included access to declared and non-declared sites by mutual consent, with decisions made unanimously by the inspection organization. Issues arose regarding inspectors' ability to take samples for laboratory analysis, with North Korea insisting on only abiding by the written agreement. Another aspect of Hill's talks was his meeting with North Korean Lt. General Lee Chan-bok. At a meeting with North Korean Lt. General Lee Chan-bok, the first of its kind, bilateral military talks were proposed. However, details of the meeting were not disclosed. Attempts to reach a compromise on the sampling issue at a six-party meeting in December 2008 were unsuccessful, leading to a slowdown in the disablement process and fuel aid delivery to North Korea. As a result, the disablement process was only 80% complete by January 2009 when the Bush Administration left office. In August 2008, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il suffered a severe stroke, leading to uncertainty about his health and control in North Korea. Reports suggest he has been battling various ailments since 2000, including heart, liver, kidney problems, and possibly pancreatic cancer. Kim Jong-il was seen frail and aged in April and June 2009, showing signs of paralysis in an arm and leg. Kim Jong-il showed signs of paralysis in an arm and leg, leading to speculation about his health. Despite reports of illness, he appeared in charge during a meeting with President Clinton in August 2009. There were rumors of a collective leadership group taking over decision-making, with Kim's brother-in-law possibly playing a key role. If Kim is incapacitated or dies, a collective leadership could remain in place as none of his sons are ready to succeed him immediately. In the aftermath of Kim Jong-il's stroke, his youngest son Kim Jong-un was named as his successor. The North Korean military took on a more prominent role in policy implementation and decision-making. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill negotiated with a North Korean General on the nuclear issue for the first time. South Korean businessmen in Kaesong dealt with military officials instead of civilians. The military leadership indicated they would control decisions on the nuclear program. Access to North Korea was further restricted by the regime. In the post-stroke period, the North Korean regime tightened restrictions on access to North Korea, limited economic activities, and imposed new restrictions on Chinese traders and private markets. They also toughened negotiating positions for nuclear talks with the United States. The Obama Administration is considering different options to engage with North Korea following their withdrawal from six-party talks and nuclear test in 2009. One option is to reform the six-party forum to no longer be a negotiation platform, potentially bridging the gap between North Korea's rejection of talks and the Administration's stance on negotiations. The Obama Administration is considering reforming the six-party forum to only ratify U.S.-North Korean agreements. They may need to promise to honor U.S. commitments unilaterally and increase pressure on North Korea through U.N. sanctions if necessary. The Obama Administration is considering reforming the six-party forum to only ratify U.S.-North Korean agreements. Increasing pressure on North Korea through U.N. sanctions may require China's cooperation and could be influenced by North Korea's food shortages. North Korea's recent conciliatory policy towards South Korea may be linked to concerns over its food situation. The Obama Administration faces challenges from North Korea and China to relax sanctions in exchange for resuming negotiations. Progress towards denuclearization is a key requirement for talks to proceed. Pressure from China to lift sanctions could complicate negotiations, requiring specific conditions for sanction removal. Resuming talks within the six-party framework or bilaterally would present a significant challenge for the Administration. The Obama Administration would face challenges in developing a strategy to deal with North Korea's negotiating positions on nuclear weapons, as outlined in official statements by the North Korean Foreign Ministry and military. Selig Harrison of the Center for International Policy, who has met with high-ranking North Korean officials, summarized these positions. North Korea is unwilling to give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for diplomatic relations with the United States. North Korea rejects proposal to give up nuclear weapons in exchange for diplomatic relations with the United States. They want recognition as a nuclear weapons state and economic benefits while retaining nuclear weapons. North Korea retains nuclear weapons and aims to develop warheads for missiles to be recognized as a nuclear weapons state. They have weaponized all their plutonium, indicating future negotiations must focus on their atomic weapons. North Korea's denuclearization negotiations must include the entire Korean peninsula and eliminate the \"U.S. nuclear threat.\" Pyongyang aims to leverage its atomic weapons to press for measures to eliminate the U.S. military presence in the region. The document regulating future U.S. military presence in the Korean peninsula supersedes the U.S.-South Korean Mutual Defense Treaty. Verification and inspections must include U.S. bases in South Korea, but North Korea has historically rejected international inspections of its nuclear programs. The Obama Administration faces challenges in negotiating with North Korea. The Obama Administration faces challenges in negotiating with North Korea over a comprehensive package deal for complete denuclearization, including incentives for irreversible steps towards denuclearization. This negotiation may involve difficult issues previously set aside by the Bush Administration in 2008. The Obama Administration faces challenges in negotiating with North Korea over a comprehensive package deal for complete denuclearization, including incentives for irreversible steps towards denuclearization. This negotiation may involve difficult issues previously set aside by the Bush Administration in 2008, such as North Korea's atomic weapons, plutonium stockpile, verification system, highly enriched uranium program, and proliferation activities with Iran and Syria. Clinton's proposal does not include negotiations over U.S. military forces in the Korean peninsula, which North Korea insists must be addressed for complete denuclearization. If negotiations reach a stalemate, the Obama Administration may need to consider major military concessions regarding the composition and operations of U.S. forces in South Korea. The Obama Administration may consider negotiating with North Korea over U.S. forces in South Korea and the Korean peninsula. If a comprehensive denuclearization agreement is not achievable, they may focus on shutting down Yongbyon to contain North Korea's plutonium production. China is likely to support this approach. The Obama Administration may aim for complete dismantlement of the Yongbyon nuclear facilities in negotiations with North Korea, with Pyongyang likely to demand diplomatic relations and the construction of light water nuclear reactors as conditions for agreement. The physical dismantlement of Yongbyon would only occur after the completion of the reactor construction. North Korea may demand diplomatic relations and the construction of light water reactors as conditions for complete dismantlement of the Yongbyon nuclear facilities. They may also request heavy oil shipments until the reactors are completed and financial aid from international agencies. North Korea's likely demands in negotiations over dismantling Yongbyon pose challenges for the Obama Administration. These demands include diplomatic relations as a condition for dismantlement, which contradicts the U.S. stance on normalizing relations only after denuclearization. Additionally, North Korea's request for light water nuclear reactors presents a dilemma for the administration, as it would require a long-term commitment or alternative incentives excluding light water reactors. North Korea's plutonium-based nuclear installations at Yongbyon, 60 miles from Pyongyang, include an atomic reactor capable of producing 6 kilograms of plutonium annually. Satellite images suggest the reactor is not used for power generation. North Korea removed fuel rods from the reactor in May 1994 for reprocessing into plutonium suitable for nuclear weapons. The reactor was shut down in 2005 and 2007 as part of agreements, with steps taken to disable it. In 2009, North Korea announced the resumption of nuclear weapons production and claimed to have restarted the plutonium reprocessing plant at Yongbyon. North Korea's plutonium reprocessing plant at Yongbyon was not visually showing signs of construction work to restore the five megawatt reactor by August 2009. Larger reactors, capable of producing enough spent fuel for 200 kilograms of plutonium annually, were under construction at Yongbyon and Taechon since 1984. The reprocessing plant would separate weapons-grade plutonium-239 from spent nuclear fuel rods for use in atomic bombs or warheads. Construction on the larger reactors was not resumed when North Korea reopened the plutonium program in early 2003. U.S. intelligence agencies detected North Korean preparations to restart the plutonium reprocessing plant in 2003. The CIA estimated that North Korea had reprocessed some fuel rods and showed samples of plutonium to a U.S. nuclear expert in 2004. IAEA monitors confirmed in 2007 that the reprocessing plant was not in operation as part of a six-party agreement. Disablement of the plant continued into 2009. North Korea announced the reprocessing plant was in operation in conjunction with missile and nuclear tests in 2009. Experts believe they had enough nuclear fuel rods to reprocess plutonium for one atomic bomb. The five megawatt reactor is not connected to power lines, indicating it is not used for electricity generation. Kim Jong-il is believed to direct the program, with support from the military and Ministry of Public Security. North Korea reportedly developed the reactor and reprocessing plant independently. North Korea admitted to having a nuclear program based on highly enriched uranium (HEU) in 2009. They claimed progress in the HEU program and stated that uranium enrichment had been successfully conducted. HEU is used in atomic weapons, like the one dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. North Korea's HEU program involves using centrifuges to produce weapons-grade U-235 for atomic bombs. The infrastructure could be located underground, unlike a plutonium reactor. U.S. intelligence agencies discovered North Korea's intent to develop an HEU program in the late 1990s and early 2000s, involving imports and technology from Pakistan. North Korea's HEU program, involving centrifuges for weapons-grade U-235, was initiated through collaboration with Pakistan's A.Q. Khan. Limited information on North Korea's progress in constructing the HEU infrastructure led to uncertainty in dealing with the issue post-2006. The program's inception dates back to the 1990s, with agreements between North Korea and Pakistan for technology exchange. A.Q. Khan, a key figure in Pakistan's HEU program, collaborated with North Korea by providing HEU technology and components in exchange for assistance in developing Pakistani missiles. Khan also supplied North Korea with centrifuges and warhead designs, as well as offering similar designs to other countries. U.S. intelligence agencies were concerned about Khan's activities and potential proliferation of nuclear technology. North Korea imported components for an HEU program, including aluminum tubes, uranium fuel equipment, uranium hexafluoride, and specialized power supply devices. The Clinton Administration learned of the HEU program in 1998 or 1999, with evidence cited in a 1999 Department of Energy report. In 2000, President Clinton waived certification that North Korea was not seeking to enrich uranium. In 2003, a North Korean shipment of aluminum tubing was seized at the Suez Canal. According to a CIA report, North Korea attempted to acquire materials for a uranium enrichment program in 2001. The CIA stated publicly in 2002 that North Korea had started constructing a centrifuge facility and could produce atomic bombs annually through HEU starting in 2005. U.S. intelligence agencies learned in 2005 that North Korea could produce uranium hexafluoride, essential for HEU production. Doubts arose in 2006, 2007, and 2008 about North Korea's centrifuge infrastructure development. In 2006, 2007, and 2008, doubts increased about North Korea's uranium enrichment program. U.S. intelligence agencies had limited information on North Korean imports of HEU-related materials. Administration officials were unsure of the program's locations and infrastructure for uranium-based atomic bombs. During negotiations in 2007 and 2008, North Korea provided the U.S. with aluminum tubes and documents related to its nuclear programs, which showed traces of HEU. This influenced the Bush Administration's actions in July 2008. The Bush Administration attempted to inject proposals for international inspections of North Korea's uranium enrichment program in 2008. North Korea's use of the word \"experimental\" in a 2009 statement suggests they may not have a full-scale centrifuge infrastructure. U.S. intelligence officials do not know the locations of HEU facilities in North Korea, but possible locations have been cited from various sources including defectors and Chinese sources. In February 2009, South Korean and U.S. intelligence agencies found underground facilities producing enriched uranium at Sowi-ri, north of Yongbyon. North Korean nuclear scientists received training in the U.S.S.R. until 1991. Reports since 1999 suggest Chinese enterprises supplied components for North Korea's missile program. In April 2008, the Bush Administration revealed that a facility in Syria bombed by Israel in 2007 was a plutonium nuclear reactor under construction with North Korea's assistance. This collaboration had been ongoing since 1997, but the information was only disclosed in 2008 after pressure from congressional committees. U.S. intelligence officials briefed committee members on North Korea's role in the reactor. The Bush Administration disclosed in 2008 that a facility in Syria bombed by Israel was a plutonium nuclear reactor under construction with North Korea's assistance. U.S. officials presented evidence of North Korean involvement, including photographs showing similarities with the North Korean reactor at Yongbyon and North Koreans inside the Syrian reactor. South Korean intelligence also reported that U.S. agencies had a list of North Korean officials involved in the project. The Israeli bombing of a Syrian nuclear reactor in 2008 raised questions about the facility's purpose and involvement of North Korea and Iran. Reports suggested collaboration between North Korean and Iranian scientists at the site, hinting at a potential plutonium reprocessing plant in Iran. Non-government experts doubted the reactor's operational status and the presence of related plutonium facilities in Syria. Korean and Iranian scientists collaborated at the reactor site during the Israeli bombing. Plutonium fuel rod production was intended for Iran as a supplement to its uranium program. Reports indicated North Korean technicians visited Iran for technical support on a planned reprocessing facility. The Syrian nuclear reactor had visits from Iranian officials in 2005 and 2006, with Ali Larijani and Mohsen Fakhrizadeh being named as visitors. Iran was reported to have financed the reactor's construction, and there were indications of North Korean-Iranian collaboration in plutonium nuclear development. The London Daily Telegraph reported in October 2006 that Iran could benefit from sharing data on nuclear tests, potentially aiding them in conducting their own underground test. Reports also indicated Iranian involvement in North Korea's second nuclear test in May 2009, with a delegation from Iran's Revolutionary Guards and Atomic Energy Organization observing the test and holding high-level meetings in Pyongyang. These reports suggest a direct collaborative relationship between North Korea and Iran in developing nuclear weapons. Reports indicate a significant North Korean-Iranian nuclear relationship, with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards playing a key role. Various sources, including the CIA, Western intelligence, and Israeli officials, have provided information on this collaboration. The IRGC is said to lead Iran's nuclear program, with multiple reports detailing specific events of their alleged cooperation. Reports have indicated a close nuclear relationship between North Korea and Iran, with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards leading Iran's nuclear program. The IRGC attempted to procure equipment for Iran's ballistic missile and nuclear program in 2006. Collaboration between North Korea and Iran on nuclear development began in the early 1990s, with reports suggesting financial support from Iran to North Korea for joint nuclear weapons development. The CIA sources mentioned joint development of nuclear weapons between North Korea and Iran, with a focus on enriched uranium. Collaboration started in the early 1990s, leading to the production of Nodong missiles in Iran. By 1997, North Korean experts were assisting Iran in developing Shahab missiles. This success led to a reported agreement in 2003 to work on nuclear warheads for the Shahab missiles. Iran and North Korea collaborated on developing nuclear warheads for the Shahab missile, with reports of North Korean experts seen at Iranian nuclear facilities in 2003. Iran offered oil and gas shipments to North Korea for joint development. Western intelligence sources mentioned economic aid from Iran to North Korea for continued cooperation in missile development. Iran and North Korea collaborated on developing nuclear warheads for the Shahab missile. Reports from German and Western intelligence sources revealed that Iranian Revolutionary Guards received important equipment from North Korea for nuclear research and development. US intelligence officials disclosed Iran's efforts to modify the Shahab missile to carry a nuclear warhead, part of Project 111. In 2006, Reuters reported Iran's plans to develop nuclear warheads for the Shahab 3 missile. The International Atomic Energy Agency confronted Iran with evidence of redesigning the Shahab-3 missile for nuclear warheads. Concerns were raised about collaboration between North Korea and Iran in developing uranium-based warhead designs. The National Council of Resistance of Iran revealed secret nuclear facilities in Iran and alleged collaboration between North Korea and Iran in warhead development. The Iranian Defense Ministry is allegedly operating a secret facility at Khojir, code-named B1-Nori-8500, for developing nuclear warheads for ballistic missiles. North Korean specialists are reportedly involved in this facility, with heavy security measures in place. Israeli concerns over North Korean-Iranian collaboration have been reported, with Israeli officials pressing for acknowledgment during negotiations with North Korea in 2008. Israeli President Shimon Peres has also expressed worry about Iran-North Korean nuclear cooperation. Israeli President Shimon Peres expressed concern over Iran-North Korean nuclear collaboration during a meeting with former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in 2007. Prime Minister Olmert planned to brief Japanese officials on North Korean-Iranian military cooperation in 2008. Reports indicated that North Korean missile experts assisted Iran in launching a satellite in 2009, using a missile based on North Korean technology. Another collaboration involved Iran's development of underground bunkers and tunnels. The Iranian project involved developing underground bunkers and tunnels for their nuclear program, costing hundreds of millions of dollars. The construction included 10,000 meters of underground halls for nuclear equipment connected by tunnels, with specifications for reinforced concrete tunnel ceilings, walls, and doors resistant to explosions. The IRGC implemented the project, with North Korea participating in the design and construction. Myong Lyu-do, a North Korean expert on underground facilities, ran the program of North Korean assistance in Tehran. North Korea's collaboration with the IRGC also included aiding Hezbollah in constructing underground military installations. The Iranian project involved aid to Hezbollah in building underground military installations in Lebanon. High-level Iranian officials visited North Korea in 2008 to ensure secrecy about nuclear collaboration. North Korea's missile program has developed over four levels, including Scud missiles with a range of up to 300 miles. North Korea has over 600 Scud missiles with a range of 300 miles, including solid-fuel versions tested in 2006. They also have 200-300 intermediate-range Nodong missiles with a range of 900 miles, tested in 2009. Additionally, North Korea has developed the Taepodong X missile with a range of 1,500 to 2,400 miles, based on a Soviet design. North Korea has deployed a new medium-range missile with a range of at least 1,800 miles, increasing the accuracy of Scud and Nodong missiles. North Korea's command and control apparatus displayed the ability to coordinate multiple missile launches at diverse targets. North Korea attempted to test launch a three-stage Taepodong II missile in 2009, with the first and second stages successfully separating and landing in the Pacific Ocean. However, the third stage carrying a satellite either did not separate or landed nearby. U.S. officials and experts initially considered the test a failure. The 2009 test of North Korea's missile showed improvement from the 2006 test, but key long-range missile technology elements were not mastered. Evaluations indicated that the missile could potentially reach as far as Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. west coast. North Korea's missile program includes exporting missiles to the Middle East and South Asia, collaborating with Iran and Pakistan on missile development. Joint programs with Iran have led to advancements in missile technology, with Iranian officials attending North Korea's test launches. North Korea attended test launches of the Taepong II long-range missile in 2006 and 2009. CIA estimated in 2003 that North Korea had produced one or two nuclear weapons without conducting yield-producing tests. Estimates in 1993 suggested North Korea had enough plutonium for one or two atomic bombs. South Korean and Japanese intelligence estimates were higher at 16-24 kilograms of plutonium. North Korea's nuclear capabilities were estimated by various intelligence agencies. South Korean and Japanese estimates suggested 16-24 kilograms of plutonium, while Russian analyses indicated about 20 kilograms, enough for two or three atomic bombs. General Leon LaPorte mentioned North Korea had three to six nuclear weapons before the 1994 U.S.-North Korean Agreed Framework. Russian intelligence also noted significant advancements in North Korea's nuclear weapons production. The Russian newspaper published a 1990 Soviet KGB report on North Korea's nuclear program, stating that the first nuclear device was completed at the DPRK nuclear research center in Yongbyon. There were concerns about North Korea smuggling plutonium from Russia, causing anxiety for Russian Counterintelligence. U.S. officials also expressed concerns about North Korea's nuclear activities. North Korea's potential smuggling of plutonium from Russia has caused concern among U.S. officials. Reports suggest that North Korea may have obtained 56 kilograms of plutonium from Russia, with additional amounts gained through reprocessing nuclear fuel rods. Dr. Sigfried Hecker testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about this issue in 2004. Dr. Hecker, former director of Los Alamos Laboratories, visited North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex multiple times. U.S. officials and experts estimate North Korea could produce 4-8 atomic bombs with their plutonium stockpile. Estimates suggest North Korea has 28-50 kilograms of plutonium, enough for 5-12 nuclear weapons. If North Korea restarts its plutonium reprocessing plant in 2009, they could quickly reprocess available nuclear fuel. If North Korea restarts its plutonium reprocessing plant, it could produce enough plutonium for one nuclear bomb annually. Experts believe any atomic bombs developed would likely be similar to the one dropped on Nagasaki in 1945. However, North Korea lacks delivery systems for such bombs to reach U.S. or Japanese targets. Pyongyang may retain weapons-grade plutonium for future use. North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test in October 2006 and reached an agreement in February 2007 for a freeze and disablement of its nuclear facilities. There were concerns about North Korea's collaboration with Iran in nuclear warhead development. The diplomatic deadlock over frozen North Korean funds in a Macau bank was resolved in June 2007. The U.S. unfroze North Korean funds in a Macau bank, leading to the shutdown of nuclear facilities at Yongbyon in accordance with the February 2007 agreement. The second phase of the agreement focused on disabling Yongbyon, North Korea declaring its nuclear programs, and the U.S. lifting economic sanctions and removing North Korea from the state sponsors of terrorism list. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill negotiated an agreement with North Korea to limit the information required in a declaration of nuclear programs, which North Korea later transmitted to China. On 6/26/08, North Korea declared its nuclear programs to China and President Bush announced lifting economic sanctions. However, on 8/11/08, North Korea was not removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism due to rejection of verification system proposals. Negotiations for a verification system took place on 10/3/08. North Korea withdrew from six party talks on 4/14/09 and conducted a second nuclear test on 5/25/09. On 6/12/09, the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on North Korea for its nuclear test. On 9/04/09, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il released two American reporters after meeting with former President Bill Clinton. The sanctions were in response to North Korea's estimated explosive power of four to five kilotons.
