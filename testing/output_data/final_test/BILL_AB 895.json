    "title": "AB 895",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 16428.25 of the Government Code requires energy settlement agreements to be solely monetary without nonmonetary compensation. It does not apply to agreements before January 1, 2016. Section 16428.3 directs settlement funds to specific purposes after reimbursing the Attorney General's expenses. The settlement funds are directed towards reducing ratepayer costs for those harmed by the actions of the settling parties, depositing in a fund for appropriation by the Legislature to benefit ratepayers by reducing rates and debt service on bonds. Section 453.5 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to require public utilities to distribute rate refunds to all current and prior customers on an equitable pro rata basis, regardless of customer classification. Refunds can be based on the amount originally paid for the service or the amount of service received, with exceptions for residential and small customers based on current usage. The commission will not use litigation proceeds for ratepayer recovery from the 2000-02 energy crisis. Any recovered claims will go to the Ratepayer Relief Fund for specified purposes. Section 1759 of the Public Utilities Code is amended. Section 1759 of the Public Utilities Code limits the jurisdiction of state courts to review or interfere with the decisions of the commission, except for specific cases outlined in the law. The writ of mandamus can be issued by the Supreme Court and court of appeal to the commission in appropriate situations. Certain actions can still be brought in superior court despite this limitation. The section does not apply to actions that can be brought in superior court, such as enforcing the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act or actions related to the California Public Records Act. The Legislature acknowledges this in Section 6 of the act. The Legislature finds that in Disenhouse v. Peevey (2014), it was determined that enforcement of the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act against the Public Utilities Commission must be done through a petition for writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court or court of appeal, not through injunctive relief in superior court. The Public Utilities Commission argued in court that Section 1759 of the Public Utilities Code prevents them from providing emails to the City of San Bruno under the California Public Records Act. They maintain that the superior court does not have jurisdiction over actions related to the Act. The Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act requires state agencies to conduct their actions and deliberations openly. The California Public Records Act aims to protect the right of every person in the state to access information about government activities. The Public Utilities Commission must conduct its affairs openly, impartially, and free from undue influence. The Public Utilities Commission should be subject to judicial review under the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act and the California Public Records Act. Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this act do not apply to claims by electrical corporations related to the energy crisis of 2000-02."
