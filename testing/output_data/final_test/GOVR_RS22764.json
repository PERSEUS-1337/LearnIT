    "content": "The Deep Water Royalty Relief Act (DWRRA) provides royalty relief for federal offshore oil and gas production leases in deep water to incentivize exploration. Lessees can apply for relief if their lease would otherwise be uneconomic, but are ineligible if oil or gas prices exceed a certain threshold. The DWRRA provides royalty relief for deep water oil and gas leases. Section 302 addresses relief for existing leases, while Sections 303 and 304 cover post-enactment lease sales. Section 303 allows Interior to offer leases with royalty relief, and Section 304 suspends royalty payments for deep water leases entered into within five years of the DWRRA's enactment. Royalty relief is based on production volume and water depth, with a minimum threshold set by Section 304. The DWRRA provides royalty relief for deep water oil and gas leases, with Section 304 setting a statutory minimum for the volumetric threshold for royalty relief. In 1998 and 1999, deepwater offshore leases were issued without a price-based limitation on royalty suspension, allowing holders to avoid royalty payments up to suspension volumes regardless of market prices. H.R. 3221, passed by the House on August 4, 2007, includes the Royalty Relief for American Consumers Act of 2007, which prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from issuing new leases to holders of \"covered leases\" without renegotiation to include price thresholds. The proposed act requires leaseholders with \"covered leases\" in the Gulf of Mexico to either renegotiate their leases to include price thresholds or pay a \"conservation of resources\" fee. Holders of \"covered leases\" must choose between keeping the lease without a price threshold, paying the fee, or renegotiating the lease terms. The proposed act aims to address the perceived oversight in 1998-1999 leases by allowing leaseholders to renegotiate leases to include price thresholds or pay a conservation fee. Kerr-McGee challenged the DOI's authority to impose price thresholds on leases sold between 1996-2000, citing section 304 of the DWRRA as prohibiting such actions. The U.S. District Court ruled in favor of Kerr-McGee, stating that the DOI's imposition of price thresholds on royalties contradicted the DWRRA. The court's decision was based on a previous ruling by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals interpreting relevant sections of the DWRRA. The Fifth Circuit found that the Interior's authority to lease water depths with royalty relief was limited by a fixed royalty suspension scheme based on volume and water depth. Mandatory Royalty Relief leases provide automatic and unconditional relief up to a minimum production volume. The court ruled that the DOI exceeded its authority by trying to collect royalties on Kerr-McGee's production below these minimums. The Kerr-McGee ruling on royalty relief for oil and gas production leases has sparked congressional interest in the impact on the Royalty Relief for American Consumers Act of 2007. Section 7504 requires holders of \"covered leases\" to renegotiate terms, pay a fee, or forfeit future lease eligibility in the Gulf of Mexico. The recent ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana could eliminate the distinction between deep water leases from 1998 and 1999 without price thresholds and those from 1996, 1997, and 2000 with unenforceable price thresholds. This ruling may impact the Royalty Relief for American Consumers Act of 2007, requiring renegotiation, fees, or forfeiting future lease eligibility in the Gulf of Mexico. The ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana could affect deep water leases issued between 1996 and 2000 under the DWRRA. The definition of \"covered leases\" in the proposed act includes leases without royalty relief provisions subject to price thresholds. This could impact the Royalty Relief for American Consumers Act of 2007. If the Western District of Louisiana decision is upheld on appeal, deep water leases issued between 1996 and 2000 may be considered \"covered leases\" under the proposed act, potentially affecting entities holding these leases' eligibility for future oil or gas production leases in the Gulf of Mexico. The proposed Royalty Relief for American Consumers Act of 2007 could impact companies operating in the deep water OCS area by encouraging recovery of royalties on leases issued between 1996 and 2000. Congress may need to amend the definition of a \"covered lease\" to restrict the scope of the act to leases without price thresholds in 1998 and 1999."
