The Congress recognizes the importance of manufactured housing for low- and moderate-income families in the US. The FHA title I insurance program has historically supported manufactured home loans during market downturns, filling the lending void until private markets recover. In 1992, over 30,000 manufactured home loans were insured under title I. The FHA title I insurance program for manufactured housing loans has faced challenges, with fewer loans being insured in 2006 and loan limits not adjusted for inflation since 1992. This has led to a limited market for manufactured housing loans, impacting low- and moderate-income families seeking homeownership. The Act aims to provide adequate funding and modernize the program to support homebuyers in all economic cycles. The Act aims to enhance participation in manufactured housing loans by Ginnie Mae and private lending markets, adjust low loan limits for title I manufactured home loan insurance to reflect cost increases since 1992, and index the limits to inflation.
