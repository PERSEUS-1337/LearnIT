    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Torture Outsourcing Prevention Act\". The Congress acknowledges the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Convention against Torture, which define torture as the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering by public officials. Article 4 of the Convention against Torture requires states to criminalize torture, while Article 3 prohibits sending individuals to countries where they may face torture. Article 15 of the Convention against Torture prohibits the use of statements obtained through torture as evidence in any proceedings. This prohibition is also found in various international human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Convention on Human Rights. The prohibition against torture and inhumane treatment is fundamental in laws governing armed conflicts, as outlined in the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Protocols. These laws establish a duty to protect civilians and noncombatants, including captured soldiers, and prohibit acts such as murder, mutilation, cruel treatment, and torture. The United States government denounces the use of torture as a policy and prohibits any form of coercion to obtain information from protected persons. Torture is illegal under existing Federal and State laws, with penalties for individuals who commit such acts. The United States Constitution and its Bill of Rights prohibit torture, violating rights such as freedom from unreasonable search or seizure, self-incrimination, due process, and freedom from cruel or unusual punishment. The Supreme Court has condemned the use of force amounting to torture in numerous cases. The Supreme Court has condemned the use of force amounting to torture during interrogations, including practices like deprivation of food, water, sleep, and threats of violence. Section 2242(a) of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 prohibits the involuntary return of individuals to countries where they may face torture. Recent practices have weakened the safeguards under applicable laws, such as the procedures under the immigration laws of the United States governing removals from the United States, which would violate obligations under Article 3 of the Convention against Torture. Transferring individuals in custody to countries where torture is commonly used is inconsistent with international human rights law and Constitutional protections against torture. The United States must ensure that all transfers of individuals to other countries comply with due process and the obligations under the Convention Against Torture. Relying on assurances from governments known for torture is ineffective in protecting individuals. The Special Rapporteur on Torture highlighted concerns about the increasing use of diplomatic assurances in rendition cases involving countries with a history of torture. Such assurances should not be accepted when there is evidence of systematic torture practices. Individual rights against torture must be upheld, and individuals should not be returned to such countries. Transfer of persons. The Secretary of State must report to Congress every 12 months on countries where torture or cruel treatment is commonly used. It is based on the information from the annual report submitted under the Foreign Assistance Act. Additionally, there is a prohibition on transferring individuals held in custody to another country. The Secretary of State reports annually to Congress on countries using torture or cruel treatment. There is a prohibition on transferring individuals in custody to certain countries, with the Secretary having the authority to waive this prohibition under certain conditions. The Secretary of State reports annually to Congress on countries using torture or cruel treatment. There is a prohibition on transferring individuals in custody to certain countries unless there are assurances in place to prevent torture or cruel treatment. These assurances must be verifiable and include access by independent humanitarian organizations. The prohibition on transferring individuals in custody to certain countries does not apply to extradition under a treaty if there are substantial grounds to believe the person would be at risk of torture. Assurances from the country requesting extradition are not sufficient to meet the requirements. Assurances from the country requesting extradition are not enough to guarantee that the person will not be subjected to torture or cruel treatment in that country. Implementation of obligation not to return to risk of torture. The Torture Outsourcing Prevention Act requires government agencies to implement regulations in line with the United Nations Convention Against Torture. The head of an agency must outline the responsibilities to comply with the United States' obligations under the Convention Against Torture. They must also establish a process for individuals to challenge transfers that may violate the Convention, including any assurances received from the receiving government. The amendment outlines that appropriate government agencies must ensure individuals are not subjected to torture or ill treatment when transferred. The agencies include the intelligence community, Departments of State, Defense, Homeland Security, and Justice, among others. The amendment made by subsection (a) does not nullify any pre-existing agency regulations under the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998. Agencies must amend regulations to comply with the amendment. The Act does not affect immigration laws or regulations, except for actions by the Secretary of Homeland Security within 120 days of enactment. The Act requires the Secretary to revise regulations to ensure that assurances from a country are not enough to guarantee a person will not be tortured if removed to that country. SEC. 5. SAVINGS CLAUSE: This Act does not limit an individual's rights under the Convention Against Torture or any other law. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE: The Act takes effect 30 days after enactment."
