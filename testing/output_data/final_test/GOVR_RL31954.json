    "content": "In April 2003, the Department of Defense proposed changes to military personnel, acquisition systems, and civilian personnel systems. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 1588, including provisions for government-wide personnel management and a National Security Personnel System for DOD. The personnel management provisions originated in DOD's April 2003 proposal and were included in H.R. 1836. They were added to H.R. 1588 during the Armed Services Committee markup and underwent several amendments during House consideration and passage. The Senate version of the defense authorization bill did not include these provisions but included other personnel provisions at Title XI. The Senate later passed H.R. 1588 with the personnel provisions included. The Senate passed H.R. 1588 with personnel provisions on pay authority for critical positions, an experimental personnel program, and personnel investigations. Senator Susan Collins introduced S. 1166, the National Security Personnel System Act, which was referred to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. The Comptroller General emphasized the importance of having human capital infrastructure in place before implementing new reforms. The importance of having human capital infrastructure in place before implementing new reforms is highlighted. This includes a human capital planning process, capabilities to develop and implement a new system effectively, and a modern performance appraisal system with safeguards for fair implementation. Lessons can be learned from how the Department of Homeland Security is developing its new personnel system. DHS has implemented an approach that includes a design team of employees from DHS, OPM, and major labor unions. They have conducted town hall meetings and focus groups to involve employees in the process. DOD should also involve employees in transformational efforts and link its performance management system to program and performance goals for alignment and individual accountability. In our view, a governmentwide approach should be used to address flexibilities like broad banding, pay for performance, reemployment, and pension offset waivers. Congress should provide such authorities on a governmentwide basis with appropriate safeguards in place. While DOD's leadership aims to transform the department, the necessary institutional infrastructure is lacking in most DOD organizations. Granting additional human capital authorities without the right infrastructure could be detrimental. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee marked up bill S. 1166 on June 17, 2003, and ordered it to be reported to the Senate with amendments. Senator Lieberman clarified provisions on collective bargaining, and Senator Voinovich excluded 10 DOD laboratories from the NSPS. The committee reported S. 1166 to the Senate on September 5, 2003, without a written report. Senator Collins, along with Senators Voinovich and Levin, expressed hope for the amended provisions of S. 1166. Several provisions similar to S. 1166 were added to H.R. 1588 in conference. On November 7, 2003, the House agreed to the conference report accompanying H.R. 1588 on a 362-40, 2 present vote. Senators Collins, Voinovich, Stevens, and Sununu expressed support for the personnel provisions of S. 1166 as an alternative to the provisions in H.R. 1588 on the NSPS, emphasizing the need for a balance between promoting a flexible system and protecting the rights of federal civil service employees. The conference report accompanying H.R. 1588 was agreed to by the House and Senate, with President Bush signing it into law as P.L. 108-136. The report discusses the provisions in Title XI of the law and plans for implementation. For more details on the background and comparisons with current law, refer to CRS reports. The implementation of the NSPS (National Security Personnel System) by the Defense Department has faced timetable changes. Discussions began in January 2004, with plans to cover 300,000 civilian DOD employees under NSPS by October 1, 2004. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld appointed Gordon England to lead negotiations with labor organizations for the personnel reform effort. Secretary England announced the phased implementation of the NSPS, with all employees to be covered by October 1, 2006. Employees were grouped into three \"spirals\" for conversion to the new system, with Spiral One consisting of 300,000 General Schedule employees from various DOD offices in the U.S. Spiral Two included remaining eligible employees, and Spiral Three covered DOD laboratory employees if legislative restrictions were lifted. Spiral One was to be implemented in three phases. The new system implementation was planned in phases, with Spiral One covering 60,000 employees over 18 months starting in July 2005. Spiral Two would follow after assessment and certification, with full implementation expected between July 2007 and January 2008. Labor relations component was set for implementation by summer 2005. Revised schedule announced in October 2005 included early FY2006 implementation of labor relations system and performance management training. Spiral 1.1 implementation was planned for early calendar year 2006. In early calendar year 2006, Spiral 1.1 was implemented to cover 65,000 employees. In spring 2006, Spiral 1.2 covered 48,000 employees. In fall 2006, Spiral 1.3 covered 160,000 employees and the performance cycle ended for employees in Spirals 1.1 and 1.2. Employees in Spirals 1.1 and 1.2 received their first pay-for-performance payout in early calendar year 2007, while employees in Spiral 1.3 received theirs in early calendar year 2008. Another revision to the NSPS implementation schedule was announced by DOD in January 2006, with implementation of various provisions starting in late April 2006. Spiral 1.1 was the first to be implemented. Under the revised schedule, Spiral 1.1 will cover around 11,000 workers in department-wide activities, with the performance rating cycle extending through October 2006 and the first performance payout in January 2007. Spirals 1.2 and 1.3 will follow, with payouts in January 2008. Proposed regulations for the system were jointly published in the Federal Register in February 2005, with over 58,000 comments submitted. The Defense Department and OPM published final regulations for a new personnel system in November 2005. Drafts of \"issuances\" for the regulations are still under review as of the report date. The process involved working groups and collaboration with labor organizations. The Defense Department and OPM developed the NSPS in late July 2004 through focus groups, town hall meetings, and discussions with union leaders. The new system covers 700,000 civilian employees and offers more flexibility in policies related to pay, performance management, adverse actions, appeals, and labor management relations compared to Title 5 regulations. A website has been established to monitor NSPS implementation. Several Members of Congress have suggested that the NSPS, along with the Department of Homeland Security's new HRM system, could serve as a model for amending Title 5 and extending provisions to the federal government's civilian workforce. Senators emphasized the importance of involving the civilian workforce in designing the NSPS for its successful implementation. Collaboration with OPM and federal employee unions is seen as crucial for the new system's acceptance. Senator Daniel Akaka and Senator Edward Kennedy have urged the Department of Defense to ensure transparency and public input in the development of the NSPS, emphasizing the importance of consulting with employee representatives. The Bush Administration's lack of transparency and refusal to involve representatives in reviewing personnel changes has been criticized. Senator Kennedy criticized the Department of Defense for withholding personnel changes from union representatives before publication, citing concerns about transparency and violating the Administrative Procedures Act. Senator Lieberman expressed disappointment with the proposed personnel rules, citing excessive limits on collective bargaining, interference with due process rights, and vague pay and performance provisions. P.L. 108-136 introduces a new Department of Defense National Security Personnel System covering 700,000 civilian employees. The Secretary of Defense, in collaboration with the OPM Director, can establish and adjust a human resources management system for DOD. This system includes provisions for pay and performance but has been criticized for being vague and untested. The HRM System for the Department of Defense must adhere to public employment principles and prohibited personnel practices. It must also provide equal employment opportunity through affirmative action and protect employees against reprisal for whistleblowing. The new HRM system for the Department of Defense must adhere to public employment principles and prohibited personnel practices. Various subparts and chapters of Part III of Title 5 United States Code are listed at the new Section 9902(d) that cannot be waived, modified, or affected in the system. This includes provisions related to employment, retention, attendance, leave, insurance, and annuities. Chapter 87 Life Insurance; Chapter 89 Health Insurance; Chapter 90 Long Term Care Insurance; Subpart H -- Access to Criminal History Record Information, including Chapter 91 for individuals under investigation; Chapter 41 -- Training; Chapter 45 -- Incentive Awards; Chapter 47 -- Personnel Research Programs and Demonstration Projects; Chapter 55 -- Pay Administration, including biweekly and monthly pay periods, computation of pay, advanced pay, and withholding of taxes from pay; Chapter 57 -- Travel, Transportation, and Subsistence; Chapter 59 -- Allowances, including uniforms, quarters, overseas differentials; Chapter 71 -- Labor Management and Employee Relations. The HRM system includes provisions for minority recruitment, antidiscrimination, security clearance, political activities, misconduct, services to employees, and employee organization rights. It must ensure employees can organize, bargain collectively, and participate in decisions that affect them. The proposed Chapter 99 outlines a performance management system that must adhere to merit principles, have a fair appraisal system, link to the agency's strategic plan, and involve employees in its design. It also requires training for supervisors and ongoing feedback between supervisors and employees. The proposed Chapter 99 outlines a performance management system that adheres to merit principles, fair appraisal, links to the agency's strategic plan, involves employees in design, and requires training for supervisors. NSPS will not apply to certain defense laboratories before October 1, 2008, and will only apply after if greater flexibilities are provided. The provision covers various defense laboratories including the Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center, Army Research Laboratory, Medical Research and Materiel Command, Engineer Research and Development Command, Communications-Electronics Command, Soldier and Biological Chemical Command, Naval Sea Systems Command Centers, Naval Research Laboratory, Office of Naval Research, and Air Force Research Laboratory. Senator Voinovich's amendment continued the authority of the reinvention. The amendment continued the authority of defense laboratories to use personnel flexibilities, which NSPS provisions might limit. The provision aims to protect existing flexibilities but could hinder the Pentagon from increasing them. No authority is granted to modify pay for employees in Executive Schedule positions under Section 9902. The law limits the total annual compensation for certain DOD employees to the Vice President's salary. Rates of compensation for civilian DOD employees should be adjusted similarly to uniformed services. The overall amount allocated for civilian DOD employees under NSPS should not be less than if they were not converted to NSPS. The regulations implementing the NSPS will ensure that civilian DOD employees are not disadvantaged in terms of overall pay compared to if they had not been converted to the NSPS. The formula for calculating compensation will consider factors such as the number and mix of employees, normal step increases, and rates of promotion. The Executive Schedule is the pay system for federal department and agency heads, with pay ranging from $133,900 to $183,500. The provision allows individual employee pay to exceed that of department heads, potentially up to the Vice President's salary. It remains unclear if OPM certification will be required for DOD policy changes under the new Section 9902(d) in P.L. 108-136. In P.L. 108-136, DOD is authorized to make changes in Title 5 Chapters 43 and 53 for the new HRM system. Key chapters of Title 5 may be affected as the new system is developed. David Chu discussed DOD's Best Practices Initiative during a hearing on the proposed NSPS of the Defense Transformation for the 21st Century Act. The Department of Defense is implementing HRM flexibilities at its science and technology laboratories, including options for a new pay system and streamlined hiring processes. The Department of Defense is implementing HRM flexibilities at its science and technology laboratories, including a new pay system and streamlined processes for reassignments, Performance Improvement Plans, and other areas. The proposed regulations for the NSPS were published in 2005, covering Classification, Pay Administration, Performance Management, Staffing, and Workforce Shaping. Details on these areas are still being discussed between DOD and labor organizations. Positions will be grouped into pay bands based on work nature and competencies. Positions will be grouped into broad pay bands based on the nature of the work and competencies required. Performance, job complexity, and market conditions will determine employee progression. Managers will have flexibility in assigning work. Classification decisions can be appealed. There are four proposed career groups: Standard, Scientific and Engineering, Investigative and Protective Services, and Medical. Table 1 shows the career groups, pay bands, and salary ranges for the National Security Personnel System Performance Management. The National Security Personnel System Performance Management will have five rating levels for employee performance evaluation. Employees rated at Level 3, 4, or 5 will be eligible for various pay adjustments and supplements, while those at Level 1 will not receive any pay increases. Employees rated at Level 1 will not receive any pay increases. For those at Level 2 or higher, pay adjustments include rate range increases, local market supplements, and performance-based raises. Performance must be at Level 2 or higher to qualify for these adjustments. Performance-based raises are given to employees at Level 3 or higher, with high performers receiving higher raises. The new system includes higher pay raises, annual review of rate ranges and local market supplements, minimum six percent salary increase upon promotion, no pay loss during conversion, streamlined hiring process, longer probationary periods for some occupational categories, retention factors in reduction in force (RIF) include tenure, veterans' preference, performance, and seniority, use of multiple years of performance ratings for RIF determinations, and provision of two years of retained pay for displaced employees. Collaboration with employee representatives on national security is ensured. The new system includes higher pay raises, annual review of rate ranges and local market supplements, streamlined hiring process, and provisions for displaced employees. Collaboration with employee representatives on national security personnel system is ensured through a process of review and recommendations. The Secretary and the Director must meet with employee representatives for at least 30 days to try to reach agreement on proposals. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service may assist if requested. After 30 days, the Secretary can implement disputed parts of the proposal if further consultation is unlikely to produce agreement. Notice must be given to Congress before implementation. The Secretary and the Director must engage in collaboration activities above the level of exclusive recognition. Employee representatives must have access to information for productive participation. Provisions allow personnel systems to include employees from any bargaining unit with exclusive recognition. The Secretary can bargain at an organizational level above exclusive recognition for bargaining units certified by the FLRA. Decisions made at this level are binding on all subordinate units and the department, superseding other agreements without further negotiations. The Secretary can bargain at an organizational level above exclusive recognition for bargaining units certified by the FLRA, with decisions binding on all subordinate units and the department. Organizational bargaining is more expeditious but may not address concerns specific to a particular unit. Collaboration with employee representatives on the development of the labor relations system is ensured, with limitations on waiving the application of Title 5, Chapter 71 of the United States Code. Section 9902(m)(1) allows the Secretary and the Director to establish a labor relations system for the Department of Defense to address the civilian workforce's role in national security. Employee representatives must be given 30 days to review and make recommendations on the new system, with their input receiving fair consideration. The Secretary and the Director must meet with employee representatives for at least 30 days to reach agreement on proposed changes. If no agreement is reached, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service may assist. After 30 days, the Secretary may implement disputed parts of the proposal with notice to Congress. The labor relations system developed under Section 9902(m) must provide for independent third-party review of decisions and collaboration with employee representatives within 60 calendar days after enactment. The Secretary has the authority to engage in collaboration activities above the level of exclusive recognition. The system expires six years after implementation unless extended by law. The authority to establish, implement, and adjust the labor relations system expires six years after enactment. On November 7, 2005, final regulations were issued for the NSPS, leading to a lawsuit by federal unions. The court enjoined the new regulations due to concerns about collective bargaining rights, third-party review, and appeal processes. Despite this, the Department of Defense plans to appeal the decision. The regulations define the department's labor-relations system and introduce new features. The regulations introduce a new labor relations board and expand management rights under the department's labor-relations system. They also establish a National Security Labor Relations Board (NSLRB) with various responsibilities, including resolving disputes and conducting de novo reviews. The NSLRB can issue binding department-wide opinions upon request. The final regulations establish a National Security Labor Relations Board (NSLRB) with duties such as determining bargaining unit appropriateness, supervising elections for exclusive representatives, resolving consultation disputes, and reviewing NSLRB decisions. Department managers are granted additional rights, including the authority to determine numbers, types, and pay schedules. Management has the right to determine employee numbers, types, pay schedules, and work methods. They can assign employees as needed but are prohibited from bargaining over their rights or procedures. While negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement are required, management is not obligated to bargain over changes unless they are significant and foreseeable according to regulations. The regulations do not specify when a change is considered \"substantial\" or \"significant.\" The NSLRB would establish procedures for the fair resolution of cases, using an integrated process. Decisions by the NSLRB could be reviewed by the FLRA, which must accept the NSLRB's findings unless shown to be arbitrary or capricious. The new section 5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a79902(h) of P.L. 108-136 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to establish an appeals process for DOD employees in the NSPS, ensuring fair treatment and due process protections. Regulations may establish legal procedures for the appeals process. Regulations implementing the appeals process for DOD employees in the NSPS must adhere to legal standards consistent with public employment principles. Pre-existing legal standards and precedents apply unless inconsistent with new standards. Employees facing certain actions have the right to appeal under the established process. Employees in the NSPS who are not on probation and are eligible to appeal performance-based or adverse actions have the right to petition the MSPB for a review of the decision. The MSPB can dismiss petitions that do not raise substantial questions and can order corrective action if the department's decision was found to be arbitrary or an abuse of discretion. No personnel action can be stayed during the board's review. Employees in the NSPS have the right to petition the MSPB for a review of decisions that are arbitrary, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with the law. Judicial review can be obtained by the employee or the Secretary of Defense. The new section 9902 of Title 5 does not authorize the waiving of any provision of law, including appeals provisions under section 2302(b)(1), (8), or (9) of Title 5. Section 2302(b)(1) prohibits discrimination based on various factors, while section 2302(b)(8) and (9) protect whistleblowers and individuals exercising their rights. Employees have the right to appeal decisions to the MSPB for review. Chapter 77 of Title 5 allows for waiver or modification by the Secretary of Defense in establishing an HRM system for DOD. Section 7701 grants employees and applicants the right to appeal to MSPB for any appealable action. An appellant has the right to a hearing and representation. The board sustains an agency decision based on substantial evidence for certain actions or a preponderance of evidence in other cases. Section 7702 of Title 5 outlines special procedures for cases where an employee alleges discrimination in an appeal to the board. The board must decide on the appealable action and discrimination within 120 days. An agency's decision is reviewable unless the employee appeals the matter. An agency decision is judicially reviewable within 120 days unless the employee appeals to the board. If discrimination is alleged, the board's decision is reviewable when issued, unless a petition is filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 30 days. The commission must decide within 60 days to concur with the board's decision or issue a differing written decision. If the commission's decision differs, the board must either concur, reaffirm its initial decision, or make appropriate revisions within 30 days. A board decision to concur and adopt a commission decision is judicially reviewable. If the board reaffirms its decision or makes revisions, it must be certified to a special panel for review within 45 days. The panel will decide on disputed issues based on the record and issue a final decision, which is also reviewable. The panel will then instruct the agency to take necessary actions based on its decision, allowing the involved parties to present arguments. Timeframes for actions by agencies, boards, or commissions must be adhered to. If time periods for action by an agency, board, or commission are not met, an employee can file a civil action in district court under antidiscrimination statutes. An employee may appeal to the board if an agency does not resolve a discrimination matter within 120 days. Section 7702 of Title 5 does not affect the right to trial de novo in district court under antidiscrimination statutes. Under Section 7703 of Title 5, an employee affected by a final order of the MSPB can seek judicial review. A petition to review a final board order must be filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit within 60 days. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit must review agency actions within 60 days. Cases of discrimination must be filed in district court within 30 days. The court can set aside agency actions that are arbitrary, unsupported by evidence, or obtained without proper procedures. Discrimination cases allow for a trial de novo. The final regulations on adverse actions allow the Department of Defense to take adverse actions for cause to promote efficiency. The Secretary of Defense has sole discretion to identify \"mandatory removal offenses\" related to national security. These offenses replace relevant subchapters of Title 5 of the United States Code. The final regulations grant the Secretary of Defense the authority to identify \"mandatory removal offenses\" related to national security, allowing for adverse actions to be taken. The Secretary has the discretion to mitigate removal penalties and is not limited by regulations for offenses not identified as mandatory removal offenses. Employees facing adverse actions are entitled to a proposal notice. An employee facing adverse action is entitled to a proposal notice, an opportunity to reply, and a decision notice. The Department must provide a minimum of 15 days advance written notice, unless there is reasonable cause to believe a crime has been committed, in which case the notice period can be shortened to five days. No notice is required for furlough without pay due to sudden breakdown of equipment or emergencies. DOD employees have ten days to reply, which can be reduced to five days in case of a crime. The Department may reduce the reply period to a minimum of five days for furlough without pay in unforeseen circumstances. The employee is given time to review evidence and respond orally or in writing, but not entitled to a formal hearing with witnesses. An official designated by the Department can make a final decision on the proposed adverse action, and the employee may have representation at their own expense. The Department must consider the employee's response and any medical documentation during the reply period. The decision notice must provide reasons for the decision and inform the employee of appeal rights. Delivery of the notice should be before the effective date, or by mail if necessary. Records of relevant information must be maintained. The Department must maintain records of relevant documentation for a period of time. Employees have the right to review and request a copy of their records. Adverse actions proposed before an employee's coverage under Subpart G are not subject to its requirements. Subpart H covers appeals for certain adverse actions for DOD employees. The Merit Systems Protection Board is bound by legal standards and precedents in reviewing appeals. The regulations in Section 9901.107(a)(2) of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations emphasize the national security mission of the Department of Defense. They waive certain provisions of Title 5 of the United States Code for employees covered by an appeals system under this subpart. Section 9901.809 of Title 5 modifies provisions regarding discrimination cases. Appellate procedures in Subpart H override those of the Merit Systems Protection Board in certain cases. The appellate procedures in Subpart H supersede those of the MSPB for DOD employees appealing adverse actions. Alternative dispute resolution methods are encouraged by the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation for employee-employer disputes. Covered DOD employees can appeal adverse actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board and have the right to be represented by an attorney. Appeals must be filed within 20 days of the effective date of the action. An appeal of an adverse action must be filed within 20 days of the action or within 20 days of receiving notice, with a decision to be made within 90 days. The MSPB judge must uphold the action unless the employee proves errors in procedure, prohibited practices, or non-compliance with the law. The judge must defer to DOD's penalty determination. An administrative judge must defer to DOD's penalty determination and can only modify it if it is totally unwarranted. The impact on national security must be considered, and the maximum justifiable penalty should be applied when mitigated. The final regulation changes some aspects of the proposed regulation. The final regulation regarding DOD penalties states that an administrative judge cannot modify a penalty unless it is totally unwarranted. The regulation also changes the standard for mitigation, emphasizing that penalties should not be modified unless they are wholly without justification. Additionally, the regulation specifies that neither the MSPB administrative judge nor the full MSPB can reverse a DOD action based on how the charge is labeled, as long as the employee is aware of the facts. The MSPB administrative judge or full MSPB cannot reverse a DOD action based on how a performance expectation is expressed, as long as it is clear to a reasonable person. Interim relief or stay of action requires specific orders from the full Board after a final decision by the Department of Defense. Back pay and attorney fees cannot be awarded before a final Board decision. Attorney fees may be required to be paid by DOD if the employee prevails and it is deemed warranted in the interest of justice. The final regulation on attorney fees for prevailing parties in cases of discrimination involving prohibited personnel practices is less restrictive than the proposed regulation. It states that attorney fees may be awarded when the Department's action was clearly without merit based on known facts. An administrative judge's decision becomes final after 30 days. The final regulation states that a request for review must be filed within 30 days, or it will be dismissed as untimely unless a good reason is provided. It removes the requirement for service as specified by DOD and clarifies the process for dismissing untimely requests. Under the final regulation, a request for review must be filed within 30 days. If no notice is served within that period, the initial decision becomes final. The MSPB will process a party's request for full Board review if no notice is served. Timeframes will be established for action on a request. If DOD decides to act on the request, the other party has 15 days to respond, with possible extensions for good cause. The Department may remand the matter for further adjudication or issue a final decision modifying or reversing the initial decision. An administrative judge must make a decision after remand within 30 days, or 45 days if a hearing is required. Decisions on remand are treated as initial decisions for further review. Any decision issued by the Department after reviewing an initial decision is precedential unless determined otherwise by the Secretary. Under the final regulation, a DOD decision is final unless challenged within 30 days. The Director can petition for review if the decision is deemed erroneous. The filing period may be extended for good cause. Employees or the Office of Personnel Management can file a petition for review with the full Board within 30 days of receiving a final DOD decision. The full Board may dismiss any petition that does not raise substantial questions of fact or law and may order corrective action if the decision was arbitrary, capricious, or unsupported by substantial evidence. The final regulation sets out these standards prescribed in the statute at section 9901(h) of Title 5 of the United States Code. A petition for review can be filed if the Department's review period expires after an initial decision by an administrative judge. The full Board must act on the petition within 90 days of receiving a response, as per 5 U.S.C. section 9902(h) and MSPB regulations. Eligible employees can petition the MSPB for review if they are removed, suspended, furloughed, or have their pay reduced. The Board can dismiss petitions that do not raise substantial legal or factual questions. The Board's review process does not allow for personnel action to be stayed or interim relief to be granted unless ordered by the Board. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management can request reconsideration by the MSPB within 35 days of the final order. The full Board must make a decision within 60 days of receiving the request for reconsideration. Failure to meet deadlines for decisions can result in consequences. The full Board is required to inform the Secretary of Defense in writing of any delays in meeting time limits and recommend actions to remedy the issue. The Secretary of Defense or an affected employee can seek judicial review under Section 9002(h) of Title 5 of the United States Code. Language allowing the Secretary of Defense to seek reconsideration by MSPB before judicial review was removed from the proposed regulation. The MSPB rules allow for judicial review of final decisions, with procedures for appeals of adverse actions being the same for all offenses. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to mitigate penalties for mandatory removal offenses within the Department. If an employee's appeal is sustained for not committing a mandatory removal offense, a subsequent adverse action based on similar evidence is not precluded. The final regulation differs from the proposed one by only allowing the MSPB administrative judge to mitigate penalties for mandatory removal offenses. The final regulation precludes the full Board from mitigating a mandatory removal offense, allowing only the Secretary to do so within the Department. Appeals under Section 7702 of Title 5 must follow 5 U.S.C. Section 9902 and DOD regulations. If no petition for review is filed, the Department will refer only discrimination issues to the full Board for adjudication. The final regulation modifies references in 5 U.S.C. Section 7702 to Part 9901 of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. It adds \"final\" before \"Department decision\" and includes provisions for appeals process for fair treatment and due process for employees. Subpart H does not apply to adverse actions proposed before an employee's coverage under this subpart. On November 7, 2005, final regulations were issued to establish the NSPS. A coalition of federal unions, including the American Federation of Government Employees, filed a lawsuit challenging the regulations. The court enjoined the regulations on grounds of lack of collective bargaining rights, independent third-party review, and fair appeal process for adverse actions. DOD plans to appeal the decision as the court found the appeal process in the regulations to be unfair and contrary to granted authority. The court found that regulations allowing DOD to reverse decisions of administrative judges were unfair and gave one party too much power. The regulations also limited the ability of administrative judges to modify penalties imposed by the department. This was similar to a case involving the Department of Homeland Security, where regulations were deemed to exceed statutory authority. The DOD regulation allows the Secretary to make unilateral decisions on employee placement and identify offenses impacting national security. This authority was found to conflict with statutory requirements by the court. The court found that the DOD regulation on employee placement and offenses impacting national security conflicted with statutory requirements. The regulation failed to provide fair treatment to employees facing separation or retirement incentives, such as voluntary early retirement and separation incentive payments. Repayment of incentives is required if an individual is re-employed by the federal government. The DOD regulation allows for early retirement or separation with repayment required if re-employed by the federal government within five years. The Secretary of Defense can establish a program to reduce personnel or restructure the workforce without reducing overall numbers, offering voluntary separation incentive pay to up to 25,000 employees per fiscal year. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 excludes military base closures or realignments from the number of employees eligible for separation incentives. The Secretary of Defense must report annually on the employees who received such pay. The term \"employee\" excludes reemployed annuitants, employees eligible for disability retirement, and those separated for misconduct. An employee aged 50 or older with 20 years of service can apply for retirement and benefits if facing involuntary separation due to misconduct or poor performance. Separation pay, up to $25,000, can be received in a lump sum or installments, and does not affect other government benefits. Separation pay, up to $25,000, can be received in a lump sum or installments and will cease upon accepting federal employment. Reemployment with DOD is prohibited for 12 months unless waived by the Secretary. Separation pay recipients cannot be reemployed by DOD for 12 months, unless waived by the Secretary on a case-by-case basis. If a former employee reenters federal service within five years, they may have to repay separation pay to DOD. Repayment waivers can be granted based on unique abilities and availability for the position. Waivers can be approved by the OPM Director, Secretary of DOD, or heads of other branches if the individual is the only qualified applicant. The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Civilian Personnel Policy, Ginger Groeber, implemented voluntary separation incentive payments and early retirement provisions on December 30, 2004. Buyouts are limited to 25,000 employees annually, with specific allocations for different branches. To be eligible for a buyout, an individual must have worked for DOD for at least 12 months, and certain high-ranking employees are not eligible. Members of the Senior Executive Service and employees above GS-15 are not eligible for buyouts or early retirement without approval from the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. Retired federal employees re-employed by the government cannot receive both a federal retirement annuity and salary simultaneously. If re-employed, the annuity amount is deducted from their pay, and they may be eligible for a supplemental annuity upon retirement after one year of re-employment. The implementation of reemployment provisions for retired federal employees by the Department of Defense allows for continued annuity payments during reemployment, without additional credit accrual under CSRS or FERS. Annuities may be continued for positions that are hard-to-fill, addressing challenges of retirement-driven talent drain. The reemployment provisions for retired federal employees by the Department of Defense allow for continued annuity payments during reemployment for hard-to-fill positions or critical organizational needs. Extensions beyond 2087 hours are not authorized, and certification from the next-level manager is required for rehiring within 90 days of retirement. The Department of Defense reemployment provisions for retired federal employees allow continued annuity payments during reemployment for hard-to-fill positions or critical organizational needs. The certification must indicate that retention options were considered and offered to the employee before retirement. The DOD guidance covers annuitants rehired after November 23, 2004, with monitoring by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Civilian Personnel Policy. The Secretary of Defense is not limited by Title 5 provisions in establishing and implementing NSPS regulations related to qualification requirements, recruitment, appointments, employee assignments, promotions, and staff reductions. The Secretary of Defense may apply the NSPS to organizational units with varying numbers of civilian DOD employees, based on performance management criteria. Section 9903 authorizes a program to attract highly qualified experts in needed occupations. The Secretary of Defense may appoint personnel from outside the civil service to positions in DOD without regard to Title 5 provisions on employee appointments and pay rates. Employees appointed under this program may receive additional payments beyond basic pay. The Secretary of Defense may appoint personnel from outside the civil service to positions in DOD without regard to Title 5 provisions on employee appointments and pay rates. Additional payments may be given to employees appointed under this program, with limits set based on the employee's annual rate of basic pay. The service period for such appointments may not exceed five years, with a possible one-year extension for national security reasons. The total additional payments in a 12-month period are capped at $50,000 or 50% of the employee's annual basic pay, with adjustments based on the Employment Cost Index. The Employment Cost Index (ECI) determines the base quarter for employee appointments in the Department of Defense. Appointed employees are not eligible for bonuses or monetary incentives, with a maximum annual compensation set at $212,100. The Secretary can appoint up to 2,500 highly qualified experts at any time. The Secretary can appoint up to 2,500 highly qualified experts at any time, with a limitation of 300 under S. 1166. If the program is terminated, employees in appointed positions will not be affected until the expiration of their appointment period. The rate of basic pay for the position cannot be reduced as long as the employee continues to serve without a break in service. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Military Departments can now hire highly qualified experts with uncommon skills or knowledge for short-term needs. Hiring authority cannot be used for temporary or redundant purposes. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Military Departments can hire experts with unique skills for short-term needs. Experts' pay is determined by various factors, including labor market conditions, position type, location, and experience. Pay may increase for exceptional accomplishments contributing to the mission. The Defense Civilian Personnel Data System will be used to record employment of highly qualified experts, with documentation required for appointment criteria, pay factors, and additional payments. Section 9904 of P.L. 108-136 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to provide allowances and benefits to civilian DOD employees supporting activities abroad hazardous to life or health. The proposed new Chapter 99 provides retirement benefits comparable to those of the Foreign Service Act and the CIA. It must conform to the requirements of Section 1101(b) of P.L. 108-136. Military leave is authorized under 5 U.S.C. \u00a76323. Section 1113 of P.L. 108-136 amends 5 U.S.C. \u00a76323 to authorize military leave for individuals on active duty in support of a contingency operation. This provision allows for up to 22 workdays of leave without loss of pay or benefits, helping federal civilian employees transition to military service by bridging the pay gap during mobilization. Section 1116 of P.L. 108-136 extends the experimental personnel program for scientific and technical personnel until September 30, 2008. It also includes provisions on an automated personnel management program and other personnel-related projects. The provisions of Subtitle C of Title XI of P.L. 108-136 apply to federal civilian employees government-wide, amending the computation of overtime rates of pay for employees. It ensures that employees will receive overtime at a rate that is the greater of one and one-half times the hourly rate for GS-10, step 1, or their hourly rate of basic pay, addressing previous issues where overtime pay was less than the regular hourly rate for some employees. P.L. 108-136 addresses issues with overtime pay for federal employees, ensuring they receive proper compensation. OPM implemented regulations to enforce the provision, affecting employees above GS-12, step 5. Section 1122 amends pay differentials for blue-collar and GS employees in severe working conditions or hazards. The amendment in P.L. 108-136 addresses pay differentials for GS employees in hazardous conditions, specifically related to asbestos exposure. Backpay determinations will be based on occupational safety and health standards under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Federal wage-grade employees will now be subject to the same standards as general schedule employees for eligibility. Federal wage-grade employees will now be subject to the same standards as general schedule employees for determining eligibility for environmental differential pay (EDP) due to exposure to asbestos. EDP standards for wage-grade employees do not have an objective measure for asbestos exposure, leading to arbitrators ruling in favor of employees even when levels are below OSHA standards. Implementation of hazard differential pay (HDP) for asbestos exposure must be based on OSHA limits as of November 24, 2003. OSHA limits for asbestos exposure as of November 24, 2003 are now applicable to federal wage-grade employees for hazard differential pay (HDP). Section 1123 amended the law to allow student loan repayments up to $10,000 per calendar year starting January 1, 2004. OPM issued regulations for the program on April 20, 2004. Section 1124 of the law allows cabinet secretaries, military department secretaries, and heads of executive agencies to be paid bi-weekly like most Federal employees, saving time and resources. Section 5504 of Title 5 is modified to consolidate the definition of employee for bi-weekly pay purposes, excluding certain groups but allowing agencies to elect to pay them bi-weekly. The provision allowing certain officials and employees to be paid bi-weekly became effective on November 30, 2003. OPM published proposed regulations on October 7, 2004, to implement the changes to basic pay and locality pay for SES members and other positions. OPM issued a final rule in December 2004 to establish a new pay system for senior executives, including a higher cap on aggregate compensation. Significant changes included replacing six pay levels with a broad pay range, increasing the cap on base pay, adding a second higher cap for certified agencies, and eliminating locality pay. Senior executives are now paid based on individual performance within the broad pay range. The new pay system for senior executives includes higher caps on base pay, with a cap of $152,000 for agencies without certified appraisal systems and $165,200 for certified agencies in 2006. Implementing a pay band and shifting the cap on basic pay can help alleviate pay compression within the SES, promoting accountability and performance appraisal system improvements. The new pay system for senior executives includes higher caps on base pay, with a cap of $152,000 for agencies without certified appraisal systems and $165,200 for certified agencies in 2006. Agencies are concerned about creating a forced distribution of performance ratings and the impact of eliminating locality pay for certain positions. Senior executives in agencies without certified appraisal systems could be adversely affected by the loss of locality pay. Total Compensation is affected by changes in the caps on basic pay and the certification process established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established a new pay system for senior executives, with higher caps on total compensation. For those with certified appraisal systems, the cap has shifted to the Vice President's salary of $212,100 in 2006. This change allows executives to receive all their compensation in one year instead of having payments deferred. The amendments took effect on January 1, 2004. Section 1125 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 established new pay provisions for senior executives, ensuring their basic rate of pay would not be reduced during the first year after enactment. It also applied the post-employment conflict of interest provision to senior executives paid on the Executive Schedule. The provision extends post-employment restrictions to senior executives compensated at a rate equal to or greater than 86.5% of the rate of basic pay for level II of the Executive Schedule. The provision extends post-employment restrictions to senior executives compensated at a rate equal to or greater than 86.5% of the rate of basic pay for level II of the Executive Schedule. Employees are subject to additional restrictions on representing foreign entities with the intent to influence any officer or employee of any department or agency of the United States. OPM published interim regulations to implement the provision in October 2004. Section 1126 amends 5 U.S.C. Chapter 47, specifying elements required in a pay-for-performance system for demonstration projects. These elements include adherence to merit system principles, transparent employee performance appraisal, alignment with agency's strategic plan, employee involvement in system design, training for supervisors and employees, and ongoing performance feedback. The eight elements required in a pay-for-performance system for demonstration projects address concerns about fairness, employee involvement, and resource allocation. OPM plans to issue proposed regulations to support performance appraisal systems capable of making performance distinctions for pay systems. The agenda anticipates final action by June 2005. Section 1127 prohibits federal agencies from imposing fees on employees for flexible spending accounts (FSAs) administrative costs. OPM must submit reports on FSA program costs and tax savings to congressional committees. Employees in federal agencies can opt for a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) to save on Social Security and Medicare taxes. This allows them to set aside pretax money for health care or dependent care expenses, reducing their pay in exchange. Reimbursements from the FSA for unreimbursed health care costs are tax-exempt. Employees participating in federal Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) can save on taxes by setting aside pretax money for health care or dependent care expenses. Reimbursements from FSAs are tax-exempt, and agencies are required to pay administrative costs, with most choosing to absorb these expenses themselves. Agencies cannot charge fees to participating employees for FSAs. The government pays administrative costs for federal Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) and cannot charge fees to employees. Private sector employers typically cover FSA administrative costs to encourage participation. OPM reported in 2004 that over 117,950 employees had health-care FSAs and 18,178 had dependent-care FSAs, with projections for increased enrollment by 2007. By 2007, 283,000 employees would have health-care FSAs and 43,627 would have dependent-care FSAs. In 2005, 157,000 employees participated in the FSA program. Administrative fees were projected to be $5.6 million for health-care FSAs and $980,000 for dependent-care FSAs in 2004, totaling nearly $80 million through 2007. Employees benefit from untaxed contributions deposited into their FSA accounts, resulting in lower taxable income and reduced Social Security and Medicare taxes for agencies. Section 1128 mandates annual surveys of employees by federal executive departments, government corporations, and independent establishments. OPM will issue regulations for agency surveys to compare results across agencies. Surveys will address leadership and management practices, employee satisfaction, rewards, and professional development. Results will be public unless it affects national security. The provision authorizes agencies to conduct surveys focusing on leadership, performance, and employee contribution to agency mission. No remedial actions are mandated based on survey results. OPM may address national security concerns in its regulations. Regulations on employee surveys were withdrawn in 2004. Section 1129 adds a new chapter on Human Capital Performance Fund to Title 5 United States Code. The legislation adds a new chapter entitled Human Capital Performance Fund to Title 5 United States Code. The fund aims to promote greater performance in the federal government by rewarding high-performing employees in eligible organizations. Executive departments, government corporations, and independent agencies are eligible to participate, while the Government Accountability Office is not covered. Various types of employees can be rewarded through the fund, including General Schedule, Foreign Service, and Veterans Health Administration employees. The Human Capital Performance Fund aims to reward high-performing employees in eligible federal organizations. Employees such as General Schedule, Foreign Service, and Veterans Health Administration employees are eligible for rewards from the fund. The fund is administered by OPM with a $500,000,000 appropriation for FY2004 and subsequent fiscal years. Participating agencies can use up to 10% of the appropriation in the first year for training on performance management systems. Agencies must submit plans to OPM for approval to participate in the fund. Agencies seeking to participate in the fund must submit plans to OPM for approval. The plans must include adherence to merit principles, a fair performance appraisal system, a link between pay-for-performance and the agency's strategic plan, employee involvement in system design, training for supervisors and employees, ongoing performance feedback, fair management, and allocation of agency resources. The agency must submit a plan to OPM for approval to receive funds from the pay-for-performance system. 90% of the remaining appropriation may be allocated to agencies based on their prorated share of executive branch payroll. If an agency's full share is not allocated, the remaining amount goes to other agencies. 10% of the remaining funds and any undistributed agency share due to a lack of a satisfactory plan will be available for distribution. The prorated share not distributed due to an agency's failure to submit a satisfactory plan will be allocated among agencies with high-quality plans. These agencies can make human capital performance payments to employees for exceptional performance. The number of employees receiving payments cannot exceed 15% of the agency's total employment, and payments cannot exceed 10% of the employee's basic pay. The total pay including performance pay cannot exceed Executive Level IV. The performance payment will be in addition to annual pay adjustments and locality-based comparability payments, considered basic pay for retirement and insurance purposes. Agencies will provide information on payments made and fund usage to OPM. Initially, agencies will use fund monies for human capital performance payments, with subsequent financing from other agency funds. Monies from the fund may not be used for new within-grade increases under current law. The Human Capital Performance Fund will be used for performance payments, with regulations issued by OPM to govern agency plans, allocation of funds, payment processes, and training. Proposed by President George Bush in FY2004 budget, the fund aims to enhance agency performance management systems. The Human Capital Performance Fund, proposed in President George Bush's FY2004 budget, aims to create performance-driven pay systems for employees. Concerns include the effectiveness of agency performance management systems, potential impact on locality-based payments, and the adequacy of performance award amounts as incentives. OPM plans to issue regulations for the fund's implementation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 does not provide funding for the Human Capital Performance Fund. P.L. 108-136 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into personal services contracts for specific purposes outside the United States. The Secretary of Defense can enter into personal services contracts for urgent or unique services that cannot be obtained by other means. Title IX, Section 906 of P.L. 108-136 transferred personnel security investigations functions from DOD to OPM, which now handles 90% of all PSIs. This transfer was authorized by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The transfer of personnel security investigations functions from DOD to OPM required approval from the Secretary of Defense and the Director of OPM. DSS investigative personnel had to move to OPM, while support personnel transfer was optional. The Director had to review functions performed by DSS and determine if they could be contracted out. The transfer was announced on November 22, 2004. On November 22, 2004, the transfer of the personnel security investigations program from DSS to OPM was announced, along with 1,850 staff. OPM selected 12 managers for key leadership positions in the program on February 15, 2005. This transfer established OPM as the primary source for federal national security background and suitability investigative services for over 90% of the federal government. The Intelligence Reform Act introduced new requirements to the clearance process, aiming to streamline and standardize it. The Office of Management and Budget, in collaboration with OPM, developed a plan to establish an integrated database for security clearances, prioritizing requests and promoting reciprocity among federal agencies. This plan also centralized the responsibility for operating the investigative process system in OPM."
