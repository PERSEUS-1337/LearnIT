    "content": "The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) faced public concern over product recalls in 2007, leading to the enactment of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). This act aimed to address organizational deficiencies and strengthen enforcement of consumer product safety standards. The CPSC was established in 1972 under the Consumer Product Safety Act to protect the public from unsafe products. The CPSC, established in 1972, has seen a reduction in staff and resources, affecting its ability to enforce consumer product safety standards effectively. The agency's authority to inspect, recall, and block unsafe products has been questioned, especially after the 2007 toy recalls. The CPSC collaborates with industries and the public to promote best practices and guidelines for product safety. The CPSC promotes best practices and guidelines for product safety, relying on voluntary standards to reduce injury risks. It administers statutes like the FHSA and FFA to regulate hazardous substances and flammable fabrics. The Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA) establishes safety standards for fabric flammability and prohibits non-compliant products from being manufactured, sold, or imported. The Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA) allows the CPSC to set special packaging standards for household substances to protect children from harm. The Refrigerator Safety Act (RSA) also falls under CPSC jurisdiction. The Refrigerator Safety Act (RSA) prohibits non-compliant household refrigerators from being introduced into interstate commerce. Before the CPSIA, regulatory procedures and enforcement authority differed among statutes, leading to potential inconsistency in product regulation. The CPSIA amended the CPSA to provide states attorneys general with injunctive enforcement authority, addressing ambiguity in enforcement. The CPSC has the authority to establish consumer product safety standards for products intended for consumer use in various settings. The CPSC has jurisdiction over various consumer products, with exemptions for certain items like tobacco, motor vehicles, and food. They also oversee amusement rides at travelling carnivals but not those permanently fixed. Additionally, they lack jurisdiction if risks can be addressed under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The CPSC has authority over consumer product safety issues, except for certain exemptions like electronic product radiation regulated by the FDA. Manufacturers must report safety problems, and the CPSC can order recalls or import bans. The CPSC has authority to inspect facilities and products, purchase consumer products for testing, and establish a product surveillance program in cooperation with other agencies. The CPSC, in collaboration with other federal agencies, conducts a surveillance program to prevent unsafe consumer products from entering the US. The CBP is authorized to provide samples of products for inspection to ensure compliance with safety regulations. It is illegal to manufacture, sell, distribute, or import consumer products that do not meet safety standards. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) collaborates with other agencies to prevent unsafe products from entering the US. It is illegal to manufacture, sell, distribute, or import consumer products that do not meet safety standards. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) expands the scope of prohibited acts, requiring manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to report any product failures or hazards to the CPSC. The CPSC may order manufacturers, distributors, or retailers to give public notice of product defects or failures to comply with safety standards to protect the public. The CPSIA broadened these provisions to cover noncompliance with rules under all CPSC jurisdiction and added more ways to notify the public. The CPSIA expanded the CPSC's authority to order manufacturers, distributors, or retailers to take specific actions in response to product hazards, removing their ability to choose the remedial action. Additionally, the CPSC can now determine the appropriate action to be taken, including declaring a product an imminent hazard in federal court. The CPSC has the authority to declare a product an imminent hazard in federal court, allowing for actions such as public notification, recall, and remedies like repair, replacement, or refund. The FHSA also allows for similar remedial actions for banned hazardous substances. The CPSC can order repair, replacement, or refund for articles or substances posing a risk. Costs are not covered by CPSC but by manufacturers, distributors, or retailers. Expenses related to CPSC orders may be reimbursed among involved parties. The CPSC can order reimbursement for expenses related to carrying out orders for noncompliant products. Manufacturers, distributors, or retailers may be required to reimburse others for expenses incurred in availing themselves of remedies provided under an order. The CPSC has the authority to order reimbursement for expenses related to carrying out remedial or notification orders for noncompliant products. Importers are held to the same responsibilities as domestic manufacturers in protecting consumers from hazardous products. The CPSC has the authority to ban noncompliant imports and may issue an order prohibiting the importation of products that present a substantial hazard. Imported consumer products may be refused admission if they do not comply with safety rules, labeling requirements, or if they are imminently hazardous. The CPSC can inform CBP of noncompliant imports. The CPSC can inform the CBP of noncompliant imports, requesting refusal of admission for products that fail safety rules or have substantial hazards. The CPSIA expands grounds for refusal, while FHSA and FFA outline specific import refusal criteria for hazardous substances and flammable products. CBP has authority for redelivery or recall of non-compliant products already released. The CPSC and CBP have the authority to address noncompliant or defective products, which must be destroyed or exported unless modified to comply with standards. The CPSIA made destruction mandatory, with the option for export within 90 days. Before the CPSIA, the CPSC could condition importation on the manufacturer's compliance. The CPSC can require compliance with inspection and recordkeeping rules for imported consumer products. Non-compliant products may be refused entry or subject to injunction or seizure. If a foreign manufacturer cannot be reached, the importer may be responsible for recalls and expenses. The importer may be responsible for expenses related to a mandatory recall under the CPSA, with the option to seek reimbursement from the foreign manufacturer. Expenses for storage or destruction of denied imported products must be paid by the owner or consignee, with a lien imposed for non-payment. Similar expenses for hazardous substances denied entry must also be covered by the owner or consignee under FHSA. The Office of Compliance and Field Operations within the CPSC conducts enforcement activities, provides guidance on compliance, and reviews standards. It also investigates consumer complaints, inspects products for defects, and identifies safety risks. The Office of International Programs and Intergovernmental Affairs at the CPSC oversees corrective action plans for defective products and ensures compliance with safety standards. Memoranda of understanding have been established with counterparts in various countries. Public meetings have been held to discuss implementation of the CPSIA. In the 110th Congress, various proposals were made to address consumer product safety issues, including CPSA reform bills like H.R. 4040 and S. 2045 / S. 2663. Other bills covered safety standards for different products, lead content standards, third-party testing, penalties, CPSC personnel increases, sales prohibition of recalled products, and expanded CPSC jurisdiction. The CPSIA incorporated language from various bills addressing consumer product safety issues, including provisions from the Senate and House versions of H.R. 4040. The final text resulted from a lengthy conference negotiation and included reforms such as whistleblower protection and safety standards for specific products like all-terrain vehicles and garage door openers. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, H.R. 4040, included safety standards for products like all-terrain vehicles and garage door openers. The bill passed both the House and Senate in July 2008 and was signed into law by President Bush in August 2008. The final text included provisions from both versions of the bill, with the major exception being a prohibition on industry-sponsored travel by CPSC members or employees. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, signed into law as P.L. 110-314, sets lead level limits in products for children aged 12 and younger. The permissible lead level will be phased in over three years at 600 ppm, 300 ppm after one year, and 100 ppm after three years. The CPSC must periodically review and lower the limit every five years. Exceptions are made for certain materials or products and inaccessible component parts. The CPSC must periodically review and lower the lead limit in products for children aged 12 and younger. Exceptions are made for certain materials or products. The permissible lead level in paint is reduced to 0.009 percent (90 ppm) from 0.06 percent (600 ppm). Noncompliant products may not be sold after February 10, 2009. The CPSC requires manufacturer certification of safety testing by accredited third-party laboratories for children's products. Deadlines for publication of accreditation requirements vary based on the type of product, with specific deadlines for lead paint, cribs, pacifiers, small parts, children's metal jewelry, and baby bouncers/walkers/jumpers. Other children's products must have accreditation requirements published within 10 months of CPSIA enactment. The CPSC requires manufacturer certification of safety testing by accredited third-party laboratories for children's products. Deadlines for publication of accreditation requirements vary based on the type of product, with specific deadlines for lead paint, cribs, pacifiers, small parts, children's metal jewelry, and baby bouncers/walkers/jumpers. CPSC proceedings for promulgating accreditation requirements are exempt from certain regulatory acts for three years after enactment. Proprietary labs may be accredited by the CPSC if they provide equal or greater protection than third-party labs. CPSC personnel can inspect accredited proprietary labs and establish audit requirements for third-party testing labs. The CPSC can revoke lab accreditation if they fail to follow requirements or are influenced by manufacturers or government entities. It is unclear which preemption provisions apply to third-party testing and certification. One possible provision exempts state/local toy safety standards from federal preemption if applied for within 90 days of CPSIA enactment. If not, general preemption provisions under CPSA \u00a726 might apply. The CPSA \u00a726 provisions, predating the CPSIA, may apply to testing and certification amendments. States/localities can seek exemption for safety standards protecting against product risks under the CPSA. Existing state/local standards must align with federal standards to be exempt. It is uncertain if testing and certification requirements qualify as safety standards for preemption purposes. CPSIA \u00a7103 requires tracking labels on children's products and packaging to identify recalled products. Advertisements, labels, and packaging cannot reference safety rules unless compliant. CPSIA \u00a7104 mandates safety standards for child products. The CPSC establishes mandatory safety standards for various durable nursery products for children under five years old, including cribs, high chairs, play yards, strollers, and more. Commercial users are prohibited from selling non-compliant cribs. Manufacturers must provide registration forms and maintain databases for consumer notification in case of product issues. The CPSC requires registration forms and databases for consumer notification in case of product issues. CPSIA \u00a7105 amends FHSA \u00a724 to require choking hazard labeling on certain toys and games, as well as cautionary statements on advertising providing a direct means of purchase. This applies to advertisements by retailers, manufacturers, importers, distributors, or private labelers. Manufacturers must inform retailers of any applicable cautionary statement requirements. The advertising requirements for products include displaying cautionary statements in a clear and conspicuous manner. Retailers are not liable if they requested but did not receive accurate information from manufacturers. Noncompliant advertisements are prohibited under the CPSA, with specific format and display requirements. The requirements take effect for internet websites 120 days after enactment and for catalogues 180 days after enactment, with a possible grace period for catalogues. The ASTM toy safety standard, deemed mandatory under CPSIA, must be reviewed and revised by CPSC within two years of enactment to enhance toy safety. CPSC will periodically review and revise the rule, with ASTM required to notify CPSC of any proposed revisions. The revised standard becomes a CPSC rule 180 days after ASTM notification. The CPSC will consider proposed revisions to the ASTM toy safety standard, which will become a CPSC rule 180 days after notification unless CPSC determines it does not improve product safety. State or local safety requirements for toys can remain in effect if filed with CPSC within 90 days of CPSIA enactment. Section 107 of the CPSIA mandates a study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on racial/ethnic disparities in preventable injuries and deaths among children, including suffocation, poisonings, and drownings. Minority populations such as Black, Hispanic, American Indian, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, and Asian/Pacific Islander children will be included in the study. The GAO must report its findings to congressional committees within one year of the legislation's enactment. Beginning 180 days after enactment of the CPSIA, \u00a7108 permanently bans three phthalates in children's products and temporarily bans three others pending review by a panel. It prohibits toys or child care articles containing certain phthalates above 0.1% concentration. Recommendations for reducing risks among minority children and education initiatives are also included in the legislation. To protect children's health, toys or child care articles with concentrations above 0.1% of certain phthalates are temporarily banned until a review by a panel. The CPSC will evaluate the panel's findings and may declare products containing phthalates as hazardous. State laws on phthalate alternatives not covered by CPSA standards are not preempted. \"Children's toy\" and \"child care article\" are defined for regulatory purposes. The CPSIA amends CPSA \u00a732(a) to authorize increasing appropriations annually for CPSC activities. Funding is allocated for travel, subsistence, and official duties of Commissioners and employees. CPSC must report on personnel development efforts and funding allocation plans to congressional committees within 180 days of enactment. Education efforts target second-hand retailers on recalls of nursery products. The CPSIA mandates educational efforts for second-hand retailers on recalls of nursery products. Funding limitations for CPSC commissioners date back to the mid-1980s, hindering the Commission's ability to reach a quorum for certain actions. During the 1990 reauthorization of the CPSC, the Senate bill proposed reducing the CPSC to three members with a quorum of two, but a temporary quorum of two was adopted instead. If a vacancy lasted longer than six months, the Commission could not establish mandatory standards or engage in rulemaking. Temporary quorum rules allowed two Commissioners from different parties to constitute a quorum for six months in 2007. The CPSIA \u00a7202(b) repeals the funding limitation to restore the CPSC to its full five-member size and prevent recent quorum problems. Section 202(c) requires the CPSC to increase full-time employees to at least 500 by October 1, 2013. CPSIA \u00a7201(b) mandates a report on funding allocation plans, including the number of investigators and personnel to be assigned to U.S. ports or overseas facilities. The CPSC is required to submit reports on its efforts to develop standards for training product safety inspectors and scientific staff publishing opportunities. Certain reports to Congress were terminated by P.L. 104-66, but the CPSC must still submit budget and legislative recommendations to Congress as per CPSIA \u00a7203. Section 204 of the CPSIA simplifies rulemaking procedures under CPSA \u00a79, FHSA, and FFA by removing the need for an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR), criticized for being overly burdensome. This change aligns with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requirements. The CPSIA \u00a7204 simplifies rulemaking procedures by eliminating the need for an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) and making technical amendments to the FHSA and FFA. References to specific authorities are updated to the CPSC. The CPSIA \u00a7204 simplifies rulemaking procedures by eliminating the need for an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) and making technical amendments to the FHSA and FFA. References to specific authorities are updated to the CPSC. Section 205 of the CPSIA requires the Inspector General of the CPSC to conduct reviews and audits to assess the CPSC's capital improvement efforts, including upgrades of its information technology system and the development of the new public safety database, and the adequacy of the accreditation and monitoring process for third-party testing laboratories. The CPSIA \u00a7205 mandates the Inspector General of the CPSC to conduct audits on conflicts of interest, ethical violations, and CPSC actions. Annual reports on findings and recommendations are to be submitted to congressional committees. The CPSC is required to establish a direct link to the Inspector General's webpage for reporting waste, fraud, or abuse within thirty days of enactment. The CPSC allows anonymous reporting of waste, fraud, or abuse. Criticisms have been raised regarding accepting industry funds for travel. CPSIA \u00a7201(a) provides funds for official travel to meetings. CPSC Chair Nord supported these amendments. The CPSC defended accepting paid travel for industry education and outreach, enabled by CPSIA amendments. Section 206 prohibits CPSC officials from accepting travel expenses from those regulated by the CPSC. Section 207 allows sharing information with government agencies. The CPSC can share information with foreign government agencies under certain conditions, maintaining confidentiality and using it for law enforcement or consumer protection purposes. Agreements can be terminated if conditions are not met, but the CPSC must still comply with federal court orders and disclose information to Congress. Foreign government agencies include multinational organizations. The CPSC can engage in employee exchanges with foreign government agencies under the CPSIA. Reimbursement for expenses incurred by the CPSC during the exchange shall be credited to the appropriations account. Foreign government agency officers or employees participating in the exchange are considered federal employees for the duration of their training. The CPSC can engage in employee exchanges with foreign government agencies under the CPSIA, with reimbursement for expenses credited to the appropriations account. Exchange participants are considered federal employees for work injury compensation, tort claims liability, ethics, and government corruption crimes. Section 237 of the CPSIA streamlines regulatory proceedings by repealing CPSA \u00a730(d). The FHSA, FFA, and PPPA provided regulatory authority before the CPSA was enacted in 1972. The CPSC often conducted cost-benefit analyses for consumer safety standards, even when not legally required. CPSIA \u00a7233 clarified that cost-benefit analysis is not required for special packaging standards under the PPPA. CPSA \u00a79(g) allows CPSC to prohibit manufacturers from stockpiling products before a safety rule takes effect. The CPSIA amended provisions to prohibit stockpiling products before safety rules take effect under any CPSC-enforced statute. It also expanded prohibited acts under CPSA \u00a719 to include sale, manufacture, distribution, or importation of regulated products. The prohibited acts under the CPSA include the sale, manufacture, distribution, or importation of non-compliant products, products subject to recalls or corrective actions, products with CPSC orders for recalls, and banned hazardous substances. Failure to comply with CPSC regulations, including providing false compliance certifications, misrepresenting information to CPSC officers, and influencing third-party laboratories during product testing. Exporting consumer products regulated by the CPSC for sale is also prohibited. The new regulations prohibit the sale of products subject to recalls or corrective actions, as well as the export of consumer products regulated by the CPSC. The CPSIA amendments prohibit violations of safety standards and banned hazardous substances in exports. Section 217 increases civil and criminal penalties under various acts, with maximum civil penalties adjusted for inflation every five years. Factors considered for penalties include the nature and gravity of the violation. The CPSC must consider mitigation of undue adverse economic impacts on small businesses when imposing civil penalties. The amendments increase criminal penalties to a maximum of five years imprisonment, fines, or both for knowing and willful violations of safety acts. Penalties may also include forfeiture of assets associated with criminal violations. Section 217 of the CPSIA removes the requirement in the CPSA that directors, officers, and agents have knowledge of a notice of noncompliance to be subject to criminal penalties. Prior to this amendment, CPSA \u00a724 allowed for enforcement actions by state attorneys general for injunctive relief. The FHSA and FFA were amended in 1990 to authorize state attorneys general to enforce consumer safety rules by obtaining injunctive relief. State attorneys general rarely used this authority, instead taking action under state consumer protection laws. The CPSIA further allows state attorneys general to bring actions in federal court for enforcement of product safety rules. State attorneys general can bring civil actions in federal court to obtain injunctive relief against prohibited acts under the CPSA, with conditions similar to other consumer protection statutes. A state must give 30-day notice to the CPSC before filing a civil action, unless immediate action is needed to protect residents from a substantial product hazard. The CPSC can intervene in these actions and appeal decisions. States cannot bring civil actions if the same violation is already subject to a federal action. The pending criminal or civil action brought by the Federal Government prohibits sharing privileged information obtained during discovery in state attorney general's actions with parties in other private civil actions arising from the same facts. State civil enforcement authority under CPSA and PPPA allows for enforcement of standards or rules, subject to procedural requirements. The CPSIA \u00a7219 adds whistleblower protections for private sector employees under the CPSA, but not for government agency employees. This new provision allows employees of manufacturers, private labelers, distributors, or retailers to seek remedies for violations. The CPSIA \u00a7219 provides whistleblower protections for employees of manufacturers, private labelers, distributors, or retailers who believe they have faced retaliation for reporting violations of CPSC laws. Employees can file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor within 180 days of the alleged retaliation. The CPSIA \u00a7219 provides whistleblower protections for employees reporting violations of CPSC laws. The Secretary of Labor must investigate complaints of retaliation within 60 days and issue findings with a preliminary relief order if merited. The defendant can object within 30 days, otherwise, the order becomes final. The new provision sets standards for burden of proof and evidence in whistleblower retaliation cases. Within 120 days of a hearing, the Secretary of Labor must issue a final relief order or denial. If retaliation is found, the responsible party must take steps to redress it, reinstate the complainant with compensation, and provide compensatory damages. The Secretary can also assess costs and fees incurred by the complainant. If the complaint is deemed frivolous, the employer may be awarded attorneys' fees. If the complaint is deemed frivolous or in bad faith, the employer may be awarded attorneys' fees. If the Secretary does not issue a final decision within 210 days of the complaint filing or within 90 days of a written determination, the complainant can seek de novo review in federal court. The court can grant relief such as reinstatement, back pay, and compensatory damages, including attorney's fees and litigation costs. Any person affected by a final administrative order can appeal to the federal appellate court in the area where the violation occurred. The Secretary of Labor can enforce the order in federal district court, granting relief like injunctive relief and compensatory damages. Additionally, a person granted relief can bring an action in federal court for compliance. The court may award court costs and fees as appropriate, and any nondiscretionary duty imposed by this section is enforceable in a mandamus proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71361. Certain provisions of the CPSA, FHSA, FFA, and PPPA establish the extent to which those acts preempt, limit, or affect any other federal, state, or local law. Section 231(a) of the CPSIA clarifies that these provisions may not be expanded, limited, or modified in any rule or regulation of the CPSC. The CPSC may not preempt any cause of action under state or local common law or state statutes regarding damage claims. The CPSC aims to prevent preemptive directives in regulations that could override state tort laws, as seen with the \"Standard for the Flammability of Mattress Sets.\" Recent preemption directives have raised concerns among opponents and legal scholars. Recent preemption directives have raised concerns among opponents and legal scholars as agencies interpret preemptive intent through directives and regulations, with federal courts divided on deference levels. Section 231(b) of the CPSIA clarifies that it does not preempt state warning requirements established before August 31, 2003. The CPSIA includes preemption provisions on state toy standards but not on state third-party testing and certification requirements. The CPSIA reduces protections for disclosure of product information by amending CPSA \u00a76. It provides safeguards for public disclosure of information on specific products, with restrictions on disclosing proprietary/trade secret information and information protected by the FOIA. Manufacturers must be notified and given the opportunity to review information before disclosure, unless public health and safety require immediate disclosure. If the CPSC disagrees with the manufacturer, it can disclose allegedly confidential or inaccurate information. The CPSIA reduces protections for disclosure of product information by amending CPSA \u00a76. Manufacturers must be notified and given the opportunity to review information before disclosure, unless public health and safety require immediate disclosure. If the CPSC disagrees with the manufacturer, it can disclose allegedly confidential or inaccurate information over the objections of the manufacturer, who may then sue in federal district court to enjoin disclosure. Certain types of information disclosure are exempt from these safeguards. Consumer advocates and retailer critics of this provision prior to amendments made by the CPSIA asserted that these safeguards unnecessarily hindered the disclosure of safety and recall information, while industry advocates sought stronger protections with regard to substantiation and disclosure of information on product categories with problems that are not common to all manufacturers. Section 211 of the CPSIA reduces prior disclosure protections in several ways. The CPSC regulations require a manufacturer/labeler to respond within 15 days after being notified of the opportunity to mark information as confidential. The amendment reduces the time for the CPSC to notify a manufacturer/labeler of an intended disclosure from 30 to 15 days. The CPSC regulations now require manufacturers/labelers to respond within 15 days after being notified of an intended disclosure. The time for the CPSC to notify a manufacturer/labeler of an intended disclosure has been reduced from 30 to 15 days. The CPSC is no longer required to publish in the Federal Register a finding that public health and safety require a lesser period of notice to the manufacturer. Exemptions from disclosure protections now include violations of any rule or law enforced by the CPSC. The CPSC can request expedited consideration in court to stop the disclosure of inaccurate information, but not for protected or confidential information. A new database on product safety will be established within two years, addressing concerns raised by opponents. Acting Chair Nord had criticized the mandatory database previously. The CPSC Acting Chair Nord criticized the mandatory database under H.R. 4040 for allowing publication of consumer complaints without vetting for accuracy. Proponents argued that the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration already has a similar database. The CPSC currently maintains the NEISS system for injury data. The CPSC is required to establish a comprehensive database under the CPSIA, integrating data from various sources including consumers. The current data systems, like NEISS, are deemed inadequate by the GAO. The CPSC must submit a detailed plan to Congress within 180 days of the CPSIA enactment for the database's establishment and integration into their IT improvement plans. The CPSC is mandated to establish a database under the CPSIA, integrating data from multiple sources including consumers. The plan must include an implementation schedule and a public awareness campaign. Within 18 months of submission, the database must be operational, containing reports of harm related to consumer products and substances regulated by the CPSC. This includes information from consumers, government agencies, healthcare professionals, child service providers, and public safety entities, as well as data from recall notices and manufacturer comments. The new section establishes requirements for information to be included in reports submitted to the CPSC and for the mode of submission. Information on the database must be sortable and retrievable by various fields. The CPSC does not guarantee the accuracy of the database contents and may not disclose the name and address of a person submitting a report of harm. The CPSC requires reports to be submitted with consent for verification. Safeguards do not apply to database disclosure of reports from consumers, health-care providers, etc. Safeguards apply to database information from manufacturers, distributors, or retailers. Reports must be available on the database within 15 business days. Duplicative or inaccurate information will not be included or will be corrected within 7 business days. The CPSC must redact protected information on the database and notify manufacturers of any non-protected information. Manufacturers can request removal of information through legal action. The CPSC also submits an annual report on the database's operation to congressional committees. The GAO will analyze the usefulness of the database, its cost, and user engagement within two years of its establishment. $25,000,000 was authorized for database establishment and maintenance. Manufacturers, distributors, and retailers must report non-compliant products to the CPSC. Section 214(a)(2)(A) of the CPSIA expands the scope of CPSA \u00a715(b) to require manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to notify the CPSC about products that do not comply with any CPSC regulations. Section 214(a)(2)(C) further amends CPSA \u00a715(b) to specify that notifications regarding non-compliance with certain regulations may not lead to criminal prosecution. The FHSA, FFA, or PPPA cannot be used for criminal prosecution under the FHSA unless there is intent to defraud or mislead. The provision aims to prevent unjust results by requiring knowledge, intent, or willfulness for criminal enforcement. This is to ensure no unintended barriers to information flow to the Commission. The CPSA criminal offenses require knowledge and willfulness. The CPSA criminal offenses generally require willfulness, except for the FFA offense of failure to notify the CPSC of non-compliant product exports. Section 214(a)(3) of the CPSIA enhances public notification by allowing the CPSC to order manufacturers, distributors, or retailers to give notice of substantial product hazards through various means. The CPSC has the authority to require notices in languages other than English to protect the public. Section 214 of the CPSIA expands the CPSC's authority to order corrective action plans and recalls, including defining \"substantial product hazard\" more broadly and enhancing recall authority. Section 214 of the CPSIA expands CPSC authority to order corrective action plans and recalls for hazardous products, allowing orders to cease distribution and notify relevant parties without a prior hearing. It also strengthens CPSC authorities related to corrective action plans by allowing orders for public notification. The CPSC's expanded authority under the CPSIA allows for ordering corrective actions and recalls for hazardous products, including public notice and actions deemed in the public interest. This includes orders to conform with regulations, standards, or bans, and requires approval of corrective action plans submitted to the CPSC. The CPSC can amend plans if found ineffective and must consider changes to functionality in repairs or replacements. The CPSIA grants the CPSC authority to order corrective actions and recalls for hazardous products, including public notice and actions in the public interest. It requires approval of corrective action plans and allows for amendments if found ineffective. The CPSC must consider changes to functionality in repairs or replacements and can revoke approval if obligations are not met, prohibiting distribution of the product. CPSIA \u00a7214(c) mandates the CPSC to establish guidelines for recall notices within 180 days, detailing information to aid consumers in identifying hazards and remedies. The CPSIA requires manufacturers, importers, retailers, and distributors to provide information on hazardous products to the CPSC, including model numbers, product names, descriptions, hazard details, manufacturer and distributor identification, manufacturing and sale dates, injury reports, consumer remedies, and other necessary information. Additionally, importers, retailers, and distributors must identify manufacturers upon request, while manufacturers must identify retailers and distributors. The CPSIA requires manufacturers to provide information on hazardous products to the CPSC, including model numbers, product names, hazard details, and manufacturer identification. Section 224 of the CPSIA adds a new section 41 to the CPSA, requiring the CPSC to identify products for which the cost of destruction exceeds bond amounts under customs laws and recommend a sufficient bond. The CPSIA mandates manufacturers to report hazardous products to the CPSC, including model numbers, product names, and hazard details. Section 209 of the CPSIA amends reporting requirements to include recall orders and voluntary actions by manufacturers. The GAO must submit a report on the feasibility of requirements within 180 days of enactment. Within one year of the CPSIA enactment, the annual report must include progress reports on corrective action plans, injury statistics for product hazards, and consumer communications. CPSIA authorizes CPSC officers to inspect proprietary laboratories and bans non-compliant product exports unless permitted by the importing country. Notification to the importing country is required before shipment. The CPSC must notify the importing country of the impending shipment and may take action if import permission is not received within thirty days. Restrictions do not apply to products refused admission into the US and permitted for export. Amendments to the CPSA now require a risk assessment methodology for identifying consumer product shipments intended for import. The CPSC is required to develop a risk assessment methodology using the ITDS to identify consumer product shipments likely to violate import laws. The methodology will be incorporated into the CPSC's information modernization plan and shared to identify noncompliant products. A report must be submitted to congressional committees within 180 days of completion. The CPSC is mandated to develop a risk assessment methodology using the ITDS to identify noncompliant consumer product shipments. A report must be submitted to congressional committees within 180 days, including a plan for implementation, assessment of statutory authority needs, required appropriations, changes to the CPSC-CBP memorandum of understanding, access to the Automated Targeting System, and effectiveness of the International Trade Data System in enhancing cooperation. Additionally, within one year, a plan for information sharing and coordination with CBP to improve enforcement and consumer protection must be developed, considering the number of CPSC personnel stationed at U.S. ports. The CPSC is required to develop a risk assessment methodology using the ITDS to identify noncompliant consumer product shipments. This includes specifying rules for the Automated Targeting System, cooperation with CBP, and resources for effective implementation. Section 223 of the CPSIA adds a new subsection (j) to CPSA \u00a715, requiring the CPSC to specify rules for identifying noncompliant shipments. Section 223 of the CPSIA adds a new subsection (j) to CPSA \u00a715, requiring the CPSC to specify characteristics of substantial product hazards for consumer products. Adversely affected individuals can petition for judicial review within 60 days. Amendments in CPSA \u00a717(e) now mandate the destruction of refused import products unless export is permitted within ninety days. The CPSA now requires manufacturers of imports to comply with inspection and recordkeeping requirements, or their products will be refused admission.
