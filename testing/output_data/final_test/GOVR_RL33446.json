    "content": "The military compensation system includes cash compensation, noncash compensation, and deferred compensation. This report focuses on cash compensation for active component Armed Forces members, covering elements, rates, historical increases, comparability with civilian pay, and additional compensation for those serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. Cash compensation for military servicemembers includes basic pay, allowances, bonuses, and additional pay for demanding duty. Noncash compensation consists of benefits like medical care, housing, educational benefits, and access to commissaries and exchanges. Deferred compensation includes retired pay, retiree health care, and other benefits like Thrift Savings Plan participation. Matching contributions were not provided by the government until 2018. Recent changes to the military retirement system in 2018 made matching contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan a key component of servicemembers' deferred compensation. The basic compensation package for all servicemembers includes basic pay, housing and subsistence allowances, free medical and dental care, paid annual leave, and other benefits. Additional cash compensation can be received based on occupational specialty and duty assignment. Basic pay is the largest component of cash compensation for servicemembers. Regular Military Compensation (RMC) is the main component of cash compensation for servicemembers, including basic pay, housing and subsistence allowances, and tax benefits. RMC is a defined measure used for comparing military cash compensation with civilian salary levels. Military compensation is structured differently than civilian compensation, but RMC provides a more complete understanding. Regular Military Compensation (RMC) is crucial for understanding servicemembers' cash compensation. It includes basic pay, housing allowances, and tax benefits. Basic pay is the largest part of RMC, varying by rank and years of service. Servicemembers also receive housing benefits like Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) or Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA). The Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) or Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) is provided to servicemembers to offset housing costs, with one-third receiving government-provided housing. The amount of BAH is determined by paygrade, location, and dependency status. The Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is provided to servicemembers to offset housing costs based on paygrade, location, and dependency status. BAH rates are determined by the type of accommodation needed and geographic location, ensuring comparable housing for servicemembers of similar status. Rates are paid regardless of actual housing expenses incurred. The Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) is based on paygrade, location, and dependents, calculated differently from BAH. OHA covers actual housing expenses up to a maximum amount, with an allowance for utilities. Servicemembers may receive a one-time allowance for move-in expenses. Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) provides a flat rate monthly payment for food costs. In 2019, enlisted personnel receive $369.39 a month for BAS, while officers receive $254.39. There have been calls to merge BAS with basic pay to simplify military compensation. Certain military compensation is tax-exempt, providing a tax benefit for servicemembers. Military allowances and in-kind benefits like housing and healthcare are not subject to federal income tax. The federal tax advantage for servicemembers varies based on their unique tax situation. RMC does not encompass all compensation elements, such as special pays, bonuses, and nonmonetary benefits. Basic pay, BAH, and BAS are components of RMC, with BAH and BAS subject to periodic adjustments. Section 1009 of Title 37 provides an annual increase in basic pay indexed to the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The military raise was tied to ECI plus an additional half percentage point from 2000-2006, and equal to ECI from 2007 onwards. The President can specify an alternative pay adjustment, and Congress can pass legislation for annual pay raises. Congress can pass legislation to specify the annual pay raise, superseding automatic adjustments. The pay raise is tied to the Employment Cost Index (ECI) with a lag due to the federal budget process. Despite the statutory formula, Congress has often overridden automatic adjustments to specify pay raises for certain years. Congress did not specify percentage increases for some years, allowing the statutory formula or presidential adjustment to take effect. The statutory formula serves as a benchmark for developing alternatives. The Basic Allowance for Housing is set by the Secretary of Defense for servicemembers in the US who do not have government quarters. The Department of Defense sets BAH rates for military housing areas based on the costs of adequate housing for civilians with comparable income levels. Increases in BAH are tied to local housing costs, not affected by the annual ECI increase. DOD conducts annual surveys to determine housing cost changes. The Department of Defense adjusts BAH rates based on annual surveys of housing cost changes in each MHA. A \"save pay\" provision prevents decreases from applying to current personnel, only affecting new assignments. Congress has modified the law regarding the coverage of housing costs by BAH. The Department of Defense adjusted housing cost coverage from 80% to 100% with the introduction of BAH in 1997. Recent legislation allows for a 5% reduction in BAH payments by 2019. BAS rates are uniform for enlisted personnel and officers. The Department of Defense introduced Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) in 1997, adjusting housing cost coverage from 80% to 100%. Recent legislation allows for a 5% reduction in BAH payments by 2019. Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) rates are uniform for enlisted personnel and officers, adjusted annually based on changes in food prices. Recent increases in basic pay for military personnel have been set at 2.6% in 2019, with the final increase across-the-board. The FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act waived the automatic increase in basic pay under the statutory formula and set the pay raise at 2.6%. The FY2018 NDAA required a 2.4% increase in basic pay to go into effect. The FY2018 NDAA required a 2.4% increase in basic pay for military personnel to go into effect, superseding President Trump's alternative adjustment of 2.1%. The final increase across-the-board was set at 2.4% on January 1, 2018. The FY2017 NDAA set the pay raise for military personnel at 2.1%, overriding President Obama's proposed 1.6% increase. President Obama signed the bill into law on December 23, 2016, resulting in a 2.1% increase in basic pay for all servicemembers. The FY2017 NDAA increased basic pay for all servicemembers by 2.1% on January 1, 2017, overriding President Obama's proposed 1.6% increase. The final increase was set at 2.1% across-the-board. The House and Senate versions of the FY2016 NDAA had different proposed pay increases, but President Obama ultimately specified a 1.3% increase. Generals and admirals were excluded from this pay raise. Section 601 of the FY2016 NDAA set the final pay increase at 1.3% across-the-board, excluding generals and admirals. The House and Senate versions had different proposed increases, but President Obama specified a 1.3% increase. Generals and admirals were excluded from this raise. The final version of the NDAA for 2014 and 2013 specified a 1% increase in pay across-the-board, excluding generals and admirals. President Obama invoked 37 U.S.C. 1009(e) to set the pay raise for 2014 at 1.0%. The FY2013 NDAA specified a 1.7% pay raise, the FY2012 NDAA had a 1.6% raise, and the FY2011 NDAA supported a 1.4% raise. Both the Senate-reported bill and the final versions were silent on the pay raise issue in each year. The statutory formula for pay raises in previous years varied, with final increases ranging from 1.4% to 3.9% across-the-board. The FY2008 NDAA initially specified a 3.0% raise, but a presidential veto led to a 3.5% increase retroactive to January 1. In 2004, the final increase was 3.7% across-the-board, with an administration request for an average of 4.1%. In 2005, the final increase was 3.5% across-the-board. In 2006, the final increase was 3.1% across-the-board. In 2007, the final increase was 2.2% across-the-board with an additional targeted pay raise. In 2004, the statutory formula specified a 3.7% minimum increase, with the administration requesting an average of 4.1%. The final increase was 3.7% minimum, 4.15% average, and 6.25% maximum for some senior NCOs. In 2003, the statutory formula was 4.1% with the administration requesting increases between 5.0% and 6.5% for certain officers. The final increase matched the administration request. In 2002, the statutory formula was 4.6%, with proposed increases of at least 5% and no more than 15% for some individuals. In 2001, the NDAA specified a 5% minimum increase, with final increases ranging between 5 and 10% depending on pay grade and years of service. The statutory formula for that year was 3.7%, with an across-the-board increase of 3.7% effective January 1, 2001, and additional raises of 1.0 to 5.5% for mid-grade officer and enlisted personnel effective July 1, 2001. The NDAA in 2001 specified a 5% minimum increase in military pay, with final increases ranging between 5 and 10% based on pay grade and years of service. The statutory formula for that year was 3.7%, with an across-the-board increase of 3.7% effective January 1, 2001, and additional raises of 1.0 to 5.5% for mid-grade officer and enlisted personnel effective July 1, 2001. In 1999, the final increase was 3.6%, aligning with the approved percentage increase for federal GS civilians. Pay has been a concern for Congress when military services struggle to recruit or retain personnel of necessary quality, or when the standard of living for career personnel is perceived as unfair compared to civilians. Military recruiting is influenced by economic factors, with low unemployment making it harder to recruit and high unemployment making military service more appealing. Recruiting and retention in the Armed Forces were strong from 2010 to 2017, leading to discussions of possible compensation cuts. However, with a strong economy, recruiting has become more challenging, potentially leading to increased advocacy for compensation increases. Increased advocacy for compensation increases in the military is often argued in moral or ethical terms, emphasizing the importance of mission accomplishment and professional ethic. Despite previous compensation increases in the 2000s, analysts find military compensation robust compared to civilian counterparts. The issue of a military-civilian \"pay gap\" raises questions about how to determine and measure the gap, whether civilians or military personnel are paid more, and if action is necessary to address the gap. A wide range of studies have compared military and civilian compensation over the past decades. It is challenging to determine if there is a pay gap due to the different structures of compensation systems. Military compensation includes various components with varying taxability and noncash benefits like health care and commissary access. Comparing military and civilian pay values is complex and lacks a common index or indicator. Military compensation includes noncash benefits like health care and commissary access, along with a deferred compensation package. Comparing military ranks and pay grades to civilian jobs is challenging due to the different conditions of service. Military service conditions are often more arduous than civilian employment, with factors like hazardous duties and frequent moves. Comparing military and civilian compensation is challenging due to different job characteristics. Military jobs are more hazardous, require frequent moves, and lack flexibility compared to civilian jobs. Members of the armed forces are always on duty, unable to resign or negotiate pay. They receive extensive training paid for by the government and have access to more family support programs. Quantifying the differences in rewards between military and civilian personnel is challenging due to varying methodologies for calculating compensation. When comparing military and civilian compensation, various factors such as different pay elements, specificity levels, and occupational specialties can lead to diverging results. For example, Army colonels may be paid similarly to federal civil service GS-15s or private sector managers in certain fields. However, comparisons focusing on highly paid private sector specialties may not be as favorable. Factors like age, gender, years of experience, and education levels can also impact the comparison results. Various comparisons of military and civilian compensation exist, showing a gap that favors civilian pay levels, refutes its existence, or favors the military. Reports lack precision in identifying aspects compared, indexes used, or time covered. One estimation indicates a pay gap in favor of civilians, with rough pay parity in 1982 but military basic pay not keeping up with civilian pay increases since then. The pay gap of about 13% in 1999 was gradually eliminated by 2011 but reappeared in 2014, with military pay estimated to be 2.6% lower than civilian pay in 2018. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found in 2010 that civilian pay rose about 2 percent more than military pay between 1982 and the beginning of 2010 when considering a broader measure of military cash compensation. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that military cash compensation has exceeded private-sector wages by 11 percent since 1982, when including allowances for housing and food. Comparing actual compensation levels of military personnel to civilians with similar education and experience is another approach to estimating the pay gap. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that military cash compensation has exceeded private-sector wages by 11 percent since 1982, including allowances for housing and food. A study compared the earnings of military personnel to civilians with similar education and experience, highlighting the importance of pay at the 70th percentile of comparably educated civilians to recruit and retain quality personnel. Congress approved pay table reforms to address situations where servicemembers fell below this compensation goal, with general increases in basic pay and the elimination of \"out-of-pocket\" housing expenses pushing servicemember RMC up. In 2009, military compensation exceeded civilian wages for enlisted members with various education levels. Average RMC for officers also surpassed civilian wages for those with a bachelor's or graduate-level degree. Efforts have been made to slow the growth of military compensation since then. Recent initiatives have included increases in basic pay and reductions in BAH payments. A 2018 RAND report compared military compensation to civilian pay levels, showing RMC remained above the 70th percentile for educated civilians in 2016. The 11th QRMC compared military compensation to civilian pay levels, showing high percentiles. Methodological differences contribute to discrepancies. Some argue that the key issue is the competitiveness of military compensation in the labor market. The 11th QRMC compared military compensation to civilian pay levels, considering factors like recruiting difficulties and retention rates. Other factors such as unemployment, political environment, and deployment frequency also play a role in determining optimal military pay levels. Members of the Armed Forces serving in Iraq or Afghanistan are eligible for additional compensation such as Hostile Fire Pay (HFP) or Imminent Danger Pay (IDP) to compensate for physical danger. HFP is $225 per month, while IDP is paid daily at $7.50. Soldiers can receive either HFP or IDP, not both simultaneously. Iraq and Afghanistan are considered imminent danger locations where IDP is granted. Certain areas surrounding Iraq and Afghanistan were formerly designated as imminent danger locations, but DOD revoked this in 2014. Military personnel serving in these countries for over 30 days are eligible for Hardship Duty Pay (HDP) and Family Separation Allowance (FSA). HDP compensates for the demands of duty, while FSA provides special pay for servicemembers with dependents who are separated from their families for more than 30 days. The Family Separation Allowance (FSA) provides special pay for U.S. military personnel with dependents who are separated from their families for more than 30 days. The allowance reimburses for extra expenses resulting from separation and covers the costs of maintaining a home overseas. Eligibility requires being separated for 30 continuous days, with retroactive application once the threshold is met. The rate is set at $250 per month, with an additional per diem of $105 for incidental expenses in Iraq and Afghanistan. Military personnel serving in combat zones receive a per diem of $105 per month for incidental expenses. They are eligible for the combat zone tax exclusion, which exempts their compensation from federal income tax. This benefit also applies to state income tax in most states. Military personnel serving in combat zones receive a per diem of $105 per month for incidental expenses and are eligible for the combat zone tax exclusion, which exempts their compensation from federal income tax. They may also qualify for a reenlistment or retention bonus without federal income tax, and can participate in the Savings Deposit Program to earn a guaranteed 10% interest on deposits up to $10,000. Survivors of military personnel who die on active duty are also provided benefits. Survivors of military personnel who die on active duty are eligible for various benefits, including a $100,000 death gratuity, up to $400,000 in Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, unpaid pay and allowances, government housing or BAH for one year, three years of TRICARE coverage, burial expenses, survivor benefit annuities, and access to Commissary and Exchange facilities. Survivors of military personnel may be eligible for various benefits, including death gratuity, life insurance, TRICARE coverage, burial expenses, survivor benefit annuities, and access to Commissary and Exchange facilities. Each benefit has its own eligibility criteria, and survivors may need to consider offsets between different annuities. For more detailed information on eligibility, refer to the Department of Defense's A Survivor's Guide to Benefits."
