    "content": "The Department of Defense operates the Military Health System, which includes the TRICARE program providing healthcare to 9.5 million beneficiaries. Services are offered in military treatment facilities or through civilian providers. Active duty servicemembers are entitled to care in any MTF, while dependents and retirees may receive care on a space-available basis. TRICARE offers health plan options based on patient capacity, beneficiary category, and enrollment status. Beneficiaries can receive care from civilian providers if not available at a military treatment facility. Options include TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life, with premium-based plans for specific groups. Additional benefits include pharmacy, dental, and vision plans. The report addresses TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Retired Reserve for reservists and their families, along with limitations on their participation. TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) and TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR) are premium-based health plans available worldwide for members of the Selected Reserve and retired reserve components, respectively. TRS was established in 2005, while TRR was established in 2010 as a coverage option for gray area reservists. These plans are similar to TRICARE Select, with monthly premiums, deductibles, and co-pays for care from network providers. TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) and TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR) are premium-based health plans available worldwide for members of the Selected Reserve and retired reserve components. TRS requires a 28% cost share from servicemembers, while TRR enrollees pay the full premium determined by the Secretary of Defense. DOD updates premiums annually on an actuarial basis. As of FY2018, 383,683 beneficiaries were covered by TRS and 9,019 by TRR. Prior to 2006, TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) availability was limited to members of the Selected Reserve after serving on continuous active duty in support of a contingency operation for 90 or more days. TRS coverage was also limited to the lesser of one year or one year for each consecutive deployment due to injury, illness, or disease incurred while deployed. The TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) eligibility criteria were expanded by the John Warner NDAA for FY2007, removing requirements such as the military service obligation agreement and active duty service length. Additionally, a prohibition was added for Selected Reserve members and their families who are eligible for the FEHB program. Retired reserve members qualify for TRR if they meet certain criteria under Title 10, U.S. Code. The TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) eligibility criteria were expanded by the John Warner NDAA for FY2007, removing requirements such as the military service obligation agreement and active duty service length. Retired reserve members qualify for TRR if they meet certain criteria under Title 10, U.S. Code, and are not eligible for the FEHB program. This restriction also applies to qualified retired members of the reserve components and their family members. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that about 13.7% of the Selected Reserve force is prohibited from enrolling in TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) due to eligibility for FEHB. Speculation suggests this prohibition may be related to potential cost increases. Neither DOD nor CBO has published similar estimates for TRICARE Retired Reserve (TRR). The Office of Management and Budget expressed cost concerns with the proposal to expand TRICARE eligibility to all Selected Reserve members and their families, estimating a cost of $400 million in FY 2007 and $3.6 billion from FY 2007 through FY 2011. The Administration strongly opposes this expansion and urges Congress to eliminate these unfunded expansions to ensure a sound fiscal foundation for the system. Reservists and their family members can get health insurance through FEHB, Medicaid, private insurance, or employer-sponsored insurance. Reservists on federal active duty for over 30 days can use TRICARE programs. FEHB has different premium rates based on location and coverage option. Reservists eligible for FEHB cannot participate in TRS or TRR. Reservists not eligible for FEHB can join TRS or TRR. Certain military service organizations advocate for the removal of the statutory prohibition for TRS or TRR to create equality among all members of the Selected Reserves. They argue that TRS is a more affordable option than FEHB, which has higher premiums. Reservists have expressed discontent with the law that disqualifies Selected Reserve members from purchasing TRS if they are eligible for FEHB. DOD supports repealing the FEHB exclusion but made no recommendation concerning it. DOD fully supports repealing the FEHB exclusion for TRS or TRR, but has not made any recommendations on the issue. Expanding TRS eligibility would have cost implications for DOD and other federal agencies funding FEHB benefits. CBO estimated savings to the federal government by removing the TRS prohibition, but increases in mandatory spending would need to be offset by direct spending cuts or revenue increases. CBO estimates that expanding TRS eligibility would increase mandatory costs by about $40 million per year starting in 2030. However, there would be savings in discretionary spending, resulting in a net reduction of about $250 million per year in discretionary costs for the government starting in 2030. This would impact FEHB premiums for federal retirees and active postal employees. The government's share of the premium for FEHB would be affected by Section 703, impacting spending for other FEHB beneficiaries. DOD reports high satisfaction among reservists and their spouses enrolled in TRS, with many finding no difference or better quality of care compared to civilian health plans. Some challenges include difficulty in finding providers accepting TRICARE and maintaining continuity of care. Congress has considered proposals to eliminate statutory prohibitions related to TRS and TRR, but none have been enacted yet."
