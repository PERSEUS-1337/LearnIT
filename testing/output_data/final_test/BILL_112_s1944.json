The definitions in this section clarify that a guarantee fee includes fees charged by the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Average fees refer to the average contractual fee rate of single-family guaranty arrangements entered into during 2011. The Director shall require each enterprise to charge a guarantee fee for timely payment on mortgages for residential properties. This fee is based on upfront cash payments over an estimated average life, expressed in basis points, and is consistent with the Federal Housing Finance Agency's annual report on guarantee fees. The Director determines the increase in guarantee fees to reflect risk and capital costs, with a minimum average increase of 12.5 basis points per year. Enterprises are prohibited from offsetting fees to mortgage originators, borrowers, or investors. The Director also has the authority to limit the offer of guarantees. The Director has the authority to prohibit enterprises from offering guarantees inconsistent with requirements or increasing risk through lower underwriting standards. Fees collected must be deposited into the Treasury and are subject to appropriation. The Director may allow enterprises to gradually increase guarantee fees over a 2-year period to comply with the section, ensuring uniform pricing among lenders, adjusting based on risk levels, and considering financial market conditions. This does not undermine the minimum required increase. The Director requires each enterprise to provide annual reports to Congress detailing changes in guarantee fees negotiated with lenders, borrower risk levels, and adjustments to ensure compliance with regulations. The reports must also assess how these fee changes meet the requirements set forth. The Director enforces compliance with guarantee fee regulations by requiring adjustments based on provided information. Noncompliance for two consecutive years results in a penalty of no guarantee provision for a specified period. Enforcement actions can be initiated by the Director if necessary. The Director can enforce compliance with guarantee fee regulations by taking enforcement actions against an enterprise as deemed necessary. The provisions of this section will expire on October 1, 2021."
