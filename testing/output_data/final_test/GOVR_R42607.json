    "content": "The Consolidated and Continuing Appropriations Act, signed into law in March 2013, provided $607.7 billion in discretionary budget authority for the Department of Defense for FY2013, which exceeded the funding cap set by the Budget Control Act and triggered a sequestration of up to $35.0 billion. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request included $646.97 billion for the \"national defense\" function of the federal budget. The federal budget for the \"national defense\" function included funding for Department of Defense global operations, defense-related nuclear programs by the Department of Energy, and other defense activities. The discretionary DOD budget authority requested $613.93 billion, with $525.45 billion for base defense costs and $88.48 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. Additionally, there was discretionary budget authority for DOE defense-related programs, FBI national security programs, and other smaller accounts. The Administration's proposed DOD budget for FY2013 included a decrease in total funding, mainly due to reduced spending on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The base budget request was $5.2 billion less than the previous year and $45.3 billion less than initially projected. These reductions were part of the Administration's plan to cut federal spending as required by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 required a reduction in federal spending, including a significant decrease in DOD budgets. The plan aimed to cut $259.4 billion from DOD base budgets from FY2012 through FY2017 and a total of $486.9 billion for FY2012-FY2021. Additional deficit reduction measures totaling $1.2 trillion through FY2021 were also mandated. In FY2013, an across-the-board cut in budget authority was required. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandated significant cuts in federal spending, including a $59 billion reduction in the National Defense budget for FY2013. This sequester would result in equal percentage cuts across all programs, projects, and activities. If the lowered spending caps remain in place, an additional $515 billion would be cut from defense budgets over the next 10 years. The Obama Administration's FY2013 DOD budget plan aimed to address spending limits set by the Budget Control Act and refocus defense planning as troops withdrew from Iraq and Afghanistan. New strategic guidance emphasized sizing forces for major aggression campaigns rather than prolonged stability operations. The Obama Administration's FY2013 DOD budget plan aimed to address spending limits set by the Budget Control Act and refocus defense planning as troops withdrew from Iraq and Afghanistan. The plan includes a shift of DOD resources towards naval and air forces in the Asia-Pacific region, with a higher priority on deploying U.S. forces to the Pacific and around Asia while scaling back deployments in Europe. This involves withdrawing and disbanding two Army brigade combat teams in Germany, maintaining a rotating force of up to 2,500 Marines in northern Australia, stationing littoral combat ships in Singapore, and deploying smaller patrol craft in Bahrain. Operations in the region would heavily rely on air and naval forces. The Obama Administration's FY2013 DOD budget plan involves a shift of resources towards naval and air forces in the Asia-Pacific region. This includes retiring older cargo planes and cutting shipbuilding budgets, but also retaining aircraft carriers and adding ships to focus on the Pacific region. Plans also include eliminating or retiring major combat units and weapons systems by FY2017, such as Army brigade combat teams, Marine battalion landing teams, Navy cruisers, and amphibious landing ships. The Obama Administration's FY2013 DOD budget plan involves retiring older cargo planes, fighter squadrons, amphibious landing ships, and surveillance drones. The plan aims to shift resources towards naval and air forces in the Asia-Pacific region while maintaining a high level of readiness for the remaining forces. The Administration plans to reduce the active-duty force by 21,600 personnel in FY2013 and by a total of 102,400 by the end of FY2017, with most reductions coming from the Army and Marine Corps. This plan would remove the personnel added for deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. The FY2013 budget request included a 1.7% increase in service members' \"basic pay.\" The Administration's plan includes reducing the active-duty force by 21,600 personnel in FY2013 and by a total of 102,400 by the end of FY2017, with most reductions from the Army and Marine Corps. The plan also involves providing basic pay raises below the anticipated ECI increase in the following years to manage budgetary limits without freezing or cutting service members' pay. The Administration projected $16.5 billion in savings from military compensation changes over a five-year period. Fee increases were proposed for TRICARE beneficiaries to address rising costs in the Military Health Program, which had doubled to $48.7 billion by FY2013. The FY2013 budget request includes controversial fee increases and pharmacy co-pays for TRICARE beneficiaries, with proposed savings of $1.8 billion. The package also indexes future fee changes to the National Health Expenditures index. Compared to the projected FY2013 budget in 2011, procurement and R&D accounts saw a 12.5% reduction. The DOD's combined procurement and R&D budget in FY2010 was 60% higher than in FY2001, leading to debates on whether spending on acquisition can be reduced while relying on previously built-up capital stocks. Some argue that past procurement spending was necessary for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, equipment replacements, and modifications to existing platforms. The Administration is prioritizing weapons programs and making cuts in planned spending. They are sustaining funding for high-priority programs like the development of a new long-range bomber. The program announced in February 2013 would save $24 billion in FY2013 and a total of $94 billion over FY2013-FY2017 by terminating procurement of some items before the originally planned total number was acquired. The Department of Defense plans to achieve savings in procurement by restructuring programs, slowing production timelines, and justifying reductions based on delays and acceptable risks. The Administration's FY2013 war costs request is $26.6 billion less than FY2012, reflecting the end of combat operations in Iraq and the reduction of troops in Afghanistan. The FY2013 budget for the Department of Defense included a reduction of U.S. troops in Afghanistan to 68,000 by the end of the fiscal year. President Obama's goal of reducing troop numbers was met, and the final NDAA authorized $648.7 billion for DOD and defense-related activities, slightly more than the administration's request. The final bill authorizes $527.5 billion, a compromise between the House and Senate versions. It reduces war costs and Energy Department nuclear program funding. Both House and Senate bills make few additions to Administration's proposed levels due to strict earmark rules. The House version would have added over $4 billion to overturn some Administration costs. The final bill authorizes $527.5 billion, a compromise between the House and Senate versions. It reduces war costs and Energy Department nuclear program funding. The Senate-passed bill aimed to reverse some of the Administration's DOD spending cuts, while the House version would have added over $4 billion to overturn some costs. Both the House-passed H.R. 4310 and the Senate committee's S. 3254 propose budget additions offset by reductions in certain programs. The bills aim to use unspent funds from prior years to cover part of the FY2013 budget. Both bills authorize a 1.7% military pay raise. The Armed Services Committees express concern in their reports on the FY2013 NDAA. In the FY2013 NDAA, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees expressed concern about the Administration's plan to reduce Army and Marine Corps personnel by 92,000 by FY2017. Both bills approved reductions in active-duty personnel for the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps in FY2013. The bills also included provisions to block the disbanding of Air Force units and retirement of over 300 aircraft. Air Force Secretary Donley deferred proposed changes, and Defense Secretary Panetta agreed to defer any changes to the Air Force's force structure. Secretary Panetta deferred changes to the Air Force's force structure, including those authorized and funded in prior budgets, until Congress completes work on the FY2013 budget. The House-passed bill authorized additional personnel for the Air Force and reserve components to staff units slated for disbanding, along with funding for C-27 cargo planes and RQ-4 Block 30 Global Hawk drones. The Senate-passed bill also authorized more personnel for the Air Force and included provisions to add $1.40 billion to maintain certain programs. The Senate bill did not challenge the Administration's proposal to dispose of the C-27s and Global Hawk Block 30s, rescinding $544 million for Global Hawk. The conference report on H.R. 4310 added $636 million and 5,040 personnel to retain the current force structure and continue operating C-27s and Global Hawk Block 30s. The enacted version of the bill did not flatly prohibit changes to the force structure, mandating the creation of a commission for long-term recommendations on USAF force structure. The House-passed version of H.R. 4310 would have prevented the Navy from decommissioning most Aegis cruisers and amphibious landing ships, except for the USS Port Royal which sustained damage in 2009. The bill also included additional funding to operate and upgrade three cruisers slated for retirement in FY2013, while approving a reduction in Navy end-strength. The Senate bill added no funds to the request but included a provision to retain the \"operational capability\" of ships slated for early retirement. The conference report on H.R. 4310 barred the retirement of cruisers and amphibious ships, adding $629 million for operation and upgrade of four cruisers, including the damaged Port Royal. Both House and Senate Armed Services Committees expressed concern over the Administration's plan to cut. The House and Senate versions of the defense authorization act expressed concern over the Administration's plan to cut 92,000 active-duty personnel from the Army and Marine Corps by the end of FY2017. Both committees approved cuts for FY2013 but were worried about the pace of reductions while troops were still deployed in Afghanistan. The House bill included a provision to limit personnel cuts in the following years. The House and Senate versions of the defense authorization act expressed concern over the Administration's plan to cut 92,000 active-duty personnel from the Army and Marine Corps by the end of FY2017. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed DOD to include predictions and assessments related to personnel reductions in their annual budget requests for FY2014-FY2017. This provision would slow the planned drawdown in ground forces, increasing military personnel and health care costs by over $500 million in 2014 and $1.9 billion through 2019. The House and Senate expressed concern over the Administration's plan to cut active-duty personnel from the Army and Marine Corps. The final version of the bill included a provision allowing a reduction in active-duty manpower by no more than 15,000 for the Army and 5,000 for the Marine Corps annually from 2014 through 2017. The bill did not authorize proposed new fees and fee increases for TRICARE beneficiaries and retirees. The House bill proposed raising TRICARE-for-Life premiums for military retirees based on a three-tier model linked to retired pay, adjusting the catastrophic cap to the National Health Expenditure index, increasing annual enrollment fees for TRICARE Prime, and introducing fees for other TRICARE plans. Additionally, it suggested raising pharmacy co-payments for brand-name and non-formulary drugs at a lower rate than current law allows, with future adjustments tied to retiree cost-of-living adjustments. The House bill proposed changes to TRICARE-for-Life premiums, catastrophic cap, enrollment fees, and pharmacy co-payments. The Secretary of Defense would conduct a pilot program using the national mail-order pharmacy program for TRICARE beneficiaries. The bill would add $1.21 billion to the budget to offset anticipated savings from TRICARE changes not made by the House bill. S. 3254 would allow for increased TRICARE pharmacy co-payments and authorize additional funds for DOD's health care program. The conference report on H.R. 4310 would set new cost-sharing rates for TRICARE pharmacy benefits from 2013 to 2022. The conference report for fiscal year 2013 set new cost-sharing rates for TRICARE pharmacy benefits from 2013 to 2022. It would limit annual increases in pharmacy copayments to retiree cost of living adjustments until 2022, with the Secretary of Defense authorized to increase copayments thereafter. The bill included provisions on using DOD funds for abortions in cases of rape or incest, prohibiting certain marriage ceremonies on DOD facilities, and protecting military chaplains' religious beliefs. The enacted version of H.R. 4310 included a provision allowing chaplains to refuse to officiate at same-sex marriage ceremonies based on conscience or religious beliefs. Additionally, DOD announced plans to relax policies restricting women from ground combat units, including developing gender-neutral physical standards for closed occupational specialties. The enacted version of H.R. 4310 included a provision requiring DOD to report to Congress on the feasibility of developing \"gender-neutral\" standards for female service members in combat. The House Armed Services Committee directed the Secretary of the Army to assess the need for body armor tailored to female body types. The Senate Armed Services Committee urged DOD to further relax restrictions on the assignment of female service personnel. The Senate committee urged the Department of Defense to relax restrictions on the assignment of female service personnel to increase service opportunities for women in the armed forces. Congressional action on funding for selected ground force equipment was also highlighted. The House committee expressed concern about the Army's plans regarding the number of heavy BCTs and armored combat vehicles. They objected to the temporary shutdown of production lines for tank and Bradley upgrades, questioning the cost-saving effectiveness and supplier support for future upgrades. The House committee increased funding for Army's heavy combat vehicles, authorizing $255.4 million for M-1A2 SEP conversion, $288.2 million for Bradley upgrades, and $169.9 million for Hercules tank recovery vehicles. They also urged the Army to accelerate the Paladin mobile howitzers program. The House committee increased funding for Army's heavy combat vehicles, authorizing $255.4 million for M-1A2 SEP conversion, $288.2 million for Bradley upgrades, and $169.9 million for Hercules tank recovery vehicles. The enacted version of the FY2013 NDAA added $338.0 million for Abrams and Bradley upgrades, as well as tank recovery vehicles. Additionally, $639.9 million was approved for the Ground Combat Vehicle and $74.1 million for the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle. The House committee increased funding for Army's heavy combat vehicles, authorizing $255.4 million for M-1A2 SEP conversion, $288.2 million for Bradley upgrades, and $169.9 million for Hercules tank recovery vehicles. The enacted version of the FY2013 NDAA added $338.0 million for Abrams and Bradley upgrades, as well as tank recovery vehicles. Additionally, $639.9 million was approved for the Ground Combat Vehicle and $74.1 million for the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle. The enacted version of H.R. 4310 authorized $3.22 billion for two Virginia-class attack submarines and $1.65 billion for long lead-time components for an additional submarine to be procured in FY2014. The final version of H.R. 4310 includes a provision for a multi-year contract to procure up to 10 Virginia-class attack submarines in FY2014-FY2018, with the possibility of using incremental funding. The Navy had requested authority for a multi-year contract to buy nine submarines during that period, but expressed interest in buying a second submarine in FY2014, which would require incremental funding. The enacted version of H.R. 4310 authorizes the Navy to sign a multi-year contract for 10 Aegis destroyers in FY2013-FY2017. The Navy had requested authority for nine ships but hoped bids would allow for a 10th ship. The House bill allocated $581.3 million for long lead-time components for the additional ship, while the Senate bill and enacted version authorized $466.3 million as requested. The FY2013 budget request for developing new missile-launching submarines, SSBN(X), was projected at $1.20 billion. The budget request was reduced to $564.9 million, delaying construction of the first sub until FY2021. The House committee added a provision to maintain a force of at least 12 ballistic missile submarines. The House passed bill would increase funding for the planned new submarine by $374.4 million, bringing the total authorization to the projected level from 2011. The bill also authorized funds for the development of the new missile sub's nuclear powerplant. Additionally, the House, Senate, and enacted versions of the NDAA authorized $291.7 million for a new long-range bomber, with the House rejecting an amendment to delay the program by 10 years. The enacted version of H.R. 4310 authorizes funds for the development of a new bomber equipped to carry nuclear weapons and a conventional, prompt global strike system. It also allocates funds for modifications in existing bombers. The Senate accepted the House provision with the understanding that it aligns with current Air Force plans. The Senate-passed bill, S. 3254, authorized funds for bomber modification, with a $15 million cut from the B-2 request. H.R. 4310 authorized funds for developing a long-range drone aircraft for reconnaissance and attack missions. The bill allocated $142.3 million for the Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) project and $142.5 million for the Unmanned Carrier-launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) project. The House-passed version of H.R. 4310 proposed cuts and additions to the UCAV and UCLASS projects. The enacted version of H.R. 4310 authorized $8.13 billion for programs managed by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), which is $394.1 million more than the Administration requested. Additional funding was authorized for Israeli defense systems and the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program to protect against missiles from North Korea. The House-passed version of H.R. 4310 proposed an additional $1.31 billion for MDA programs. The House bill added $1.31 billion to the $7.74 billion MDA request, with a significant portion allocated for Israel's Iron Dome system and expanding missile defense sites in Alaska, California, and a new site on the East Coast. The final bill authorized $211.0 million for Iron Dome, $168.0 million for other Israeli missile defense programs, and $75.0 million for GMD. The House bill added funding for Israel's Iron Dome system and missile defense sites in Alaska, California, and a potential new site on the East Coast. The enacted version of H.R. 4310 requires DOD to evaluate three potential locations for a third GMD site, with a focus on the East Coast. The deadline for this evaluation was dropped in the final bill. The final version of the bill dropped a House provision for GMD testing against a target ICBM in 2013. Instead, DOD must report on the feasibility of testing earlier and conducting GMD flight tests every two years. No funding was authorized for the MEADS program. The three partner countries, including the United States, are working on developing a mobile air and missile defense system using the Patriot PAC-3 missile. Plans to procure MEADS as an operational system have been put on hold, but the development program continues to explore technologies for other systems. The enacted version of H.R. 4310 includes provisions related to the export of communications satellites and funding restrictions for MEADS. The FY2013 NDAA repeals a provision from the FY1999 NDAA regarding the export of satellites and related items, allowing the President to designate them as \"dual use\" items subject to less restrictive export controls. The new law prohibits satellite sales to certain countries, including China, North Korea, and state sponsors of terrorism. The FY2013 NDAA allows the President to designate satellites as \"dual use\" items for export, with restrictions on sales to certain countries. Provisions in the House and Senate bills address detainee issues related to Al Qaeda and associated forces, including restrictions on transfers and releases. The FY2013 NDAA extended detainee-related provisions from the FY2012 bill, including a funding bar on transferring Guantanamo detainees. The FY2013 NDAA extended provisions from the FY2012 bill, including funding restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees and new requirements for the transfer or release of non-U.S. or non-Afghan nationals held in Parwan, Afghanistan. The FY2013 NDAA extended provisions from the FY2012 bill, including funding restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees and new requirements for the transfer or release of non-U.S. or non-Afghan nationals held in Parwan, Afghanistan. The bill also addresses recidivism rates of individuals formerly detained at the Detention Facility at Parwan, Afghanistan, and the use of naval vessels to detain persons under the Authorization of the Use of Military Force. The FY2013 NDAA addressed controversial provisions regarding the indefinite detention of Americans in the United States. The Senate-passed bill included a provision stating that authorizations to use force should not allow detention of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents without explicit congressional authorization. An amendment to remove military detention as an option for individuals in the U.S. was proposed but not adopted. The enacted version of the bill includes a provision ensuring the availability of the writ of habeas corpus and Constitutional rights in court. The FY2013 NDAA addressed provisions regarding indefinite detention of Americans in the United States, ensuring availability of habeas corpus and Constitutional rights in court. The bill does not clarify which U.S. persons are lawfully subject to detention under the AUMF. The FY2013 NDAA addressed provisions regarding indefinite detention of Americans in the United States, ensuring availability of habeas corpus and Constitutional rights in court. The final version of the bill preserved ambiguity on who can be lawfully detained under the AUMF, but reassured access to habeas corpus for those detained in the U.S. Section 1078 of the bill incorporated a modified provision from the House-passed bill amending the Smith-Mundt Act and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987, prohibited dissemination of information about the United States within the country until 12 years after initial dissemination. Media organizations and researchers could access the information at the Department of State before the 12-year mark. Funds for public diplomacy programs were not to be used to influence public opinion in the U.S. The amendments in Section 1028 addressed these provisions. The amendments in Section 1028 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act removed the prohibition on domestic dissemination of public diplomacy information produced by the Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors for foreign audiences, while maintaining the ban on using public diplomacy funds to influence U.S. public opinion. Proponents argued that the ban was impractical in the age of global communications and lifting it would promote transparency in U.S. public diplomacy activities abroad. Critics expressed concerns about potential consequences of lifting the ban. Critics of lifting the ban on domestic dissemination of public diplomacy information expressed concerns about potential consequences, such as more aggressive U.S. government activities to influence U.S. citizens and reduced effectiveness of State Department and BBG communications with foreign publics. The House took action on selected amendments during consideration of H.R. 4310 and S. 3254, with the FY2013 DOD appropriations bill providing $599.89 billion for DOD activities, exceeding the President's budget request. The House-passed DOD appropriations bill exceeds the President's budget request and defense funding cap set by the Budget Control Act. The Administration warned of a potential veto due to the bill's current form. The Senate Appropriations Committee's version of H.R. 5856 provides $596.64 billion, less than the Administration's request and the House-passed version. The House-passed and Senate committee-reported versions of H.R. 5856 would add billions of dollars to the Administration's budget request, reversing some of the DOD budget reduction initiatives. The House bill proposes a $5.5 billion increase, partly offset by funding reductions. Additionally, the House bill includes upwards of $6.0 billion for certain programs typically funded above the proposed level. H.R. 933 enacted a 1.7% increase in military personnel's basic pay, based on the Labor Department's ECI. The bill also accepted the Administration's proposal to reduce Army and Marine Corps end-strength during FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern about the Administration's plan to reduce Army and Marine Corps personnel by 77,300 spaces by FY2017 due to budgetary pressures. The enacted bill added $2.38 billion to maintain and modernize Aegis cruisers and amphibious landing ships scheduled for retirement in FY2013 and FY2014. This funding is allocated to a new \"Ship Modernization, Operations and Sustainment Fund\" available through FY2014. The House bill in FY2013 allowed the retirement of USS Port Royal, while adding funds for operation, maintenance, and equipment upgrades for three other Aegis cruisers. The final appropriations bill added nearly $900 million to sustain flying squadrons and continue operating aircraft that were slated for disposal. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees rejected a proposal to disband Air Force squadrons and dispose of F-16s and A-10s. H.R. 933 includes a provision to prohibit the dissolution of squadrons and adds $557.2 million to continue operating them. The House Appropriations Committee directed the Air Force to submit a cost-benefit analysis by October 1, 2012. The Appropriations Committee dropped the requirement for the Air Force to submit a cost-benefit analysis of proposed retirements and reorganizations. The final defense bill added $341.3 million for planned procurements of Global Hawk drones and C-27 cargo planes. Additionally, the bill included a provision requiring the Air Force to spend funds appropriated for Block 30s and C-27s. The enacted version of the FY2013 DOD appropriations bill cut $2.94 billion requested by the four services for routine personnel transfers. The enacted version of the FY2013 DOD appropriations bill (H.R. 933) reduced routine personnel transfer costs by 5% ($146.8 million), half of what was proposed by the Senate Appropriations Committee (H.R. 5856). The Senate committee highlighted the frequency of military personnel rotations and directed the Under Secretary of Defense to report on potential budget savings and improvements in service members' job performance and quality of life within 180 days. The FY2013 defense appropriations bill cut the Administration's budget request to reduce backlog of maintenance work by services' depots. The issue of \"excess carryover\" has been scrutinized by the GAO for years. The GAO has scrutinized the issue of \"excess carryover\" at Army depots, where work funded by customers but not completed by year-end is carried over to the next fiscal year. Congressional reports have raised concerns about excessive carryover levels, which may lead to reductions by the Department of Defense. The House-passed version of H.R. 5856 and the Senate committee-reported version proposed cuts to Army Operation and Maintenance and Other Procurement accounts. H.R. 933 as enacted cut $332.3 million from the O&M requests. The Administration's $16.15 billion request for DOD's TRICARE medical insurance program assumed fee increases, requiring legislative changes. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees rejected most legislative changes proposed for the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act, including TRICARE fee hikes. H.R. 933 as enacted added $273.0 million to cover higher costs from rejected fee increases, cutting $807.4 million from the TRICARE request. The enacted version of H.R. 933 cuts $807.4 million from the FY2013 TRICARE request, citing underexecution of budget in previous years. The House-passed version of H.R. 5856 also proposed cuts based on historic underexecution. Congressional action on appropriation of funds for ground combat systems is summarized in the document. The House-passed additions to the armored vehicle programs include $383.0 million for upgrades to M-1 tanks, Bradley armored troop carriers, and M-88A2 Hercules tank recovery vehicles. The final appropriations bill would increase funding for tank upgrades, night vision equipment, digital communications gear, and power train modifications. The total funding for these programs would be $639.9 million. The Senate committee questioned the Army's emphasis on the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) in the context of its overall spending plans for modernization of its armored combat vehicle fleet. The GCV would account for about 10% of the Army's entire fleet of combat vehicles, but in the FY2013 budget request, it represents more than 70% of the total amount requested for modernization. Over the FY2013-FY2017 period, the GCV would absorb over 80% of the Army's projected spending on combat vehicle modernization. The committee directed the Army to provide Congress with the results of a business case analysis. The Army was directed to provide Congress with the results of a business case analysis on its combat vehicle fleet modernization plans. Both House and Senate Appropriations Committees criticized the Administration's plan to reduce funding for warships in FY2013-FY2017, warning that it would increase costs and weaken the nation's shipbuilding industrial base. Congressional action on naval systems funding is summarized in Table A-6. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee objected to the Administration's plan to buy one Virginia-class attack submarine and one Aegis destroyer in FY2014 instead of two of each type. H.R. 933 adds nearly $1.8 billion for Navy shipbuilding to support multi-year contracts for 10 submarines and 10 destroyers in FY2013 through FY2017. Additionally, it includes funding for long lead-time components for two submarines in FY2014 and a third destroyer in FY2013. The final bill added $723 million for submarine components and $1 billion for a third destroyer. It also included $150 million for the repair of the USS Miami submarine damaged by fire. The Navy plans to repair the ship at a cost of $450 million by April 30, 2015, extending its service life by 10 years. Additionally, $263.3 million was added for long lead-time components for an amphibious transport dock ship in FY2014. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported on the shortage of amphibious landing transports in the Navy and the declining number of such ships. Congressional action on funding for aircraft programs, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, was summarized in H.R. 933, which allocated $8.29 billion for development and production. Various reductions were made to funding requests deemed premature or unjustified. The final bill allocated $5.59 billion to purchase 29 F-35s of different types. The enacted bill allocates $5.59 billion to buy 29 F-35s of different types for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, along with $2.68 billion for plane development. An additional $21.5 million is added for modifications to the Air Force's F-22 fighters to address pilot oxygen supply issues. The enacted defense bill provides funding for 14 C-130 cargo planes and a down-payment on 18 more for future years, totaling $1.73 billion for procurement and modifications. An additional $20.0 million is allocated for the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program, which was initially proposed to be scrapped in the Administration's budget. The enacted version of H.R. 933 appropriates $8.30 billion for programs of the Missile Defense Agency, an increase of 6.6% above the $7.79 billion request. The largest component of the increase is $280.0 million for Israeli missile defense systems, including $211.0 million for the Iron Dome system. Additionally, $75.0 million was added to the Ground-Based Missile Defense system. The bill also allocates $380.9 million for the Medium Extended Air Defense System. The Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) is a joint U.S.-German-Italian effort to develop a mobile air and missile defense system incorporating the Patriot PAC-3 missile. Plans to deploy MEADS have been shelved, but work continues on developing components and technologies for other systems. The House-passed appropriations bill denied the $400.9 million requested for MEADS in the FY2013 budget. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act authorized no funds for MEADS and included a provision prohibiting the use of funds for the program. The House-passed appropriations bill denied funding for the MEADS program in the FY2013 budget. However, DOD argues that funds from H.R. 933 can be used for MEADS as subsequent legislation can supersede previous provisions. H.R. 933 allows DOD to use the funds for completing the MEADS program or for termination fees. The Senate Appropriations Committee estimated similar costs for both options. H.R. 933 allocated $86.95 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations, $1.26 billion less than requested. The Senate committee-reported version of the bill would have provided $93.03 billion. H.R. 933 would provide $1.20 billion for payments to Pakistan from DOD's Coalition Support Fund. The fund reimburses coalition partners for supporting U.S. military operations.
