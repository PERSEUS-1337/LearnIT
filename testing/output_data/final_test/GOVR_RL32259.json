    "content": "In early 2005, the United States launched a rewards program in Pakistan to capture wanted Al Qaeda suspects. Abu Faraj al-Libbi, wanted for attempting to assassinate President Musharraf, was captured in Mardan. His information led to the arrest of six suspects and the killing of an alleged bomb expert. Musharraf claimed success in breaking Al Qaeda's back with recent arrests. Despite this, debate over the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden continues. The debate over the whereabouts of fugitive Al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden continues to focus on the Afghan-Pakistani border region. Pakistani officials deny evidence of bin Laden hiding there, while US officials suggest otherwise. Efforts to capture militants near the border bring mixed results, with the Taliban suffering losses but still able to attack US-led forces in Afghanistan. In June, Afghan officials complained about terrorists crossing into Afghanistan from Pakistan, deepening the Afghan-Pakistani rift. President Bush called Musharraf to improve relations. Pakistan deployed 4,000 troops to the border region, totaling 80,000. Prime Minister Aziz promised cooperation with Afghanistan in fighting terrorism. U.S. officials urge more action to end insurgent operations, as Taliban activities reportedly continue in Pakistan's tribal regions. Pakistan's western tribal regions face tensions and sporadic Islamic militant violence. Military operations in South Waziristan ended in 2004, with attention now on North Waziristan where foreign militants seek refuge. The government uses a mix of incentives and threats to gain tribal cooperation, but resistance to U.S.-led efforts in Afghanistan persists. Cooperative tribal leaders have been targeted by militants. Efforts in Afghanistan face resistance in Pakistan, with U.S. forces engaging militants near the border. Pakistan struggles with belligerent Islamism, with President Musharraf expressing concerns about extremism and militancy. Major sectarian bomb attacks in urban centers raise questions about security forces' ability to maintain order. Pakistan is taking steps to combat indigenous terrorism by detaining suspected militants, closing extremist group offices, and regulating religious schools. Pakistan-U.S. counterterrorism cooperation remains strong, with potential major Foreign Military Sales including maritime reconnaissance aircraft and anti-armor missiles. In March 2005, the Bush Administration announced the resumption of sales of F-16 fighters to Pakistan after a 16-year hiatus, despite India's concerns about the negative impact on goodwill. Separatist-related violence and terrorism in Kashmir increased in the summer of 2005, while the India-Pakistan peace initiative continued with a formal ceasefire agreement along the Kashmiri Line of Control. In April 2005, a new bus service was launched in the disputed Kashmir region, and Indian and Pakistan leaders called the bilateral peace process \"irreversible.\" Despite decreased rates of militant infiltration across the LOC, separatist-related violence in India's Jammu and Kashmir state persists. Indian officials criticize Pakistan for not eliminating terrorist infrastructure on its territory. Separatist movements continue in India's northeastern states, with Assamese separatist leaders surrendering in February followed by coordinated bomb attacks by United Liberation Front of Assam terrorists in March. Indian security forces responded with a 2,000-man operation. In March, coordinated bomb attacks led to a 2,000-man operation by Indian security forces against militants. New Delhi signed a truce with the National Democratic Front of Bodoland in May. Maoist \"Naxalites\" attacks increased in 2005, spreading to over half of India's states. Recent terrorist violence included an incident in July with six militants. Recent terrorist violence in India included a July incident where six militants, linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist group, were killed in an unsuccessful attack on a controversial temple in Ayodhya. Hindu activists protested leading to arrests. India-U.S. counterterrorism cooperation is set to expand with a defense framework agreement signed in June. In August, 350 small bombs exploded in Bangladesh, killing two and injuring over 125, with no one claiming responsibility. The bombings in Bangladesh in August killed two people and injured over 125 others. Leaflets from the banned militant group Jamatul Mujahideen were found at the attack sites. The United States offered assistance in the investigation, focusing on capacity building for law enforcement and coastal security to combat terrorism. During her visit, Rocca urged Bangladesh to combat those undermining its tradition of tolerance and peace. Bangladesh banned militant groups for their alleged role in recent bombings. Foreign Minister Khan reaffirmed Bangladesh's commitment to the US in the war against terror. The US sees Bangladesh as a democratic force and a voice of moderation. Bangladesh assumed the Chair of the BIMSTEC grouping and hosted a meeting to review progress. The June 1, 2005 BIMSTEC meeting in Dhaka reviewed progress on counterterrorism. Concerns are rising over King Gyanendra's takeover in Nepal, weakening the government's ability to fight the Maoists. Violence has increased, with over 11,500 deaths in the conflict. India is worried about the conflict spilling over into neighboring areas. Maoist tactics are changing with increased daytime attacks and the use of roadblocks. Kathmandu accused Maoist rebels of executing 40 captured soldiers in August. The Sri Lanka peace process faces new threats after the assassination of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, leading to concerns about the cease-fire holding amidst growing instability within the LTTE ranks. The government's counterinsurgency efforts in Nepal are seen as ineffective following the alleged execution of 40 captured soldiers by Maoist rebels. The LTTE is pressuring the Sri Lankan Government and the SLMM with isolated attacks. They are also seeking to acquire air capabilities, which could lead to destabilization. Internal divisions within the Sri Lankan government are hindering peace talks. The U.S. Administration supports negotiations for peace in Sri Lanka and urges the LTTE to disarm. Operation Enduring Freedom aims to destroy terrorist camps in Afghanistan and capture Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders. Since the Taliban's ouster from power in Kabul, U.S. military forces have faced \"hit-and-run\" attacks from remnant forces in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, where Al Qaeda operations are centered. Pakistan is considered a global hub for terrorism and Al Qaeda remnants. Pakistan is considered a global hub for terrorism and Al Qaeda remnants, with speculation about Osama bin Laden's whereabouts in the country's North West Frontier Province. Despite Pakistani officials denying his presence, US officials believe otherwise, with concerns about capturing him due to sanctuaries in sovereign states and international obligations. There are conflicting statements from the Pakistani president on bin Laden's location, and capturing him in Pakistan could lead to backlash among his sympathizers. US frustration is growing over the lack of progress in locating bin Laden. In 2003, attacks on U.S.-led coalition forces in Afghanistan increased, with concerns raised about the threat posed by resurgent Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. In 2004, Pakistan conducted military operations near the Afghan border, receiving praise for fighting terrorism but also criticism for militants crossing into Afghanistan. Afghan President Karzai visited Islamabad in 2004, where President Musharraf assured him that Pakistan would not allow extremists to use its territory. President Musharraf assured Afghan President Karzai that Pakistan would prevent extremists from disrupting the upcoming Afghan elections. Extra troops and quick reaction forces were deployed near the Afghan border to prevent militant infiltrations. Despite concerns raised by the top U.S. general in Afghanistan, the successful and peaceful polling led to the declaration that the Taliban were no longer a significant threat to Afghan stability. However, lingering pro-Taliban sentiments and reports of sympathies within Pakistan's security apparatus for anti-U.S. forces raise concerns about the government's commitment to pacifying the border. In 2005, political tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan escalated due to border incidents and accusations. Reports of Pakistan's potential military operations near the Afghan border and alleged involvement in sparking anti-U.S. protests raised concerns about the government's commitment to pacifying the border. In 2005, tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan escalated over border incidents and accusations. Reports suggested Pakistan's intelligence service may have played a role in sparking riots, with concerns about opposition to a long-term U.S. presence in Afghanistan. Revived Taliban insurgent activity in Afghanistan led to hundreds of casualties. Afghan officials complained of terrorists entering from Pakistan, leading to a plea from the Afghan president to stop the exfiltration. Pakistan's President Musharraf assured support for the Kabul government, but three Pakistani nationals were arrested for planning an attack on the outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan. In July 2005, Pakistan moved 4,000 additional troops to the border region, bringing the total to 80,000. Prime Minister Aziz visited Kabul, promising cooperation in fighting terrorism. U.S. officials urge Islamabad to do more to end insurgent operations, with reports of Taliban activities in Pakistan. Al Qaeda's links with Pakistani militant groups are believed to be mostly informal. Islamic militant groups in Pakistan, facilitated by existing Pakistani extremists, are linked to Al Qaeda activities without formal membership. Al Qaeda was involved in anti-U.S. attacks in 2002, with most suspects being indigenous Pakistani groups. After the capture of Arab Al Qaeda leaders post-9/11, Pakistani nationals are now leading the organization. President Musharraf's crackdown on outlawed groups and potential policy changes in Kashmir have angered radical Islamists. In 2003 and 2004, President Musharraf and his allies were targeted by Al Qaeda and extremist attacks, including bombings on his motorcade in Rawalpindi and Karachi, as well as an assassination attempt on the Prime Minister-designate, Shaukat Aziz. The F.B.I. was involved in investigating these incidents. The F.B.I. investigated assassination attempts on President Musharraf and the Prime Minister-designate, Shaukat Aziz. Concerns about domestic extremism in Pakistan's security apparatus and Al Qaeda's alliance with Pakistani militants have raised worries about the country's stability. The United States has noted links between Al Qaeda and Pakistani army officers, intelligence agents, and militant leaders, raising doubts about Pakistan's commitment to moderation. Al Qaeda members have been found in collaboration with groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-i-Islami in Pakistan. Pakistan's leading religious Islamist political party, Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), faced scrutiny for its ties to Al Qaeda suspects. Despite denials from JI's chief, President Musharraf expressed disappointment over political elements in Pakistan instigating foreign terrorists. The country's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had supported the Afghan Taliban regime, leading to concerns about its connections to militant groups. Pakistan's ISI agency had direct contacts with Al Qaeda figures and may have provided shelter to them in Pakistan and Kashmir. ISI collaborated with Al Qaeda's shift into South Waziristan in 2002. Pakistani nuclear scientists met with Osama bin Laden in 2001 to discuss weapons. In 2005, six Pakistan army officers were convicted of plotting with Al Qaeda. Islamic extremists with ties to Al Qaeda remain active in Pakistan, including Fazlur Rehman Khalil who openly lives in Rawalpindi. In 1998, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, leader of Harakat ul-Mujahideen, a Pakistan-based terrorist group, openly lived in Rawalpindi. In mid-2004, several Al Qaeda-linked militants were captured or killed in Pakistan, including Masrab Arochi, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, and Mohammed Naeem Noor Khan. Pakistan's security agencies captured foreign and Pakistani \"terrorists,\" including suspected Al Qaeda members. In 2004, Pakistan captured suspected Al Qaeda members planning attacks on government and Western targets, including the U.S. Embassy. Pictures of six \"most-wanted terrorists\" were published with rewards for information. One fugitive, Amjad Farooqi, was killed in a gunbattle. Pakistan also captured 11 militants, including Jaish-e-Mohammed members wanted for a 2002 car bombing in Karachi. In 2004, Pakistan made significant strides in capturing suspected Al Qaeda members, including those planning attacks on government and Western targets. The arrests were praised by top officials, but the issue of non-Pakistani militants with Al Qaeda links in western border regions remains unresolved. Pakistani forces continue to hunt suspected Al Qaeda members in urban areas and the western border regions. In 2005, the Islamabad government made cash payments to Pashtun tribal commanders to sever ties with Al Qaeda. The United States increased efforts to capture Al Qaeda fugitives with monetary rewards. A rift between Arab and Central Asia Al Qaeda members was exploited for the capture of Abu Faraj al-Liby. President Musharraf claimed security forces had weakened Al Qaeda in Pakistan, despite ongoing operations in June 2005. In June 2005, a senior Taliban leader claimed Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar were alive and well, sparking international scrutiny on Pakistan's links to extremism after the London bombings. President Musharraf launched a crackdown on militants and investigated ties to Pakistan-based terrorist groups. Musharraf declared Al Qaeda's operational structure in Pakistan destroyed. The surge in Afghan opium production has raised concerns about Afghanistan becoming a \"narco-state,\" with terrorist groups profiting from heroin trafficking. Pakistan plays a significant role in the trafficking of narcotics from Afghanistan. Pakistan's role in heroin trafficking from Afghanistan raises concerns about funding for terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. The genesis of this issue is linked to the Islamization process initiated by Z.A. Bhutto and accelerated by Gen. Zia-ul-Haq. The United States' support for Zia further exacerbated the problem by strengthening conservative religious elements in Pakistan. Pakistan has a history of inconsistency in combating terrorism, with the US noting the country's tolerance of terrorists within its borders. Militant groups in Pakistan have traditionally operated separately, but there are concerns about material support provided to these groups, including those designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations. In the post-9/11 period, Pakistan banned extremist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan. Al Qaeda activists joined forces with Pakistani Sunni militant groups, including LeT, JeM, SSP, and LJ, with close ties to Al Qaeda. United Nations lists JeM and LJ as associated with the Taliban. In response to President Musharraf's 2002 speech denouncing terrorism and extremism, about 3,300 extremists were detained, including founders of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad. Despite being officially banned, these groups continued to operate under new names. In 2003, Musharraf arrested members of banned organizations and shut down their offices, including offshoots of JeM and SSP. In response to President Musharraf's 2002 speech denouncing terrorism and extremism, about 3,300 extremists were detained, including founders of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad. In 2003, Musharraf banned six groups, raided over 100 offices, and vowed to prevent banned groups from resurfacing. Efforts were criticized as cosmetic and ineffective, with doubts about the effectiveness of recent initiatives in combating religious extremism. Reports of militant training facilities operating in Pakistani-controlled territory have increased in mid-2005, with concerns raised by government officials in Kabul and New Delhi. Pakistan's domestic terrorism has mainly involved Sunni-Shia conflict since 2003, stemming from state policies of Islamization and marginalization of secular democratic forces. Repression of religious minorities in Pakistan is acknowledged by the United States. Major suicide bombings in Islamabad and Karachi have resulted in numerous casualties. The Taliban movement originated among students in Pakistani religious schools. Some madrassas in Pakistan have been linked to teaching militant ideologies, but there is little evidence of producing known terrorists. Many Pakistani madrassas, including those run by the Deobandi sect, are financed by Islamist political parties and foreign entities, with some linked to terrorist groups. Senior members of Jamaat-e-Ulema Islam (JUI) have ties to designated terrorist organizations. JUI chief Fazlur Rehman is critical of Pakistan's cooperation with the US and was named Leader of the Opposition in 2004. Musharraf assured religious seminarians in 2004 that his government would not interfere in madrassas affairs. In 2004, Musharraf assured religious seminarians that his government would not interfere in madrassas affairs. However, in July 2005, international attention increased after officials acknowledged links between Pakistani madrassas and terrorists. A crackdown on Pakistani religious extremists followed, including a government deadline for madrassa registration and the expulsion of foreign nationals. Islamist leaders criticized these actions as human rights abuses. Since 2002, the U.S. Congress has allocated funds to help Pakistan reform its education system, aiming to align madrassa curriculum with non-religious schools. President Musharraf pledged to address extremist madrassas, but there is little evidence of concrete action. The Wafaq-ul-Madaris, a leading madrassa group, has criticized certain registration requirements, including reporting funding sources. President Musharraf's promises to reform extremist madrassas have not been implemented, with speculation that his reluctance is to maintain good relations with Pakistan's Islamist political parties. The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) holds significant political power and opposes military operations in tribal areas, resists reform in religious schools, and criticizes cooperation with the U.S. government. The MMA's leadership, including Jamaat-i-Islami and Jamiat-Ulema-Islami-Fazlur, strongly criticize Islamabad's cooperation with the U.S. and movement towards India. They have anti-American rhetoric and have called for \"jihad\" against perceived threats to Pakistani sovereignty. Some suggest Western governments may have been involved in the 7/7 London bombings. They oppose President Musharraf's cooperation with the U.S. and are seen as against the U.S.-supported Kabul government. Afghan President Karzai and the foreign minister have raised concerns about Taliban activities in Quetta. The Afghan foreign minister complained about Taliban leaders openly operating in Quetta and other cities in western Pakistan. Pakistan's interior minister accused MMA politicians of giving terrorists a \"free hand\" after a battle in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Despite Musharraf's calls for assistance in fighting extremism, Pakistan's religious parties are increasingly challenging these efforts. Pakistan has cooperated with the U.S. by allowing military bases, detaining extremists, and deploying security forces. Pakistan has been a key partner in the war on terrorism, with the State Department praising its anti-terrorism efforts. Islamabad has captured over 600 alleged terrorists, transferring some to U.S. custody. President Bush commended Pakistani President Musharraf for his cooperation in the global fight against terrorism. President Bush praised Pakistani President Musharraf for his cooperation in the global war on terrorism. The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to deepen the U.S.-Pakistan relationship during meetings in New York and Washington. Musharraf was commended for his efforts in combating terrorism, with the Pakistani army being active in southern Waziristan. President Bush praised Pakistani President Musharraf for his cooperation in the global war on terrorism, with the Pakistani army being active in southern Waziristan. Pakistani forces captured over 100 extremists in 2004, including those plotting attacks against the United States. Despite doubts about Islamabad's full commitment to core U.S. concerns in the Afghan-Pakistani border region, top U.S. officials regularly meet with Musharraf in Islamabad for counterterrorism discussions. Islamabad's leaders have historically supported and manipulated Islamic extremism for strategic interests. Until September 2001, Islamabad was one of only three world governments to recognize the Afghan Taliban regime, with Pakistan providing support to the Taliban throughout the 1990s. Concerns have been raised about members of the Taliban receiving support inside Pakistan, including from elements of Pakistan's intelligence agencies. In August 2003, Pakistani army officers were arrested for suspected ties to Al Qaeda, leading to doubts about the Pakistani security community's willingness to work with the U.S. In October 2003, concerns were raised before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about Pakistan's involvement with Islamic militants. In October 2003, concerns were raised about elements in the Pakistani government sympathetic to pre-9/11 policies, with a radical Islamic infrastructure in northwestern Pakistan. A senior Pakistan expert warned about the danger of not addressing extremism fully, likening it to dismantling a weapons system. Arrests of Al Qaeda figures in Pakistan remained static until mid-2004, prompting questions from U.S. military officials. The U.S. military officials questioned Pakistan's commitment to counterterrorism efforts, particularly regarding President Musharraf's leadership. Analysts highlighted the importance of developing Pakistan's democratic institutions for long-term success. The U.S. reliance on Musharraf was criticized as flawed, with experts suggesting a need for a more comprehensive approach. In response to concerns about Pakistan's commitment to counterterrorism efforts, analysts criticized the reliance on President Musharraf as a \"marginal satisfier\" who may only do the minimum expected. They recommended that the United States change the perception that its support for Pakistan is solely support for Musharraf. Islamabad deployed troops along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border to block infiltration, and a Tripartite Commission was formed in 2003 to stabilize the border areas. In June 2003, Islamabad sent armed forces into the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) to search for Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters. By September 2003, up to 25,000 troops were in the tribal areas, coordinating with U.S.-led forces. A firefight in South Waziristan in early October showed Islamabad's commitment to tracking extremists on Pakistani territory. After two attempts on President Musharraf's life in December 2003, the Pakistan military increased efforts in the FATA. Musharraf admitted in February 2004 that militants were crossing into Afghanistan to fight coalition troops. By August 2004, 75,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the western border areas. In August 2004, 75,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the western border areas, conducting operations against Islamist groups in the tribal regions. A battle in South Waziristan in March 2004 resulted in the deaths of 130 people, including 46 Pakistani soldiers, but no high-value Al Qaeda or Taliban fugitives were captured. The operation was criticized for poor intelligence and hasty planning. During the battle in South Waziristan, Pakistani troops bulldozed homes of suspected shelter providers to foreign terrorists. The US delivered 2,500 protective vests to the Pakistani military. Pashtun tribal leaders were persuaded to form militias to detain fugitives. Political administrators issued ultimatums with threats of fines for sheltering foreigners. A deadline was set for foreigners to register and surrender weapons after a military setback in March. On April 24, 2004, the five most-wanted Pashtun tribesmen surrendered to government authorities in Pakistan, receiving amnesty in exchange for not sheltering Al Qaeda members. The \"Shakai agreement\" raised concerns about Pakistan's counterterrorism efforts, with Lt. Gen. David Barno warning it could lead in the wrong direction. The Shakai agreement in western tribal areas raised concerns about Pakistan's counterterrorism efforts. Nek Mohammed, a Taliban fighter, threatened Islamabad and pledged loyalty to Mohammed Omar. Spurious deals with foreign militants failed, leading to economic pressure on uncooperative tribesmen and a massive mobilization of federal troops. Amnesty offer to key militants was rescinded in June. In June, the government issued a \"kill or capture\" order against five key militants and conducted airstrikes in South Waziristan, resulting in 72 deaths including 17 soldiers. Nek Mohammed was killed along with seven others by a missile, possibly from an American Predator drone. In September 2004, 55 suspected Islamic militants were killed in an airstrike on an alleged Al Qaeda training camp in South Waziristan. In mid-September 2004, Abdullah Mahsud, a Pakistani Pashtun militant, refused to allow Pakistan security forces to use a key road connecting North and South Waziristan. Mahsud, who was trying to fill the shoes of Nek Mohammed, kidnapped two Chinese engineers and two Pakistani security officers in South Waziristan. In Waziristan, two Pakistani security officers were kidnapped by Mahsud and his followers, leading to a deadly confrontation with Pakistani commandos. Tribal leaders attempting to negotiate Mahsud's surrender were attacked, resulting in fourteen deaths. Five Pashtun tribal militant leaders surrendered to the government in exchange for peace and reparations. The regional corps commander declared peace restored in Wana after combat in 2004. Most troops would be withdrawn, leaving only 3,000 troops and nine check posts. The US was assured that Pakistani forces were still committed to fighting Al Qaeda. 35 military operations in Waziristan resulted in 250 militants and 175 soldiers dead, with no high-value targets captured. Militants swept out of South Waziristan found refuge in other areas. In 2005, Pakistani security forces conducted sporadic raids in North Waziristan, targeting suspected militants including local Pashtun tribals, Afghans, Uzbeks, and Arabs. Pakistani commanders warned tribal leaders to expel foreign militants or face large-scale military operations. Reports indicate ongoing tensions in North Waziristan despite denials of major operations by Pakistani officials. Tensions in North Waziristan remain high, with underlying tensions significant and potential for future unrest. Islamic militants in Wana area warned of peace unraveling due to unmet promises, and incidents like a bomb explosion at a tribal leader's home. Taliban in South Waziristan vowed to continue jihad against America, with attacks on pro-government tribal elders reported. In South Waziristan, five pro-government tribal elders were attacked in three separate incidents while assisting army efforts against Islamic militants. Despite the violence, Pakistani officials claim that Al Qaeda-linked militants have been eliminated from the region. President Musharraf's crackdown on extremist groups led to attempts on his life in December 2003, sparking unrest and strengthening pro-Al Qaeda sentiments in tribal communities and cities. In 2004, President Musharraf expressed concerns about the fallout from military operations in South Waziristan, which led to a spate of bombings and killings in Karachi. Pro-Taliban militants accused Islamabad of collaborating with the U.S. to kill Nek Mohammed, warning of further violence. International aid organizations suspended operations in Baluchistan due to threats of suicide attacks. Islamic militant outrage peaked in mid-summer 2004 with a suicide bombing killing a senior Pakistani intelligence officer. In July and August, a suicide bomber killed a senior Pakistani intelligence officer in Kohat, another bomber attempted to assassinate Pakistan's Prime Minister-designate, and gunmen tried to assassinate the Baluchistan Chief Minister. Analysts expressed concerns about Pakistan's political stability as conflict and bloodshed increased. Tensions rose between Islamabad and Washington over U.S. military presence on Pakistani soil. In March 2004, U.S. and Afghan forces conducted Operation Mountain Storm in southern and eastern Afghanistan with Pakistani troops. In April 2004, tensions between Islamabad and Washington rose over U.S. military presence on Pakistani soil. The U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan stated that Pakistan must address militant infiltration into Afghanistan or the U.S. would take action. President Musharraf denied plans for a spring offensive into Pakistan with U.S. help. Gen. Abizaid confirmed no plans to deploy U.S. troops in Pakistan against Islamabad's wishes. Since spring 2002, U.S. military and law enforcement personnel have been assisting Pakistani security forces in tracking and apprehending Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters on Pakistani territory. U.S. forces in Afghanistan provide support to Pakistani forces near the border, including spy satellites, drones, and ground sensors. Islamabad has reportedly agreed to allow \"hot pursuit\" up to ten kilometers into Pakistani territory. The United States is providing sophisticated ground sensors and surveillance equipment to assist Pakistan in counterterrorism efforts. U.S. assistance includes training new Pakistan Army Air Assault units and supplying equipment such as night-vision gear, protective vests, and transport helicopters. Additionally, the U.S. is involved in road-building projects in border areas and plans to provide used C-130 transport aircraft. The United States is providing advanced equipment and training to enhance Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. This includes supplying military radio systems, maritime reconnaissance aircraft, naval guns, and anti-armor missiles. The Pentagon has notified Congress of potential sales worth up to $1.2 billion to improve communication and interoperability between Pakistani and U.S.-led forces. India's external affairs minister cautions the United States against selling F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan, citing potential negative impacts on the relationship between India and the U.S. Pakistan has received significant security-related assistance from the U.S. since September 2001, with Foreign Military Sales agreements totaling $27 million in FY2002, $167 million in FY2003, and $176 million in FY2004. Since September 2001, Pakistan has received substantial security-related assistance from the U.S., including Foreign Military Financing totaling nearly $675 million in 2001 and additional defense spending for counterterrorism operations. Pentagon documents show Pakistan received over $1.3 billion in coalition support funding from January 2003 to September 2004. The House Armed Services Committee reported that the Secretary of Defense expected to disburse another $1.2 billion to Pakistan in FY2005. In 2004, the US and Pakistan intensified efforts to capture terrorists in Pashtun-majority areas. President Musharraf cracked down on Pakistani extremist groups with links to violence in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kashmir. A cease-fire between Pakistan and India led to a decrease in terrorist infiltrations, but separatist militants vowed to continue their struggle in 2004. In 2004, India faced challenges due to its diverse population and internal instability. Separatist movements in Jammu and Kashmir and the northeast regions, along with Maoist rebels in eastern states, posed threats to New Delhi. The Indian Home Ministry reported 7,458 deaths in 10,788 incidents of separatist and Maoist violence in the country. In 2004, 7,458 people were killed in 10,788 incidents of separatist and Maoist violence in India, with a majority of deaths in Kashmir. India blames Pakistan for supporting militant groups in Kashmir, while Pakistan denies direct involvement and criticizes India for human rights violations in the region. Disagreements over the definition of terrorism have strained India-Pakistan relations. Several anti-India militant groups in Kashmir are based in Pakistan and have ties to Islamist organizations, including Al Qaeda. These groups include Harakat ul-Mujahideen, Hizbul Mujahideen, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which are aligned with various political and religious parties in Pakistan. JeM, an armed wing of a Pakistan-based anti-U.S. Sunni religious organization, claimed responsibility for a 2001 suicide bomb attack in Srinagar. The U.S. designated both LeT and JeM as Foreign Terrorist Organizations after being implicated in an attack on the Indian Parliament. This led to a 10-month standoff in 2002 between India and Pakistan, causing concerns of a potential nuclear confrontation. Pakistan's ISI played a significant role in these events. Pakistan's ISI is believed to support Kashmiri separatists in a proxy war against India. India provided proof of militant camps in Pakistani Kashmir. Al Qaeda's presence in Kashmir is suggested. Despite pledges from Pakistani President Musharraf to cease cross-border terrorism, concerns remain about terrorist training camps in Pakistani-controlled areas. In September 2003, Indian PM Vajpayee expressed concerns to President Bush about continued cross-border terrorism from Pakistan hindering India's peace initiative. President Musharraf claimed to be taking steps to curb infiltration at the LOC and proposed joint monitoring with India. Positive developments included a November 2003 cease-fire agreement and a January 2004 pledge by Musharraf to prevent Pakistani territory from supporting terrorism. Indian officials confirmed reduced infiltration rates. In 2004, separatist violence increased in Indian Kashmir, with shootouts and bombings causing many deaths. Despite reduced infiltration rates, concerns remained about cross-border activities in Kashmir. The completion of fence structures along the LOC contributed to the decrease in infiltration rates. New Delhi acknowledged lower levels of violence and tension in Jammu and Kashmir compared to the previous year. The India-Pakistan peace initiative faces obstacles due to Pakistan's alleged support for cross-border terrorism in Kashmir. Indian leaders have criticized Pakistan for not fulfilling promises to end terrorist activities on its territory. Despite improved relations, India continues to demand control over terrorist threats from Pakistan. The Indian prime minister criticized Pakistan for not doing enough to dismantle terrorist infrastructure on its territory. Separatist militants continue to attack civilians and Indian security forces, with some believing that Pakistan still actively supports Kashmiri militants. Concerns have been raised about the sophistication of terrorist attacks by Kashmiri separatists in various parts of India. In the northeast region, various separatist groups have been fighting for ethnic autonomy or independence since India's inception. In India's northeast region, tribal struggles in the Seven Sisters states have been ongoing for centuries. While the United States does not label most of these groups as terrorist organizations, New Delhi has designated some under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Over 6,000 people, including insurgents, have been killed in related violence since 1992 in states like Nagaland, Assam, Manipur, and Tripura. Various insurgent groups, such as ULFA, NSCN, NLFT, NDFB, and UNLF, are active in seeking autonomy or independence. The Indian government has accused neighboring countries of sheltering insurgent groups like ULFA and NDFB. Bhutan launched military operations against these rebels in 2003, resulting in the capture of ULFA's leader. Despite this, attacks on civilians continued, with ULFA being blamed for a bombing in Assam in 2004. In Assam and Nagaland, a joint operation by ULFA and NDFB resulted in bombings and shootings, leaving 83 people dead. Despite senior ULFA leaders surrendering in 2005, coordinated bomb attacks continued in Assam. Indian security forces took action against ULFA in April 2005. Additionally, Naxalites, communist insurgents, are active in east-central India, claiming to fight for landless laborers and tribals. Naxalites, communist insurgents in east-central India, are fighting against oppression to create a classless society. They are labeled as terrorists by their opponents. The U.S. Department of State reports their increasing influence and spread of insurgency to half of India's states. The People's War Group and Maoist Communist Center merged in 2004 to form the Communist Party of India - Maoist. The People's War Group (PWG) and Maoist insurgents were designated as terrorist groups by the U.S. State Department and New Delhi. PWG fighters were responsible for a landmine attack in 2003. The government of Andhra Pradesh lifted a ban on PWG in 2004 for peace talks, but negotiations broke down in 2005. The U.S. Ambassador to India expressed concerns about Naxalite violence in Andhra Pradesh impacting foreign investors. The Andhra Pradesh government banned the Communist Party of India - Maoist after suspected Maoist rebels killed ten civilians. The U.S.-India Joint Working Group on Counterterrorism was established to increase cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. In August 2004, the U.S. and India met for the sixth time to discuss bilateral cooperation. President Bush and Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee agreed in November 2001 that terrorism threatens both countries' security and global stability. In May 2002, the Indo-US Cyber Security Forum was launched to protect critical infrastructures from cyber attacks. The State Department believes that engaging with India will help in resolving terrorist insurgencies in Nepal and Sri Lanka. The Bush Administration considers India a close ally in the global war on terrorism and is providing better border security systems, training, and intelligence to prevent future attacks. The U.S. and India have been working together to enhance their capabilities to combat terrorism. U.S. military sales to India include equipment to enhance their special forces' counterterrorism capabilities. The seating of a new left-leaning national government in India in 2004 did not affect U.S.-India security ties. The Defense Policy Group recognized areas of convergence on combating terrorism. The new Indian government showed a desire for enhanced U.S.-India relations. The U.S. and India have strengthened their relationship, with President Bush meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2004. A defense framework agreement was signed in 2005, focusing on defeating terrorism. Bangladesh's development is hindered by corruption and political rivalry. The ongoing political rivalry in Bangladesh between the nation's two largest parties has led to demonstrations, strikes, and politically motivated violence. The combination of poverty, corruption, and lack of good governance is believed to contribute to the radicalization of society and the recruitment of Islamist radicals for terrorism. Concerns have been raised about the rise of Islamic extremism in Bangladesh, with the Bangladesh National Party having coalition partners with ties to radical Islamist elements. This coalition is seen as promoting violence and threatening the country's moderate form of Islam. The radical Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI) in Bangladesh, with ties to Al Qaeda and the Islamic Oikya Jote, is on the US State Department list of terrorist organizations. HuJI, linked to an assassination attempt on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, supports a fatwa by Usama bin Laden targeting American civilians. Bangla Bhai, associated with Jamaat-e-Islami, aims to establish a Taliban-style government in Bangladesh, particularly near India, and has targeted communists and leftists. The government of Bangladesh has been criticized for denying the existence of fundamentalist organizations in the country. Political infighting, including an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Sheik Hasina, has undermined political stability. Prime Minister Khaleda Zia has denied the presence of Islamic fundamentalists in Bangladesh, despite reports of an \"alarming rise\" in extremist activities. A recent government report has highlighted an alarming rise in political assassinations in Bangladesh, along with concerns about arms smuggling to insurgents in India's northeast and the increase of Islamic fundamentalism in the country. There are fears of Bangladesh becoming a center for international terrorism, with reports of extremist threats, including one to kill the Indian cricket team. HuJI maintains terrorist training camps in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region of Bangladesh, receiving funding from Islamic charities with ties to Al-Qaeda. They are also training individuals from various countries in the region. Concerns exist that Bangladesh could become a base for South and Southeast Asian terrorists to regroup. Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters have reportedly fled to Bangladesh. Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters fled to Bangladesh in December 2001 aboard the MV Mecca from Afghanistan. Al Qaeda had recruited Rohingya Muslims from refugee camps in Bangladesh for conflicts in Afghanistan, Kashmir, and Chechnya. HuJI, an Al Qaeda affiliate founded by Fazlul Rahman, aims to establish Islamic rule in Bangladesh and recruits members from madrassas in the country. Rahman joined bin Laden's World Islamic Front in 1998. The Rohingya Solidarity Organization (RSO) is the largest organization representing over 120,000 Rohingyas in Bangladesh, with the number varying based on the pressure they face in Burma. Bangladesh has ties to militants in Pakistan and HuJI, an Al Qaeda affiliate, with connections to the small Islamic Oikya Jote party in the government. Bangladeshis have been arrested for alleged terrorist activities, including a reported hijacking plot in Bolivia and suspicions of planning attacks in Saudi Arabia. The Rohingya Solidarity Organization (RSO) represents Rohingyas in Bangladesh, who are vulnerable to recruitment by militant Islamist groups. Reports suggest RSO has received support from Jamaat-e-Islami in Bangladesh and Afghan instructors have been seen in RSO camps. There are indications of Jemaah Islamiya (JI) elements shifting to Bangladesh, as seen in the arrest of Malaysians and Indonesians in Pakistan. Bangladeshis have also been arrested in Pakistan for alleged terrorist activities. Gunawan, a Bangladeshi, was arrested in Pakistan in September 2003 on suspicion of terrorist links. Speculations suggest that JI militants from Malaysia and Singapore may have entered southeastern Bangladesh with tacit approval from Bangladesh's Directorate General of Forces Intelligence. Fazlul Rahman's Rohingya Solidarity Organization in southeast Bangladesh is believed to have ties with JI. The Bangladesh government denies allegations of harboring Islamic militants like the Taliban or Al Qaeda, as well as aiding Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence and Al Qaeda elements. The security situation in Nepal has deteriorated since the collapse of the cease fire between the Maoists and the government on August 27, 2003. The numbers of Nepalese killed since August has risen significantly, bringing the total number killed since 1996 to 11,500 by some estimates. The United States Government announced the freezing of Maoist terrorist assets for national security reasons on October 31, 2003. The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)/ United Peoples Front has been identified as an Other Terrorist Group by the U.S. Department of State. Bangladesh Rifles and police have captured weapons during anti-terrorist operations in the southeastern border region with Burma in August and September 2003. The Maoists in Nepal have been linked to leftist extremists and have expressed anti-American sentiments. They have threatened the United States with \"another Vietnam\" if aid to Nepal is expanded. The Maoists have also targeted American interests, including killing Nepalese security guards at the American Embassy and warning American trekkers to stay away from Maoist-controlled areas. They have called on the United States to stop interfering in Nepal's internal affairs. The Maoists in Nepal have threatened American-backed organizations and declared a shift in tactics to smaller-scale attacks on military, police, and party officials. Despite a guarantee to stop political killings and infrastructure destruction, attacks against Americans and American interests continued. The Maoists' pledge against terrorism did not apply to projects directly run by the United States. The United States Agency for International Development and Save the Children operate in Nepal. Maoist leader Prachanda stated that American citizens would not be harmed by the Maoist militia, except those with the Nepal Army. The United States Department of State designates the LTTE as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2005, known for using suicide-bomber tactics. The LTTE has been observed trying to acquire light aircraft for potential terrorist attacks, which is concerning given their history of using various means for attacks. The Black Tigers unit is responsible for such operations, and it is important to monitor for any signs of flight training. The peace process in Sri Lanka was successful but was suspended in 2003 due to disagreements. In February 2002, a permanent cease-fire was reached between the government in Colombo and the LTTE, with talks of autonomy for Tamil-majority regions. Despite increasing instability in both sides, the United States continues to support Norway's facilitation of a peace settlement in Sri Lanka. The cease-fire of 2002 is holding. The LTTE in Sri Lanka has experienced internal divisions and instability, leading to a major split in March 2004 when Col. Karuna broke away with 6,000 soldiers. This has contributed to the stalled peace process and ongoing violence in the region. In March 2004, Col. Karuna split from the LTTE with 6,000 soldiers, leading to factional fighting and power struggles in eastern Sri Lanka. The LTTE accused Karuna of collaborating with the Sri Lankan Army, resulting in ceasefire violations and targeted killings. Karuna retreated to a fortified base in the jungle, repelling LTTE attacks. In early February, a high level LTTE political officer, E. Kousalyane, was killed, followed by politically motivated killings in the eastern provinces. In early April, a Sea Tiger unit attacked a Sri Lankan Navy vessel carrying a peace monitor, leading to a formal censure of the LTTE by the ceasefire monitoring group."
