    "content": "Energy tax policy uses taxes and subsidies to influence energy resource allocation. In the US, policy is influenced by politicians, interest groups, bureaucrats, and scholars, often deviating from economic theory and potentially exacerbating existing distortions. Energy tax policy in the US has evolved over the years, with energy tax policy instruments being applied to the energy markets since the 1970s. Policymakers have increasingly turned to energy taxes and subsidies in response to energy-related problems such as oil embargoes, price shocks, and environmental concerns. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, signed into law on August 8, 2005, included $15 billion in energy tax incentives over 11 years, with a focus on conventional fuels. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provided tax incentives for conventional fuels, but the mood has shifted towards stimulating alternative fuels and energy conservation. President Bush signed a $70 billion tax reconciliation bill in May 2006, increasing taxes on major oil companies to fund alternative energy initiatives. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 initially provided tax incentives for conventional fuels, but there is now a focus on alternative fuels and energy conservation. The current debate in Congress involves potential tax increases on the oil and gas industry to fund tax cuts for alternative energy sectors. This is part of the discussion on new energy policy legislation in the 110th Congress. The history, current status, and future outlook of federal energy tax policy are also discussed, along with proposed energy tax changes and provisions from the 109th Congress. The history of federal energy tax policy can be divided into four eras: the oil and gas period from 1916 to 1970, the energy crisis period of the 1970s, the free-market era of the Reagan Administration, and the post-Reagan era since 1998. Historically, tax incentives were focused on increasing domestic oil and gas reserves, with no incentives for energy conservation or alternative fuels. Key preferences included expensing of intangible drilling costs (IDCs) and the percentage depletion allowance. The tax policy allowed for the expensing of drilling costs and depletion allowance for oil and gas producers, encouraging exploration and development. This led to tax shelters benefiting high-income taxpayers and accelerated deductions, deferring tax liability. Percentage depletion, a tax subsidy in the extractive industries, allows deductions exceeding capital investment. It encourages faster mineral development compared to cost depletion. These subsidies, along with other tax benefits, reduce effective tax rates, production costs, and increase investments in locating reserves. This leads to more profitable production, accelerated extraction rates, and faster depletion of energy resources. The shift in federal energy tax policy during the 1970s was driven by concerns over revenue losses from oil and gas tax preferences, increasing federal budget deficits, and environmental pollution awareness. Oil and gas production rose significantly from 16% to 71.1% of total U.S. energy production between 1920 and 1970. During the 1970s, federal energy tax policy shifted due to environmental concerns, distributional issues, and energy crises like the oil embargo of 1973 and the Iranian Revolution. This led to a reevaluation of subsidies for the oil and gas industry, as well as a focus on the impact of energy market failures on the economy. During the 1970s, federal energy tax policy shifted towards energy conservation and alternative sources, reducing tax preferences for the oil industry and imposing new excise taxes on conventional fossil fuels. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced a federal \"gas guzzler\" excise tax on automobiles with low fuel economy ratings. The windfall profit tax imposed on oil in 1980 taxed the difference between market price and a predetermined base price. This tax was repealed in 1988 as part of a political compromise to decontrol oil prices. The environmental excise tax on crude oil was instituted in 1980 as part of the Superfund program to charge oil refineries for releasing hazardous materials. The tax rate started at 0.79\u00a2 per barrel and later increased to 9.70\u00a2 per barrel before expiring in 1995. Legislation has been proposed to reinstate this tax as part of Superfund reauthorization. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced tax incentives for energy conservation, alternative fuels development, and energy efficiency technologies. This included Residential and Business Energy Tax Credits for investments in energy conservation products and solar/wind energy equipment. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced tax incentives for energy conservation and alternative fuels. Business energy tax credits were available for investments in conservation or alternative fuels technologies like synthetic fuels, solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass. These tax credits expired in 1982 or 1985, except for solar and geothermal technologies. The act also introduced tax subsidies for gasohol and a tax credit for ethanol. Geothermal deposits became eligible for percentage depletion. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced tax incentives for energy conservation and alternative fuels, including geothermal. Geothermal deposits were made eligible for a 22% percentage depletion allowance, which is currently at 15%. The act also included a $3.00 production tax credit for unconventional fuels like oil from shale, gas from biomass, and synthetic fuels from coal. Additionally, facilities for producing fuels from solid waste were made exempt from federal taxation on interest for industrial development bonds. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced tax incentives for energy conservation and alternative fuels, including geothermal. Geothermal deposits were eligible for a 22% depletion allowance, now at 15%. The act also included a $3.00 production tax credit for unconventional fuels. Facilities for producing fuels from solid waste were exempt from federal taxation on interest for industrial development bonds. This approach towards energy tax policy has been followed since the 1970s, providing incentives for diverse energy conservation technologies. New incentives like the \u00a745 renewable electricity tax credit have been introduced to support renewable energy projects. Since the 1970s, policymakers have focused on increasing nontax interventions in energy markets, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. The Reagan Administration aimed for a neutral energy tax policy to promote efficiency and believed in private sector responsibility for commercializing conservation and alternative energy technologies. The Reagan Administration's energy tax policy aimed to promote efficiency and relied on the private sector for commercializing conservation and alternative energy technologies. High oil prices in the early 1980s provided encouragement for the development of alternative energy resources, aligning with President Reagan's free-market views and proposals to deregulate oil and natural gas prices. The Reagan Administration's energy tax policy aimed to promote efficiency and relied on the private sector for commercializing conservation and alternative energy technologies. In 1982, many of the Administration's objectives were realized, with business energy tax credits expiring for nonrenewable technologies and only credits for solar, geothermal, ocean thermal, and biomass technologies being extended. The tax credit for business investment in solar and geothermal technologies remains at 10% today. The Windfall Profits Tax was repealed in 1988, but other energy tax policy proposals were not adopted. The Reagan Administration's energy tax policy aimed to promote efficiency and relied on the private sector for commercializing conservation and alternative energy technologies. In 1982, business energy tax credits expired for nonrenewable technologies, with only credits for solar, geothermal, ocean thermal, and biomass technologies being extended. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 pared back tax incentives for oil and gas, but liberalization of the depreciation system and reduction in marginal tax rates resulted in negative effective tax rates for many investments, favoring oil and gas investments. Post-Reagan Administration, major energy and non-energy laws were enacted that amended tax policies. After the Reagan Administration, major energy and non-energy laws were enacted that amended energy tax laws in several ways. President George H.W. Bush's tax law included incentives for conservation, oil and gas, and alternative fuels. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 introduced the \u00a745 tax credit for kilowatt hour. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 introduced the \u00a745 tax credit for electricity generated from wind and biomass systems, along with other tax incentives for clean-fuel vehicles and nonconventional energy resources. President Clinton's Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 proposed a Btu tax on fossil fuels but was replaced with a 4.3\u00a2/gallon increase in excise taxes. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-34) replaced the proposed Btu tax with a 4.3\u00a2/gallon increase in excise taxes on motor fuels for deficit reduction. The Tax Relief and Extension Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-170) extended the renewable electricity production tax credit and suspended the net income limit on percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas wells. This shift in energy tax policy favored alternative fuels. Energy tax policy in the post-Reagan era focused on energy conservation, alternative fuels, and reducing oil import dependence. There were proposals for broad-based energy taxes like the Btu tax or carbon tax to address greenhouse gas emissions, but none were enacted. Fiscal concerns drove energy tax policy proposals, with a minor tax increase on motor fuels for deficit reduction in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Since about 1998, there have been negative energy market developments leading to congressional action on comprehensive energy proposals with tax relief for the oil and gas industry. The bills introduced in the late 1990s were in response to very low crude oil prices, reaching just over $10 per barrel in 1998-1999. Oil prices averaged about $17 per barrel from 1986 to 1999. From 1986 to 1999, oil prices averaged $17 per barrel, fluctuating between $12 and $20 per barrel. Low oil prices hurt producers, benefitted refiners, and discouraged conservation and investment in energy efficiency. Tax bills in the 106th Congress focused on production tax credits for wells. By summer 1999, crude oil prices rose to $20 per barrel, peaking at over $30 per barrel by summer 2000, causing higher gasoline, diesel, and heating oil prices. Legislative proposals addressed the effects of rising crude oil prices with production tax credits and supply incentives. The focus shifted to production tax credits and supply incentives to increase output and reduce prices, providing relief to consumers. Proposals in 2000 aimed to temporarily reduce or eliminate federal excise tax on gasoline and diesel to help cushion the financial impact of price spikes. Interest in excise tax moratoria and windfall profit tax on oil companies grew due to substantial profits from high prices. In the 106th Congress, there were proposals for a windfall profit tax on oil companies due to their substantial profits from high prices. Despite various bills addressing energy issues, no major energy tax bill was enacted. However, minor amendments were made to energy tax provisions in non-energy tax bills. Additionally, $500 million in loan guarantees for small independent oil and gas producers was enacted. In early 2001, the 107th Congress faced fluctuating oil prices, an electricity crisis in California, and spiking natural gas prices, reaching $9 per thousand cubic feet at the outset of the Congress. In 2002, an \"energy crisis\" led to congressional action on a comprehensive energy policy bill, with significant expansion of energy tax incentives and subsidies. The House and Senate approved two versions of an omnibus energy bill, with differences in energy tax measures. The House proposed larger energy tax cuts, reducing taxes by about $36.5 billion over 10 years, including tax credits for renewable energy standards. The House and Senate approved two versions of an omnibus energy bill in response to the 2002 \"energy crisis\". The House version focused on conventional fuels supply with incentives for oil, natural gas, and electricity production. The Senate bill provided fewer incentives for fossil fuels and nuclear power but more for alternative and renewable fuels. The bills were dropped in November 2002 due to unresolved differences. In April 2003, the Ways and Means Committee voted for an energy tax incentives bill that was incorporated into H.R. 6 and approved by the House. The House approved H.R. 6 on April 11, 2003, with energy tax incentives totaling $17.1 billion. This bill was a scaled-down version of a previous energy tax bill. House and Senate conferees reconciled differences in November 2003. The House approved H.R. 6 in April 2003 with energy tax incentives totaling $17.1 billion. Differences over energy tax issues remained between the two conference versions of the bill, including ethanol subsidies, unconventional fuels tax credit, nuclear power incentives, and clean coal. The House approved the conference report with $23.5 billion in energy tax incentives, but the proposed ethanol mandate would reduce energy tax receipts by $26 billion over 10 years. Senate Republicans abandoned attempts to pass H.R. 6 on November 24, 2003, due to a lack of 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster. This was the third failed attempt to pass comprehensive energy legislation. The Senate approved energy tax measures as part of the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004, which retroactively extended four energy tax subsidies on October 4, 2004. The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 retroactively extended four energy tax subsidies on October 4, 2004, including the renewable tax credit, suspension of the net income limitation for oil and gas, tax credit for electric vehicles, and deduction for clean fuel vehicles. These incentives were extended through December 31, 2005, with the phase-out of electric vehicle credit and clean-vehicle deduction starting in 2004 and resuming in 2006. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 included $5 billion in energy tax incentives. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 made extensive amendments to U.S. energy tax laws, and the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 extended energy tax subsidies. The Senate approved an energy bill in 2005 with $18.6 billion in energy tax breaks focused on renewable energy resources. The bill included $18.8 billion in tax cuts over 11 years, offset by $4.7 billion in tax increases. The House energy bill had energy tax incentives totaling $8.1 billion over 11 years, with no tax increases, focused on fossil fuels and electricity supply. The conference committee on H.R. 6 agreed on $11.1 billion in energy tax incentives, including $3 billion in tax increases. Comparing the revenue losses from energy tax incentives and the distribution by type of incentive as a percentage of net energy tax cuts over an 11-year period. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated net revenue losses over an 11-year period from FY2005 to FY2015. The total revenue losses were reported in two ways: absolute dollar value of tax cuts and percentage distribution of total revenue losses by type of incentive. Table 1 details various energy efficiency and conservation incentives, renewables incentives, oil and gas incentives, and coal incentives totaling billions of dollars. The $3 billion coal package included an 84-month amortization for pollution control facilities and treatment of \u00a729 as a general business credit. It also provided electricity incentives such as 15-year depreciation for transmission property, nuclear decommissioning provisions, and a nuclear electricity production tax credit. The final energy bill dropped a Senate-passed tax credit for recycling and instead included a provision for a study on recycling by the Treasury and Energy departments. The House and Senate approved the conference report in July 2005, clearing it for the President's signature in August 2005. The final energy bill, approved in July 2005 and signed into law in August 2005 (P.L. 109-58), included revenue offsets such as reinstatement of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, extension of the Leaking Underground Storage Tank trust fund rate, modification of \u00a7197 amortization, and a small increase in excise taxes on tires. The offsets totaled around $3 billion, with the oil and gas refinery sector facing a net tax increase. This was a response to high energy prices and aimed to rescind oil and gas incentives while raising energy taxes. Many bills in the 109th Congress aimed to repeal oil and gas industry tax subsidies, particularly the expensing of intangible drilling costs. Public outcry over high energy prices and industry profits led to proposals to raise energy taxes on oil and gas. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act (P.L. 109-222) reduced the subsidy for geological and geophysical costs in the oil and gas industry by extending the amortization period from two years to five years for major integrated oil companies. This change was a response to high energy prices and industry profits, with proposals to repeal oil and gas tax subsidies. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act extended the amortization period for geological and geophysical costs in the oil and gas industry from two years to five years for major integrated oil companies, increasing taxes by $189 million over 10 years. The 109th Congress enacted a tax extenders package in 2006, including extensions for renewable energy provisions. The curr_chunk discusses special energy tax subsidies and targeted energy taxes, indicating revenue effects. It distinguishes between tax subsidies (indicated by a minus sign) and taxes (no minus sign), with a focus on industry-specific provisions. The current tax law includes provisions that provide tax benefits to businesses, such as accelerated depreciation deductions. These deductions result in a revenue loss of $6.7 billion in FY2006, with a portion benefiting the domestic oil and gas industry. Continued high crude oil and petroleum product prices, along with political realignment in Congress after the 2006 elections, led to a shift towards increased taxes on the oil and gas industry. Proposals to reduce production incentives were debated in the 110th Congress, but ultimately dropped from energy policy legislation. The focus shifted towards energy conservation and alternative fuels over conventional hydrocarbons. The 110th Congress aimed to reduce tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry to fund energy efficiency and renewable fuels, focusing on reducing fossil fuel demand rather than increasing supply. Congressional leaders also sought to extend expired or expiring energy efficiency and renewable fuels tax incentives. The 110th Congress aimed to reduce tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry to fund energy efficiency and renewable fuels. The Senate stripped the controversial tax title from H.R. 6 and passed the bill on December 13, 2007, leading to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 being signed on December 19, 2007. Surviving tax-related provisions included an extension of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act surtax, higher penalties for failure to file partnership returns, and an extension of the amortization period for geological and geophysical expenditures. The Senate passed H.R. 6 on December 13, 2007, raising $103 million in revenues through a tax increase on the oil and gas industry. This offset the $2.1 billion lost in excise tax revenues for the federal Highway Trust Fund due to revised fuel economy standards. The decision to remove a $21 billion tax title was influenced by a White House veto threat and Senate's failure to end debate. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's cloture attempt fell short by one vote. Congress had made multiple attempts to pass energy tax legislation to avoid the expiration of popular energy tax incentives like the \"wind\" energy tax credit under IRC \u00a745. Since 1992, the IRC \u00a745 energy tax provision has lapsed three times and been reinstated. Senate Republicans opposed raising taxes to extend expiring energy tax provisions, particularly on the oil and gas industry. The Bush administration threatened to veto energy tax bills that increased taxes on oil and gas companies. House Democrats introduced and approved multiple energy tax bills due to frustration with Senate inaction. House Democrats introduced and approved several energy tax bills over the last two years, including H.R. 5351 and H.R. 6049. Despite House approval, Senate cloture votes prevented the bills from being debated. Energy tax provisions were part of H.R. 6899, passed on September 16, 2008. The Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act, passed on September 16, 2008, allows oil and gas drilling offshore in areas of the outer continental shelf previously off-limits, with certain restrictions on distances from shore. Revenue from new offshore leases would support alternative energy development. The bill also repeals the ban on leasing federal lands for oil shale production under certain conditions. Additionally, it enacts a renewable portfolio standard for power companies. The Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2008, including a renewable portfolio standard mandating power companies to generate 15% of energy from renewable sources by 2020, was a key focus in legislative efforts. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid emphasized the importance of passing the $40 billion energy tax bill, S. 3478, ahead of broader energy policy bills. He aimed to bring the bill to the floor during the week of September 15. Reid aims to bring the $40 billion energy tax bill to the Senate floor in September. The bill includes tax incentives for renewable energy but requires new revenue sources. Proposed offsets target major oil and gas producers, including a repeal of the manufacturing deduction and new excise taxes. Overall, $31 billion of the bill's funding would come from tax increases on the oil and gas industry. In 2017, tax increases on the oil and gas industry would contribute $31 billion to a $40 billion energy tax bill. Another $8 billion would come from securities brokers reporting transaction costs to the IRS. Some Republicans opposed raising taxes to offset energy tax provisions, especially on the oil and gas industry. The Bush Administration threatened to veto any bill increasing taxes on this industry. The inclusion of the \u00a7199 deduction repeal as an offset may prevent the energy tax bill from reaching the Senate floor. Senators Baucus and Grassley released a scaled-down version of S. 3478, a $17 billion energy tax extenders package fully offset and including increased taxes on the oil industry. This substitute bill freezes the value of the \u00a7199 for major integrated oil companies instead of repealing it completely. The substitute bill freezes the manufacturing deduction for oil companies at 6%, raising $4.9 billion over 10 years. Other provisions for renewable fuels and energy efficiency were cut back, including nuclear electricity production tax credit and renewable electricity tax credit. The bill was added to H.R. 6049 and passed by the Senate on September 23. The final bill, H.R. 6049, included energy tax amendments approved by the Senate and was added to the Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. President Bush signed the legislation, which includes $17 billion in energy tax incentives, with $10.9 billion for renewable energy, $2.6 billion for cleaner vehicles, and $3.5 billion for energy conservation. The energy tax extenders legislation is financed by raising taxes on the oil and gas industry through various measures like reducing tax breaks, freezing the manufacturing deduction at 6%, reforming foreign tax credit provisions, and increasing the per-barrel tax rate on refinery crude oil. The top five major integrated companies in the industry have seen surging revenues and record profits in the past decade. The top five major integrated oil companies reported over $100 billion in profits on nearly $1.5 trillion of revenues in 2007. Revenues increased by 51% from 2003 to 2007, while net income rose by 85%. Despite a decline in oil output, increased income was largely due to record crude oil prices, leading to calls for a windfall profit tax on the industry. Numerous bills were introduced in Congress to address this issue. Several bills were introduced in Congress to address the issue of windfall profits in the oil industry. One such bill, S. 3044, aimed to eliminate $17 billion in tax breaks for major oil companies over 10 years and impose a 25% windfall profit tax. This tax would increase marginal oil production costs, reduce domestic oil supply, and raise petroleum imports, potentially making the United States more dependent on foreign oil. Alternatively, an income-tax based windfall profit tax could generate significant revenue without impacting domestic oil supplies. To address windfall profits in the oil industry, proposals include eliminating tax breaks for major oil companies and imposing a windfall profit tax. An alternative approach suggests increasing the corporate tax rate by repealing deductions, such as the domestic manufacturing activities deduction, to recoup excess profits from major integrated oil producers. This method could raise significant revenues without affecting domestic oil supplies or increasing oil imports. Repealing tax breaks for oil companies, including major integrated firms, and freezing deductions at 6% for qualifying companies could generate $10 billion over 10 years. The farm bill (H.R. 2419) includes energy tax provisions promoting alternative fuels from agricultural resources. The text chunk provides information on various tax provisions related to renewable energy, energy conservation, coal, and oil and gas subsidies. It includes reports from the U.S. Congress Joint Tax Committee and the Congressional Research Service. The text chunk summarizes various reports on oil and gas tax subsidies, tax credits for hybrid vehicles, budget reconciliation, windfall profit tax implications, and energy tax bills comparison."
