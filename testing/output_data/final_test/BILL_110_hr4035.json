    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Student Loan Auction Market Act\" and involves market-based determination of lender returns. The \"Student Loan Auction Market Act\" involves a joint planning study by the Secretaries of Education and Treasury to select auction mechanisms for testing lender returns on loans under the Higher Education Act of 1965. The planning study under the \"Student Loan Auction Market Act\" will determine necessary administrative changes for market-based lender returns on loans under the Higher Education Act of 1965. It will examine auctioning existing loans, auctioning rights to originate loans, or selling securities backed by federally owned student loan assets. The planning study under the \"Student Loan Auction Market Act\" will assess efficient market-based alternatives for organizing auctions or sales of loans, including bundling loans and origination rights, capital structure of securitization plans, and servicing issues. It will also address how to ensure that regulatory requirements do not hinder separate management and ownership of loans or assets backed by loans. The study will consider market-based mechanisms to test pilot programs that guarantee loan availability under part B of title IV. The planning study under the \"Student Loan Auction Market Act\" will assess market-based approaches for ensuring loan availability, minimizing administrative complexity, and reducing Federal costs. A report on the study results and a plan for pilot programs using promising market-based approaches must be submitted to Congress within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretaries of Education and the Treasury will exclude certain factors when conducting the planning study and proposing pilot programs. The Secretaries of Education and the Treasury will exclude Federal PLUS loans from consideration for a competitive loan auction pilot program. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, will prepare for pilot programs after submitting a report to Congress. The Secretary of Education will implement pilot programs starting no earlier than July 1, 2009, lasting up to two academic years to determine lender returns for a portion of the annual loan volume under Title IV. During the second year of the pilot programs under this subsection, participation in auction-based pilot programs is voluntary for eligible institutions and lenders under Title IV. Savings generated from auctions will be distributed to participating institutions based on loan volume for financial aid, excluding eligible lenders under section 435(d)(2). The Government Accountability Office will conduct an independent evaluation of pilot programs under this section and the Higher Education Act. The evaluation must be completed within 120 days after the pilot programs end. Program-wide implementation will occur after the evaluation is submitted to Congress. The Secretary of Education is authorized to implement a program-wide, market-based system for all loans, excluding those under the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program. The system must ensure loan availability to eligible students and minimize administrative complexity for borrowers, institutions, lenders, and the Federal Government. The Secretary of Education is authorized to implement a program-wide auction-based system for student financial aid, consulting with various stakeholders. The Secretary of Education may consult with experts and utilize services from other federal agencies for planning studies and pilot programs."
