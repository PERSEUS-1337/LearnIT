    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tampon Safety and Research Act of 1997\". It includes findings related to tampon safety. The Congress finds that tampons are widely used by menstruating women in the US, containing dioxins which can have cumulative effects over time. FDA documents suggest insufficient investigation into the dangers of dioxin in tampons. The FDA relies on data from feminine hygiene manufacturers for product safety, including monitoring dioxin levels in tampons. The EPA considers dioxins a probable human carcinogen, with conflicting studies on the link to endometriosis risks. The EPA has linked high dioxin exposure to potential health risks like immune suppression, pelvic inflammatory disease, reduced fertility, and fetal development interference. Tampons may contain additives like chlorine compounds, absorbency enhancers, fibers, deodorants, and fragrances. Toxic shock syndrome, a rare bacterial illness, has been associated with tampon use, causing deaths and illnesses in menstruating women. Toxic shock syndrome linked to tampon use caused 55 deaths and 1,066 nonfatal cases. Synthetic fiber additives in tampons amplify toxin production associated with the syndrome. SEC. 3. National Institutes of Health amends the Public Health Service Act to include research on dioxin related to women's health. The Director of NIH, in collaboration with the Office, will conduct research on the risks of dioxin, synthetic fibers, and additives in feminine hygiene products on women's health, including cervical cancer, endometriosis, infertility, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, immune system deficiencies, pelvic inflammatory disease, and toxic shock syndrome, as well as on the health of children of women who used such products during or before pregnancies. Research under this section aims to confirm data on tampons and other feminine hygiene products submitted by manufacturers to the relevant authorities. Reports on the research results will be periodically shared with Congress, the FDA, EPA, and CPSC, and made publicly available. The research results on tampons and feminine hygiene products will be shared with Congress, FDA, EPA, and CPSC, and made available to the public through the data system and clearinghouse program."
