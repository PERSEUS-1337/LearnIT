The Secretary will make payments to producers on a farm eligible for direct payments for the 2005 crop of a covered commodity if the farm is in a disaster county or if producers have suffered qualifying crop losses due to damaging weather. The payment amount will be determined based on loss thresholds set by the Secretary. The payment amount to producers on a farm under this section is 50% of the direct payment they are eligible for in 2005. Producers must obtain crop insurance for the next two crop years as a condition of receiving the payment. Producers must repay any payments received under the contract in case of violation.
