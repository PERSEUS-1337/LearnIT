    "content": "The Act titled \"Rebuilding American Manufacturing Act of 2012\" establishes a 20 percent income tax rate for domestic manufacturing income under a new section called \"SEC. 200. DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING INCOME.\" The Act allows a deduction of 43 percent of domestic manufacturing income or taxable income for the taxpayer. The deduction is limited to 25 percent of the taxpayer's qualifying domestic investment, which includes W-2 wages. The deduction for domestic manufacturing income or taxable income is limited to 25 percent of the taxpayer's qualifying domestic investment, which includes W-2 wages and certain deductions under sections 167, 169, 179, and 179D, as well as the deduction under section 174. W-2 wages refer to amounts paid by the taxpayer for employment of employees during the calendar year. The deduction for domestic manufacturing income is limited to 25 percent of the taxpayer's qualifying domestic investment, which includes W-2 wages and certain deductions under sections 167, 169, 179, and 179D, as well as the deduction under section 174. The term 'qualifying domestic investment' excludes amounts not properly allocable to domestic manufacturing gross receipts. The Secretary will apply this subsection when a taxpayer acquires or disposes of a major portion of a trade or business during the taxable year. The term 'domestic manufacturing income' is defined as the excess of the taxpayer's domestic manufacturing gross receipts over the cost of goods sold and other allocable expenses. The Secretary will prescribe rules for proper allocation of these items to determine domestic manufacturing income. The rules will allocate items for domestic manufacturing gross receipts, regardless of direct allocability. Special rules determine costs, treating items brought into the US as acquired by purchase with a cost not less than its value. Similar rules apply to leased or rented property contributing to domestic manufacturing gross receipts. The increase in cost or adjusted basis for exported property shall not exceed the difference between its value when exported and when brought back into the US after further manufacture. Accelerated depreciation deductions for property placed in service between 2007 and 2012 are determined without regard to certain provisions. In the case of deferred compensation under nonqualified plans, the deduction is allowed for the taxable year when the services are performed. This does not apply to compensation for services before the taxpayer's first taxable year after December 31, 2012. The term 'domestic manufacturing gross receipts' is defined for this section. The term 'domestic manufacturing gross receipts' refers to the taxpayer's gross receipts from qualified property manufactured, produced, or grown in the United States, excluding receipts from food and beverages sold at retail. Gross receipts from government contracts still qualify even if the Federal Government holds title or risk of loss. The Federal Government holds title or risk of loss for property manufactured under a contract with them, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Qualified property excludes oil, gas, and certain other products. The subsection discusses the types of property that qualify for certain tax benefits, including property subject to section 613, specific types of property under section 168(f), electricity, potable water, and certain computer software. Additionally, partnerships owned by a single expanded affiliated group are treated as a single taxpayer for tax purposes. The term 'domestic manufacturing gross receipts' excludes gross receipts from property leased, licensed, or rented to related persons. Related persons are defined as those treated as a single employer under specific sections, with exceptions. The taxpayer may elect not to include certain income as domestic manufacturing gross receipts. Any gross receipts used for this deduction cannot be used for another deduction under section 199. This section also applies to partnerships and S corporations. For partnerships or S corporations, each partner or shareholder must consider their share of qualifying domestic items for tax purposes. The qualifying domestic investment of a partnership or S corporation for the taxable year is determined based on each person's share of the item. For trusts and estates, the items and investment are apportioned among beneficiaries and the fiduciary according to regulations. The adjusted gross income of a trust or estate for paragraph (4) is determined as provided in section 67(e) with adjustments. The Secretary may prescribe rules for allocation of items and investment, and reporting requirements. For individuals, adjusted gross income is substituted for taxable income. The adjusted gross income of a trust or estate is determined with adjustments as provided in section 67(e). Rules similar to section 199(d) apply for purposes of this section. Conforming amendments include changes to sections 56(d)(1)(A) and 56(g)(4)(C) of the Code. Section 200 allows deductions that do not apply to certain income amounts. Various provisions in the tax code are amended to include deductions under section 200. Additionally, section 163(j)(6)(A)(i) is amended to include deductions allowable under section 200. Section 200 deductions are incorporated into various provisions of the tax code, including sections 170, 172, 199, and 613. Deductions under section 200 are not allowed for domestic business income. The tax code amendments include redesignating subparagraphs and disallowing the deduction provided by section 200. The amendments made by section 200 regarding domestic manufacturing income will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2012."
