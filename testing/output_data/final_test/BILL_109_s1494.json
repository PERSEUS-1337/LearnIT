The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1992 is amended to establish the Chesapeake Bay Integrated Observing System in collaboration with various organizations in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The Chesapeake Bay Integrated Observing System (referred to as the `System') aims to provide essential information for restoring the health of the Chesapeake Bay, including data on land use, environmental quality, coastal erosion, ecosystem health, aquatic resources, and weather patterns. The System coordinates monitoring activities, identifies data collection needs, and utilizes new technologies to gather comprehensive environmental information. The Chesapeake Bay Integrated Observing System aims to provide environmental information for the Chesapeake Bay, including collecting and analyzing scientific data, managing and interpreting information, organizing data into useful products, and supporting the development of an Internet-based information system. The development of an Internet-based information system for integrating, interpreting, and disseminating coastal information, products, and forecasts related to climate, land use, coastal pollution, environmental quality, coastal hazards, ecosystem health, aquatic living resources, habitat conditions, economic and recreational uses in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The Director may enter agreements with other entities to provide and interpret data and information related to weather, tides, currents, sediments, nutrients, organisms, coastline erosion, and chemical processes. The Director may enter agreements with eligible entities for data collection, processing, analysis, and electronic publication of information products. Additionally, a Chesapeake Bay watershed education and training program will be established in cooperation with the Chesapeake Executive Council. The Director is authorized to award grants for a program expanding Chesapeake Bay watershed education, aimed at improving understanding of the ecosystem, providing community education for watershed protection, and meeting educational goals of the Chesapeake 2000 agreement.
