    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Clean Distributed Energy Grid Integration Act\". It includes findings related to energy grid integration. Congress finds that clean distributed energy technologies can create important values for both host facilities and electric grid operators. These values include energy bill savings, additional revenue from offering ancillary services, increased electric reliability during grid outages, improved power quality, and avoiding the need for transmission and distribution upgrades. New advances in intelligent sensing and simulation technologies can enhance the benefits of clean distributed generation by providing dispatchable energy, improving grid stability, and offering dynamic response to changing grid conditions. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"ancillary service\" refers to services necessary to support electric power transmission. \"Clean distributed energy\" denotes energy technologies located on the customer site and connected to the grid. \"Combined heat and power technology\" generates electricity and heat in an integrated system meeting efficiency criteria. Energy storage refers to technologies that store electric energy and can discharge on demand. A fuel cell is a device that produces electric energy from a chemical reaction. The grid consists of distribution and transmission lines, substations, sensors, and operational controls. Intelligence refers to devices or technologies that demonstrate adaptive and anticipatory capabilities. The curr_chunk discusses qualified waste heat resources, including exhaust heat, waste gas, pressure drops, and other forms of waste heat as determined by the Secretary. The curr_chunk defines waste heat to power technology as a system that generates electricity from a qualified waste heat resource, excluding heat from fossil fuel electricity generation. Research and deployment plan for integrating clean distributed energy with the grid. The Secretary will advance the integration of clean distributed energy into electric grids by conducting a study on the status of grid integration, identifying benefits and technical issues. The Secretary will conduct a study to identify technical issues and regulatory barriers hindering the integration of clean distributed energy resources into the grid. A report will be submitted to Congress within 1 year, and unobligated funds from the Department of Energy will be used for this purpose. Additionally, research proposals will be solicited to address technical barriers within 18 months of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary will issue a solicitation for research proposals to address technical barriers identified in a report submitted under subsection (b)(3) and make grants to selected applicants based on merit criteria. Funding may be requested annually for 2 years to carry out this subsection. The Secretary will convene a Stakeholder Working Group within 18 months of the Act's enactment to address regulatory barriers to intelligent grid integration of clean distributed energy technologies. The Group's purpose is to provide guidance on technical, regulatory, and economic factors limiting the integration of clean distributed energy into electric grids. The Group, composed of representatives with a material interest in clean distributed energy technology, will be selected based on qualifications and balance of interests. Their duties include reviewing regulatory barriers. The Group, composed of representatives with a material interest in clean distributed energy technology, will review regulatory barriers, identify additional barriers, and recommend actions to the Secretary. The Secretary will prepare and submit a report to Congress based on the Group's recommendations within 3 years. Funding for this initiative shall not exceed $2,000,000 in any fiscal year. The Secretary will issue a solicitation for demonstrations of integrating distributed energy resources into the grid within 3 years of the Act's enactment. Eligible entities include state and local agencies, public institutions, private companies, electric utilities, and equipment manufacturers. Grants may be provided for demonstration projects. The Secretary may provide grants up to $5,000,000 to eligible entities for demonstration projects addressing critical barriers. Funding requests for this subsection cannot exceed $15,000,000 annually for three years starting in the third fiscal year after the Act's enactment. The Secretary may provide grants up to $5,000,000 for demonstration projects addressing critical barriers. Funding requests cannot exceed $15,000,000 annually. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress on progress and identify any issues requiring legislative action."
