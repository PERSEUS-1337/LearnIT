    "content": "The role of working memory is crucial for visual reasoning and decision making in cognitive systems. Significant progress has been made in understanding human/animal working memory mechanisms and artificial neural network frameworks. Visual working memory tasks involve identifying previously seen images in a sequence. Our study explores different methods of training recurrent neural networks to learn a working memory model for remembering input images over time. We use supervised and reinforcement learning approaches, with the latter inspired by the dopaminergic mechanism in the prefrontal cortex. The VWM task serves as an environment that rewards the agent for remembering past information and penalizes it for forgetting. Based on our analysis, a gated recurrent neural network model with long short-term memory units trained using reinforcement learning is efficient in consolidating input spatial information over time. The initial analysis aims to use artificial neural networks to model the working memory of the brain and understand memory mechanisms using brain imaging data from human subjects during a VWM cognitive task. Memory is crucial for intelligent problem-solving, serving as a workspace in the brain to encode and maintain relevant information for cognitive tasks. Various cognitive tasks, such as the Visual Working Memory Task, have been used to study working memory in animals. Artificial intelligence systems have made significant progress in using artificial neural networks as memory for learning tasks. This progress presents an opportunity to computationally model the brain's working memory system. The study focused on computationally modeling the brain's working memory system, using 36 relevant studies to choose models for experiments in supervised and reinforcement learning settings. The models solved a binary classification problem, predicting unseen(0)/seen(1) images with accuracy measured as a percentage. Evaluation was repeated for 10 independent trials as part of ablation studies."
