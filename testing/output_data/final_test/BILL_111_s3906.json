    "content": "The \"PREEMIE Act\" aims to reduce preterm birth, expand research on its causes, and improve care standards for at-risk pregnant women and preterm infants. It includes provisions for research and activities at the National Institutes of Health to address preterm labor, delivery, and infant mortality. The Secretary, through the Director of NIH, will enhance research on preterm labor, detection tools, and care for preterm infants. This includes integrating various disciplines and sciences to collaboratively address the causes of preterm labor. Additionally, a multi-center clinical program will be established to investigate obstetrical issues related to low birth weight prevention. The Director of NIH will award grants for trans-disciplinary research centers to improve care for preterm infants and understand the underlying processes of preterm birth. The Director of NIH will award grants for trans-disciplinary research centers focusing on prematurity research, including neonatal and maternal-fetal medicine multi-center research networks with a focus on clinical trials. Activities will progress from basic research to translational, interventional, and clinical research. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2011 through 2016. For fiscal years 2011 through 2016, funds are allocated for planning grants in 2011 and for establishing centers in 2012 through 2016 under the trans-disciplinary research centers for prematurity. The Director of NIH is required to report on the activities of these centers. SEC. 4. RESEARCH AND ACTIVITIES AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct ongoing epidemiological studies on factors related to prematurity, improve national data tracking of preterm birth burden, and develop novel approaches. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop, implement, and evaluate new prevention methods for late preterm birth, conduct etiologic and epidemiologic studies, expand research on obesity and disparities, and assess the effectiveness of community interventions. Reports on progress will be submitted to Congress every 2 years. The Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Act is amended to provide necessary funding for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Act is amended to provide funding for fiscal years 2012 through 2016, including research and activities at the Health Resources and Services Administration. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a Telemedicine Demonstration Project on High Risk Pregnancies, providing grants for remote obstetric services to high-risk women. The Telemedicine Demonstration Project on High Risk Pregnancies provides grants for remote obstetric services to high-risk women, including telehealth services for midwives and educational activities on preterm birth risk factors. Eligibility requires submitting an application to the Director. Additional funding is allocated for grants under subsection (q) for fiscal years 2011 through 2015. The Telemedicine Demonstration Project on High Risk Pregnancies provides grants for remote obstetric services to high-risk women, including telehealth services for midwives and educational activities on preterm birth risk factors. Eligibility requires submitting an application to the Director. Additional funding is allocated for grants under subsection (q) for fiscal years 2011 through 2015. Public Health Service Act is amended to include core risk factors for preterm labor, medically indicated deliveries before 39 weeks, outcomes for infants born before 39 weeks, risk factors for preterm delivery, importance of preconception- and prenatal care, smoking cessation and weight maintenance, treatments and outcomes for babies born premature, and informational needs of families during the stay of an infant in a neonatal intensive care.

The bill also addresses preventable birth injuries, oral health, and the use of progesterone. SEC. 6. OTHER ACTIVITIES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a national education campaign on preventing preterm birth, targeting women of childbearing age, high-risk populations, ethnic minorities, and those with low socioeconomic status through competitive contracts with entities. The Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality of the Department of Health and Human Services annually develops and updates a strategic plan for preterm birth research. They also submit an annual report to the Secretary and the public on their activities related to infant mortality, prematurity, and low birthweight. The Secretary ensures the committee's membership. The Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality includes representatives from the original charter and the National Center for Health Statistics. The Secretary oversees pilot programs through various agencies to address infant mortality, prematurity, and low birthweight. The Secretary may conduct research studies and demonstration projects to test maternity care models aimed at reducing preterm birth rates. Grants may be awarded to eligible entities such as hospitals or collaborative networks that follow evidence-based practices and submit required applications. The Secretary may award grants to areas with high rates of preterm birth. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2011 through 2016."
