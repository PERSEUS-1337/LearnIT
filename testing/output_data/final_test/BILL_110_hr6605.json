Eligibility is determined by adjusted gross income, with higher income individuals facing restrictions on loan amounts. Repayment agreements must be made within 2 years of receiving the loan funds. Each State receiving a grant must submit an annual report. Each State receiving a grant under this section must submit an annual report detailing the use of funds from the State loan fund.
