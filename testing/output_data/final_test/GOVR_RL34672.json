    "content": "Auction-rate securities (ARSs) were popular for long-term borrowing with interest rates tied to short-term money markets through auctions. They were used by municipalities, public authorities, and institutional borrowers since the mid-1980s, reaching a market value of over $330 billion by 2007. However, the 2007-2008 credit crunch revealed flaws in ARS design, leading to a halt in new issuances. Many borrowers saw ARS as a cost-effective funding option compared to other strategies. Interest rates for auction-rate securities are tied to short-term market rates, making them a cost-effective borrowing option. However, ARS auctions created liquidity risks for investors and interest-rate reset risks for issuers. The 2007 financial turmoil led to failed ARS auctions, causing temporary illiquidity for investors. Despite a return to normalcy, some institutional investors began withdrawing funds from ARS markets. In 2007 and early 2008, ARS auctions were saved from failure by investment banks stepping in, but in mid-February 2008, key banks stopped supporting auctions, leading to widespread failures. This caused liquidity to disappear, hindering investors' ability to sell holdings and raising borrowing costs for issuers. Many turned to alternative securities like VRDN/VRDO or fixed-rate bonds. The collapse of the ARS market raised concerns about increased borrowing costs for state and local governments, disruptions in higher education finance, and questions about federal financial regulation. Congress held a hearing on ARSs in September 2008, highlighting the importance of ARS markets in funding municipal infrastructure projects. Policymakers have looked to infrastructure investments to stimulate economic activity and increase future productivity, but financing costs for state and local governments have seen significant increases. Many state and local governments faced higher financing costs for their ARS debt after interest auctions failed, coinciding with the economic recession. Congress held hearings to address concerns about increased borrowing costs and disruptions in federally guaranteed loan programs, particularly in the student loan sector. The House and Senate Committees held hearings on the impact of financial market turmoil on student loans. Congress passed the ECASLA in response, allowing the Secretary of Education to provide capital to student lenders. The focus was on facilitating the purchase of newly originated loans, rather than directly affecting existing SLARS debt. The Obama Administration proposed an expansion of the federal Direct Loan program and a halt in new FFELP loans. The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009 proposed ending FFELP lending in June 2010, which was signed into law on March 30, 2010. Starting July 1, 2010, new FFELP lending will cease, and an expanded Direct Loan program will provide all new Stafford, PLUS, and consolidation loans. Holders of existing FFEL program loans will continue to be responsible for servicing the loans. The U.S. Department of Education will finance federally guaranteed student loans instead of private capital. The collapse of the ARS market may lead to changes in financial regulation. Municipal bonds and student loan-backed bonds are prominent in the ARS market. Congressional oversight of financial markets is increasing. At the end of 2007, tax-preferred and taxable municipal bonds, along with securities backed by student loans, dominated the ARS market. Issuers of auction-rate securities, like student lenders, work with broker/dealers to underwrite and distribute securities. Broker/dealers sell securities for the issuer, who receives the net proceeds. Issuers often obtain bond ratings from agencies like Fitch or Moody's, and some also secure bond insurance for investor protection. Typically, broker/dealers receive an initial fee equal to 1% of the transaction. The auction mechanism for auction-rate securities (ARS) involves broker/dealers receiving fees based on the amount underwritten and managed. An auction agent, usually a bank, runs interest-rate auctions where investors submit bids. Interest-rate auctions are held every 7, 14, 28, or 35 days, with investors stating how much they wish to hold and the lowest interest rate they will accept. The broker/dealer facilitates the transactions between buyers and sellers in the ARS market. The auction mechanism for auction-rate securities (ARS) involves broker/dealers receiving fees based on the amount underwritten and managed. An auction agent runs interest-rate auctions where investors submit bids. The clearing rate is the interest rate of the last bidder assigned a portion, and bids above this rate receive none of the issue. If bids are insufficient, the auction fails, and the interest rate is set by the securitization contract. Liquidity for ARS essentially depends on auction success. The auction mechanism for auction-rate securities (ARS) involves broker/dealers receiving fees based on the amount underwritten and managed. The ARS market allowed issuers to borrow more cheaply and gave investors slightly better yields compared to other financial instruments. The global credit crunch in August 2007 strained the ARS market, leading to difficulties in finding new buyers for ARSs and putting pressure on investment bank balance sheets. Efforts to avoid auction failures increased pressure on investment bank balance sheets, leading to the collapse of the ARS market in February 2008. By 2005, concerns about liquidity risks in ARSs were noted, with financial advisors advising clients to reduce holdings. Major accounting firms recommended classifying ARSs as \"investments\" rather than \"cash equivalents\" in financial reports. Despite claims of ARSs being highly liquid investments, the risk of auction failure was downplayed. The accounting profession's view of ARSs was not affected by claims of liquidity, leading to a reduction in their attractiveness on corporate balance sheets. Some corporations had to exchange ARS assets for more traditional cash equivalents to meet cash reserve requirements. Changes in financial accounting treatment indirectly impacted the ARS market, but were not seen as the main cause of auction failures in 2007. Merrill Lynch managers were concerned that highlighting liquidity risks associated with ARSs could undermine the market. German banks became more reluctant to provide letters of credit in 2006, affecting the ARS market. This led to a rise in the cost of letters of credit needed for Variable-Rate Demand Obligations/Notes (VRDN/VRDOs), making ARSs a cheaper financing option. The SEC sanctioned 15 broker/dealers in 2006 for irregularities in auction-rate securities. In 2006, the SEC sanctioned 15 broker/dealers for irregularities in auction-rate securities markets, including failure to disclose interventions in auctions. Analysts were concerned that the consent decree might hinder dealer support for auctions, potentially increasing liquidity risks. Some ARS contracts allowed broker/dealers to see investor bids before auctions, potentially influencing prices and allocations. Broker/dealers had the ability to influence prices and allocations of ARS shares in auctions. They could set interest rates within a range for auctions with few bids at risk of failing. Internal emails suggest broker/dealers effectively set prices for such auctions, resembling market makers in London stock markets. Market makers controlled order books, held inventory, and executed trades to balance supply and demand. Before the global credit crunch in 2007, broker/dealers had the ability to influence prices and allocations of ARS shares in auctions by setting interest rates. However, after August 9, 2007, more than 60 auctions failed, leading to widened interest-rate spreads between government securities and money market rates. This was due to concerns about mortgage-backed liabilities threatening financial institutions, potentially impacting ARSs backed by collateralized debt. The global credit crunch in 2007 affected Auction Rate Securities (ARSs) in three ways. Some ARSs were backed by collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) linked to mortgages, while others had interest-rate caps tied to LIBOR or Treasury rates, making them less attractive. Corporations became more aware of ARS liquidity risks, leading to pressure on investment banks highly exposed to mortgage-backed securities. This forced banks to de-leverage and liquidate assets, putting additional strain on major ARS broker/dealers. After the global credit crunch in 2007, investment banks faced increased pressure to support Auction Rate Securities (ARS) auctions to prevent failures. Major investors were withdrawing from the ARS market, leading to a rise in ARS inventories at some banks. For example, UBS increased its ARS holdings fivefold from June 2007 to January 2008. This intensified support for ARS auctions while banks were hesitant to add more ARS assets to their strained balance sheets. In the first half of 2007, UBS held $1-2 billion of auction-rate securities, which increased to nearly $10 billion by February 8, 2008. This raised risk-management concerns amidst mounting mortgage-backed securities losses. Some investment banks aggressively marketed ARSs to small investors to reduce inventories, but auctions began to fail as broker/dealers ceased support on February 13, 2008. This led to a market freeze, leaving investors with illiquid investments in long maturities. Some ARS auctions failed in mid-February 2008, causing financial stress for some issuers. Municipal ARS assets continued to operate normally, with penalty rates leading many cities to refinance their debt. Student loan ARSs had limited penalty rates due to bond contract provisions. Some investors earned higher interest rates than usual money market rates. The lack of liquidity in ARSs has decreased their value, causing investors to be left with long-maturity assets when auctions fail. Small investors who borrowed to meet short-term obligations paid higher rates than what the securities returned. The collapse of the ARS market in February 2008 caught many by surprise due to various factors undermining the viability of ARS auctions. The collapse of the ARS market in February 2008 was unexpected due to factors undermining the viability of ARS auctions. Liquidity risks can arise from causes other than default risk, affecting the ability to sell assets like student loans and municipal debt. Despite low default risks for assets backed by municipalities, liquidity risks can still impact the ability to sell to third parties. Default rates for investment-grade municipal debt are historically lower than Aaa-rated corporate debt. Probabilities for investment-grade municipal debt are lower than Aaa-rated corporate debt, with higher recovery ratios. Moody's and Fitch plan to recalibrate municipal ratings to align with corporate credit ratings. Guaranteed assets still carry financial risk, as federal guarantees for student loans may delay payments to asset holders. Bond insurers provide guarantees for timely payment on asset-backed securities, but concerns about their financial condition could impact investor confidence. The breakdown of auction-rate securities markets is mainly due to their design features introducing liquidity risk, rather than the quality of underlying assets. ARS backed by municipal taxing authority or federally guaranteed student loans have minimal default risk. Unlike traditional short-term bonds, ARS holders retain assets if an auction fails, leading to liquidity concerns for investors. The fear of auction failures in auction-rate securities can deter investors, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy. This dynamic resembles a bank run, where concerns about liquidity can impact the market. ARS holders may face liquidity issues if auctions fail, similar to a traditional banking model where short-term funds are used for long-term investments. The fear of auction failures in auction-rate securities can deter investors, resembling a bank run. A study suggests that the ARS market failed due to investor run and coordination failure among major broker-dealers. Deposit insurance is a classic solution to prevent bank runs, while in ARS markets, a third-party guarantee for investors to redeem their investments could be a solution. Many issuers have restructured ARSs into alternative investment vehicles. Many issuers have restructured ARSs into alternative investment vehicles like VRDOs with put options for guaranteed liquidity. The cost of put options increased during the credit crunch, but credit markets started to normalize in the second half of 2009. Some issuers used bond insurance to enhance credit quality, but downgrades in mortgage markets led to disruptions in debt markets. Many municipalities and public borrowers faced debt downgrades due to rating agencies' perception of financial weakness in bond insurers. This led to forced sales of debt by high-quality borrowers, increasing market strain on firms providing liquidity to the variable-rate debt market. A warning email from a Merrill Lynch trader highlighted potential downgrades of bond insurers affecting the ARS market. Interest rate caps may have contributed to the collapse. Interest rate caps on student loan-backed auction rate securities may have led to the collapse of the ARS market. These caps were added to enhance bond ratings and ensure payments in case of auction failure. Caps were important for securities backed by guaranteed student loans, where borrower interest rates and lender yields are legislatively determined. The Special Allowance Payment (SAP) for student loans can vary based on loan type and lender. Cash flows from student loan pools used to pay investors holding auction-rate securities depend on commercial paper rates and federal subsidies. Rating agencies view caps as crucial safeguards against high payout rates that could deplete loan pools. Caps on ARSs may limit interest rates to a fixed percentage above benchmark rates like LIBOR or Treasury rates. Some ARSs also have caps to ensure a fixed spread over a benchmark rate for income from the loan pool. Income from the trust's loan pool could pay a fixed spread over a benchmark rate, with maximum-interest-rate caps to ensure minimum cash flows. Municipal ARSs, backed by taxing power, typically lack interest-rate caps. State governments may intervene to prevent defaults. Municipal ARS interest costs have risen without caps, but fewer auctions have caps. Some broker/dealers convinced rating agencies to temporarily waive interest-rate maximums on ARS auctions to prevent failures. Without waivers, some ARS yields were uncompetitive with money market alternatives. Cash-flow caps on student loan ARSs triggered near-zero interest-rate maximums in extreme cases. Investment banks realized the reimposition of caps would impact ARS debt inventories. The expiration of temporary maximum-interest-rate waivers on ARS auctions could lead to financial losses for banks as some yields may fall below the cost of capital. UBS withdrew support for ARS auctions in February 2008 due to the realization that interest cap waivers would expire. Internal emails highlighted the impact of prevailing market conditions on excess spread of structured products, triggering max rates and potentially resulting in auctions resetting at below market yields. Rating agencies' unwillingness to grant waivers on max rates could accelerate financial stress. The expiration of waivers on maximum interest rates for ARS auctions may lead to below market yields, causing financial strain on broker dealers and investors. The collapse of the auction-rate securities market resulted in illiquid assets for investors and higher interest costs for issuers. Many were not warned about liquidity risks. Many investors and financial professionals were not alerted to liquidity risks with auction-rate securities, as major investment banks misrepresented them as \"cash equivalents.\" Corporate treasurers believed dealers would prevent auction failures, with some even promising support. However, accounting firms warned of liquidity risks in 2005, and some financial institutions had previously cautioned investors. Litigation by state attorneys general ensued. Litigation by state attorneys general and class-action suits are restructuring the auction-rate securities markets. The SEC settled with major broker-dealers, while private litigation continues between ARS holders and broker-dealers. Investment banks are buying back ARSs from investors, with Citibank agreeing to repurchase $7.5 billion in ARS from small investors and UBS agreeing to buy back $22.1 billion. UBS, the second largest ARS broker/dealer, agreed to buy back $22.1 billion in auction-rate securities. Merrill Lynch also agreed to repurchase $10-12 billion in ARS starting in January 2009. Other major banks like Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wachovia have made similar agreements with the New York State attorney general. Fidelity reached a deal to buy back $300 million in ARS, while Charles Schwab & Co. was charged by the SEC for misinforming customers about ARSs. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) maintains a website listing firms involved in ARS agreements. Broker/dealers may sell ARSs to institutional investors or hedge funds to address liquidity concerns. Settlements with broker-dealer firms exclude high-net-worth individuals and large corporations. Some non-financial firms holding ARSs have marked down their values, while others have not. Some firms have specialized in the valuation and repurchase of ARSs at discounts from par. Corporate treasurers holding ARSs have called for federal assistance to sell illiquid assets. A coalition of corporations holding student loan ARSs commissioned a study suggesting federal assistance could generate a stimulative effect by freeing up liquidity for new manufacturing facilities in the US. The multiplier used in the study exceeds CBO estimates for economic stimulus effects. It is uncertain if federal assistance would prompt action from the coalition. Some firms have initiated private lawsuits against broker-dealers for ARS-related issues. Legal barriers may hinder claims, with courts dismissing suits for lack of specificity or intent/knowledge of wrongdoing. Concerns exist about investment banks buying back illiquid ARS assets for favored clients without offering relief to others. FINRA issued guidelines in 2008 for fair treatment of auction-rate securities. Investment banks face pressure to address concerns of major corporate customers holding illiquid ARS assets. Untangling the ARS market is complex, with different challenges for various sectors. The municipal ARS market has restructured more smoothly than the student loan ARS market. By July 2009, around $120 billion in ARSs had been refinanced since the failures in February 2008. By April 2008, around half of municipal ARS auctions were not failing, but issuers still exited the market. Some municipalities restructured ARS debt, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which redeemed its ARS debt due to high interest rates. Washington, D.C. also redeemed $800 million in ARS and VRDO debt, saving $10 million annually. Market volumes for VRDOs increased, while interest in new ARS deals decreased. About a third of municipal ARS debt was refinanced by April 2008. In 2008, a third of municipal ARS debt had been refinanced. Some borrowers used ARSs to hedge interest rate risks through swaps linked to LIBOR. However, during 2008, this hedge generally performed poorly as interest rates rose sharply, triggering penalty rates. LIBOR rates increased by less than ARS rates for some issuers. The City of Baltimore, Maryland has sued banks for artificially low LIBOR rates. Banks may have understated borrowing costs during financial turmoil. Barclays Bank admitted to manipulating certain LIBOR rates in a settlement. Investigations are ongoing. Student loan ARS market shows sparse signs of recovery. The student loan ARS market has shown sparse signs of recovery, with nearly all auctions continuing to fail due to maximum-interest-rate caps. Only $3 billion of the $80 billion in auction-rate debt held by nonprofit student lenders had been restructured by August 2008. Refinancing student loan-backed ARS debt may be complicated by the structure of SLARSs and the presence of private student loans, which pose greater default risks. Finding new funding for refinancing may be harder for student loan issuers compared to municipal and closed-end fund issuers. Private student loans could complicate refinancing options due to the structure of SLARSs. The trust holding the underlying student loan assets plays a key role in SLARSs, with income generated used to make interest payments to investors. The flow of income from the trust is variable, influenced by borrower defaults, prepayments, and lender subsidies tied to interest rate benchmarks. Issuers and trustee banks have limited control over this income flow. The income flow for SLARS trusts is uncontrollable as lender yields are set by law. Credit ratings agencies impose conditions on trust structures to minimize default risk, using stress tests to assess sustainability under adverse scenarios. The credit rating is tied to specific protections for SLARS issuers. The collapse of auction-rate securities in February 2008 led to issuers and investors seeking alternatives like VRDOs for new debt issues and refinancing existing ARS debt with fixed-rate long-maturity bonds. Municipal debt has been refinanced using various instruments to mitigate risks. The collapse of auction-rate securities in February 2008 led to a shift towards alternatives like VRDOs for new debt issues and refinancing existing ARS debt with fixed-rate long-maturity bonds. ARSs lacked a put option, making them vulnerable to tight credit conditions or liquidity fears. Investors accepted the risk of liquidity evaporating if auctions failed, leading many to return to instruments with a put option. Omitting a put option allowed issuers to avoid certain underwriting costs. VRDOs, similar to auction-rate securities, have long maturities with interest rates tied to short-term money markets. They include a put option for investors to resell assets after a notice period. Issuers often secure a letter of credit or SBPA from a financial institution to cover potential repurchases, but obtaining these has become more costly due to increased demand and higher risk premia. In 2008, investors sought to withdraw funds from VRDO markets, putting pressure on issuers. Municipal issuers have refinanced ARS debt, but student loan issuers have not. Refinancing ARS debt requires finding new investors and paying fees to various parties. Designing fixed-rate bonds for student loan issuers is challenging due to variable income flows and limited sources of income. Some argue that interest rate caps have kept payments below market levels, dampening enthusiasm for refinancing. Municipal ARS issuers have more diverse revenue streams to pay interest expenses compared to student loan issuers. Municipal issuers, whose debts are backed by the power to tax, may prefer fixed-rate bonds. Taxing ability simplifies credit ratings and allows for better terms on letters of credit. Some closed-end funds use tender option bonds to redeem ARSs. ARS market issues since 2007 may be linked to broader financial market challenges. ARSs introduced liquidity risks with serious consequences for issuers and investors if auctions failed. ARSs bundled small benefits with serious costs in financial turmoil due to asymmetric risks. The attractiveness of ARSs was based on the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates, allowing issuers to pay short-term rates on long-term debt. Issuers, investors, and investment banks benefitted from ARSs as long as auctions ran smoothly. Not all asymmetric risks are problematic, but they can present challenges to financial markets. Asymmetric risks in financial markets, like those found in ARSs, can be challenging to manage. While insurance markets have tools to handle such risks, other markets may struggle with poorly understood or difficult to assess asymmetric risks. Machinery assessing credit risks often focuses on long-term default risks, neglecting short-term liquidity risks. Some market arrangements meant to strengthen long-term default risks may actually worsen short-run liquidity risks. The presence of caps on some ARSs exacerbated short-run liquidity risks, while credit agency ratings provided investors with vital information on default risks. Despite efforts to inform clients about ARS auction mechanics, investors were not given key information about market trends in 2007 and 2008. Asymmetric risks in financial markets can also present challenges to corporate governance. Managers may be tempted to pursue risky strategies if they benefit from lower costs or increased profits at the expense of others. Corporate governance procedures and compensation schemes can help mitigate these temptations. Auction-rate securities have been used since the mid-1980s to lower borrowing costs for issuers compared to fixed-rate debt. ARS interest rates have been consistently lower than variable-rate bond rates in the past five years. Since August 2007, auction-rate securities have caused sharp increases in financing costs for student lenders, municipalities, and other public borrowers. ARSs created liquidity problems for many holders of ARS debt. The savings generated by ARSs before 2007 may have outweighed the increased costs afterwards. Restructuring ARS debt could be a long and expensive process, putting pressure on municipalities and complicating student loan financing. Some issuers argue that ARSs were the best option. Auction-rate securities (ARSs) have complicated student loan financing due to liquidity problems and increased costs since 2007. Some issuers believe ARSs were the best option, but former SEC Commissioner Arthur Levitt criticized them for not exercising critical judgment in choosing financial instruments. Financial innovation has introduced more efficient ways of matching investors to borrowers, but the complexity of new financial instruments has created new risks that may strain existing corporate governance and ratings structures. The turmoil in ARS markets since late 2007 has raised concerns about transparency and fair dealing in publicly traded securities. State attorneys general have filed suits alleging that investment banks failed to disclose rising liquidity risks to clients between August 2007 and February 2008. Legal remedies have been pursued, with some investors pushing for investment banks to buy back ARSs from smaller investors. Investors are concerned about the lack of protection in existing remedies for ARS market issues. The SEC regulates investment banks and brokerages involved in ARS transactions. Following a 2006 consent decree, the SEC has increased oversight of ARS industry. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox vowed to investigate firms selling ARS to individual investors. The SEC was involved in negotiating settlements with Citicorp, Merrill Lynch, UBS, and Wachovia, subject to approval. Additionally, two Credit Suisse brokers were charged with securities fraud for mislabeling $0.8 billion of ARSs sold to foreign clients. The brokers were charged with securities fraud for mislabeling $0.8 billion of ARSs sold to foreign clients. Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt criticized the SEC for being passive in addressing the financial turmoil consequences. Major ARS settlements were mainly driven by state regulators, with SEC enforcement actions lagging behind. The collapse of the ARS market has put financial strains on various entities and may lead to taxpayers bearing the costs of refinancing ARS debt. Some argue that firms selling securities should absorb losses instead of passing costs to taxpayers. Senator Grassley suggested offsetting fines with tax deductions to prevent financial burdens on investment banks during economic turmoil. Some firms purchased ARSs for higher yields without \"put\" provisions, leading to difficulties in reselling. Federal aid to ARSs holders may resemble ex-post insurance, potentially impairing corporate treasurers' motivation to invest prudently. A private solution is being considered to help thaw the frozen student loan ARS (SLARS). A private solution to address the frozen student loan ARS (SLARS) market involves multiple parties such as student lenders, broker/dealers, and bond insurance companies. Some student lenders may want to call SLARSs below par to reduce costs or minimize default risks. Broker/dealers, covered by ARS settlements, are reluctant to sell SLARSs back below par due to mark-to-market accounting rules. Some broker/dealers balanced their ARS portfolio by issuing swap contracts. The collapse of the ARS market has raised concerns about higher interest costs and challenges in refinancing ARS debt, potentially hindering state and local government borrowing and infrastructure project financing. Some bond insurers may offer financial support for ARS repurchases to reduce default risk liabilities in the future. However, this solution may not benefit investors or corporations with SLARS holdings not covered by buy-back settlements. The collapse of the ARS market could impact state and local government borrowing and infrastructure projects. Concerns have been raised about credit terms not reflecting credit quality, leading to higher borrowing costs. Municipal issuers have used bond insurance to lower default risks, but downgrades of insurers have caused issues. Federal legislation on bond insurers could affect municipal debt markets. Rating agencies play a crucial role in reducing borrowing costs by providing accurate credit information. The Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 required rating agencies to report to the SEC, focusing on long-term default risk over short-term liquidity risks. Encouraging agencies to consider a broader range of risks could benefit investors and capital markets. The ARS market is unwinding, but the student loan ARS market remains frozen, potentially requiring federal intervention. Some suggest amending the Higher Education Act for federal purchase of older guaranteed student loans. The proposed Senate amendment submitted by Senator Sherrod Brown on May 26, 2010, would allow the government to purchase certain federally guaranteed student loans, potentially unfreezing the student loan ARS market. This intervention could provide liquidity to the market, but concerns have been raised about using federal funds for this purpose. The proposed Senate amendment would eliminate the requirement to include the OMB Director in the suitability requirement for purchasing certain FFEL consolidation loans. The purchases would be made through the ED's Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduit program, created by the ECASLA. This proposal would allow ED to purchase loans excluded from ECASLA mechanisms, but challenges may arise due to the expired authority to issue new FFEL loans. Another bill, the Municipal Market Liquidity Enhancement Act of 2009, would amend the EESA. The bill proposed on May 21, 2009, would amend the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 to give the Treasury Secretary authority to refinance auction-rate securities. Municipal securities and federally guaranteed student loans are the main segments of the auction-rate securities market, known for their high quality. Despite disruptions in the market, the need for financial intermediation between investors and public borrowers/student lenders will persist. Some experts believe financial markets may not learn from past mistakes due to turnover in personnel and gains from financial engineering techniques. Congressional and regulatory decisions on financial reporting and oversight will impact market structure and participant behavior."
