    "content": "The USFS has been selling timber for over a century, starting with the authorization to proclaim national forests in 1891. Congressional concerns in 1898 led to provisions limiting forest reservations to specific purposes, including timber supply for citizens. The first timber sale was in 1899 to the Homestake Mining Company. USFS timber sales grew slowly until the 1950s when sales expanded rapidly due to post-World War II demand and decline in private forest supply. The high level of USFS timber sales was sustained through the 1980s, except for during the 1980 and 1982 recessions. The decline in USFS timber sales began in 1990 due to litigation to protect the northern spotted owl. This decline was not solely caused by the listing of the owl as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, but also by broader issues. USFS timber sales have remained modest for the past two decades due to environmental concerns and weak wood products demand globally. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the U.S. Department of the Interior sells timber, with the majority coming from Oregon and California (O&C) grant lands in western Oregon. These lands were originally granted to the Oregon and California Railroad Company in 1869 but were returned to federal ownership in 1915. The O&C lands also include the Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) grant lands. The O&C and CBWR lands in Oregon were returned to federal ownership in 1919 to resolve litigation. Management of these lands was directed to the DOI in 1937. Timber sales from O&C lands declined after 1990 due to habitat protection for the northern spotted owl. Congress directed the USFS to give 25% of its gross receipts to states for roads and schools in 1908. The state determines funding allocation for roads and schools, based on gross receipts from various sources. The USFS provides 25% of a seven-year average of receipts to states for mandatory spending, with payments made automatically unless Congress intervenes. The O&C Act of 1937 allocated 50% of receipts from O&C lands to counties for governmental purposes, 25% for land administration, and 25% for tax liabilities. After tax liabilities were paid, all of the 25% went to land administration, increasing the Treasury share to 50%. CBWR lands payments were not initially included but were later added, allowing counties to receive up to 50% of receipts. The CBWR act directed that counties receive up to 50% of receipts from CBWR lands based on county tax rates. President Clinton proposed a 10-year payment program to address economic issues caused by declining timber sales due to conservation efforts. These \"spotted owl payments\" started at 85% of average payments between FY1986 and FY1990, decreasing annually to 58% in FY2003. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination (SRS) Act of 2000 was a response to concerns about declining timber sales and county payments, especially with the declining spotted owl payments. The program provided optional substitute payments for counties, based on the three highest payments between FY1986 and FY1999. Counties receiving payments of $100,000 or more were required to spend a percentage on reinvestment projects on federal lands. SRS payments were authorized for six years, FY2001-FY2006. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination (SRS) Act of 2000 provided optional substitute payments for counties based on the three highest payments between FY1986 and FY1999. The program was authorized for six years, FY2001-FY2006, with a one-year extension for FY2007 and an amendment in 2008 for a four-year extension. The amended version included a complicated formula for payments, transition payments for some states, and retained federal land reinvestment and special purposes provisions. The amended SRS payments expired at the end of FY2011, with payments returning to previous levels unless Congress enacts an alternative program before September 30, 2012. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 provided substitute payments for counties based on past revenues. Congressional efforts to reauthorize the program face challenges, including the need for funding offsets and the issue of \"linkage\" where counties aligned with the timber industry for revenue-generating activities. Counties aligned with the timber industry for revenue-generating activities and opposed environmental groups in debates over USFS and O&C management. Three bills in the 112th Congress address USFS payments for counties, including H.R. 3599 and S. 1692 to extend the SRS Act for five years, and Title I of H.R. 4019, which introduces the County, Schools, and Revenue Trust for Federal Forest Land. The bill introduces unique definitions such as \"Trustee\" for the Secretary of Agriculture and \"community wildfire protection plans.\" It also defines terms like \"Federal lands\" and \"National Forest System\" with potential conflicts. The County, Schools, and Revenue Trust would be established with the Secretary of Agriculture as the Trustee. The bill establishes the County, Schools, and Revenue Trust with the Secretary of Agriculture as the Trustee. It includes provisions for the appropriation of $875 million and directs the portion of receipts from trust projects to be deposited in the trust. Political subdivisions with National Forest System lands eligible for payments under SRS can choose not to participate annually. The bill establishes the County, Schools, and Revenue Trust with the Secretary of Agriculture as the Trustee. Counties can choose not to participate in the trust program, which would then prohibit trust projects on their lands. The Secretary of Agriculture must determine the annual revenue requirement and minimum sale level for each unit of the National Forest System. The revenue requirement is based on 60% of the average annual gross receipts from FY1980 to FY1999, while the minimum sale level is based on 50% of the average annual timber volume sold from FY1980 to FY2000. The chargeable volume is the amount of timber counted towards the allowable sale quantity on National Forest System land. Section 104 may pose management challenges for forest supervisors in meeting the minimum sale level while maintaining a perpetual supply. Trust projects would provide funds deposited in the trust, limited to meeting the annual revenue requirement and not exceeding the necessary number of projects. Trust projects cannot occur on National Forest System lands in counties that opt out of the program. Trust projects could not occur on National Forest System lands in counties that opt out of the trust program, in components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, or on lands where Congress had prohibited timber harvesting. Section 105 of the bill would direct that trust projects be consistent with NFMA plans for each unit but allow modifications for each project. Public review, comments, and environmental review would be required for trust projects. The provisions of section 105(d)(1) in H.R. 4019 streamline the process for implementing trust projects by deeming compliance with various environmental acts. It establishes a notice and comment process for proposed projects, with a 30-day public comment period and a requirement for a final decision within 90 days. The process for implementing trust projects includes a 30-day public comment period and a 90-day deadline for a final decision. An environmental report is required within 180 days of the initial notice, with a shortened deadline of 30 days for catastrophic events. Public comment and objection periods may be adjusted accordingly. The environmental review for trust projects evaluates impacts on endangered species and public comments, with modifications to meet revenue requirements. The report cannot exceed one-third of project receipts and may not be subject to judicial review. 65% of project receipts go to the trust, while 35% goes to the Treasury for Forest Service use. The Forest Service may allocate funds for performance-based cash awards to employees who exceed sales targets. Deposits to the trust are distributed to states for use in counties with national forests, following specific allocation guidelines. States must spend the money on roads and schools in these counties. The USFS allocates 25% of payments to states based on forest receipts and county acreage. Section 107 is unclear on state allocation, which could follow the SRS formula or be based on current forest receipts. Trust payments must be used for roads and schools as per SRS guidelines. The SRS Section 102(d) outlines requirements for counties with payments over $350,000, specifying how funds should be allocated for various projects. Counties with smaller payments may be exempt from certain project allocations. Section 107(b) does not specify if Title II projects can be done as trust projects. Title I of H.R. 4019 proposes changes to federal land management, focusing on generating revenues for counties. This shift may impact benefits to the public and future generations, while potentially creating jobs in the timber industry. The bill assumes compliance with existing statutes like NEPA, ESA, and NFMA, which could eliminate external enforcement of these regulations. The bill H.R. 4019 proposes changes to federal land management, potentially impacting benefits to the public and future generations. It assumes compliance with existing statutes like NEPA, ESA, and NFMA, which could eliminate external enforcement of these regulations. The bill would establish a fiduciary responsibility to the Secretary of Agriculture as trustee for the trust, with technical implementation questions and issues discussed. Additionally, the bill includes no direction on deposits to the National Forest Fund for USFS 25% payments. The bill H.R. 4019 proposes changes to federal land management, establishing a trust for income generation. It is unclear on the responsibilities of the agency and citizens to protect assets. The bill may limit challenges to management decisions for income generation, potentially prioritizing short-term gains over long-term asset preservation. Counties would benefit from the trust but may bear few responsibilities or costs. The federal government bears the costs of implementing and administering trust projects for income generation in counties. H.R. 4019 proposes an annual revenue requirement of 60% of average gross receipts from National Forest System units, raising questions for Congress. Funding availability and potential supplement to annual appropriations remain unclear. The bill proposes an annual revenue requirement of 60% of average gross receipts from National Forest System units, raising questions for Congress about the selection process and definitions of \"gross receipts.\" The bill does not define \"gross receipts\" and there are uncertainties about what receipts would be available to make specified payments. The bill proposes an annual revenue requirement of 60% of average gross receipts from National Forest System units, but the basis for calculating this is unclear. If the gross receipts were based on averages from FY1980 through FY1999, the annual revenue requirement nationally would likely be $550 million to $600 million. However, the actual requirement could vary depending on estimates and assumptions. There are different categories of receipts that could be deposited in the trust, including those currently deposited for USFS 25% payments. The National Forest Fund (NFF) accumulates USFS receipts not deposited into an account with mandatory spending authority. Congress directs NFF funds for specific purposes like the 10% Roads and Trails Fund. Various land uses generate receipts: Timber sales - $18.8 million annually, Grazing fees - $1.9 million annually, Minerals - $45.3 million annually. The National Forest Fund (NFF) collects various receipts for specific purposes, including $44.0 million annually for FY2008-FY2010 from the Minerals Management Service (MMS) and $44.2 million annually for FY2008-FY2010 from recreation fees. Additionally, $16.9 million annually for FY2008-FY2010 is collected from fees for land uses and power. The National Forest Fund (NFF) collects various receipts, including deposits from the Minerals Management Service (MMS) and recreation fees. Possible sources of funds for the trust could be funds deposited in many of the MSAs, such as the Knutson-Vandenberg (K-V) Fund and the Salvage Sale Fund. These funds are used for reforestation, timber stand improvement, and other resource enhancements in timber sale areas. The National Forest Fund (NFF) collects various receipts, including deposits from the Minerals Management Service (MMS) and recreation fees. Possible sources of funds for the trust could be funds deposited in many of the MSAs, such as the Knutson-Vandenberg (K-V) Fund and the Salvage Sale Fund. These funds are used for reforestation, timber stand improvement, and other resource enhancements in timber sale areas. Annually for FY2008-FY2010, funds from timber sale receipts, brush disposal, and stewardship contracting retained receipts were allocated for additional salvage timber sales, cleaning up slash in timber sale areas, and special timber sales with additional land and resource treatments. The USFS can substantially expand the funds available for the trust by determining the amount deposited in these accounts and choosing to undertake stewardship contracting. The agency could increase funds for the trust by depositing K-V and Salvage Sale Funds directly, potentially diverting funds from other MSAs. This could result in an average of $141.9 million annually for FY2008-FY2010. Additionally, activities generating receipts for MSAs could be designated as trust projects, potentially shifting an average of $124.0 million annually for FY2008-FY2010. The Recreation fees under FLREA and the 10% Roads and Trails Fund are two large accounts, totaling $78.4 million annually for FY2008-FY2010. These funds have primarily been used to address the $5.5 billion backlog of deferred maintenance in national forests. Additionally, there are MSAs with funds for specific purposes that may not be available for the trust, including the Restoration of Lands and Improvements account. The largest account, Restoration of Lands and Improvements, collects funds from contractors for incomplete work, while the Cooperative Work account funds jointly beneficial projects. These accounts averaged $67.7 million annually for FY2008-FY2010. Current NFF receipts could provide $83 million to $127 million annually, with potential for an additional $142 million annually by shifting timber-related MSAs deposits to the trust. The USFS could potentially deposit $349 million to $393 million annually into the trust by designating certain activities as trust projects. However, the trust would likely need receipts of about $550 million to $600 million annually, requiring additional funds ranging from $423 million to $517 million if only current NFF receipts were deposited. Timber sales would need to increase significantly to meet these funding requirements. The USFS may need to increase timber sales significantly to generate enough funds for the trust, with potential annual timber harvests reaching levels triple that of the past 20 years. This could require altering timber sales and allocation methods to meet funding requirements of about $281 million to $375 million annually. If all activities funding MSAs were designated as trust projects, annual requirements could be reduced to $157 million to $251 million. Increasing timber sales by 98% to 156% would generate additional revenue, but there is debate over feasibility and desirability due to concerns about sufficient timber availability in national forests. Softwood growing stock has increased by 23% between 1953 and 2007, with a significant rise in medium-sized trees. The timber inventory in national forests has increased, with growth exceeding harvests and mortality rates. This suggests that more timber could be cut, especially in salvaging trees killed by fires, insects, or diseases. However, sawmill capacity in some areas has declined in the past 20 years. Sawmill capacity in some areas of the Rocky Mountains has declined substantially in the past 20 years, raising questions about market demand for increased federal timber harvests. Additional timber harvests could generate more jobs in the industry, with job multipliers ranging from 6 to 26 direct and indirect jobs per million board feet harvested. Recent studies suggest a lower job multiplier of 11.28 jobs per million board feet in Washington in 2004. If the estimated additional timber sales of 5.1 billion to 8.7 billion board feet were achieved, it could result in additional direct and indirect jobs. The USFS could adjust timber practices to generate additional revenue and create 57,000 to 98,000 timber industry jobs. Shifting funds from K-V, Salvage, and brush disposal funds to the trust is feasible, but additional appropriations may be needed for tasks like reforestation and wildfire prevention. Shifting timber harvests to focus on large-diameter trees could also be beneficial. The emphasis on logging large-diameter trees in forests could lead to ecological problems, such as exacerbating wildfire threats by leaving small trees and debris. This approach, known as \"high-grading,\" degrades forest conditions and increases the risk of catastrophic wildfires. The practice of \"high-grading\" forests by logging large-diameter trees is considered poor forest management. It could take decades to realize the extent of damage and even longer to restore the forests. This practice could also impact wildlife populations and increase wildfire risks. Harvesting additional timber in national forests could generate revenue for trust payments to counties, with receipts from trust projects deposited into the trust. The USFS could prioritize timber sales in high-value areas like the Allegheny National Forest, regardless of where the receipts are generated. Counties in the trust payment program could benefit from increased timber sales, with the potential for trust payments to be used in other areas. H.R. 4019 focuses on increasing revenues for the trust through timber sales, but it does not limit revenue sources to just timber sales. The bill aims to increase revenues for the trust through various means, not just timber sales. This includes issuing grazing permits, special use permits for various activities, and projects related to community wildfire protection. Livestock grazing and biomass removal for wildfire protection are unlikely to generate significant revenue. Special use permits in national forests, including for renewable energy production, could generate revenues for the trust. The USFS seeks fair market values for these permits, which are currently used for activities like ski areas and commercial filming. Fees from wind or solar farms are being studied for their revenue potential, while other activities may also require special use permits. Under FLREA, the USFS can charge fees for various recreational activities, excluding some like parking, picnicking, camping at undeveloped sites, and hunting/fishing for those with specific access rights. Special use permits could be issued for activities like hunting, fishing, ATV/snowmobile use, and commercial guiding, potentially generating revenue. However, the collection and enforcement costs in remote areas may outweigh the receipts, with local residents likely bearing the fee burden. H.R. 4019 lacks penalties for not meeting revenue requirements and does not provide a notice-and-comment process for environmental reports on proposed trust projects by the USFS. In cases of catastrophic events, the USFS must produce an environmental report within 30 days and can shorten the public comment period. H.R. 4019 does not specify penalties for USFS failing to meet deadlines for trust projects. Section 105(e) would exempt trust projects from NEPA and ESA compliance, with the environmental report not equivalent to NEPA or ESA reviews. The report must evaluate environmental impacts, address public comments, and ensure revenue goals are met. H.R. 4019 would ban judicial review of trust project reports and limit administrative review to submitting objections without requiring USFS response. This raises concerns about the report's purpose in informing timely decisions and meaningful public input. Compliance with Section 105 would satisfy various environmental laws, but enforcement mechanisms for project deadlines are not specified. H.R. 4019 could potentially exempt timber harvests for trust projects from certain laws like NFMA Section 14, but could still lead to litigation under laws such as the Clean Water Act and the ESA. The bill also limits judicial review and administrative response for trust project reports, raising concerns about public input and decision-making processes. The bill, H.R. 4019, aims to exempt timber harvests for trust projects from certain laws like NFMA Section 14, potentially leading to litigation under laws such as the Clean Water Act and the ESA. It also limits judicial review and administrative response for trust project reports, raising concerns about public input and decision-making processes. Additionally, the bill proposes allocating 65% of trust project receipts to the trust, a significant increase from historic allocations. The bill, H.R. 4019, proposes allocating trust project receipts to the trust, potentially based on historic USFS payments or the SRS formula, which could significantly impact state allocations. The bill, H.R. 4019, proposes allocating trust project receipts to the trust, potentially based on historic USFS payments or the SRS formula, which could significantly impact state allocations. If the allocation were based on historic payments, trust payments would rise in states like Oregon, Washington, and California, while they would decline in states like Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming if based on the SRS formula. Counties exceeding specified amounts may allocate 15%-20% of payments for projects. The bill proposes allocating trust project receipts to the trust, potentially impacting state allocations. Counties may allocate 15%-20% of payments for projects. Trust payments could be higher than shown in the table for counties opting out of the program. The bill also allocates 35% of receipts to the U.S. Treasury and allows funds to be appropriated to the USFS. The bill proposes a bonus for employees who help exceed timber sales targets, regardless of environmental and economic consequences. Implementation of the bill may raise various issues, such as inaccuracies in grazing fees and volume calculations. The bill proposes a bonus for employees exceeding timber sales targets, with potential issues in grazing fees and volume calculations. Implementation provisions may raise complicated issues, including state education funding, O&C lands inclusion, national forest parts implementation, timber sale practices, regulations need, and impacts on USFS staffing and funding. Section 102(c)(3) aims to prevent states from adjusting state educational funds in response to USFS state payments, potentially conflicting with state prerogatives and the U.S. Constitution. The bill includes provisions for federal trust payments, with potential concerns about the voluntary nature of the program and the exclusion of certain lands from specific requirements. The Secretary of Agriculture is directed to identify trust projects on National Forest System lands, but there are no instructions for O&C lands. The bill includes provisions for federal trust payments, directing trust project revenues to the U.S. Treasury for appropriation to the USFS. It is unclear if O&C lands are eligible for trust payments, and counties can opt out of the program. Trust projects are prohibited on lands in counties that opt out. The bill includes provisions for federal trust payments to the USFS, but counties can opt out of the program, prohibiting trust projects on their lands. Calculations and decisions for the program would be directed at units of the National Forest System, which could complicate forest management due to unclear definitions and organizational differences within the USFS. Under the SRS payment program, counties could opt in or out, leading to potential complications for national forests spread across multiple counties. About a quarter of proclaimed national forests had counties opting in or out. Implementing the trust payment program may require additional surveying to ensure trust projects only occur in counties that have not opted out. Section 14 of NFMA outlines guidelines for timber sales in the National Forest System. The bill outlines guidelines for timber sales in the National Forest System, requiring appraisal of timber value, competitive bidding, USDA supervision of harvest, and development of utilization standards. It is unclear if these guidelines will be enforced for trust projects. Regulations may be needed for consistent practices. Procedures and regulations may be necessary for trust projects to ensure consistent practices and proper deposit of receipts. H.R. 4019 could increase USFS staffing and funding needs for administering timber sales, with additional staff required for preparation and administration. Implementing different sale regulations on adjacent lands could significantly increase workload. Additional funding would likely be needed to administer the trust and trust payments. Additional funding would likely be needed to replace funds for timber sale preparation, reforestation, fuel treatment, and mitigation of effects from additional timber sales. Funding for staff to administer the trust and trust payments would also be necessary. The extent of possible additional funding needs is unclear. The extent of additional funding needs for the trust is uncertain, but it could be as much as the decline in deposits to USFS MSAs. It is unclear how this funding would be provided in the current federal fiscal situation."
