    "content": "In 2007, AIG was the fifth-largest insurer globally with $110 billion in revenues. It ranked second in property/casualty insurance premiums and first in life insurance premiums in the US. AIG had various top rankings in different insurance lines but was outside the top 10 in homeowners insurance. The company had numerous state-regulated insurance subsidiaries and non-insurance entities under its holding company. AIG, primarily an insurer, faced financial difficulties in 2008 due to losses from derivative activities of AIG Financial Products and securities lending managed by AIG Investments. The company's insurance operations were mainly regulated by individual state regulators, making it outside the normal Federal Reserve facilities for lending to financial institutions. In 2008, AIG faced financial difficulties due to losses from AIG Financial Products and securities lending managed by AIG Investments. Regulatory oversight was split between OTS and state insurance regulators. A significant decline in stock price and credit rating downgrades led to demands for collateral, raising the possibility of bankruptcy. In 2008, AIG faced financial difficulties leading to fears of bankruptcy. Calls for government action arose due to concerns about the spillover effects of a potential failure. Efforts to secure private funding failed, and the Federal Reserve approved a loan of up to $85 billion to prevent AIG's collapse. The Federal Reserve approved an extraordinary loan of up to $85 billion in September 2008 to prevent AIG's collapse. Additional funding was provided by both the Fed and the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act overhauled the financial regulatory structure in the United States, moving federal financial holding company regulation to the Federal Reserve. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council and enhanced supervision by the Fed for designated institutions like AIG. The act also restricted the Federal Reserve's lending authority to prevent future extraordinary assistance to individual companies. States remain the primary regulators of AIG's insurance operations. The assistance provided to AIG sparked controversy on various levels. The assistance for AIG sparked controversy regarding employee compensation, leading to legislation aimed at restricting excessive pay for TARP recipients. Questions arose about transparency and legality of the assistance. Questions have been raised about the transparency and legality of the government assistance provided to AIG. It is argued that AIG acted as an intermediary for the assistance, with funds flowing out to entities on the other side of financial transactions. The true beneficiaries of the federal funds may have been AIG's counterparties, who were not fully identified until public and congressional pressure. Lawsuits have been filed challenging the legality of the government actions related to the assistance. Lawsuits have been filed by Starr International Company, Inc. challenging the legality of government actions related to the assistance provided to AIG. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of Starr but did not award damages. The case was appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the case back to the Court of Federal Claims. Starr's attorney indicated that an appeal was likely. The government assistance for AIG, which began in 2008, ended in 2013. All loans have been repaid, assets sold, and equity holdings in AIG have been divested. A small amount of warrants issued to the Treasury were repurchased by AIG in 2013, lifting corporate governance restrictions. Various forms of assistance were provided, including Federal Reserve loans and TARP assistance in multiple restructurings. The government provided assistance to AIG in three major restructurings from 2008 to 2010, including an $85 billion loan commitment in September 2008. The loans were gradually reduced and eventually repaid in January 2011 through cash gained from sales. The loans to AIG were repaid in January 2011 through cash from asset sales and TARP assistance. The Fed received $8.2 billion in interest and dividends, and the Treasury sold the common equity stake for $17.55 billion. Federal Reserve profits doubled from 2007 to 2010, with remittances mostly going to the Treasury. Fed loans to AIG were partially replaced by loans to LLCs Maiden Lane II and III, totaling $52.5 billion, with $43.8 billion disbursed. These LLCs purchased securities that were later sold as market conditions improved. The Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) was created by the Federal Reserve in 2008 to provide liquidity during the financial crisis. AIG and its subsidiaries borrowed up to $20.9 billion, with actual borrowing reaching $16.1 billion in January 2009. CPFF borrowing by AIG is not typically included in the reporting of AIG assistance by the Fed and Treasury. This borrowing occurred concurrently with other Fed loans and TARP assistance, likely preferred due to lower interest rates. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Fed to report full details. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Fed to report full details of the CPFF and other Fed facilities. AIG borrowed from October 2008 to April 2010, with estimated interest earnings of $0.4 billion for the Fed. TARP assistance to AIG started with $40 billion in November 2008, increased to nearly $70 billion in March 2009, and reached a maximum disbursement of $67.8 billion in January 2011. $47.5 billion in AIG preferred equity was converted into common equity. In January 2011, $47.5 billion in AIG preferred equity was converted into common equity, increasing government ownership to 92%. The Treasury began selling the common equity in May 2011 and completed sales in December 2012. AIG redeemed unconverted preferred equity in March 2012. The Treasury also sold stock warrants back to AIG in March 2013. Approximately $55.34 billion was recouped from various sales and dividends, resulting in a $12.5 billion shortfall on the TARP assistance for AIG. The government provided direct assistance to AIG, including loans and preferred equity purchases. AIG also benefited from other government actions during the financial crisis, such as TARP providing additional capital to U.S. banks. This assistance helped AIG's financial position and may have given the company advantages in insurance and debt markets. The government's assistance to AIG during the financial crisis provided the company with advantages in insurance and debt markets. The reputational effect of government-backing had both positive and negative impacts, leading AIG to even change the name of its primary insurance subsidiary. Additionally, AIG benefited from tax rulings by the IRS, allowing the company to report a $17.7 billion accounting gain in 2011. The government's assistance to AIG during the financial crisis included tax rulings by the IRS, resulting in a $17.7 billion accounting gain in 2011. The Treasury and CBO did not include these tax benefits in their assessments of the assistance. The overall cost of the AIG assistance seems straightforward, with a positive return of $23.1 billion when considering interest, dividends, and equity sales returned compared to the amount disbursed. The cash accounting for the AIG assistance resulted in a positive return of $23.1 billion, but a full economic assessment is needed. Factors like the time value of money and opportunity cost of funds are typically considered in such assessments. CBO's budgetary cost estimates for TARP incorporate broader economic principles, recognizing the present value of long-term costs and using market rates in calculations. The CBO estimates a budgetary cost of $15 billion for the TARP portion of AIG assistance, compared to a negative return of $12.5 billion using simple cash accounting. The Federal Reserve actions, which make up most of the returns from government assistance for AIG, are not subject to regular CBO or OMB budget assessments. CBO estimated a cost of $2 billion from Federal Reserve loans to AIG at inception, with a final positive return of $35.6 billion on a cash accounting basis. The CBO estimates for TARP and Federal Reserve actions for AIG assistance became more positive over time. The Fed announced a $85 billion loan to AIG with conditions on fund drawdowns and interest rates. A new CEO was appointed, and Fed staff oversaw operations. AIG had to pay interest on drawn and undrawn funds from the facility. The government provided AIG with an $85 billion loan at an 8.5% interest rate. The government also received warrants for a 79.9% ownership stake in AIG. Three trustees were appointed to oversee the firm. The loan was secured by AIG's assets, reducing the risk for the Fed and taxpayers. On September 18, 2008, the Fed announced lending $28 billion initially out of $85 billion to AIG, which later increased to around $61 billion by November 5, 2008. The Fed also provided assistance by swapping cash for up to $37.8 billion of AIG's securities to cover losses from the securities lending program. This facility lasted until September 16, 2010, with an interest rate of 1% over. The Fed provided assistance to AIG by lending $28 billion initially, which later increased to around $61 billion by November 5, 2008. AIG also received cash collateral in exchange for securities to cover losses from the securities lending program. The Commercial Paper Funding Facility was introduced to restore liquidity in the commercial paper market, open to various recipients, not just AIG. The Fed purchased commercial paper through the CPFF, offering discounts based on OIS rates. AIG utilized up to $20.9 billion from the CPFF, but downgrades limited access to $15.2 billion. By January 28, 2009, AIG repaid $1.7 billion to the CPFF. As of February 17, 2010, outstanding CPFF borrowing was $2.3 billion. The CPFF ceased new purchases on February 1, 2010. The Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury restructured assistance to AIG in November 2008, easing payment terms with a $40 billion capital injection and up to $52.5 billion in Fed loans for troubled assets. AIG repaid all CPFF borrowing by April 2010. The Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury restructured assistance to AIG in November 2008, reducing the $85 billion loan facility to $60 billion, extending the time period to five years, and easing financial terms. Through TARP, the Treasury purchased $40 billion in preferred shares of AIG, with a 10% dividend per annum. The Treasury paid a 10% dividend per annum on shares held in trust for the U.S. Treasury under the Fed loan. Government equity interest in AIG remained under 80% after TARP intervention. Troubled asset purchases related to AIG were done by LLCs controlled by the Federal Reserve. Maiden Lane II was set up for residential mortgage-backed securities, and Maiden Lane III for collateralized debt obligations. Under the November 2008 restructuring, Maiden Lane II received loans totaling $22.5 billion from the Fed and $1 billion from AIG to purchase RMBS from AIG's securities lending portfolio. The Fed's loan to Maiden Lane II had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1% for six years, while AIG's loan had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3%, but was subordinate to the Fed's loan. Proceeds from Maiden Lane II were to be distributed for operating expenses, principal and interest due to the Fed, and deferred payment and interest due to AIG. Under the November 2008 restructuring, Maiden Lane II received loans totaling $22.5 billion from the Fed and $1 billion from AIG to purchase RMBS. The Fed received $2.3 billion in capital gains, while AIG received $460 million. Maiden Lane II purchased RMBS with the loans and the securities had a face value of nearly double the purchase price. Maiden Lane III could receive loans up to $30 billion from the Fed and $5 billion from AIG to purchase CDOs. Maiden Lane III received loans totaling $24.3 billion from the Fed and $5 billion from AIG to purchase CDOs. The securities in Maiden Lane III were sufficient to fully repay the loans, with the Fed receiving $5.9 billion in capital gains and AIG receiving $2.9 billion. The Fed loaned $24.3 billion of the $30 billion maximum, while AIG loaned $5 billion to Maiden Lane III. The LLC received $5 billion in loans from AIG and $35 billion in cash collateral for purchasing CDOs. AIGFP received $2.5 billion in return for the collateral. Maiden Lane III purchased CDOs worth $62.1 billion. In March 2009, there was a revision of financial assistance to AIG due to a $60 billion loss announced by AIG in the fourth quarter of 2008. Private credit ratings agencies were considering downgrading AIG, leading to potential collateral calls. The Treasury provided revised assistance to AIG to address significant challenges caused by market deterioration. The assistance included exchanging $40 billion in preferred shares for $41.6 billion in shares resembling common equity. Dividends on the new shares were non-cumulative and paid at 10% when declared by AIG's Board of Directors. The government had the right to appoint new directors to the board for four quarters. AIG committed to up to $29.8 billion in additional preferred share purchases from TARP. The interest rate on the Fed loan facility was reduced to three-month LIBOR plus 3%. The Fed revolving credit facility limit was reduced to as low as $25 billion. AIG was to repay up to $34.5 billion of the outstanding Fed credit facility through asset transfers. AIG transferred majority stakes in its foreign life insurance subsidiaries ALICO and AIA to the Fed, with a $25 billion repayment of the Fed loan completed in December 2009. The repayment through securitization of life insurance cash flows did not occur as expected. AIG continued to access the Fed's Commercial Paper Funding Facility until February 2010. The structure for winding down AIG's assistance was announced in September 2010. The restructuring of AIG's assistance was announced in September 2010, with transactions closing on January 14, 2011. The Fed's direct involvement was ended through loan repayment and transfer of equity to the Treasury. Government's preferred shares were converted into common shares for easier sale. Steps included repayment of $19.5 billion to the Fed, transfer of equity from AIA and Alico to the Treasury, and redemption of TARP funds. The Treasury redeemed equity interests held by the Fed, converting $49.1 billion in TARP preferred shares into approximately 1.1 billion common shares in September 2010. The Treasury held 1.655 billion shares of AIG common stock, or 92.1% of the total. AIG could issue $2 billion of new Series G preferred shares purchased by the Treasury, with the option to convert to common shares by March 2012. None of these shares were issued. AIG issued warrants to private shareholders, allowing for the purchase of up to 75 million new shares at $45 a share. This benefited private stockholders and potentially reduced the government's assistance return by $1.2 billion. Executive compensation restrictions were imposed on AIG's senior executive officers under TARP. The Treasury imposed stricter executive compensation restrictions on AIG compared to other TARP participants, in recognition of the special assistance received. The 111th Congress further limited executive compensation for financial institutions under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This included prohibiting certain executives from receiving bonuses, retention, or incentive compensation. The executive compensation restrictions imposed on certain executives include limitations on bonuses, recovery of inaccurate compensation, prohibition of manipulation of earnings, and restrictions on \"golden parachute\" payments for departing executives and highly compensated employees. The executive compensation restrictions under the EESA prohibit manipulation of earnings to enhance employee compensation, except for bonuses required under pre-existing contracts. The Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation made specific determinations for AIG compensation."
