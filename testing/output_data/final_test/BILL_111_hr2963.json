    "content": "SECTION 1. SMALL MANUFACTURERS' COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TAX CREDIT IN LIEU OF EXPENSING. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to add a new section for a tax credit for small manufacturers for computer hardware and software. The small manufacturers' computer hardware and software credit is determined as the lesser of 50% of the amount paid for qualified computer hardware and software property or $35,000. Qualified property includes computer hardware and software for use in small manufacturers in the US, with original use by the taxpayer, subject to depreciation, and placed in service after the enactment of this section. The term \"computer hardware\" includes disk drives, integrated circuits, display screens, cables, modems, speakers, and printers. The term \"computer software\" refers to programs, programming languages, data directing computer operations, enterprise resource planning software, manufacturing resource planning software, materials requirements planning software, and software enhancing Internet capabilities. A small manufacturer is defined as any unincorporated business, partnership, or for-profit corporation with an average of 50 or fewer employees. Small manufacturers with 50 or fewer employees are defined as small businesses. The number of employees is calculated based on the average number of employees expected to work on business days in the current calendar year. The employees of a subsidiary of a wholly owned corporation are included in this calculation. The small manufacturers' computer hardware credit applies to employees of a parent corporation and any subsidiary corporation. The basis adjustment reduces the property's basis by the credit amount. The section does not apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2011. The small manufacturers' computer hardware and software credit under section 45R denies a double benefit by disallowing a deduction equal to the credit amount. The credit can be applied against alternative minimum tax. Transferability of Credit: The credit allowed by section 45R can be transferred through sale and repurchase agreements. Effective Date: Amendments apply to taxable years ending after December 31, 2008."
