    "content": "MODIFICATION OF SAVER'S CREDIT. Expansion of Phaseout Ranges for the 50 percent credit for all taxpayers under section 25B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The applicable percentage is 50 percent, but it will be reduced based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income compared to the phaseout range. The reduction determined under this paragraph is rounded to the nearest whole percentage point. For joint returns, the applicable dollar amount is $65,000 with a phaseout range of $20,000. For other returns, the applicable dollar amount and phaseout range are 3/4 of the amounts for joint returns. For single taxpayers not filing joint returns or as head of household, the applicable dollar amount and phaseout range are half of those for joint returns. The dollar amount is adjusted for inflation annually. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to make the credit refundable by moving section 25B to subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. Section 25B is inserted after section 36A and redesignated as section 36B. Conforming amendments are made to various sections by removing references to 25B and replacing them with 36B. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by replacing section 25B with section 36B in various sections and tables. Section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows eligible individuals to receive a tax credit for qualified retirement savings contributions that do not exceed the contribution limit. The maximum contributions are determined based on the applicable percentage of the individual's contributions. The contribution limit for eligible individuals under Section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code is $500 ($1,500 for taxable years after 2021). For taxable years between 2011 and 2022, the limit increases annually by $100. Inflation adjustments apply for taxable years after 2021. The contribution limit for eligible individuals under Section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code will be increased annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment determined for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins. The amendments made by this section will apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010."
