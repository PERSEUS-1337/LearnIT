    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas Equal and Fair Opportunity Settlement Act.\" Congressional findings and policy declaration are included in the Act. Congress finds and declares the policy of promoting tribal self-determination, economic self-sufficiency, and resolving historical claims. Sam Houston's efforts in establishing friendly relations with Indian tribes and protecting their rights are recognized. The United States has affirmed the rights of tribes, including the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe, as per Federal law and court decisions. The Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas has rights to free and undisturbed use of their lands, including compensation for violations. Their land in southeastern Texas has been illegally trespassed on, depriving them of economic opportunities. The United States was found to have violated its fiduciary obligations to the Tribe by failing to protect their aboriginal lands. In October 2002, the United States Court of Federal Claims found that the failure to compensate the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe for the loss of 2,850,000 acres of aboriginal lands was eligible to be heard by the Indian Claims Commission. The House of Representatives expressed the view that the Federal Government should provide full monetary compensation to the Tribe for the illegal occupation of their lands by non-Indian settlers after 1845. In October 2002, the United States Court of Federal Claims approved $270,600,000 as economic damages for the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe. The Tribe has decided to waive their aboriginal land claims in exchange for Congress amending the 1987 Restoration Act to improve economic self-sufficiency. Congress aims to empower the Tribe to govern its economic future through this Act. The Act aims to compensate the Tribe for the loss of aboriginal lands by providing economic development opportunities. Without Congressional action, land claims will be pursued through the courts, leading to hostility and uncertainty in Texas. The Act aims to recognize and compensate the Tribe for the loss of aboriginal lands, restore economic development opportunities, resolve claims, and protect the Federal Government and taxpayers from ongoing liability. SEC. 3. RESTORATION ACT AMENDMENT.\n\nRepeals section 207 of Public Law 100-89 to restore economic development opportunities on fair terms.\n\nSEC. 4. DISMISSAL OF LAND CLAIMS.\n\nWithin 180 days of enactment, the United States and the Tribe must file a motion to dismiss any pending claims related to the Tribe's aboriginal lands.\n\nSEC. 5. EXTINGUISHMENT OF CLAIMS. SEC. 5. EXTINGUISHMENT OF CLAIMS.\n\nAny claim by the Tribe or its members against the United States, State of Texas, or landowners regarding land or natural resources is extinguished. Personal claims of individual Indians are not affected, and land held in trust by the United States for the Tribe remains unchanged."
