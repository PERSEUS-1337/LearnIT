    "content": "President William Clinton issued E.O. 12866 in 1993, replacing E.O. 12291 from President Ronald Reagan in 1981. E.O. 12866 requires agencies to conduct CBA and submit rules to OIRA for review, but does not apply to independent regulatory agencies. This exemption provides them with independence from presidential control. The independent regulatory agencies listed in E.O. 12866 have independence from presidential control. These agencies include the Federal Reserve, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Consumer Product Safety Commission, and others. The independent regulatory agencies listed in E.O. 12866, such as the Federal Reserve and Consumer Product Safety Commission, have various elements of independence to insulate them from presidential intrusion. This includes exemptions from presidential review of agency rulemaking, \"for cause\" removal protections for agency heads, structural designs, exemptions from OMB clearance requirements, authority to bypass OMB for budget submissions, and independent litigation authority. The remainder of this report delves into the requirements of E.O. 12866, focusing on agencies assessing costs and benefits for \"significant\" rules. \"Significant\" rules are those with a major impact on the economy or other sectors, as defined in the executive order. When issuing \"economically significant\" rules, agencies must perform a detailed cost-benefit analysis and consider feasible alternatives. E.O. 12866 also requires agencies to design regulations in a cost-effective manner to achieve regulatory objectives. E.O. 12866 requires agencies to design regulations in a cost-effective manner to achieve regulatory objectives, consider incentives for innovation, and assess both costs and benefits of regulations. OMB finalized Circular A-4 on \"Regulatory Analysis\" in September 2003. The OMB finalized Circular A-4 on \"Regulatory Analysis\" to provide guidance to agencies on conducting cost-benefit analyses for regulatory actions. It outlines specific information that agencies should include in their analyses, such as statutory directives, market failures, regulatory alternatives, and cost-effectiveness analysis. Circular A-4 remains the current OMB guidance for agencies preparing CBAs. Barack Obama issued E.O. 13563 to emphasize cost-benefit considerations in the rulemaking process. It encouraged agencies to tailor regulations to minimize societal burdens and maximize net benefits. The executive order also mandated a retrospective review of regulations to identify outdated or burdensome rules. President Obama issued E.O. 13579, urging Independent Regulatory Agencies to comply voluntarily with E.O. 13563 for retrospective reviews of regulations and considerations like economic growth. IRCs are exempt from certain analytical requirements but may need to conduct regulatory analyses under specific statutes. The IRCs may conduct regulatory analyses under specific statutes, such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), even if not required to do so. Nine IRCs are required to analyze the potential effects of their rules, including the SEC, CFTC, CFPB, FDIC, OCC, Federal Reserve, NRC, NLRB, and CPSC. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), and the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) impose analytical requirements on federal agencies, including the IRCs, to assess environmental impacts, regulatory effects on small entities, and minimize paperwork burdens. The Securities and Exchange Commission is granted authority by various statutes to promulgate rules, with provisions requiring consideration of promoting efficiency, competition, and capital formation. The Securities and Exchange Commission must consider the impact on competition when adopting rules or regulations, ensuring that any burden imposed is necessary for the purposes of the chapter. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 mandates the SEC to promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation in its rulemaking decisions. The SEC is engaged in rulemaking and must consider whether actions are necessary in the public interest, consistent with investor protection, and promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. In Business Roundtable v. SEC, the D.C. Circuit vacated an SEC rule on shareholder-nominated candidates disclosure, citing the SEC's obligation to assess economic implications. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, under the Commodity Exchange Act, must consider costs and benefits before issuing regulations. Section 15(a) of the act requires evaluation of costs and benefits in relation to market protection, efficiency, price discovery, risk management, and public interest. The Dodd-Frank Act amended Title IV to address financial market reforms. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Commodity Exchange Act, expanding the CFTC's rulemaking responsibilities. The CFTC created a template for cost-benefit analysis when proposing rules, requiring consideration of costs and benefits without monetization. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created under Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act to enforce federal consumer financial laws. The Dodd-Frank Act established standards for rulemaking by the CFPB and FDIC under Section 209. The CFPB must consider potential costs and benefits before issuing rules, while the FDIC has rulemaking authority with similar considerations. The FDIC is granted rulemaking authority by the Riegle Community Act, which requires consideration of burdens and benefits on depository institutions when issuing new regulations. The FDIC is required to consider administrative burdens and benefits on depository institutions when issuing regulations. The OCC, designated as an IRC under the Dodd-Frank Act, is no longer subject to certain regulatory requirements. The OCC, FDIC, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System are federal banking agencies subject to analytical requirements of the Riegle Community Act. The NRC has rulemaking authority under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The NRC is granted rulemaking authority under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. The NRC can establish standards to govern the use of nuclear material for defense, security, health, and safety purposes. The NRC can adopt regulations that exceed \"adequate\" protection and conduct cost-benefit analysis for those rules. The NRC's internal rulemaking procedures allow for extensive cost-benefit analysis of rules, including those that go beyond \"adequate\" protection. The backfit rule requires detailed analysis of modifications to nuclear facilities for increased public health and safety. The NRC must adopt necessary regulations regardless of cost, but also conducts additional CBA for rules exceeding \"adequate\" protection. The NRC conducts comprehensive regulatory analyses to ensure necessary requirements are imposed on licensees. NLRB rules are promulgated without a cost-benefit analysis requirement. CPSC has rulemaking authority under various statutes. The Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA), Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), Child Safety Protection Act (CSPA), and Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA) have varying requirements for regulatory analyses. For example, CPSA mandates a preliminary regulatory analysis with potential benefits and costs, while PPPA focuses on the \"reasonableness\" of packaging standards for household substances. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is not required to conduct cost benefit analysis when establishing packaging standards for household substances under certain acts. The IRCs may need to conduct some form of CBA or other regulatory analyses under specific statutes, which may be less rigorous than E.O. 12866 and Circular A-4 requirements. They may also conduct CBA as part of their internal rulemaking process, even if not mandated by law. In FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012, selected IRCs conducted cost-benefit analyses for \"major\" rules. Out of 57 rules, 43 included information on costs or benefits, with only 26 having monetized cost estimates. The SEC issued the most \"major\" rules, providing cost and benefit information for all but one rule. In FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012, selected IRCs conducted cost-benefit analyses for \"major\" rules. Out of 57 rules, 43 included information on costs or benefits, with only 26 having monetized cost estimates. The SEC issued the most \"major\" rules, providing cost and benefit information for all but one rule. The CFTC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the NRC, the CFPB, and the NLRB also issued \"major\" rules with varying levels of cost-benefit analysis. The requirements for cost-benefit analysis by IRCs vary in scope and rigor, with some statutes mandating monetized estimates while others require only consideration of costs and benefits. Internal rulemaking practices also differ among IRCs, with some integrating OMB guidance while others do not. Conducting rigorous, quantitative cost-benefit analysis may be challenging due to the nature of rules being promulgated. The IRCs may face challenges in conducting rigorous cost-benefit analysis due to rules that are difficult to quantify or monetize. Agencies are instructed to consider cost-effectiveness analysis when cost-benefit analysis is not feasible. Variations in resources and staff capacity across agencies may impact the ability to perform extensive quantitative analysis, especially for rules subject to specific analytical requirements. The SEC issued the highest number of rules between FY2010 and FY2012, creating the Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation in 2009 to enhance economic analysis in rulemaking. Smaller agencies may lack staff expertise for quantitative cost-benefit analysis, leading to arguments for extending CBA requirements to IRCs to improve rule quality. Extending cost-benefit analysis requirements to independent regulatory commissions (IRCs) may improve rule quality by incentivizing agencies to produce high-quality analyses. Former OIRA administrators advocate for this extension, suggesting that it would lead to higher quality rules and provide incentives for agencies to produce thorough analyses. President Obama's failure to extend these requirements has been met with disappointment. President Obama's failure to extend cost-benefit analysis requirements to independent regulatory commissions (IRCs) has been met with disappointment. Concerns were raised about financial regulations not being constrained by sound principles and procedures outlined by the President, especially those issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the Dodd-Frank Act. Extending E.O. 12866's requirements to IRCs may create duplicative requirements for agencies already fulfilling statutory CBA requirements. The potential effects of extending CBA requirements to IRCs through S. 3468 would vary depending on the agency's current analytical practices, rulemaking responsibilities, number of rules issued annually, and analytical resources. The effects may be minimal for IRCs with procedures similar to E.O. 12866 and Circular A-4. The SEC and OCC follow cost-benefit analysis procedures similar to E.O. 12866 and Circular A-4. The SEC seeks comments on costs and benefits of regulatory alternatives, while the OCC's economic analysis requirements mirror those of E.O. 12866 and OMB Circular A-4. The additional requirements of S. 3468 may already be met by agencies with current analytical practices similar to E.O. 12866 and Circular A-4. Agencies with less rigorous procedures may find the effects of S. 3468 dependent on various factors. Independent agencies issuing fewer \"significant\" rules may find the additional requirements minimally burdensome, while agencies with more rulemaking responsibilities may find them more challenging. The potential effects of S. 3468 may be more burdensome for agencies with greater regulatory responsibilities and limited technical expertise. Some agencies, like IRCs under the Dodd-Frank Act, may consult OIRA for cost-benefit analysis. The CFTC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with OIRA for technical expertise. Some IRCs may be exempt from E.O. 12866 requirements, mitigating the impact of S. 3468. The E.O. 12866 exempts agencies from certain analytical requirements in emergency situations or when under deadlines. The Federal Reserve's OIG report noted these exemptions but did not specify their frequency. There is a debate over the use of cost-benefit analysis in IRCs. Former OIRA Administrator Cass Sunstein has been a strong advocate of cost-benefit analysis (CBA), arguing that it leads to a stronger regulatory system and serves as a check against interest group influence. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is seen as a tool to inform regulatory decisions and protect democratic processes by exposing consequences to public view. While some argue that CBA can improve regulatory decisions through centralized oversight, others believe it may not necessarily enhance agencies' decision-making. The House Judiciary Committee in 2011 discussed the limitations of cost-benefit analysis in regulatory decision-making. While CBA can be useful, it is not foolproof and should not be the sole basis for regulations. Comment periods and alternative regulatory options should also be considered to ensure the public interest is served. The SEC has faced criticism for the slow pace of issuing rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act, partly due to the need for thorough cost-benefit analysis. Concerns include the potential strain on agencies to meet deadlines and the difficulty in estimating costs and benefits for certain rules. The criticism of the slow pace of rule issuance by the SEC under the Dodd-Frank Act includes challenges in estimating costs and benefits, especially for rules involving financial risk and fraud reduction. Critics argue that costs are easier to quantify than benefits, leading to potential overestimation of costs. Additionally, scholars have discussed the \"ossification\" of the rulemaking process, suggesting that agencies face numerous requirements that result in longer rule issuance times and increased resource needs, creating uncertainty for the agencies involved. The ossification of rulemaking can lead agencies to seek alternative ways to implement policy, such as issuing guidance documents instead of going through the rulemaking process. This may be a response to increased requirements for cost-benefit analysis, potentially resulting in less transparent and participatory decision-making. President George W. Bush's OIRA Administrator John Graham testified that agencies continue to issue regulations in a timely manner despite procedural and judicial requirements. Academic studies have questioned the ossification thesis, with one study finding little evidence that additional procedural requirements cause significant delays in rulemaking. E.O. 12866 requires agencies to conduct cost-benefit analyses for \"economically significant\" rules and undergo centralized OIRA review within 90 days. E.O. 12866 mandates OIRA review to ensure regulations align with presidential policy priorities and conduct cost-benefit analyses for significant rules. It replaced E.O. 12291's broader review requirements. Since President Reagan issued E.O. 12291, there has been debate over OIRA's role in the rulemaking process. S. 3468 would extend OIRA review to the IRCs, with many supporting this move for improved rulemaking quality. Centralized review by OIRA is seen as a way to enhance the rulemaking process and regulations. Sally Katzen and others suggest that centralized review of regulations by the White House can improve political accountability and regulatory efficacy. Some organizations support extending OIRA review to the IRCs for better coordination among agencies. ACUS has backed presidential review of IRC rulemaking since 1988. ACUS has supported presidential review of IRC rulemaking since 1988, with the American Bar Association also endorsing extending presidential review to the IRCs. The ABA House of Delegates adopted a recommendation in 1990 endorsing ACUS's guidelines and President Reagan's executive orders on presidential review of agency rulemaking. In 2009, the ABA provided comments to OIRA on presidential supervision of agency rulemaking. The American Bar Association (ABA) has consistently supported extending presidential oversight to independent regulatory commissions (IRCs). In 2011, the ABA expressed strong support for the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2011 (RAA), which aimed to expand OIRA oversight to IRC rulemaking. While some support this extension, others have raised concerns similar to those seen when centralized OIRA review was established in 1981 under President Reagan. Critics initially raised concerns about Reagan's establishment of centralized OIRA review in 1981, fearing a deregulatory agenda and violation of separation of powers. These concerns have largely diminished over time. Recently, similar worries have emerged regarding extending E.O. 12866's requirements to IRCs, which are sometimes seen as quasi-legislative. The extension of presidential review to Independent Regulatory Commissions (IRCs) could compromise their independence and give the President undue influence over rulemaking decisions. Concerns about politicizing the process have led past presidents to defer to Congress on this issue. Sunstein supports presidential review, arguing that it can improve regulatory outcomes. Sunstein and Strauss argue for greater presidential control over the regulatory process, citing the President's ability to centralize, coordinate, and energize regulatory policy. They propose expanding OIRA review to Independent Regulatory Commissions for sound regulatory policy. The authors argue for extending OIRA review to Independent Regulatory Commissions for effective regulatory policy coordination. They believe there is no significant difference between \"independent\" agencies and those under executive orders in terms of regulatory activities. The overlapping work of agencies like the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission in areas like antitrust supports this view. They suggest applying Executive Orders 12291 and 12498 to independent agencies for better coordination. Many scholars suggest extending presidential review to Independent Regulatory Commissions (IRCs) to protect their independence and limit OIRA's ability to stop rule issuance. Differences in structure and relationship to the President indicate that IRCs should not undergo the same review process as Executive Branch agencies. In a 2002 article, two administrative law scholars proposed subjecting IRCs to OIRA review for beneficial regulatory policy coordination. The suggestion is to subject Independent Regulatory Commissions (IRCs) to OIRA review for beneficial regulatory coordination, while maintaining the independence of the agencies. It is proposed that a supervisory rule be implemented, allowing ultimate decision-making by the agencies themselves. Limited OIRA oversight of agency cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) could be established through non-binding feedback to address concerns. The bill S. 3468 proposes allowing OIRA to provide non-binding feedback on IRC rules, without the authority to stop rule issuance. Compliance with CBA requirements would not be subject to judicial review. The bill S. 3468 proposes allowing OIRA to provide non-binding feedback on IRC rules, without the authority to stop rule issuance. OIRA review would not be subject to judicial review. Katzen suggests congressional authorization for OIRA review to address concerns about agency independence. Congressional approval through statutory requirement or authorization would be key. The administrative law scholar testified that Presidents have not fully involved the commissions in their executive orders due to concerns about political costs. Critics worry that subjecting IRCs to OIRA review could compromise agency independence and favor industry interests. Critics also fear that OIRA review may serve as a conduit for private industry's interests. Some studies suggest industry influence on regulations, raising concerns about OIRA's role in IRC rulemaking. Critics fear OIRA lacks technical expertise and resources, as its officials are generalists, not specialists in regulatory fields. The bill S. 3468 would authorize the President to make changes to regulations, with a narrower definition of \"significant\" rules compared to E.O. 12866. The scope of rules covered by an executive order under S. 3468 differs slightly from current regulations. S. 3468 authorizes the President to modify regulations with a narrower definition of \"significant\" rules compared to E.O. 12866. The bill's definition of \"rule\" is broader and may include guidance documents. Compliance with executive orders under the bill cannot be judicially reviewed. The potential consequences of disagreement between an IRC and OIRA on a rule's analysis or substance may not be subject to judicial review."
