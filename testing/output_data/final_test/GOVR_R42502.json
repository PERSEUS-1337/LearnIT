    "content": "Hydraulic fracturing is a controversial technique used to extract oil and gas from underground rock formations by pumping fluids under high pressure. The potential environmental consequences of this method are a subject of concern under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). For environmental review purposes, actions taken by a federal agency fall into three categories: categorical exclusion (CE), environmental assessment (EA), and environmental impact statement (EIS). CE involves low-level review for actions with minimal environmental impact, while EA is more comprehensive to determine if an EIS is needed. An EIS is the most detailed NEPA document, requiring an explanation of environmental effects, adverse impacts, and alternative actions. This report discusses arguments against comprehensive environmental review of hydraulic fracturing under NEPA. Oil and gas companies are interested in drilling in the Monterey Shale in Central California, estimated to contain billions of barrels of oil recoverable through hydraulic fracturing. The Bureau of Land Management sold leases for public land, leading to a lawsuit by environmental groups claiming violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and NEPA. The Bureau of Land Management prepared an Environmental Impact Statement in 2006 for the Southern Mountain Diablo Range and Central Coast of California, estimating limited oil and gas development with no more than 15 wells to be drilled in the next 15-20 years. A 125-page Environmental Assessment was done in June 2011 for a proposed lease sale, but concerns about hydraulic fracturing were not addressed by BLM. The Bureau of Land Management proceeded with an auction after issuing a FONSI, but the district court found that the BLM NEPA review was \"erroneous as a matter of law\" due to concerns about hydraulic fracturing's potential effects on health and the environment, risks of water pollution, and uncertain environmental impacts. The court found that the Bureau of Land Management's environmental analysis was flawed as it underestimated the number of wells to be drilled and lacked a detailed assessment of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling impacts. New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit alleging NEPA violations by federal agencies and the Delaware River Basin Commission. The court requested parties to propose a remedy for the violations. New York challenged the DRBC's refusal to prepare an EIS for natural gas development in the Delaware River Basin, alleging violations of the APA. The DRBC, exempt from APA compliance under the Delaware River Basin Compact, was accused of arbitrary and capricious behavior. The compact establishes the DRBC to manage water resources in the basin, with five voting members representing federal agencies and four states. The federal commissioner of the DRBC is appointed by the President of the United States and serves \"at the pleasure of the President.\" NEPA states that all federal agencies must include an EIS in recommendations or reports for major actions affecting the environment. CEQ regulations define a major Federal action as one with potentially significant effects subject to Federal control. The regulations list categories for federal actions, including approval of specific projects in a defined area. New York claimed DRBC approval required an EIS due to its federal agency status. The complaint argued DRBC rules in CFR and CEQ recognition supported this. The approval of DRBC regulations was considered a federal action requiring an EIS for two reasons: it was a project approved by the DRBC, seen as a federal agency for NEPA purposes, and federal agencies had a significant role in the process. New York claimed NEPA was violated as no EIS was prepared by the five federal agencies and the DRBC. The DRBC stated in 1980 that it would no longer prepare NEPA documents due to lack of funding. In 1997, the agency deleted its NEPA procedures. The federal defendants argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims, citing sovereign immunity, lack of standing, and ripeness. They also contended that NEPA did not apply as the DRBC's regulations were not a \"major federal action\" and the DRBC was not a federal agency. The federal defendants argued that they lacked enough control over the DRBC's regulations to make it a federal action. The court dismissed New York's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, citing lack of standing and ripeness. The court found that New York could not show immediate injury from the proposed regulations, and the case was not fit for judicial review. The court dismissed New York's complaint regarding natural gas development in areas affecting the state, citing lack of standing and ripeness. The proposed regulations did not impact New York's legal rights due to an existing moratorium. The plaintiffs' complaint was dismissed on procedural grounds, allowing them to refile if final regulations are adopted. The USDA Rural Development agency lends money for single-family homes, some located on properties where hydraulic fracturing may occur. The USDA Rural Development agency may use a categorical exclusion to exempt loans for properties with drilling leases from further NEPA review, as outlined in RD Instruction 1940-G. This allows for certain actions to be excluded from detailed environmental assessments. The USDA Rural Development agency may use a categorical exclusion to exempt certain actions from NEPA review, including providing financial assistance for the purchase of single or multi-family dwellings. Extraordinary circumstances may require further NEPA review for actions affecting wetlands, rivers, habitats, endangered species, aquifers, and water quality standards. The USDA Rural Development agency may use a categorical exclusion to exempt certain actions from NEPA review, including providing financial assistance for the purchase of dwellings. Form RD 1940-22 is used to document the use of a CE, with a checklist to determine if extraordinary circumstances exist. The form certifies that the proposal meets the criteria for a categorical exclusion and does not affect important land uses or environmental resources. The USDA Rural Development agency continues to use a categorical exclusion for providing financial assistance for the purchase of single-family dwellings on properties with drilling leases, despite considerations for more detailed NEPA environmental review due to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing. The USDA Rural Development agency allows financial assistance for purchasing single-family dwellings on properties with drilling leases, stating that the presence of gas leases alone does not trigger special circumstances for a more detailed environmental review under NEPA. In March 2013, a federal court ruled that the Bureau of Land Management violated NEPA and APA by not preparing a detailed environmental assessment for a lease sale in the Monterey Shale. New York sued the DRBC and federal agencies for not conducting an EIS before approving natural gas development in the Delaware River Basin. The defendants argued that the approval of regulations in the Delaware River Basin did not require an EIS as the DRBC was not a federal agency. A federal court dismissed a lawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in September 2012. The USDA Rural Development agency will continue to use a CE to exempt home loans from further NEPA review, even for properties leased for drilling. Different viewpoints exist on the legal necessity of NEPA reviews for hydraulic fracturing. The legal necessity of NEPA reviews for hydraulic fracturing is still a topic of debate, and further clarification may come from future court decisions and agency actions."
