    "content": "Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, is the primary provider of intercity passenger rail service in the US. It was created by Congress in 1970 to maintain passenger rail service and relieve private companies from money-losing routes. Despite being structured as a for-profit corporation, Amtrak has never made a profit. Federal assistance to Amtrak totaled around $81 billion from 1971 to 2017. Amtrak employs approximately 20,000 people to operate trains and maintain infrastructure, serving around 31 million passengers. Amtrak operates 44 routes over 21,300 miles of track, with most track owned by freight rail companies. It owns about 625 route miles, including the heavily used Northeast Corridor. The company runs corridor routes under 750 miles and long-distance routes over 750 miles. Corridor routes are financially supported by states, and Amtrak also operates commuter services. Expenses exceed revenues each year, with revenues at $3.2 billion and expenses at $4.3 billion in FY2016. In FY2016, Amtrak reported a net loss of $1.1 billion, covered by federal grants from the DOT. Congress divides the grant into operating and capital categories, with the operating grant covering annual cash losses and the capital grant for asset depreciation and debt repayments. Amtrak's federal funding is primarily within the DOT's appropriation, with separate requests made to Congress each year. Congress changed the structure of federal grants to Amtrak. Starting in FY2017, federal grants to Amtrak were restructured to separate funding for the NEC service, which is operationally self-sufficient but has significant capital needs, from the rest of Amtrak's network, which operates at a deficit. This change aims to increase transparency and eliminate cross-subsidization between the two lines of business. Operating profits from the NEC and state access payments will be reinvested in that corridor, while passenger revenue, state payments, and federal grants will support the National Network. Amtrak's funding, authorized through FY2020, is drawn from the general fund and must compete with other programs for appropriations. Funding from a transportation trust fund could improve the odds of receiving the full authorized amount. Amtrak relies on federal funding to cover a portion of its operating and capital expenses, with a backlog of maintenance projects due to insufficient funding. A transportation trust fund could enhance funding stability and increase the predictability of future funding for Amtrak. Amtrak's federal funding levels are unstable, with one-third of revenue coming from year-to-year appropriations by Congress. The lack of long-term funding has impacted Amtrak's infrastructure maintenance and increased costs. Proposals for a trust fund to provide financial stability have faced opposition from some Members of Congress. Amtrak's funding challenges include identifying revenue sources for a trust fund, potential issues with funding solely from a tax on passengers, and the inadequacy of the existing Highway Trust Fund. Amtrak initially had no infrastructure and operated trains on tracks owned by private railroads before receiving trackage from the Penn Central Railroad. Congress decided to give Amtrak much of the trackage owned by the Penn Central in the 450-mile Northeast Corridor running from Washington, DC, to Boston. The corridor hosts 2,200 daily trains carrying over 800,000 passengers and includes bridges, tunnels, and electric traction systems. Amtrak owns most of the right-of-way and track, with sections owned by state governments and commuter rail agencies. The NEC is Amtrak's flagship corridor, with Acela service reaching speeds of up to 125 miles per hour. The Acela service on the Northeast Corridor reaches speeds of up to 125-150 mph, with an average speed of 70-80 mph. Travel time improvements could result in $500 million in annual benefits, mainly from air passengers shifting to the train. Amtrak's share of the air/rail market in the Northeast has increased since 2008. The market in the Northeast has increased since 2008. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 directed DOT to create a commission for the Northeast Corridor. The commission's purpose is to promote cooperation and planning for rail operations and improvements on the NEC. The commission published a policy in January 2015 to allocate annual operating costs and asset replacement on the NEC, but it does not address the $38 billion capital maintenance backlog. The NEC infrastructure dates back to before the Civil War, making it challenging for Amtrak to improve service due to outdated alignment and speed limitations. Amtrak faces issues with a large backlog of capital projects and limits on the number of trains that can operate on the NEC. The NEC faces challenges with outdated infrastructure, capacity limits, and increasing service demands. Three improvement plans are in place: Amtrak's Gateway Program, NEC Commission's Capital Investment Plan, and FRA's NEC FUTURE plan. Amtrak highlights the need for increased capacity into Manhattan to support intercity service expansion. The Gateway Program aims to enhance reliability and capacity through various projects. The Gateway Program aims to enhance reliability and capacity through various projects, including a new two-track tunnel under the Hudson River. Cost estimates for the program range from $24 billion to $29 billion, with most parts currently in the planning stage. The NEC Commission's five-year investment plan identifies unfunded priority projects and a state-of-good-repair backlog of $38 billion, calling for $29 billion in work over the next 5 years. FRA's NEC FUTURE program is developing a long-range plan for the region. FRA's NEC FUTURE program aims to improve infrastructure and accommodate faster passenger service through 2040. The Selected Alternative includes various improvements to the NEC at an estimated cost of $121-153 billion. Implementation and funding will depend on decisions by Amtrak, commuter railroads, and states. Individual projects will require a Tier 2 Environmental Impact Statement for planning. The next step in the long-range planning process for improving the Northeast Corridor (NEC) involves completing a service development plan. Union Station in Washington, DC, is facing capacity issues and non-compliance with ADA requirements and life safety codes. A redevelopment plan has been proposed by Amtrak and other transportation agencies, envisioning 4 phases of construction over roughly 20 years. Amtrak envisions 4 phases of construction over 20 years, with the first 3 phases focusing on station reconstruction and capacity increase, costing around $7 billion. Amtrak has started a $50 million modernization of its passenger concourse. The average age of Amtrak's passenger car equipment in 2015 was almost 31 years, the highest in its history. Amtrak replaced aging locomotives on the NEC with 70 new electric locomotives from Siemens at a cost of $466 million in 2017. Amtrak purchased 70 new electric locomotives from Siemens for $466 million to increase the reliability of the NEC fleet. The purchase was financed by a $563 million loan from FRA. This loan was paid off with part of a larger loan to Amtrak for the purchase of 28 Acela trainsets. Amtrak's plan to replace equipment on its network was published in 2012, aiming to buy 700 single-level passenger cars between 2016 and 2022 and 500 bi-level cars between 2018 and 2022. However, the funding needed for this fleet replacement plan was not received in the 2018 budget request. Amtrak's fleet replacement plan faces challenges due to high costs and lack of scale economies in equipment purchases. Section 305 of PRIIA aimed to create standardized passenger railcar designs to achieve economies of scale, but there is a risk that equipment delivery schedules may be delayed. Amtrak faces challenges in fleet replacement due to high costs and lack of scale economies in equipment purchases. Standardized passenger railcar designs under Section 305 of PRIIA could hinder innovative car designs and competition among manufacturers. Domestic manufacturing requirements and FRA safety standards contribute to heavier U.S. equipment compared to foreign designs, increasing costs for Amtrak. Equipment lease arrangements with banks claiming tax benefits further complicate equipment acquisition. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with Amtrak and the Secretary of Transportation, restructured Amtrak's capital leases, resulting in savings of $152 million. Additional savings of $426 million are possible if Congress extends the authorization to negotiate early buyout options. It is uncertain if Amtrak's equipment's remaining economic life aligns with lease agreements, potentially affecting fleet replacement plans. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 requires intercity passenger rail stations to be accessible to persons with disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) required intercity passenger rail stations to be accessible by 2010. Amtrak's schedule estimated full compliance by 2015 at a cost of $1.564 billion. A 2011 DOT rule on ADA compliance delayed Amtrak's plans. In 2015, the Department of Justice found Amtrak violated the ADA by not making stations accessible. Amtrak violated the ADA by failing to make stations accessible, incorrectly classifying some as \"flag stop\" to avoid accessibility requirements. As of March 2017, Amtrak had 517 stations, with 512 requiring ADA accessibility. They had sole or shared responsibility for 384 stations, with progress made on tasks like land survey, ADA assessment, design, and construction. The challenge lies in the height difference between boarding platforms and train seating areas. Amtrak faces challenges with ADA accessibility due to varying platform heights and ownership by freight railroads. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandated a PTC system by 2018 for certain railroads. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandated a Positive Train Control (PTC) system by December 31, 2018. PTC features an automatic override system to prevent collisions by slowing or stopping trains if the engineer fails to comply with signals. It relies on radio communications and aims to prevent accidents from excessive speed or conflicting movements. Interoperability is a concern for Amtrak, which operates on various track systems. Amtrak faces challenges with implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) due to operating on tracks owned by multiple railroads. PTC was started on some tracks in 2000 for higher-speed service. A fatal derailment in 2015 highlighted the importance of PTC, although operational issues were noted. Amtrak must also install PTC on tracks in Michigan and ensure compatibility with host railroads' systems. The presence of Amtrak trains on certain lines triggers the PTC requirement. Amtrak faces challenges with implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) due to operating on tracks owned by multiple railroads. The presence of Amtrak trains on certain lines triggers the PTC requirement, but Amtrak has stated it does not have the funds to install PTC on tracks it does not own. Amtrak ridership has grown slowly over the past decade, with corridor/short-distance trains surpassing the flagship NEC service in ridership. The Northeast Corridor still provides the majority of ticket revenue. Amtrak's performance can be assessed by increasing efficiency and demand. Passenger load factor and operating ratio are key measures. Amtrak's load factor has remained stable at 51%, close to its record in FY1988. The operating ratio, covering three-fourths of costs with revenues, has been consistent over the past two decades. Amtrak's operating ratio has been fairly constant over the past two decades, but it is currently at a high level. On-time performance is crucial for Amtrak's profitability as it affects ridership and operating costs. Acela service and shorter routes have a 10-minute on-time standard, while longer routes have a 30-minute allowance. Recent data shows a decline in Amtrak's on-time performance, even on the NEC where Amtrak controls operations. On-time performance has worsened, especially outside the NEC where Amtrak shares tracks with freight railroads. Host freight railroads control train dispatching, leading to delays for Amtrak trains. \"Host railroad delays\" and freight train interference are the main causes of Amtrak delays, followed by \"slow order\" track issues. Signal problems also contribute to delays. \"Amtrak delays are mainly caused by host railroad delays and freight train interference, with signal problems also contributing. Conductors record delay causes, but accuracy is disputed by freight railroads due to potential misinterpretation of root causes. Interference between freight and Amtrak trains is exacerbated by factors like increased oil shipments and construction causing delays.\" The addition of trackage to accommodate increased traffic has led to delays in train movements. Amtrak often uses secondary routes owned by freight railroads, which may not prioritize improving performance. About 70% of Amtrak's operations off the NEC consist of single tracks with sidings, causing significant delays if a train is late. Amtrak's faster trains require more clearance, complicating operations on busy freight corridors. Congress granted Amtrak \"preference\" over freight trains in 1973, but enforcement of this preference is a point of contention between Amtrak and freight railroads. The Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 requires Amtrak to pay host railroads for track usage, but not for overhead costs. Amtrak provides incentive payments for on-time trains, but some freight railroads find them insufficient. Freight railroads prioritize fluidity of routes, sometimes giving priority to freight trains over Amtrak to avoid delays. Railroads find incentive payments insufficient to influence dispatch of Amtrak trains. Amtrak pays $100 million annually for track usage and on-time incentives to freight railroads. Congress directed FRA and Amtrak to develop metrics for measuring performance. STB has power to investigate Amtrak's on-time failures. The STB has the power to investigate Amtrak's failures to meet on-time performance standards. The Supreme Court ruled that Amtrak is a government entity for developing performance standards. The Appeals Court found Section 207 to be an unconstitutional delegation of power and voided associated standards issued by FRA in 2011. The STB developed its own standard for on-time performance through the rule-making process, ruling against a host railroad, which was later overturned. Congress's efforts to address host railroad delays to Amtrak trains have had little impact so far. Tension between freight and passenger use of track is likely to intensify as freight traffic increases and states plan to increase passenger train speeds. Amtrak has served food and beverages since its inception in 1971. Amtrak has provided food and beverage services since its establishment in 1971. Congress has prohibited Amtrak from offering these services at a loss, requiring revenues to cover the costs. Amtrak believes that excluding labor costs shows the service covers its expenses, but including labor costs results in a significant deficit. Amtrak operates its food and beverage service at a significant deficit when labor costs are included. Measures have been taken to reduce costs, including contracting out activities. Congress has mandated a plan to eliminate losses in food and beverage service, with a provision for using ticket revenue allocation to cover the deficits without job losses for Amtrak employees. Amtrak's food and beverage service operates at a deficit, with measures taken to reduce costs. Congress mandated a plan to cover the deficits using ticket revenue allocation without job losses for employees. The Sunset Limited route was extended to Jacksonville, FL in 1993 but service east of New Orleans was suspended in 2005 due to hurricane damage. Despite the restoration of the rail line in 2006, Amtrak did not restore passenger service east of New Orleans, affecting 12 stations. Congress directed Amtrak to develop a plan for restoring passenger rail service between New Orleans and. Amtrak was directed to develop a plan for restoring passenger rail service between New Orleans and Sanford, FL, but no action was taken by Congress despite Amtrak presenting three options requiring capital improvements. In 2015, Amtrak revisited the issue at the request of the Southern Rail Commission, examining different options. Congress later directed DOT to establish a working group to evaluate the restoration of passenger rail service along the Gulf Coast. The DOT established a working group to evaluate restoring passenger rail service along the Gulf Coast. The final report in July 2017 estimated capital expenditures of $10-102 million for service from New Orleans to Orlando via Jacksonville. CSX needs $2.3 billion in upgrades for reliable service. Amtrak is a for-profit company receiving government grants, similar to rail providers in Great Britain. Funding for recommended improvements is still being developed. The British government funds rail companies to operate unprofitable routes, while Amtrak in the US receives direct annual funding from the government. Privatizing intercity passenger rail in the US faces challenges due to the majority of the rail network being owned by private freight companies. This ownership control limits competition and access for private operators. Freight railroads have a statutory obligation to carry Amtrak trains, but they are hesitant to allow other passenger rail providers on their tracks. Indiana tried to replace Amtrak with a private operator in 2015, but the private company ended up losing money and Amtrak resumed operations in 2017. Privatizing intercity passenger rail in the US is challenging due to the majority of the rail network being owned by private freight companies. One obstacle to privatization of passenger rail service in the US is the difficulty for other operators to access freight-owned right-of-way on favorable terms like Amtrak. Amtrak has eminent domain power and can use freight track at incremental cost, giving them a competitive advantage. This may hinder other companies from directly competing with Amtrak or offering passenger service over existing tracks without freight railroads' support. Congress directed the Department of Transportation to establish a pilot program for competitive selection of operators on long-distance routes currently operated by Amtrak. The Department of Transportation is establishing a pilot program for competitive selection of operators on long-distance routes currently operated by Amtrak. The winning bidder would have the right to operate a route for four years, with the possibility of renewal for another four years. Amtrak would be eligible to bid, and the winning bidder could receive an operating subsidy of up to 90% of the previous year's service amount. All Aboard Florida, a subsidiary of Florida East Coast Industries, plans to run high-speed passenger rail services on privately owned lines. All Aboard Florida, a subsidiary of Florida East Coast Industries, plans to run a high-speed passenger service called Brightline between Miami and Orlando, with stops at Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. The company owns most of the right-of-way and is constructing 40 miles of track to reach Orlando Airport. The trains will travel at speeds up to 125 miles per hour on the new track section. The project is estimated to cost $3 billion, with construction starting in 2015. The rail project, estimated to cost $3 billion, began construction in 2015. The sponsor initially applied for an RRIF loan but later sought state approval to sell $600 million in tax-free private activity bonds. The project, facing opposition from communities, aims to connect Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston with a high-speed line operated by the Central Japan Railway Company. Trains on the 240-mile route would run at speeds up to 200 miles per hour, offering a 90-minute ride. The high-speed rail project connecting Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston has faced cost overruns and delays, with the initial estimate of $8 billion now at $12 billion and the completion date pushed back to 2023. Texas Central Partners has secured contracts for 30% of the needed land parcels, but some landowners oppose the project. The Texas State Legislature passed a bill to ensure the state won't be responsible for any costs. XpressWest has proposed a separate high-speed rail line from Victorville. XpressWest, also known as DesertXpress, plans to build a high-speed rail line from Victorville, CA to Las Vegas, NV, covering 185 miles. The project aims to run nonstop trains at 150 mph, transporting tourists between the two cities. Private funding commitments of $1.5 billion have been secured, with a $5.5 billion loan application. However, the loan review was halted in 2013 due to non-compliance with Buy America requirements. In 2015, XpressWest partnered with China Railway International for financing. In 2016, XpressWest ended its partnership with China Railway International for financing. The company is currently in discussions with potential partners and investors. The High Desert Corridor Joint Powers Authority estimated that a high-speed rail line connecting Las Vegas with points near Los Angeles could carry 6.5 million passengers by 2024 with an average round-trip fare of $100. The California High-Speed Rail Authority plans to build a dedicated rail line between Sacramento. The California High-Speed Rail Authority plans to build a dedicated rail line between Sacramento and San Diego, with trains reaching speeds of up to 220 mph. The first phase will connect San Francisco and Los Angeles, with a possible extension to Merced. Service is expected to begin in 2025, with completion by 2029. An operating company will be selected to run the trains."
