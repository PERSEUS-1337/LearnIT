The \"Truth in Accounting Act of 2007\" mandates the inclusion of net present value calculations for the United States Government's fiscal exposures in financial statements. This calculation covers outstanding public debt and the net present value of commitments and receipts of the OASI Trust Fund. The \"Truth in Accounting Act of 2007\" requires the inclusion of net present value calculations for various federal trust funds and programs, such as the DI Trust Fund, HI Trust Fund, SMI Trust Fund, Railroad Retirement, and Black Lung programs. The \"Truth in Accounting Act of 2007\" mandates net present value calculations for federal retirement and health insurance systems, civil and military, over 75-year and indefinite time horizons. Calculations involve projecting expenditures minus revenues annually, dividing by the discount factor, and summing 75 annual discounted flows to determine the program's net present value imbalance. The discount and growth rates used in calculations must align with those used by the Department of Treasury and other Government agencies for long-term financial calculations. Revenues for the calculations include payroll taxes, participant premiums, State transfer income, general revenue receipts from taxation of benefits, and funding for Federal retirement and health insurance systems. The financial statement includes calculations for health insurance systems, both civil and military, based on extended projections for a number of years beyond 75 years. The calculations must align with rates used by the Department of Treasury and other Government agencies. The financial statement includes a calculation of the net present value of benefits and projected benefits for current participants of various programs, taking into account contributions, taxes, and trust fund balances. The financial statement presents the net present value of benefits and projected benefits for current and future participants of certain programs, factoring in contributions, taxes, and trust fund balances. It also includes the total public debt and fiscal imbalance calculations. The financial statement includes detailed calculations of debt per person, full-time worker, and household, along with the methods and assumptions used in making projections of tax revenues, premiums, benefit outlays, and administrative expenses. The financial statement provides details on demographic and economic assumptions, including fertility rates, trust fund interest rates, and inflation rates. The President is required to use this statement when preparing the budget for the United States Government. The President must consider the financial statement prepared by the Secretary of the Treasury, including its impact on budget calculations and fiscal exposures, when submitting the budget to the United States Government. The Secretary of the Treasury must testify annually before Congress on the financial statement for the previous fiscal year, as required by section 331(e) of title 31, United States Code. This includes addressing the generational imbalance and fiscal exposure calculations. The Comptroller General is required to submit an annual report to Congress on the financial condition of the US Government, including assessments of generational and fiscal imbalances. The report must also evaluate whether the President complied with the Truth in Accounting Act. The Comptroller General must provide an annual report to Congress on the financial status of the US Government, assessing generational and fiscal imbalances, and evaluating the President's compliance with the Truth in Accounting Act. The report should include information on the requirements of the Truth in Accounting Act, the results of the Government Accountability Office's fiscal model simulation, and other significant fiscal matters determined by the Comptroller General. The effective date for this information to be included in the financial statement is after the enactment of the Act."
