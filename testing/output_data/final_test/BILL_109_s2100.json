The Tax Depreciation, Modernization, and Simplification Act of 2005 allows for the adjustment of class lives under section 168(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The term 'class life' refers to the applicable class life of property as of January 1, 1986, determined under subsection (m) of section 167. The Secretary has the authority to make modifications after consultation. The Secretary, in consultation with Congress, may establish new class lives for properties or assign class lives to properties without them. Exceptions include residential rental property, nonresidential real property, and properties already classified under subsection. The Secretary, in consultation with Congress, may establish new class lives for properties or assign class lives to properties without them. Any class life prescribed or modified shall reflect the anticipated useful life and decline in value over time, considering technological or functional obsolescence. Consultation is required within 60 days. The Secretary must consult with Congress before publishing proposed regulations for new class lives or modifications. A monitoring office will analyze the actual experience with depreciable assets. The amendment under section 168 modifies class life for property classification and application. Each class life is treated as a separate rule for regulatory review. Effective upon enactment of the Act. Elimination of mid-quarter convention in section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Effective for property placed in service after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, mass asset accounting is introduced. The new subsection (l) of Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces Mass Asset Accounting, allowing taxpayers to elect to add the adjusted basis of qualified property to a mass asset account and determine deductions using the applicable depreciation method for that account. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for making elections under subparagraph (A) for all qualified property with the same recovery period. Any election made is irrevocable without Secretary's consent, with rules for asset accounting in case of revocation. Special rules apply for modifying depreciation method in mass asset accounts. In applying the deduction allowable under subsection (a) to any mass asset account, the amount of the deduction shall be adjusted to reflect a half-year convention. The deduction is 100 percent for qualified property placed in service before the taxable year and 50 percent for qualified property placed in service during the taxable year. Special rules apply for the sale of qualified property. Sale of qualified property results in reduction of mass asset account balance by sale proceeds. Excess proceeds over account balance are treated as ordinary income. Qualified property rules apply. For tax purposes, qualified property refers to tangible property subject to specific depreciation methods with a cost not exceeding $10,000. This amount is adjusted for inflation annually. The term 'mass asset account' refers to a taxpayer's account reflecting the adjusted basis of all qualified property. Adjustments are made annually for inflation. The amendments made by this section apply to property placed in service after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5 of the Act permanently extends expensing for small businesses by increasing the dollar limitation to $100,000 and the reduction in limitation to $400,000. Inflation adjustments are made, and the amendments apply to property placed in service after the enactment of the Act."
