The Secretary will distribute additional residency positions accordingly. The Act redistributes residency positions to establish new medical specialties, with limits reduced based on unused positions. Hospitals can increase resident limits by applying to the Secretary.

If a hospital no longer meets certain criteria, positions may be redistributed. If a hospital no longer meets requirements, the Secretary will reduce the resident limit and redistribute positions accordingly. The Secretary will consider hospital capacity and likelihood of filling positions when increasing resident limits.
