    "content": "Pointwise localization offers more precise and interpretable object localization compared to bounding box methods, especially in unstructured domains like medicine. This study focuses on weakly supervised localization (WSL), training a model to classify images and localize regions of interest at the pixel level using global annotations. A new deep learning method is proposed, consisting of a localizer and a classifier, where the localizer uses conditional entropy (CE) to distinguish relevant from irrelevant regions and reduce false positives. Experimental results on medical and natural datasets show significant improvements in image-level classification and pixel-level accuracy compared to existing WSL methods. The curr_chunk discusses the benefits of weakly supervised learning (WSL) in image understanding tasks, particularly in pointwise localization. It highlights the use of deep learning methods like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve image classification and pixel-level localization with robustness to overfitting. The implementation in PyTorch is mentioned, emphasizing the importance of WSL in reducing the need for extensive annotations in training data. Weakly supervised learning (WSL) involves training with uncertain supervision, often using image level tags, scribbles, or bounding boxes. State-of-the-art WSL methods rely on CNN-generated activation maps for localization and model interpretation. Recent literature shows a shift away from dense pixel-level annotations towards more efficient methods. Recent methods for weakly supervised object detection include spatial pooling techniques, multi-instance learning, and attend-and-erase based methods. Some models predict bounding boxes instead of pointwise localization. Top-down methods inspired by human visual attention use feedback layers, backpropagation error, and Grad-CAM for determining regions of interest. These approaches are particularly useful in applications like medical imaging. In medical imaging, precise region localization is crucial for cells, boundaries, and organs. Pointwise localization is more suitable for regions with unstructured shapes and varying scales. Predicting a mask instead of a bounding box can address localization challenges, especially when there is one object of interest in the image. The evaluation datasets require global image annotation for training and pixel-level annotation for evaluation. In medical imaging, precise region localization is crucial for cells, boundaries, and organs. False positive localization can occur when a class appears in different shapes or textures similar to irrelevant parts in the image, leading to confusion in the model. This issue is critical in medical applications where interpretability is key. To address this, prior knowledge should be used in learning to alleviate false positives. In medical imaging, precise region localization is crucial to avoid false positive localization. To address this issue, prior knowledge is used to favor models with low false positive localization. The model is designed to simultaneously localize relevant and irrelevant regions in an end-to-end manner within a weakly supervised learning scenario. The model consists of a localizer to predict a latent mask for both types of regions and a classifier to classify the visible content of the input image using the latent mask. The localizer, driven through CE, identifies relevant and irrelevant regions for more reliable predictions. A recursive erasing algorithm is used to train the localizer to remove discriminative parts during training, leading to precise region localization. The model in this paper utilizes a deep learning framework for Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) at the pixel level. It consists of two sub-networks - one for localizing regions of interest and the other for classifying them. Through Cross-Entropy (CE) training, the model is guided to identify relevant and irrelevant regions, leading to more accurate region localization. The framework allows for the extension of discriminative parts over different instances, inherently handling multi-instances. The paper introduces a localizer that aims to identify relevant and irrelevant regions for more interpretable and reliable regions of interest. It includes a recursive erasing algorithm for complete discriminative region extraction and conducts experiments on various image datasets to show effectiveness in pointwise localization while maintaining competitive accuracy. The paper also reviews state-of-the-art Weakly Supervised Learning methods for region localization using only image-level labels. Fully convolutional networks with spatial pooling and multi-instance learning methods have been effective in localizing discriminative regions. Some approaches involve hiding patches in training images to force the network to seek other discriminative regions. Attention maps are used to erase the most discriminative parts of images, and a two-phase learning stage is utilized for attention maps. In two-phase learning, attention maps from two networks are combined to identify object regions. Another approach involves erasing discriminative parts of an image before passing it to a second network. Top-down methods use backpropagation error to visualize saliency maps, while Excitation backprop allows top-down signals to pass through the network. Excitation backprop proposes passing top-down signals through a probabilistic framework. Grad-CAM and its generalizations have shown success with natural images but lack a mechanism for distinguishing relevant and irrelevant information within an image. Erase-based methods follow a concept of erasing discriminative parts of an image to improve localization accuracy. The proposal involves using entropy-measure to explore the input image, focusing on minimizing variance over discriminative regions while maximizing it over non-discriminative ones. The recursive erasing algorithm emphasizes mining consistent regions on the fly, inspired by erasing and mining techniques in previous studies. Our algorithm focuses on mining consistent regions during backpropagation, expanding regions of interest, and erasing irrelevant pixels. It acts as a guided dropout, inhibiting noisy regions and keeping only discriminative ones to support the image label. Mimicking a discriminative gate, it allows only informative regions to pass through.

It acts as a guided dropout, inhibiting noisy regions and keeping only discriminative ones to support the image label while allowing only informative and discriminative regions to pass through the gate. The input image X can be decomposed into two images X = X M + + X M \u2212, where X + inherits the image-level label of X. Predicting the image label depends only on the decidable region X +, as X \u2212 does not contain any information about the image label. The algorithm focuses on mining consistent regions during backpropagation, expanding regions of interest, and erasing irrelevant pixels. It acts as a guided dropout, inhibiting noisy regions and keeping only discriminative ones to support the image label. The image label is conditionally independent of X + and X \u2212, which model the decidable and undecidable regions. The uncertainty of the model prediction over these regions is modeled using conditional entropy. The model is constrained to have low entropy over X + to ensure correct predictions. The algorithm focuses on mining consistent regions during backpropagation, expanding regions of interest, and erasing irrelevant pixels. It acts as a guided dropout, inhibiting noisy regions and keeping only discriminative ones to support the image label. The model is constrained to have low entropy over X + to ensure correct predictions. In order to ensure the model predicts the correct image label, a supervised learning problem is cast using cross-entropy between p and p using the image-level label of X as supervision. The model is required to be unable to decide over irrelevant regions, leading to high uncertainty in the model decision. An alternative approach to maximizing Eq.4 involves using a supervised target distribution, such as a uniform distribution. By setting q as a uniform distribution and minimizing the cross-entropy between q and p, the posterior probability p can be modeled using a neural network. The network localizes regions of interest and classifies their content, ultimately minimizing the total training loss. The binary mask classifies content based on error made by C. A secondary classification task at the output of M helps select discriminative regions. M computes posterior probability p s (Y |X) to minimize cross-entropy. The mask R + is computed using feature maps of M with high abstract activations. The proposed approach involves downsampled feature maps of classes, pushing posterior probabilities towards 1 for the winning class. The winning class feature map is then upscaled and pseudo-thresholded. To address discriminative regions, a learning incremental and recursive erasing method is suggested to mine complete discriminative regions. The experiments focus on classification and pointwise localization tasks using datasets like GlaS in the medical domain, CUB-200-2011, and Oxford flower 102 for natural scene images. The GlaS dataset, from the Gland Segmentation in Colon Histology Images Challenge Contest 2, consists of 165 images for gland segmentation. The dataset includes 165 images from 16 H&E histology sections, divided into benign and malignant classes. Images show variation in gland shape/size and stain. Glandes are regions of interest for image grading. Another dataset is CUB-200-2011 for bird species with 11,788 samples. Oxford flower 102 dataset is also mentioned. The Oxford flower 102 dataset consists of 102 species of flowers in the UK, with 8,189 samples. Training, validation, and test sets are split accordingly. Training is done on 80% of samples, with 20% for validation. Image-level labels are used for training, while pixel-level labels are used for evaluation. Evaluation is done at both image and pixel levels. The study compares their method to various weakly supervised learning (WSL) methods using pre-trained backbones like ResNet18 for feature extraction. Different pooling layers such as CAM-Avg, CAM-Max, CAM-LSE, Wildcat, Grad-CAM, and Deep MIL are compared. The evaluation includes F1 score over foreground (F1 +) and background (F1 -) to measure model performance. Supervised segmentation using U-Net is utilized. In the study, the method is compared to weakly supervised learning methods using pre-trained backbones like ResNet18 for feature extraction. Different pooling layers are evaluated, and F1 score is used to measure model performance. The method utilizes supervised segmentation with U-Net and shares a pre-trained backbone with M and C to avoid overfitting. The approach uses the same hyper-parameters across all datasets and provides datasets splits, experimental details, and visual results in the supplementary material. The study compares the method to weakly supervised learning methods using pre-trained backbones like ResNet18 for feature extraction. Results are presented in Tab.1 and Tab.2, with visual results in Fig.3. The method outperforms all WSL methods in both F1 + and F1 - scores, particularly excelling at localizing tissues in challenging datasets like Cub5. Our model shows improvements in pointwise localization, but still lags behind full supervision. Similar enhancements are seen on CUB data. On the OxF dataset, our approach has lower F1 + values compared to other WSL methods, but outperforms them in terms of F1 -. All methods achieve low classification error on GlaS, indicating an easy classification problem. Our model demonstrates robustness in pointwise localization on CUB5, outperforming other methods. It also shows effectiveness in image classification and localization reliability compared to WSL methods. The visual quality of our approach aligns with colon cancer diagnostics using glands as a diagnostic tool. Additionally, our model successfully locates birds on CUB5/CUB datasets by focusing on specific body parts for species prediction. Our approach for weakly supervised learning (WSL) focuses on learning relevant and irrelevant regions within the model to reduce false positive localization. It accurately locates regions of interest with low false positives while maintaining effectiveness in pixel-level WSL. The model mainly locates the central part of pistil on the OxF dataset, relying on petals or unique discriminative parts of the flower when needed. The inference time is the same as a standard fully convolutional network, with a moderate increase in training time depending on the depth of recursion. Our approach for weakly supervised learning focuses on accurately localizing regions of interest with low false positives while maintaining interpretability. Future work includes extending the approach to handle multiple classes within the image and applying different constraints on the predicted mask. Predicting bounding boxes instead of heat maps is also considered for applications where pixel-level accuracy is not required. The recursive erasing algorithm can be improved by using a memory-like mechanism to prevent forgetting previously spotted regions and promote localizing the entire region. Our proposal aims to improve weakly supervised learning by using a recursive erasing approach to identify discriminative regions in images. Unlike previous methods, we incorporate erasing within backpropagation for efficient learning without the need for erasing during inference. The recursive process mines more discriminative parts within non-discriminative regions, accumulating them in a temporal mask for better localization. Our proposal improves weakly supervised learning by using a recursive erasing approach to identify discriminative regions in images. Trust coefficients control how much we trust mined discriminative regions at each recursion step, decreasing with depth. This approach accumulates discriminative parts in a temporal mask for better localization. The proposed approach improves weakly supervised learning by recursively erasing to identify discriminative regions in images. Trust coefficients determine the trust in the estimated mask for each sample, ensuring consistency in class predictions and confidence levels across steps. The proposed recursive erasing algorithm initializes R to zero at t = 0 and restarts M for each sample to prevent incorrect region accumulation. Erasing continues until reaching a maximum depth of recursion u, maintaining a non-zero trust coefficient for samples. A practical implementation using gradient accumulation at M is suggested to avoid memory issues.

Erasing continues until reaching a maximum depth of recursion u, maintaining a non-zero trust coefficient for samples. A practical implementation using gradient accumulation at M is suggested to avoid memory issues. The recursive erasing algorithm is performed only during training, utilizing accumulated gradient through backpropagation within the localizer M. This approach involves incremental mining of discriminative parts and is implemented using Algorithm 1 for one epoch (or one mini-batch) with gradient accumulation and masks. The text discusses the process of accumulating gradients and masks during recursion, addressing issues with non-deterministic gradients and reproducibility. The approach involves detaching the upscaling operation from the training graph. Experiments were conducted with a focus on reproducibility, using specific precautions and a seed value of 0. The experiments were run on a GPU with 12GB and an environment with 10 to 64 GB of RAM. The experiments were conducted on a GPU with 12GB of RAM and an environment with 10 to 64 GB of RAM. Visual results, analysis, training time, and drawbacks were shown, along with samples from each dataset's test set. A subset called CUB5 was created by randomly selecting 5 classes from the original CUB-200-2011 dataset. The train and test sets for CUB5 were built using all corresponding samples of each class. The effective train set and validation set were created by randomly selecting 80% and 20% from the train set of CUB5, respectively. The configuration used for the model over all datasets included a patch size of 480x480 for training samples. The model used for all datasets includes a patch size of 480x480, data augmentation with random rotation and flipping, channel normalization, and jittering for GlaS patches. It utilizes a pretrained resnet101 backbone with a pooling score adaptation, dropout with varying values, and high dropout rates to focus on abstract features. The model used for all datasets includes a patch size of 480x480, data augmentation, channel normalization, and a pretrained resnet101 backbone with pooling score adaptation. Dropout is applied to internal mask of pooling function, with parameters set to \u03b1 = 0, kmax = kmin = 0.09, u = 0, u = 4, \u03c3 = 10, \u03c3 = 0.5, \u03c9 = 8. Predicted masks are binarized using a 0.5 threshold for evaluation. Visual results show model's ability to handle multi-instance on GlaS dataset, with erasing feature recovering discriminative regions. Results on CUB5 dataset reveal limitations of erasing concept. The erasing concept in the case of one instance shows limitations as the model may struggle to find other discriminative parts once one is hidden. This issue is illustrated in CUB5 dataset where the model correctly spots the head but fails to locate other discriminative parts like the body, which has a similar texture and is located nearby. This is attributed to the erasing concept forgetting the location of discriminative parts. The erasing concept in algorithms may forget the location of discriminative parts, hindering the ability to localize the entire region of interest. Erasing the most discriminative regions can make it difficult to discriminate using the remaining regions. Soft-erasing techniques, like blurring pixels, could be more effective than hard-erasing. The model uses soft-erasing techniques for localization, relying on texture and specific features of birds. It shows robustness to small/occluded regions and improves classification and localization performance. Visual results are presented in figures, demonstrating the effectiveness of the recursive algorithm. The recursive algorithm improves localization in the model, leading to better classification error. The extra computation time is mainly due to gradient accumulation during backpropagation. The size of samples impacts training time over the validation set. Comparison of training time over GlaS and CUB5 datasets using erasing algorithm. Post-processing with CRF for better mask alignment. Post-processing with CRF improves mask alignment by spreading the mask over the region of interest, but may increase false positives if the mask misses the region. Using CRF helps in improving F1 + and F1 - when the produced mask covers mostly the region of interest. The methods CAM-Avg, CAM-Max, CAM-LSE, Grad-CAM are renamed to Avg, Max, LSE, G-C. Average precision-recall curves of the model over different test sets are shown. The precision axis is interpolated with respect to the recall axis to compute an average curve."
