    "content": "The fluoridation of drinking water is recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to prevent tooth decay. The decision to fluoridate a public water supply is made by the state or local municipality and is not mandated by any federal agency. Opponents express concerns about potential health effects and view it as an infringement on individual freedom. The medical and public health communities generally support water fluoridation as a safe and effective way to protect dental health community-wide. The Environmental Protection Agency regulates the amount of fluoride in public drinking water to prevent adverse health effects. Some communities add fluoride to strengthen teeth, while others must remove excess fluoride naturally present in water. Research gaps exist on the health effects of fluoride exposure, adding controversy to water fluoridation decisions. EPA issued a regulation in 1986 with a maximum contaminant level for fluoride in drinking water. The EPA regulates fluoride levels in drinking water to prevent health effects. A secondary standard of 2 mg/L protects children from dental fluorosis. The National Research Council recommended lowering the EPA's 4 mg/L standard. The report discusses benefits and adverse effects of water fluoridation. The review discusses the regulation of fluoride in drinking water to protect against adverse health effects and federal efforts to update health risk assessments and standards. It presents information from various sources on fluoride being a naturally occurring substance in water at low levels. Community water fluoridation began in 1945 to reduce dental caries. In 2010, CDC reported that 73.9% of people in the US received fluoridated water. Many health organizations support adding fluoride to water to strengthen teeth and prevent cavities. The CDC, American Medical Association, ADA, and other health organizations recommend fluoridation of public water supplies to prevent dental caries, especially in underserved communities. Fluoridation is considered a top public health achievement of the 20th Century for its effectiveness in reducing tooth decay. Fluoridation of public water is recommended by health organizations to prevent dental caries. The optimal fluoride level for decay prevention is 0.7 to 1.2 mg/L. The World Health Organization identifies dental caries as a global issue and recommends adding fluoride to water where levels are low. The goal is to maintain a constant low level of fluoride in as many mouths as possible through community-based programs. According to the WHO, water fluoridation in low fluoride-containing water supplies helps maintain dental health throughout life. Fluoride levels in water are inversely related to dental decay, especially in the elderly. The recommended fluoride amount can also be obtained from other sources like toothpaste and supplements. The WHO recommends water fluoridation as a crucial intervention to reduce dental caries, especially in deprived areas, despite not being universally practiced. About 370 million people worldwide receive artificially fluoridated water. Approximately 370 million people globally receive artificially fluoridated water, with an additional 50 million consuming naturally fluoridated water at optimal levels. Water fluoridation is practiced in around 30 countries, with varying percentages of the population receiving fluoridated water. Countries such as Argentina (21%), Australia (61%), Brazil (41%), Canada (43%), Chile (40%), Colombia (80%), Israel (75%), Malaysia (70%), New Zealand (61%), and Singapore (100%) practice water fluoridation. In Western Europe, the Republic of Ireland (73%), Spain (10%), and the United Kingdom (10%) fluoridate drinking water, while most other Western European countries have stopped or never implemented water fluoridation due to alternative fluoride sources and dental care programs. In some countries, fluoridated salt is used instead of water fluoridation for dental protection. Fluoridated salt is available in Latin American and European countries like Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, and Switzerland. Water fluoridation faces less opposition in the United States but still generates controversy in some communities due to concerns about long-term fluoride exposure. The safety and efficacy of water fluoridation continue to be debated despite recommendations from health organizations. The safety and efficacy of water fluoridation are still debated, with concerns about dental fluorosis in children. Dental fluorosis is caused by excessive fluoride intake during tooth development, leading to white patches or pitting in the enamel. Recommended fluoride levels aim to limit fluorosis to about 10% of the population. Concerns have increased over dental fluorosis and potential effects of fluoride ingestion due to the use of fluoridated dental products. Questions have been raised about current fluoridation practices and levels to balance beneficial effects with avoiding adverse effects from ingesting too much fluoride. Americans may ingest more fluoride than anticipated through various sources like toothpaste, mouth rinse, and fluoridated water in beverages and foods. The prevalence of fluorosis among schoolchildren in the 1980s ranged from 18% to 26%, with concerns raised about potential esthetic issues due to fluoride exposure from water and toothpaste. Data on other sources of fluoride intake like fluoridated toothpaste and infant formula were lacking, leading to a possible overestimation of fluorosis risk from public water fluoridation. Researchers emphasized the need to balance fluorosis prevalence with the lifetime benefits of fluoridation and the costs of alternative solutions. The feasibility and costs of alternative solutions for fluorosis prevention, such as educating parents on toothpaste use and reducing fluoride content in children's toothpaste, were discussed. The NRC suggested controlling fluoride in foods and beverages as a more effective approach than altering current fluoridation policies. The CDC issued new recommendations in 2001 for fluoride use, focusing on controlling fluoride in foods and beverages. The debate on fluoridation includes concerns about dental fluorosis and the impact on tooth health. Reducing fluoride concentrations in drinking water is seen as a more manageable solution compared to adjusting recommended levels. The CDC issued new recommendations in 2001 for fluoride use, focusing on controlling fluoride in foods and beverages to decrease the risk of enamel fluorosis in children under six years old. The American Dental Association recommended mixing infant formulas with fluoride-free or low fluoride water to prevent dental fluorosis. In 2011, HHS proposed a lower recommended level of 0.7 milligrams per liter for community water fluoridation. Researchers are studying the health effects of fluoride in drinking water, focusing on naturally occurring levels rather than artificial fluoridation levels. Elevated fluoride ingestion can lead to skeletal fluorosis, with symptoms ranging from slight bone mass increases to crippling deformities and immobility. Few cases of crippling skeletal fluorosis have been reported in the US, and it is not considered a public health concern. Studies have looked at the impact of artificial water fluoridation on bone fracture risk in older women. Community-level studies in the 1980s and 1990s showed mixed results, with some indicating increased risk, some reduced risk, and others finding no effect. However, these studies lacked individual data. A 2000 study found that fluoridated water consumption may reduce the risk of hip and vertebrae fractures in older white women. Water fluoridation may reduce the risk of fractures in older white women. Controversy arose in the 1970s regarding a possible link between fluoridation and cancer mortality, but subsequent research refuted these claims. Independent panels in 1982 and 1985 found no credible evidence of an association between fluoride in drinking water and cancer risk. Researchers continue to investigate this topic. The 1993 NRC fluoride review found no credible evidence linking fluoride in drinking water to cancer risk. Studies were limited by their focus on community-level exposures rather than individual exposures, hindering the ability to measure long-term effects. The National Cancer Institute also found no increased cancer risk associated with fluoridated water after analyzing over 2.2 million cancer death records. The NRC concluded in 1993 that there is no increased cancer risk associated with fluoridated drinking water. The National Toxicology Program found no evidence of carcinogenic activity in female rats or mice at high fluoride concentrations, but observed some bone cancers in male rats at even higher levels. In 1992, a study on rats using higher fluoride doses found rare nonmalignant tumors. Both the NTP and 1992 studies had limitations in determining if fluoride causes cancer in humans. EPA requested NRC to review fluoride data in 1993, which concluded no association between fluoridated water and cancer but suggested more research. While a 1995 case-control analysis in Wisconsin found no association between fluoridated water and bone cancer, it did not consider individual exposure histories. EPA requested further studies on fluoride's effects on bone in 2002. In 2006, the EPA requested the NRC to review fluoride data and update risk assessment. The NRC found evidence on fluoride's potential to cause cancer inconclusive. The NRC review found inconclusive evidence on fluoride's potential to cause cancer. The effectiveness of water fluoridation in preventing caries has been debated, with some studies suggesting it may be less important due to fluoride toothpaste and better nutrition. The benefits of water fluoridation may be underestimated. A 2001 study found that the reduction in caries from fluoridation extends to nonfluoridated communities through bottled beverages and processed foods. Earlier studies showed a significant difference in caries prevalence between fluoridated and nonfluoridated areas, with the difference increasing when controlling for topical fluoride. In 2000, British researchers conducted a systematic review of 214 studies on water fluoridation. They found that fluoridation was linked to fewer children with caries and a decrease in caries-affected teeth. However, the reductions were smaller than previously reported. At a fluoride level of 1 mg/L, an estimated 12.5% of individuals may experience aesthetically concerning fluorosis. No other adverse effects were found, but the studies were of low to moderate quality, prompting a call for better research. Overall, studies on water fluoridation were of low to moderate quality, prompting a call for better research. Social and political concerns, such as lack of choice for consumers who prefer non-fluoridated water, also play a role in decisions about water fluoridation. Some view fluoridation requirements as intrusive and believe that decisions regarding dental health should be made by individuals and families, not imposed by the government. The conflict between individual choice and public policy regarding fluoride regulation persists due to research gaps on potential adverse effects. Regulators face challenges as communities add fluoride to water for benefits at low levels, but it can be toxic at higher concentrations. The federal regulation aims to protect against health risks from higher fluoride exposure levels. The federal regulation aims to protect against health risks from higher fluoride exposure levels, with EPA reviewing and potentially revising standards based on NRC's updated assessment. EPA sets a non-enforceable maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) for contaminants in public water supplies. Amendments in 1996 added regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The EPA sets a non-enforceable maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) for contaminants in public water supplies, considering exposure risks to sensitive subpopulations. The MCLG is based on health effects and not on monitoring or treatment costs, often set at zero for carcinogens. EPA also considers other sources of exposure and sets an enforceable standard, the maximum contaminant level (MCL), as close to the MCLG as feasible using the best available technology. The EPA sets a non-enforceable maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) for contaminants in public water supplies, considering health effects and not costs. The MCL is the legal limit of a substance in water, with secondary MCLs for aesthetic and cosmetic effects. The current national primary drinking water regulation for fluoride includes an MCL of 4 mg/L to protect against skeletal fluorosis. The EPA established a controversial new standard for fluoride in drinking water at 4 mg/L, replacing the previous 1.4 to 2.4 mg/L standard. This new regulation does not protect infants and young children against moderate dental fluorosis, which is considered a cosmetic effect. Additionally, a secondary standard of 2 mg/L was set to protect children. EPA estimated that 220,000 people receive water from public systems with fluoride levels equal to or exceeding 4 mg/L. The EPA established a secondary standard for fluoride at 2 mg/L to protect children from dental fluorosis and adverse health effects. CDC estimated 850,000 people are served by water systems with more than 2 mg/L fluoride. EPA does not recommend infants consume water with 4 mg/L fluoride due to dental fluorosis concerns. Water systems exceeding 2 mg/L fluoride must notify customers to use alternate water sources for infants and children within one year. This notification lag has been criticized for exposing infants and children to elevated fluoride levels during critical tooth development. The EPA is reviewing fluoride regulations to ensure protection of public health, prompted by concerns over potential carcinogenicity. NRC previously deemed the current standard of 4 mg/L as interim but noted the need for further assessment. The NRC recommended further research on fluoride intake, dental fluorosis, bone strength, and carcinogenicity due to increased fluoride use in dental products. EPA commissioned an evaluation of fluoride exposure data in 1998 and published results in 2002, suggesting a review and potential revision of the fluoride standard when new research findings emerge. The EPA requested the National Research Council to review new studies on fluoride's effects on bone and update the fluoride health risk assessment. NRC agreed to evaluate the scientific basis for EPA's MCLG and secondary fluoride standard to protect children and others from adverse effects. The National Research Council evaluated toxicologic, epidemiologic, and clinical data on fluoride in response to EPA's request for a new data review. The committee concluded that EPA's MCLG of 4 mg/L should be lowered due to information gaps regarding fluoride safety at concentrations of 2 to 4 mg/L. The committee did not address the risks or benefits of artificial fluoridation. The NRC committee found that severe enamel fluorosis is an adverse health effect, not just cosmetic. They recommended lowering the MCLG to protect against this condition, as it affects roughly 10% of children in communities with water fluoride concentrations at or near the current standard of 4 mg/L. The NRC committee recommended lowering the MCLG to protect against severe enamel fluorosis, which affects roughly 10% of children in communities with water fluoride concentrations at or near the current standard of 4 mg/L. They also concluded that stage II skeletal fluorosis constitutes an adverse health effect, suggesting that fluoride at 2 or 4 mg/L might not protect all individuals from this condition. The committee reviewed studies on fluoride ingestion and bone fracture risks, finding that fluoride at 4 mg/L may increase nonvertebral bone fracture risk and slightly decrease vertebral fracture risk. More research is needed to understand the relationship between fluoride ingestion, bone fluoride concentrations, and skeletal fluorosis stages. The majority of the committee agreed that fluoride can weaken bones and increase fracture risk under certain conditions. The committee concluded that lifetime exposure to fluoride at concentrations of 4 mg/L or higher can increase fracture rates, especially in susceptible demographic groups. Some members questioned the protective nature of the MCLG against bone fractures. Further research is needed to assess the risk of bone fractures at fluoride concentrations around 2 mg/L. The debate on the association between fluoride and bone cancer continues. The NRC committee concluded that further research is needed to analyze the potential of fluoride to initiate or promote cancers, particularly of the bone. The evidence on fluoride's carcinogenicity in humans is tentative and mixed, with no clear indication either way. The committee noted an upcoming study by the Harvard School of Public Health in 2006 that may help identify research needs. The NRC review assessed pre-publication data from an \"exploratory analysis\" of Harvard data linking fluoride in drinking water to osteosarcoma in young males. Further research was recommended to confirm or refute the results. A subsequent study in 2011 found no significant association between bone fluoride levels and osteosarcoma risk. Researchers highlighted the use of bone fluoride concentrations as a measure of fluoride exposure. The NRC committee evaluated scientific studies on various health effects of fluoride exposure, including neurotoxicity, endocrine effects, and effects on different body systems. While some studies suggested adverse effects, the research was deemed insufficient to assess their significance. More research is needed to determine the risks of fluoride exposure at 4 mg/L in these areas. The committee recommended further studies to fill data gaps and aid in EPA's revision of regulations. The NRC committee recommended further studies to fill data gaps and facilitate EPA's revision of fluoride standards. Recommendations included studies on enamel fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis, bone fractures, and other health effects. The committee suggested lowering the maximum contaminant level goal to protect against severe enamel fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis, and bone fractures. EPA was advised to update risk assessments with new data on health risks and better exposure estimates. The committee recommended additional research on the prevalence and severity of enamel fluorosis in U.S. communities with fluoride concentrations greater than 1 mg/L, focusing on moderate and severe enamel fluorosis in relation to caries and psychological, behavioral, and social effects among affected children. The Safe Drinking Water Act requires EPA to review and potentially revise drinking water regulations every six years. In March 2010, EPA announced the results of its review for 71 contaminants, including fluoride, and concluded that a revision to the fluoride regulation was not necessary at that time. The agency was conducting assessments on the noncancer impacts of fluoride on severe dental fluorosis and skeletal systems, as well as evaluating the contribution of drinking water to total fluoride exposure. In December 2010, EPA analyzed fluoride exposure and source contributions from various sources including dental products, foods, and pesticides. Data was collected to estimate total fluoride exposure for children and adults, considering concentrations in foods, beverages, drinking water, toothpaste, and pesticides. EPA's conclusions were based on this exposure analysis. EPA reported conclusions on fluoride exposure: - Some young children at risk for severe dental fluorosis up to age 7. - Residential tap water contributes less to ingested fluoride. - Fluoridated water in beverages increases dietary fluoride, raising over-exposure risk. - Solid foods' fluoride content varies due to fluoridated water. - Toothpaste ingestion is a significant fluoride source for children under 4. - Ambient air, soils, and sulfuryl fluoride in foods have minor fluoride contributions. In December 2010, EPA completed a dose-response assessment for severe dental fluorosis, establishing a reference dose of 0.08 mg fluoride per kilogram per day to protect children from enamel pitting during enamel formation. This assessment aims to prevent over-exposure to fluoride in children, especially those living in fluoridated communities. The EPA is reviewing new fluoride risk assessments to potentially revise drinking water standards. The NRC recommended lowering the maximum contaminant level goal for fluoride. Regulatory efforts under the Safe Drinking Water Act may take several years to complete. The NRC recommended lowering fluoride levels to prevent enamel fluorosis and reduce bone accumulation. EPA may revise standards considering sources of fluoride exposure beyond drinking water, potentially leading to lower primary and secondary standards. The EPA may revise fluoride standards due to concerns about children's health effects and public notification requirements for dental fluorosis. The NRC recommended lowering fluoride levels to prevent enamel fluorosis and reduce bone accumulation. The NRC committee reviewed the science for fluoride risk assessment, potentially leading to a more protective standard. EPA considers various factors like health effects, compliance cost, and technical feasibility in setting standards. HHS proposed changing recommended levels for community water fluoridation based on available science and exposure evaluation. The HHS proposed changing recommended levels for community water fluoridation from 0.7 mg/L to 1.2 mg/L to 0.7 mg/L. Opposition to fluoridation is driven by health risks and social/political concerns. Some opponents cite lack of choice and prefer only essential chemicals like chlorine in water supply. Public health professionals support fluoridation for its equity and cost-effectiveness. Water fluoridation is seen as a cost-effective way to protect dental health in diverse communities. The conflict between individual liberty and social policy remains unresolved despite additional scientific evidence. Congress has shown interest in the issue, but decisions on fluoridation are typically made at the state and local levels. The Safe Drinking Water Act does not mandate the addition of substances for preventive health care. The NRC's finding suggests that EPA should lower the drinking water standard for fluoride to prevent adverse health effects like dental fluorosis. This may lead to congressional oversight and legislative attention on gaps in health effects research, EPA's review of fluoride regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act."
