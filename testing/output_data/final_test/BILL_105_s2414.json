If the highest bidder is not CFRA, CFRA has the right to match the bid and purchase the properties. The purchaser must offer leaseholders the option to purchase the property at fair market value or continue leasing. The Lessee has the option to continue leasing the Property at fair market value rent with the same terms and conditions, including the right to renew the lease for 2 consecutive 5-year terms. If the Lessee declines to purchase the Property, the Purchaser must compensate them for the fair market value of all improvements made to the Property. The Lessee can sell the improvements to the Purchaser before the lease termination. The Purchaser must honor existing property descriptions and historical use restrictions for leaseholds.
