    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Energy Pipeline Research, Development, and Demonstration Act\". The Congress recognizes the importance of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines in the US energy infrastructure, highlighting their vulnerability to aging, terrorist attacks, and disruptions. It emphasizes the significant impact of pipeline failures on the economy and national security, while also acknowledging the need for new pipelines to support emerging energy sources like hydrogen. A coordinated research, development, and standardization program is deemed necessary for existing and new technologies in pipeline systems. The Congress emphasizes the importance of enhancing the safety and security of critical facilities through the use of existing and new technologies. SEC. 3. PIPELINE INTEGRITY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION. The heads of participating agencies will establish a cooperative program for research, development, demonstration, and standardization to ensure pipeline integrity. This program will focus on materials research, stress analysis, leak detection, flow metering, and content analysis of pipeline throughput. The participating agencies will establish a program focusing on pipeline integrity, including materials research, stress analysis, leak detection, flow metering, and content analysis of pipeline throughput. Within 6 months, a report on activities and capabilities will be submitted to Congress. The participating agencies will prepare a 5-year program plan for pipeline integrity activities, consulting with State and local government representatives. The plan will be submitted to Congress and reviewed by the Pipeline Integrity Technical Advisory Committee. The participating agencies will consult with State and local government representatives, as well as private sector stakeholders, to establish program priorities and select project proposals. They may also seek advice from various entities including Federal agencies, utilities, manufacturers, and environmental organizations. Additionally, a Pipeline Integrity Technical Advisory Committee will be established to manage pipeline integrity activities. The Advisory Committee, established within 6 months of the Act, advises on program development and evaluates research progress. Membership includes 3 members appointed by the Secretary of Energy. The Advisory Committee, established within 6 months of the Act, advises on program development and evaluates research progress. Membership includes 3 members appointed by the Secretary of Energy, 3 members appointed by the Secretary of Transportation, and 3 members appointed by the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Members must have experience in the hazardous liquid or gas pipeline industries and research and development of pipeline technologies. Compensation for members is provided. The Advisory Committee advises on program development and evaluates research progress. Members serve without compensation but receive travel expenses. The Committee meets at least 4 times a year and terminates after 5 years. Participating agencies must report to Congress annually on the implementation of their program plans. SEC. 4. MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING.\n\nWithin 120 days of this Act's enactment, participating agencies will establish a memorandum of understanding outlining their responsibilities, aligned with section 3(a)(3). Each agency will ensure program plan elements are implemented as per the Act. The Department of Transportation will focus on pipeline inspection and information systems, the Department of Energy on low-volume leak detection, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology on standards and materials research.\n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAuthorized appropriations for fiscal years 2002 through 2006:\n- Secretary of Energy: $10,000,000\n- Secretary of Transportation: $5,000,000\n- National Institute of Standards and Technology: $5,000,000\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITION.\n\n\"Participating agencies\" refer to the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, and National Institute of Standards and Technology."
