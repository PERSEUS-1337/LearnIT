    "content": "The Act titled \"Affordable Medicines Utilization Act of 2011\" includes a provision for savings rebate for states that increase generic drug utilization under Medicaid. The Affordable Medicines Utilization Act of 2011 includes a provision for states to receive increased funding if their generic drug utilization rate rises compared to previous years. The Affordable Medicines Utilization Act of 2011 allows states to receive additional funding based on the difference in spending for multiple source drugs compared to the previous year and the state's percentage under section 1905(b). Additionally, the Act includes an amendment for the annual determination of State Generic Substitution Rates and Performance Rankings under section 1927 of the Social Security Act. The Secretary will annually determine the generic substitution rate for each State and publish the rates on the CMS website, listing States in order of the greatest increase in the generic substitution rate. The generic substitution rate is defined as the share of drug units for the 20 most prescribed multiple source drugs under a State program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will evaluate and report to Congress on the effectiveness of generic drug utilization savings payments in encouraging States to increase their utilization rates by December 31, 2014. The evaluation will analyze the savings for State Medicaid programs from increased generic drug substitution, indirect savings from improved medication adherence, and future estimated savings after termination of generic drug utilization payments. The term \"Medicaid generic substitution rate\" refers to the generic substitution rate for a State under the Social Security Act, as added by subsection (b)."
