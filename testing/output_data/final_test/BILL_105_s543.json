    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Volunteer Protection Act of 1997\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. The Congress finds that the potential for liability actions deters volunteers, leading to a decrease in volunteer participation in nonprofit organizations and civic programs. This results in diminished community contributions and higher program costs, impacting the effectiveness of social service programs that rely on volunteer involvement. The Congress recognizes the importance of protecting volunteer participation in public-private partnerships through Federal legislation due to high liability costs faced by volunteers and nonprofit organizations. This is necessary to ensure the continued provision of services and goods that would otherwise be provided by private entities operating in interstate commerce. The Congress acknowledges the need to protect volunteers from frivolous lawsuits to maintain the operation of volunteer service organizations and uphold constitutionally protected due process, promoting the free flow of goods and services. The Act aims to promote the interests of social service program beneficiaries and taxpayers by providing liability protections for volunteers serving nonprofit organizations and governmental entities. This is in line with the powers granted by the United States Constitution to uphold due process rights and ensure the availability of volunteer-based programs. SEC. 3 of the Act preempts state laws inconsistent with it, except for laws providing additional liability protection for volunteers. States can choose not to apply the Act to civil actions in state courts involving only state citizens by enacting specific legislation. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR VOLUNTEERS. Liability Protection for Volunteers: Volunteers of nonprofit organizations or governmental entities are not liable for harm caused by their actions if they were within their responsibilities, properly licensed, and the harm was not due to misconduct or negligence. Liability protection for volunteers extends to situations where harm is not caused by gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or conscious indifference, and not related to operating a vehicle requiring a license or insurance. This section does not affect civil actions against volunteers by nonprofit organizations or governmental entities, nor does it impact the liability of these organizations for harm caused to individuals. Exceptions to Volunteer Liability Protection include state laws that require risk management procedures and training for volunteers, hold organizations liable for volunteer actions like employer-employee relationships, allow civil actions by government officers to bypass liability limits, and determine when liability limits apply. A State law may limit liability for nonprofit organizations or governmental entities if they provide a financially secure source of recovery for harm caused by volunteers. This source can be insurance, risk pooling, assets, or alternative arrangements. Separate standards for different liabilities may apply. Additionally, punitive damages cannot be awarded against volunteers for harm caused by their actions. The limitations on liability for volunteers acting within the scope of their responsibilities to a nonprofit organization or governmental entity can be overcome if clear and convincing evidence shows willful or criminal misconduct. This does not create a cause of action for punitive damages and does not override any Federal or State laws limiting punitive damages. Exceptions to the limitations include misconduct constituting a crime of violence. The curr_chunk outlines various scenarios where misconduct can override limitations on liability for volunteers, including crimes of violence, hate crimes, sexual offenses, civil rights violations, and misconduct under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The curr_chunk clarifies that this subsection does not impact subsection (a)(3) or (e). SEC. 5. LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS. Liability for noneconomic loss in civil actions against volunteers is determined based on the volunteer's responsibility within a nonprofit organization or governmental entity. Volunteers are only liable for noneconomic loss in proportion to their responsibility for the harm, with separate judgments rendered for each defendant. In civil actions against volunteers, liability for noneconomic loss is determined based on the volunteer's responsibility within the organization. The trier of fact will determine the percentage of responsibility of the defendant for the claimant's harm. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"economic loss\" as pecuniary loss resulting from harm, \"harm\" includes various types of losses, and \"noneconomic losses\" encompass nonpecuniary losses such as pain, suffering, and emotional distress. The term \"nonprofit organization\" refers to organizations exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, operating for charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes, and not involved in hate crimes. The term \"volunteer\" is defined as an individual who performs services for a nonprofit organization or governmental entity without receiving compensation exceeding $500 per year. SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act will take effect 90 days after enactment and applies to claims for harm caused by volunteers filed after the effective date, only if the harm or conduct occurred after that date."
