    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Functional Gastrointestinal and Motility Disorders Research Enhancement Act of 2011\". Functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders (FGIMDs) are chronic conditions characterized by increased sensitivity of the GI tract, abnormal motor functioning, and brain-gut dysfunction. Symptoms include pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, incontinence, and difficulties in food or feces passage. FGIMDs encompass various conditions affecting the esophagus, stomach, gallbladder, small and large intestine, and anorectal areas. Patients with FGIMDs suffer from a range of symptoms affecting the gastrointestinal tract, leading to significant discomfort and potential life-threatening situations. Treatment options are limited, resulting in low patient satisfaction. Diagnosis delays expose patients to unnecessary tests, surgeries, and high costs, with the economic impact in the United States estimated to be substantial. Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIMDs) have a significant economic impact, costing billions in direct and indirect medical expenses. These disorders affect individuals of all ages, including children, and can lead to serious symptoms and lifelong medical expenses. Military veterans, especially those deployed, are particularly affected by gastrointestinal symptoms. The National Institutes of Health recognizes the seriousness of FGIMDs. The Commission on Digestive Diseases outlined research goals for FGIMDs in a 2009 report to Congress and the public. SEC. 409K. FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL AND MOTILITY DISORDERS research enhancement is added to the Public Health Service Act to address research goals outlined in a 2009 report. The Director of NIH can enhance research on functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders (FGIMDs) by expanding basic and clinical research, supporting the establishment of up to five centers of excellence on FGIMDs, and exploring collaborative research opportunities among various Institutes and Centers. The NIH is directing funding towards expanding research on FGIMDs, including those affecting children and maternal health. They are also exploring partnerships with the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve patient care for FGIMDs. The NIH is funding research to improve patient care for FGIMDs like IBS and dyspepsia in veterans and active duty military personnel. SEC. 4. PROMOTING PUBLIC AWARENESS OF FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL AND MOTILITY DISORDERS. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to include promoting public awareness of these disorders. The Secretary may engage in public awareness and education activities to increase understanding of functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders (FGIMDs). These activities include distributing materials targeting healthcare providers and the public, emphasizing basic information on FGIMDs, symptoms, prevalence, co-occurring conditions, and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. The sense of Congress is to improve treatment options for functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders (FGIMDs) by accelerating efforts to enhance medical device and drug development, study risk vs. patient benefit, and identify proper endpoints. This includes supporting initiatives like the Patient Reported Outcomes Consortium and the Critical Path Initiative. The Critical Path Initiative aims to translate scientific breakthroughs into safe treatments quickly and collaborate with patient organizations treating FGIMDs to consider the patient perspective in innovative treatment decisions."
