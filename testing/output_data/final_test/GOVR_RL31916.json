The 207-page proposal aimed to make significant changes to military personnel, acquisition systems, and civilian personnel systems within the Department of Defense. Congressional committees have started reviewing different parts of the proposal, with the Senate and House Armed Services Committees reporting bills related to the proposal. The proposal would impact various titles in the U.S. Code, primarily Title 5 and Title 10. The Department of Defense proposed the \"Defense Transformation for the 21st Century Act of 2003\" to Congress in April 2003, aiming to make significant changes to military personnel, acquisition systems, and civilian personnel systems within the Department of Defense. The proposal would impact various titles in the U.S. Code, primarily Title 5 and Title 10. Provisions from the Homeland Security Act of 2002 specific to personnel management in the Department of Homeland Security are listed separately from the rest of the current law, as they represent the most recent legislative actions impacting Title 5. The DOD proposal, if enacted in its entirety, would have resulted in significantly greater changes in Title 5 than the HSA changes. The Congressional Research Service analysts and attorneys contributed to a comprehensive report on current laws related to the proposed changes in the Defense Department's transformation proposal. The report may not include every law, and updates will only occur if necessary. Key policy staff are involved in comparing the proposed changes to existing laws."
