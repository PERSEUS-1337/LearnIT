    "content": "One of the main goals of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (DFA) is to ensure financial stability in the United States without the need for government bailouts like the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in 2008. Title I of the DFA establishes the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to identify and respond to risks to the financial system, as well as implementing stricter regulations for large financial institutions. Covered financial institutions with $50 billion or more in assets are subject to heightened regulatory requirements, including increased capital and leverage ratios. These institutions must submit credible plans to the Federal Reserve and FDIC outlining how they could be resolved in an orderly manner in the event of financial distress. The DFA requires covered financial institutions to submit \"living wills\" outlining how they can be resolved in case of financial distress. Failure to submit a \"credible\" plan could result in enforcement actions, including divestiture of business lines. Title II of the DFA establishes an insolvency regime for systemic threats to the financial system. The Title II insolvency regime, known as Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), is administered by the FDIC. Under OLA, the FDIC must liquidate the failed firm within five years, with costs intended to be covered by the assets of the failed company or assessments on surviving financial institutions. Financial firms can only be subject to OLA if specific criteria are met, including evaluation of the impact on financial stability and approval from various regulatory bodies. The Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) is a fallback alternative to insolvency regimes like the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, triggered only in extraordinary circumstances. The living wills regime aims to prevent the need for OLA by requiring detailed roadmaps from large financial firms to address potential crises. The living wills regime requires large financial institutions to design detailed roadmaps for utilizing resolution regimes in case of insolvency or default. Over 130 institutions have submitted plans, with the 11 largest firms in the US filing multiple plans. Despite their extensive length, these plans have not met the minimum requirements set by regulators. The next living wills for these firms are due in July 2015. The FRB and FDIC will review the living wills of 11 large financial institutions due in July 2015. If found insufficient, enforcement actions may be taken, including divestment of assets for orderly resolution. This report examines the legal requirements of living wills under DFA Section 165(d), the inadequacies of 2013 plans, suggested steps for improvement, and potential enforcement tools available to regulators. This report focuses on the legal aspects of the DFA living wills regime and how the FRB and FDIC are administering it. It does not take a stance on whether the regime promotes financial stability or if recommended steps improve resolvability. The report concentrates on the interpretation and implementation of the living wills regime by the FRB and FDIC. Several bills in the 113th Congress aim to modify financial institution regulation, including H.R. 46 and S. 20 which seek to repeal the DFA. H.R. 5421, the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2014, proposes changes to the Bankruptcy Code to resolve insolvent financial institutions. Another bill, S. 1861, the Taxpayer Protection and Responsible Resolution Act, also addresses the resolution of financial institutions. The Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act (H.R. 1450 / S. 685) aims to break up financial institutions deemed \"too big to fail\" to prevent catastrophic effects on the economy. The Systemic Risk Mitigation Act (H.R. 613) requires large bank holding companies to hold long-term, subordinated debt to promote firm viability and absorb losses in case of failure. The DFA Section 165(d) requires covered financial institutions to submit plans detailing how they would be resolved in an orderly fashion under the Bankruptcy Code if they fail. Plans must include information on how affiliated insured depository institutions are protected, company obligations and assets, significant counterparties, and entities with rights. Section 165(d) of the DFA mandates covered financial institutions to submit detailed resolution plans outlining their ownership structure, credit exposure to other institutions, and cross-guarantees. The FRB and FDIC review these submissions iteratively and must notify if a plan is deemed not credible for an orderly resolution. The DFA mandates covered financial institutions to submit detailed resolution plans. If a company's plan is deemed not credible, regulators can require a modified plan. Failure to submit a credible plan may result in operational limits or heightened standards until requirements are met. The FRB and FDIC can compel companies to divest business lines and assets if they fail to submit a credible resolution plan within two years. Regulations issued in 2011 establish economic conditions, filing timeframes, and review processes for resolution plans under DFA Section 165(d). Covered financial institutions must consider baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios in their plans. Financial institutions must consider baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic conditions when developing resolution plans under DFA Section 165(i). Plans cannot rely on government support and must be divided into public and confidential sections. The public section of a living will for financial institutions should include an executive summary with key business information. Confidentiality of information in living wills is determined by regulatory rules, and covered companies can request certain information to be treated as confidential. Full living will submissions for many financial institutions are extensive. The public sections of living will submissions for financial institutions are typically between 15 and 35 pages long, detailing key business information and strategic analysis. These plans emphasize the covered parent company, its material entities, critical operations, and core business lines. Living wills should also include specific actions for rapid resolution, financial needs, available resources, and steps to limit impact on the U.S. financial system in times of stress. The company's resolution plan includes details on limiting the impact on the U.S. financial system in case of collapse, time frames for implementation, fair market value of critical operations and assets, senior management responsible for resolution planning, steps taken to strengthen the plan, legal organization structure, and balance sheet information. The company's resolution plan includes details on balance sheets, liabilities, collateral, hedging activities, counterparties, off-balance-sheet exposures, and interconnections. Regulations require staggered living will submissions from covered financial institutions, with initial plans due based on asset size. Covered financial institutions must submit a living will annually, with the initial submission deadline staggered based on asset size. Regulators may require more frequent submissions or updates on specified aspects of the plan. Institutions must notify the FRB and FDIC of any material changes within 45 days. The regulations require covered financial institutions to submit a living will annually, with initial deadlines staggered by asset size. The FRB and FDIC must inform institutions of any deficiencies within 60 days, giving them 30 days to provide necessary information. If living wills are deemed not credible, institutions have 90 days to submit a modified plan. The regulations impose heightened standards or limitations on covered financial institutions for failing to submit a credible resolution plan within the regulators' deadline. Failure to comply could result in forced divestment of assets and operations. Enforcement powers under 12 U.S.C. \u00a71818 may be exercised for non-compliance with the living wills regime. The DFA grants broad enforcement powers under Section 1818 for non-compliance with the living wills regime. Disputes can be resolved informally or through a formal hearing and judicial review process. The initial living wills were submitted by the first-wave filers by the July 1, 2012, deadline. The 11 companies submitted their initial living wills to the FRB and FDIC by the July 1, 2012, deadline. Regulators issued joint guidance in April 2013 for the firms to develop their 2013 plans, extending the deadline to October 1, 2013. The guidance required concise descriptions of the key elements of the firm's resolution strategy. The strategic analysis portion of the living wills should include a detailed narrative supported by data and information in appendixes. It should address five key obstacles to resolvability identified by the FRB and FDIC. The guidance for developing living wills includes addressing disruptions in operations, counterparties' actions, and illiquidity of Material Entities. Covered companies are not allowed to assume financial assistance or unsecured financing before default. The FDIC and FRB announced that the living wills submitted by 11 first-wave filers in 2013 failed to establish sufficient resolution plans for their companies. Despite improvements from the original submissions in 2012, the 2013 plans had various deficiencies, including unrealistic assumptions about customer behavior and inadequate support. The FDIC and FRB found deficiencies in the living wills submitted by 11 first-wave filers in 2013. The plans lacked realistic assumptions about customer behavior and needed changes in firm structure and practices for orderly resolution. Actions required for compliance include simplifying business structures, modifying contracts for temporary stays during insolvency, strengthening internal operations, and establishing the ability to maintain. The FDIC and FRB found deficiencies in the living wills of 11 banking organizations in 2013, deeming them \"not credible.\" The regulators have mandated immediate action to improve resolvability and submit credible plans by July 1, 2015, or face enforcement actions under Section 165(d). Regulators plan to impose stricter requirements on companies until robust resolution plans are submitted. Failure to comply could result in divestiture of certain business lines and assets. Initial resolution plans of financial institutions were reviewed, with no indication of non-compliance with Dodd-Frank Act. Regulators provided guidance to covered financial institutions on resolution plans based on their complexity and operations within the US. More than 30 firms with complex operations must submit full plans, while an intermediate group can submit tailored plans using a model template issued by regulators. Regulators issued a model template for covered financial institutions to submit tailored plans for resolution. The remaining institutions with limited domestic operations can update their original filings with material changes. The report examines steps these institutions can take to improve their resolvability, as indicated by the FRB and FDIC. The report focuses on legal issues related to living wills and suggests that implementing changes could increase costs. Steps to address deficiencies noted by regulators may lead to industry-wide changes, impacting smaller companies. FRB and FDIC recommend strategic divestiture to improve resolvability of covered financial institutions. One potential strategy to improve resolvability of financial institutions is strategic divestiture, which involves selling off nonessential entities operating in foreign countries to reduce size and complexity. This approach could also decrease geographical footprint and concentration of risk exposure. The 11 first-wave filers of covered financial institutions face challenges with multiple insolvency regimes across different countries, as highlighted by the FDIC and FRB. Vice-Chairman Thomas M. Hoenig emphasized the complexities of dealing with various legal systems, contracts, depositor preferences, funding arrangements, and derivatives in a global context. When a covered financial institution enters bankruptcy, differences in treatment of depositor preference, wholesale funding, derivatives, and repurchase agreements among countries can complicate the resolution process. Simplifying the institution's operations across fewer countries and within each country could enhance resolvability by reducing coordination challenges between insolvency regimes and preventing self-interested actions like \"ring-fencing\" of assets by administrators. Ring-fencing in bankruptcy can lead to inefficient asset allocation, inconsistent treatment of creditors, and hinder cross-border fund flow for Critical Operations. The FDIC has been active in establishing MOUs with cross-border insolvency regimes to coordinate in case of default, but legal enforceability and voluntary cooperation may pose challenges. The development of a living will could help prevent financial institutions from facing large margin calls and payouts on risky derivative products, as seen in the case of AIG during the Great Recession. This process relies on voluntary cooperation and could identify areas for divestiture to reduce concentrated risk exposure. Developing a living will could alert financial institutions to significant concentrations like AIG's mortgage-related credit default swaps, prompting divestment to reduce risk. Restructuring by aligning business areas with legal organizations may improve resolvability. The Chairman's suggestion aims to improve resolvability by creating a transparent and rational organization, easing operations during resolution. Covered financial institutions may focus on aligning Material Entities and Core Operations in distinct legal structures to mitigate financial losses. This strategy can enhance understanding of the institution's legal structure, reduce complexity, and address regulators' concerns by ensuring sufficient capitalization of intermediate holding companies. The company is well-capitalized to absorb potential losses by subsidiaries in the intermediate holding company. Implementing policies for the intermediate holding company to serve as a \"source of strength\" for its subsidiaries can help avoid the parent holding company from guaranteeing liabilities. Incorporation and contractual barriers within each intermediate holding company could reduce the likelihood of financial distress. The establishment of an intermediate holding company can help prevent financial distress from spreading to other parts of the institution. For example, AIG's subsidiary, AIG Financial Products, issued credit default swaps with the parent company's guarantee, which could have been avoided if the subsidiary was organized within an intermediate holding company. The FRB issued regulations requiring foreign banking organizations to establish U.S.-based intermediate holding companies to reduce cross-border risks and improve the resolvability of U.S.-based subsidiaries. Some foreign banking organizations are taking reorganization steps to comply with regulations requiring the establishment of U.S.-based intermediate holding companies. For example, UBS announced a restructuring plan to separate its banking activities into a distinct banking subsidiary and establish a U.S.-based intermediate holding company. UBS announced a restructuring plan to separate its banking activities into a distinct banking subsidiary and establish a U.S.-based intermediate holding company to improve its resolvability in response to industry-wide \"too-big-to-fail\" requirements. This restructuring would incur costs for covered financial institutions. Transferring capital to the intermediate holding company could impact compliance with minimum capital standards and result in negative tax consequences. Borrowing costs for subsidiaries without parental guarantees may be higher. There is a risk of financial instability even with explicit contract disclaimers. The FDIC and FRB are promoting covered financial institutions to modify standard terms in financial contracts to improve resolvability. Market forces may break down if emergency governmental assistance is expected in case of default. The FDIC and FRB are encouraging covered financial institutions to modify standard terms in financial contracts to enhance resolvability, including implementing a brief \"stay\" provision similar to the FDIC's powers under OLA and the FDI Act. This could align the treatment of contracts in bankruptcy with special insolvency regimes, potentially improving the resolution process. The FDIC and FRB are encouraging covered financial institutions to modify financial contracts to align with special insolvency regimes, potentially improving the resolution process. Global financial institutions are voluntarily modifying contracts to provide a temporary stay from counterparties' default trigger rights during insolvency. FDIC Vice Chairman Thomas M. Hoenig suggests covered financial institutions should reduce their overall risk exposure. Thomas M. Hoenig recommends covered financial institutions reduce exposure to derivatives contracts, as shown in Table 1 with large exposures compared to assets. Stays in insolvency allow time for resolution authorities to validate claims, coordinate creditor claims, and prevent creditor runs. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code automatically establishes a stay upon filing for bankruptcy. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code imposes a general stay upon filing for bankruptcy, with exceptions for qualified financial contracts (QFCs) like securities, commodity contracts, and swap agreements. Trustees can reverse certain debtor transfers before bankruptcy to ensure fair asset distribution among creditors and prevent a rush to file for bankruptcy. The \"safe-harbor protections\" for qualified financial contracts (QFCs) aim to prevent the negative impact of a financial institution's bankruptcy on global markets by allowing counterparties to terminate contracts and offset positions. Close-out and netting rights in QFCs enable parties to unilaterally terminate contracts and offset amounts due. The \"safe-harbor protections\" for qualified financial contracts (QFCs) allow counterparties to terminate contracts and offset amounts due at termination. Close-out and netting provisions in QFCs can be triggered by default, potentially impacting ailing firms by depleting their assets. For example, Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy estate had around 930,000 QFCs, with approximately 733,000 terminated within three months of filing for bankruptcy, leaving non-Lehman counterparties owed money. Lehman Brothers' non-Lehman counterparties, who were \"in the money,\" could terminate QFCs and keep collateral. Counterparties could close-out and net non-collateralized QFCs, becoming unsecured creditors in Lehman's bankruptcy. The unilateral termination authority of counterparties caused significant value destruction for Lehman. The FDIC, as receiver, aims to uphold FDI statutory objectives. The FDIC, as receiver, aims to maintain a failed firm's operations to protect insured deposits and promote financial stability under the FDI Act and OLA. It has greater flexibility in managing QFCs compared to the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC, as receiver, has powers to manage QFCs of failed financial institutions, including the ability to impose temporary stays on counterparties from exercising their rights until notified of a transfer or until 5:00 p.m. of the business day after the appointment of the receiver. Only after this stay can counterparties freely exercise their rights under such contracts. The FDIC, as receiver, has the authority to transfer QFCs to other financial institutions during a temporary stay period. It can also repudiate certain contracts if allowing performance would be burdensome. The FDIC must either transfer or repudiate all QFCs with a particular party and its affiliates. The FDIC, as receiver, can avoid property transfers made with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud. The temporary stay for QFCs allows the FDIC to assess and exercise its powers effectively. This includes transferring performing QFCs to different financial institutions to streamline the process. The temporary stay for QFCs allows the FDIC to assess and exercise its powers effectively, potentially reducing financial strain on insolvent institutions. However, providing the FDIC with discretion on QFC transfer or repudiation could increase market uncertainty. The FDI Act and OLA could be amended to treat QFCs the same as under the Bankruptcy Code, potentially impacting counterparties' decisions on terminating contracts. In 2014, major financial institutions agreed to temporarily stay counterparties' ability to terminate swaps contracts. The ISDA Resolution Stay Protocol allows financial institutions to opt into overseas resolution regimes for derivatives contracts, covering 90% of the market initially. More institutions are expected to join, increasing market coverage. The ISDA Resolution Stay Protocol, agreed upon by major financial firms, will be implemented in the United States and other jurisdictions. Participating institutions include Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley. The FDIC and FRB support the Protocol, which aims to increase long-term, unsecured debt for covered financial institutions. This aligns with global proposals for systemically important financial institutions. The Financial Stability Board globally applies minimum capital requirements to systemically important financial institutions to reduce the likelihood of failure. Capital requirements do not eliminate default risk, as institutions fund assets through liabilities. Long-term unsecured debt is preferred in insolvency proceedings for its benefits over secured and short-term debt. In insolvency proceedings, long-term, unsecured debt holders are more willing to restructure their claims compared to secured creditors. Long-term debt aligns market interests better than short-term and secured debt, as the latter do not incentivize long-term stability in covered financial institutions. Short-term debt holders are mainly concerned with financial strength. Long-term, unsecured debt holders prioritize the long-term stability of financial institutions as they may absorb losses in case of failure. Their decision to extend credit is influenced by the institution's long-term viability. If questioned, obtaining long-term credit becomes difficult and rolling over short-term debt may be challenging in a stressed environment. Long-term debt holders prioritize financial stability by absorbing losses in case of failure. Short-term debt reliance may impact stability during market downturns. Governor Tarullo emphasizes the importance of long-term unsecured debt for successful resolution without taxpayer assistance. Having sufficient long-term debt reduces run risk and clarifies creditor positions. Long-term, unsecured debt subordinated to other creditors can reduce run risk and improve market discipline. FDIC Chairman Gruenberg and FRB Governor Tarullo are considering imposing a minimum level of long-term debt for financial institutions. However, long-term debt is more expensive than short-term debt, and its benefits may be undermined if creditors expect government assistance in case of insolvency. The curr_chunk states that a financial institution will receive emergency governmental assistance if it faces insolvency or default."
