The United States and Russia are working to reduce and eliminate their chemical weapon stockpiles, but concerns remain about terrorist groups obtaining insecure chemical weapons. Security of Syrian chemical weapons, including nerve and blister agents, is a significant concern. Policy approaches to reducing chemical agent vulnerability in Syria have focused on treating them as a group rather than specific agents. Detection capabilities for military and civilian chemical agents vary, leading to challenges in coordination. Treatments for chemical exposure differ based on the specific agent. Limited practical experience exists among health care providers in treating chemical casualties, especially civilians. Efforts to reduce vulnerability to terrorist chemical agent use may not address risks from specific agents. This report discusses different types of chemical weapons and toxic industrial chemicals, their availability, treatment, and detection. Chemical agents are chemicals posing exceptional lethality and danger to humans, with some used for commercial purposes and others developed as weapons. Identifying the chemical agent is crucial for effective treatment due to the range of potential effects. Protective equipment and approaches vary depending on the exposure route of the chemical. Chemical agents are categorized into nerve, blister, choking, and blood agents based on their biological effects. Nerve agents disrupt the nervous system and are manmade compounds like organophosphates. Military focus is on nerve and blister agents, while choking and blood agents are commonly used in industrial processes. Nerve agents, including organophosphates, have a wide range of toxicity. Developed as chemical weapons, nerve agents like tabun, sarin, soman, and VX were manufactured by various countries. The United States and Russia, as part of the Chemical Weapons Convention, are reducing their nerve agent stockpiles. Military and terrorist use of nerve agents has been rare. The use of nerve agents has been rare historically. The Syrian government used a nerve agent in 2013, Iraq used nerve agents during the Iran-Iraq war, and the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo used sarin in attacks. Nerve agents have been produced by national chemical weapons programs for decades. Terrorist groups could potentially synthesize nerve agents using commercially available equipment, but the extreme toxicity of these compounds poses significant risks. Nerve agent production involves toxic chemicals and specialized equipment. VX is the most challenging nerve agent to manufacture. Binary chemical weapons offer an alternative method by combining chemicals to create the nerve agent. These weapons are less toxic and safer to handle but may result in less pure or effective nerve agents. Nerve agents like sarin, VX, and tabun are highly toxic chemicals that can enter the body through the lungs or skin. They interfere with the nervous system, causing muscle overstimulation, nausea, weakness, convulsions, and even death. Treatment for nerve agent exposure involves atropine and pralidoxime chloride as antidotes to prevent muscle spasms and reverse the agent's effects. Treatment for nerve agent exposure involves atropine and pralidoxime chloride as antidotes to reverse the agent's effects. Anticonvulsants like Diazepam may reduce seizures. The treatment window varies depending on the agent, with some requiring immediate treatment while others allow for a longer delay. Prophylactic use of compounds like pyridostigmine bromide can also be effective. Blister agents cause painful skin blistering but are generally not lethal. Blister agents, known as vesicants, cause painful skin blistering but are not generally lethal. Mustard agents are the most common blister agents, developed in the late 1800s and used in World War I. They produce casualties and reduce combat effectiveness by requiring bulky protective equipment. Mustard agents are oily liquids with a faint odor of mustard, onion, or garlic, evaporating quickly and causing injurious vapors. Blister agents, like mustard agent, are stockpiled by countries for chemical warfare. The United States is destroying its blister agent stockpile as a signatory to the CWC. Production of blister agents is simpler than nerve agents, requiring toxic chemicals and specialized equipment. These agents can enter the body through inhalation or skin contact, causing burns even through clothing. Symptoms of blister agents may be delayed, with mustard agent causing damage within minutes of exposure. Exposure to mustard agent causes damage within minutes, with symptoms appearing hours later. Even low concentrations can cause skin damage, leading to reddening, pain, swelling, blisters, and lesions. Systemic symptoms like malaise, vomiting, and fever may occur in severe cases. Large amounts of liquid mustard agent can be fatal. Eye exposure to blister agents can result in pain, corneal damage, and scarring, with liquid agent causing the most severe damage. Exposure to blister agents can occur through contact with airborne droplets or self-contamination. Inhaling blister agents can damage the lungs, ranging from mild bronchitis to blistering. Severe lung damage may require mechanical ventilation. Mustard agent exposure weakens the immune system, requiring precautions against infections. Choking agents cause breathing difficulties and potential permanent lung damage. Examples include... Choking agents like chlorine, ammonia, and phosgene can cause breathing difficulties and permanent lung damage. They were used in World War I and more recently in improvised explosive devices. Industrial accidents can also lead to exposure to choking agents, which are now mainly used for commercial purposes like water disinfection and food refrigeration. Choking agents require specialized equipment to produce and injure victims through inhalation. Symptoms include chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and lung swelling. Victims are treated symptomatically and kept at rest to avoid exacerbating lung damage. Treatment for chest discomfort and coughing from choking agents includes rest and comfort. Supplemental oxygen may be needed for shallow breathing. Corticosteroids may be recommended for fluid accumulation in the lungs, but their effectiveness is uncertain. Blood agents like hydrogen cyanide interfere with oxygen utilization at the cellular level. France used hydrogen cyanide as a military agent during World War I. Hydrogen cyanide was used as a military agent by France during World War I and in German concentration camps during World War II. It has industrial applications in various industries. Blood agents like hydrogen cyanide impair cellular oxygen use and affect the central nervous system. Symptoms of exposure depend on concentration and duration, ranging from headache and dizziness to more severe effects. Higher concentrations of hydrogen cyanide can cause convulsions, coma, and cardiac failure. Treatment with specific antidotes like amyl or sodium nitrite combined with sodium thiosulfate can reverse the effects of blood agents. Prompt treatment is crucial for recovery from otherwise-fatal doses of cyanide. Protection against chemical agents is mainly physical to limit exposure to the eyes, lungs, and skin. Gas masks and protective clothing provide physical protection against chemical agents. Gas mask filters with activated charcoal remove particles and chemicals from the airstream, but have a limited lifetime. Protective garments protect against chemical weapons that affect the skin. Protective equipment like hazardous materials suits and military battle dress over-garments are designed to protect against chemical weapons. Hazardous materials suits are made of layered rubber with activated charcoal, while military battle dress over-garments are cloth treated to resist liquids and contain charcoal-impregnated foam. The combination of a properly fitted mask and suit provides full protection against most chemical exposures. Medical prophylaxis against chemical weapons is limited, with pyridostigmine bromide offering some protection against nerve agents like soman. Pre-exposure use of pyridostigmine bromide provides protection against nerve agent soman by preventing permanent binding within the nervous system. It supplements post-exposure antidotes atropine and pralidoxime chloride. Recommended only in high imminent threat situations due to noticeable side effects. U.S. Army developed SERPACWA, a chemical resistant skin cream for added protection. Decontamination involves washing eyes and skin with water and bleach solution. Decontamination, which involves washing the eyes and skin with water and a dilute bleach solution, is crucial for preventing secondary chemical exposure and protecting those treating the victim. It is especially important for victims exposed to liquid chemical agents. Chemical weapons detection is primarily a concern for military planners, but detection capabilities are also needed at manufacturing plants and by first responders handling hazardous materials. The Department of Defense employs various technologies for detecting and identifying chemical agents, including personal sensors, atmospheric sampling, and laboratory methods. Developing a portable instrument that can quickly detect all chemical agents is still an area of research. Detection of chemical agents serves to provide warning of an attack and identify the specific chemical used. Detection techniques for chemical agents include detection paper, tickets, and tubes. These methods rely on sampling the environment, with the paper changing color when exposed to a chemical agent. However, false positives can occur due to other substances dissolving the pigments. Detection techniques for chemical agents involve using detection paper, tickets, or tubes that change color when exposed to a chemical agent. False positives can occur when other substances dissolve the pigments. Handheld detectors like the Chemical Agent Monitor (CAM) can detect mustard agents and nerve agents. Automatic sampling devices like the Automatic Chemical Agent Detector/Alarm (ACADA) use ion mobility spectroscopy to detect chemical agents. Commercially available equipment can be used by hazardous material response teams to assess chemical releases. The Department of Homeland Security provides guidelines for first responders to choose the best detection system. Public health systems can also detect chemical terrorism events through sudden arrivals of casualties in local hospitals. Improved public health networking since 9/11 enhances information sharing and aids in identifying covert chemical releases. Public health monitoring can assist in forensic investigations and identifying terrorists with self-inflicted chemical injuries. The Laboratory Response Network has been established to identify chemical agents and disease outbreaks. Terrorist organizations are seeking to acquire and use chemical, biological, and radiological materials. Experts believe terrorist groups may find it challenging to use chemical agents as weapons of mass destruction due to the large amounts required. However, chemical agents could be used effectively in enclosed spaces for terror attacks. The use of chemical weapons for terror attacks can cause fear and magnify the attack's impact. Aum Shinrikyo used sarin in the Tokyo subway attack, killing 12 and injuring over 5,000. V-series nerve agents could be more lethal than G-series agents. Blister agents cause injury upon contact. Mustard gas is an example of a blister agent. Choking agents are no longer considered useful military weapons due to the high protection provided by chemical suits and masks. However, terrorist interest in using easily available toxic industrial chemicals as weapons has been highlighted. The low lethality of choking agents complicates their use as weapons of mass destruction against civilians, as large volumes would be needed. Industrial availability of some choking agents provides opportunities for acquisition. The industrial availability of choking agents, such as chlorine, poses security concerns due to the potential for terrorist attacks on chemical facilities or during shipment. Congress provided DHS with authority to regulate these facilities for security purposes, leading to the issuance of chemical facility anti-terrorism standards (CFATS) in 2007. Compliance with these regulations is incomplete, and the 113th Congress has held oversight hearings on CFATS and considered its reauthorization. Terrorists may find blood agents difficult to use as weapons of mass destruction due to their quick dispersal and the large amounts required for mass casualties. Some industrially manufactured blood agents are used on-site, but terrorist groups still show interest in them for their potential to cause mass casualties."
