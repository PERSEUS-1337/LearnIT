    "content": "The United States launched assistance programs after the Soviet Union's demise in 1991 to achieve foreign policy objectives, including promoting democracy, free market economies, security, humanitarian relief, and supporting the war on terror. These efforts were mainly supported by the FREEDOM Support Act of 1992. Assistance programs authorized by the FREEDOM Support Act of 1992 aim to promote democracy in the FSU through expert advice, grants to indigenous organizations, and support for political parties, parliaments, and independent media. State Department-funded exchanges introduce FSU leaders to U.S. institutions. In FY2005, 14.4% of total FSU U.S. assistance supported democratization and economic reform programs. In FY2005, about 14.4% of total aid was allocated to economic and social development, a decrease from 43.5% in FY1995. Humanitarian programs included the PL480 food aid program and airlifts of food and medical supplies, with the latter being crucial during the transition period. In FY2005, security programs focused on non-proliferation concerns, mainly under the \"Nunn-Lugar\" Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. Various government departments were actively involved in implementing security programs, including the Department of Defense's efforts to secure transport and storage and eliminate nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. The Department of Energy's Material Protection, Control, and Accounting program also worked to protect nuclear sites and prevent material smuggling. The State Department and DOE have programs to control the spread of weapons expertise in the FSU, focusing on security. Over 40% of U.S. assistance to the FSU since 1992 has been for security, with most funds directed at Russia. In recent years, security aid has increased significantly, reaching 67% in FY2005. Anti-terrorism efforts in the region include border security and training, with the goal of preventing weapons from falling into the hands of terrorist groups. Economic growth and democracy are also seen as supporting anti-terrorism efforts. The emergency supplemental funding post-9/11 targeted Central Asian countries hosting U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan. Various U.S. funding sources provide assistance to the region, including Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and Foreign Operations appropriations. Security-related aid is a major focus, with programs like Foreign Military Financing and Non-proliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining accounts receiving funding. Since 1992, the U.S. has provided $5.2 billion in security aid to the FSU through DOD appropriations, $3.6 billion through DOE appropriations, and $2.4 billion through Foreign Operations appropriations. Humanitarian programs, mainly the PL480 food aid program, are funded by the Department of Agriculture. Various U.S. government agencies have implemented democratization, economic, and social programs in the FSU, including the Peace Corps volunteer program and State Department's exchange programs. The Foreign Operations-funded FSA account has supported various U.S. policy objectives since 1992, with $11 billion of the total $28 billion in aid provided between 1992 and 2005 coming from this account. However, funding for the FSA account has been decreasing since 2002, reaching its lowest level of $452 million in FY2007. The Foreign Operations-funded FSA account has been decreasing since 2002, reaching its lowest level of $452 million in FY2007. The decline may be due to some countries no longer requiring U.S. assistance. The composition of the account has changed significantly over 15 years, with economic and social reform decreasing to 40% in 2005, democratization efforts increasing to 25%, and security aid rising to 25% in 2000. The State Department's non-proliferation program funding has shifted to other accounts, leading to a decline in security funding from the FSA account. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) was established in 2004, providing assistance to countries meeting accountability and reform standards. Four former Soviet Union states are eligible for MCA funds, with Georgia receiving $295.3 million for transport and energy improvements. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) provides funding to eligible countries for infrastructure development and enterprise stimulation. Armenia received a $235.7 million compact for rural poverty reduction through road rehabilitation and irrigation. Moldova and Ukraine are candidate countries working on program proposals for financial assistance. Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and Ukraine have \"threshold\" status, receiving limited funds to improve their performance for MCA Compact funding. In December 2006, the MCC signed anti-corruption assistance packages with Ukraine ($45 million) and Moldova ($24.7 million), managed by USAID and the Department of Justice. FY2007 economic aid funding for the FSU is provided under a continuing appropriations resolution, allocating $452 million in the FSA account. The FY2008 Administration request for DOD Cooperative Threat is $351.6 million, a 22% decrease from FY2007. The FY2008 Administration request for DOD Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs is $348 million, a 22% decrease from the previous year. Concerns have been raised about U.S. assistance for democracy and economic reform, with a continued decline in aid to the region. The FY2008 Administration request for DOD Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs is $348 million, a 22% decrease from the previous year. Cuts in aid levels would fall heavily on six countries, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan. The Russia Program's FSA assistance would be cut to $50 million from $80 million in FY2006, leading to a phase-out of the aid program in the next few years. There are no current plans to eliminate DOD or DOE non-proliferation programs to Russia. The State Department's strategy in 1994 indicated the Russia program would end around 1998. The Partnership for Freedom initiative in 1997 planned to wind down large-scale technical assistance to the FSU by 2002, with smaller programs continuing until 2006. The Bush Administration decided to phase out Russia programs starting with economic sector programs by 2006. The Administration argued that economic reform programs were no longer necessary due to Russia's strong economic growth, but the maintenance of democracy activities was questionable. In FY2002 and FY2003, Russia FSA-funded democracy programs amounted to $63 and $61 million respectively. However, funding declined in subsequent years to $33 million in FY2004, $43 million in FY2005, and $43 million in FY2006. The Administration request for FY2008 contains $26 million for democracy programs in Russia. Democracy funding has fluctuated between 15-34% of total all-spigots spending, with a recent decline in overall account levels. The FY2008 request would provide about $128 million for democratization, 36% of the total account. The recent rise of democracy in Ukraine and Georgia, along with the decline in Russia, has emphasized the importance of U.S. democratization assistance. Calls for increased aid have been made due to Putin's erosion of democratic institutions. The Russian Democracy Act of 2002 called for more aid and highlighted the role of NGOs and independent media. Attacks on aid recipients, especially NGOs promoting democracy, have been a concern. In mid-2005, a U.S.-supported human rights organization was accused of tax evasion, despite its supposed tax-free status. The Russian government approved legislation in 2005 to restrict foreign organizations from assisting Russian NGOs, citing concerns about foreign funding of political activities. This move was seen as a response to fears of a Ukraine-like situation blamed on donor-funded NGOs. The impact of U.S. assistance on positive developments in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan remains uncertain. The United States provided significant financial aid to Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, including democracy assistance. Despite the countries' initial corruption and authoritarianism, U.S. programs aimed to support civil society and political party training, potentially laying the groundwork for democratic revolutions. However, there is a risk of being perceived as interfering in a country's internal affairs, especially if the government is authoritarian. NGOs in Central Asia are facing harassment, believed by some U.S. officials to be instigated by Russia due to the perceived subversive nature of democracy aid in authoritarian governments. Aid to the states of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) comes with conditions outlined in the FREEDOM Support Act and foreign operations bills, including requirements for economic and political reform, human rights standards, adherence to international treaties, and denial of support to terrorists. Specific conditions, like Section 907 of the FSA, have restricted direct assistance to the government of Azerbaijan unless certain steps are taken. Since 2002, the President has waived restrictions on aid to Azerbaijan unless blockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh cease. Restrictions on aid to Russia have been imposed for various reasons, such as discrimination against religious minorities and selling nuclear reactor technology to Iran. The Millennium Challenge Account compacts also have conditions for eligibility. The Millennium Challenge Account compacts have conditions for eligibility, including standards related to governance, social development, and economic freedom. Armenia received a $236 million award but was warned to maintain these standards or risk losing aid due to issues like electoral fraud and media restrictions. Central Asia faces challenges with human rights conditionality, especially after 9/11. After 9/11, Central Asian states received increased aid due to their strategic importance in the war on terrorism. Concerns over their poor human rights record led to conditions on aid in subsequent appropriations bills, such as requiring progress in human rights and democratization for aid to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Secretary of State Rice waived these conditions for national security reasons in 2006. The House version of the FY2007 foreign operations bill did not include language regarding Uzbekistan or Kazakhstan. Despite this, foreign assistance appropriators expect the Administration to adhere to FY2006 terms and conditions. In 2004, aid to Uzbekistan was withheld due to the Secretary of State's inability to make a determination. Relations between the United States and Uzbekistan became strained after a violent government response to demonstrators in 2005. Discussions about the long-term use of a military base in Uzbekistan were impacted by these events. The Uzbek government evicted U.S. forces from a military base in 2005, leading to a halt in cooperation on counterterrorism activities. Aid to Uzbekistan was also suspended due to constraints on civil society. Peace Corps and IREX programs were affected as well. In 2006, several U.S. organizations, including IREX, Freedom House, Eurasia Foundation, and Counterpart International, were ordered to stop their programs in Uzbekistan. Local NGOs were also forced to disband, raising concerns about implementing democracy programs in the country."
