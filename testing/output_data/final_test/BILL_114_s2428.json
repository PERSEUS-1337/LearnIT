    "content": "The \"Service for Schools Act of 2015\" is cited as the short title. It amends the National and Community Service Act of 1990 by adding a new section for a National Service for Schools program, including a Service Opportunity Registry. The \"Service for Schools Act of 2015\" defines an eligible service opportunity as a national service opportunity that meets specified purposes without displacing existing workers, with compensation not exceeding $10.00 per hour. The \"Service for Schools Act of 2015\" allows participants to receive compensation up to $10.00 per hour for qualifying hours of service. Participants in a professional corps program can exceed this amount if the excess is deducted from their award under subsection (d). The \"Service for Schools Act of 2015\" allows eligible students in high-need communities to receive compensation for qualifying hours of service without age restrictions. Eligible students must have completed 2000 qualifying hours of service as a qualified student, recorded by a State Commission. A qualified student is defined as an individual between the ages of 12 and 30. The \"Service for Schools Act of 2015\" allows eligible students in high-need communities to receive compensation for qualifying hours of service without age restrictions. An hour of service is defined as work done for an eligible service opportunity without payment under part C of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Corporation will establish a Service Opportunity Registry listing eligible opportunities and organizations offering them. Organizations must meet criteria to be registered in the Registry. The Corporation requires organizations offering eligible service opportunities to submit an application containing necessary information for registration in the Registry. Once approved, the organization's name, contact information, and a description of the opportunity will be listed on the Registry, which will be accessible to the public through a National Service for Schools website. The listed organization offering service opportunities must re-register every 2 years. Qualified students must apply through their State Commission with necessary information to participate in listed service opportunities. The State Commission designates qualified students to participate in listed service opportunities and receive credit. Students must contact the organization offering the opportunity and the organization records the completed service hours. The organization must notify the State Commission annually of the qualifying service hours completed by qualified students. The State Commission records and transfers the student's service application and hours to another State Commission upon request. The organization must report service hours annually to the State Commission. If erroneous certifications are found, the Corporation may charge the organization for any associated payments made from the National Service Trust. Eligible students may receive a $10,000 award from the National Service Trust, subject to appropriations. An eligible student may receive a $10,000 award from the National Service for Schools Account, with limitations on the number of awards and ineligibility for receiving both this award and a national service educational award for the same hours of service. The student must submit an application to the Corporation to receive the award. The Corporation allows participants to use certified hours towards an award instead of a national service educational award. Award funds can be used to repay student loans or cover educational expenses at a higher education institution. In subsections (b) and (c) of section 148, references to a national service educational award, an eligible individual, the National Service Trust, a position, and a term of service are considered to be related to an award under this section, an eligible student meeting award requirements, the National Service for Schools Account, activities under this section, and a term of service under this section, respectively. The Secretary of the Treasury will invest appropriated amounts into the National Service for Schools Account. The Corporation will not record an obligation for an award under this section until a specific time. The Corporation and the Director of the Congressional Budget Office estimate the amount needed for award payments in the next fiscal year and submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations. Appropriations are authorized for the Registry under this section. The Corporation estimates funds needed for award payments in the next fiscal year and submits a report to the Committees on Appropriations. If appropriations are insufficient, a notice is sent to Congress identifying the additional amount required for all awards. Establishment of the National Service for Schools Account under SEC. 145A of the National and Community Service Act of 1990. The National Service for Schools Account is established within the National Service Trust to hold appropriated funds, donations, and interest/proceeds from investments. It is administered as outlined in section 198T."
