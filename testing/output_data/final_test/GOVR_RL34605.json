The term \"charitable\" is not defined in the tax code, but examples of charitable purposes include relief of the poor, promotion of social welfare, and advancement of education, religion, and science. The IRS has developed two standards for hospitals to qualify as charitable organizations: the \"charity care standard\" and another standard. The IRS has two standards for hospitals to qualify as charitable organizations: the \"charity care standard\" and the \"community benefit standard.\" In 1956, Revenue Ruling 56-185 outlined the requirements for hospitals to qualify for tax-exempt status, including providing free or reduced-cost care to patients in need. Publicly supported community hospitals typically qualify as charitable organizations, even with a low level of charity care, if it is due to the community's lack of demand. In 1969, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 69-545, which established the \"community benefit standard\" for hospitals to qualify as charitable organizations. This ruling focused on whether hospitals promote the health of the community at large, rather than providing free or reduced-cost care. The IRS ruled in favor of a hospital that only admitted paying patients but operated a full-time emergency room open to everyone, stating that promoting health aligns with charitable purposes. The IRS ruled that promoting health aligns with charitable purposes, as long as the class of beneficiaries is broad enough to benefit the community. The hospital's emergency room was open to all and provided care to everyone, regardless of payment ability. The hospital's surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand facilities, and advance medical training. It was controlled by a board of trustees consisting of civic leaders, and hospital privileges were available to all qualified physicians. The community benefit standard was adopted partly in response to Medicare and Medicaid, with concerns about charity care standards. The House Report expressed concern with how charity care standards were applied to hospitals under IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3). Internal revenue agents challenged hospitals' exempt status for not accepting enough patients at no charge or below cost. This led to uncertainty about the required level of care for retaining exempt status. The IRS issued Revenue Ruling 69-545 in response, prompting the Senate Finance Committee to remove the hospital provision from the bill. Finance Committee staff advocated for revoking the ruling and reinstating the charity care standard. After the release of Revenue Ruling 69-545, indigents and organizations challenged the IRS's authority to implement the community benefit standard, arguing it was inconsistent with charitable requirements. The Supreme Court dismissed the case due to lack of standing, as plaintiffs failed to show personal injury from hospitals not providing necessary care to the poor. The IRS continues to use and develop the community benefit standard for hospitals. In 1983, Revenue Ruling 83-157 clarified that hospitals can still qualify for tax-exempt status without an emergency room. The IRS ruling recognized that hospitals may not need to operate emergency rooms in certain circumstances to qualify as charitable organizations. Factors such as community board of directors, open medical staff policy, treatment of patients using public programs, and using surplus funds for patient care and medical training can be used as evidence of providing benefits to the community. Some controversy surrounds non-profit hospitals receiving benefits as charitable organizations, including pricing for uninsured patients, debt collection methods, partnerships with for-profit entities, executive compensation, and the community benefit standard. Class action lawsuits have been filed challenging billing practices for low-income uninsured individuals. The plaintiffs claimed that IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3) created a contract between the federal government and hospitals or a charitable trust, requiring hospitals to provide emergency treatment regardless of ability to pay. However, courts disagreed, stating that the statute does not create a contract or charitable trust. Congressional attention has been focused on the activities of tax-exempt hospitals, with hearings held on the matter. The Tax Exempt Hospitals Responsibility Act of 2006 proposed requirements for hospitals to maintain charity care programs and provide a minimum amount of charity care. No action was taken on the bill, but in the 110th Congress, a discussion draft of possible tax-exempt hospital reforms was released for public comment. Senator Grassley requested a report from the Government Accountability Office on this matter. The GAO report examined inconsistencies in defining and measuring community benefits due to hospital discretion and state requirements. IRS required large hospitals to provide industry-specific information on a new Schedule H of Form 990 to address transparency concerns. Schedule H was created to address transparency concerns surrounding tax-exempt organizations providing hospital or medical care. It consists of six parts: charity care program details, community building activities, Medicare shortfalls and bad debts, joint ventures disclosure, health care facilities information, and a section for other charitable activities. For tax year 2008, only disclosure of hospital facilities was required on Schedule H. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148 , \u00a7 9007) imposes additional requirements on hospitals to qualify for \u00a7 501(c)(3) status. Organizations operating hospital facilities must meet new requirements, including conducting certain activities starting after March 23, 2012. Starting after March 23, 2012, hospitals must conduct a \"community health needs assessment\" in the current or past two taxable years, adopt an implementation strategy, and make the assessment publicly available. Failure to meet the assessment requirement will result in a $50,000 excise tax. Hospitals must also describe on Form 990 how identified needs are being met and explain any unaddressed needs. Additionally, starting after March 23, 2010, hospitals must have written financial assistance and emergency medical care policies. The financial assistance policy for hospitals must address eligibility criteria, application process, and provision of free or discounted care. It should also cover how amounts are calculated, actions for nonpayment, and measures to publicize the policy. Emergency medical care policy requires hospitals to provide care without discrimination, regardless of financial assistance eligibility. Hospitals cannot charge eligible individuals more than those with insurance coverage for emergency and medically necessary care, and gross charges are prohibited. The Affordable Care Act requires hospitals to make reasonable efforts to determine eligibility for financial assistance before collection actions. Treasury Department will issue regulations and review community benefit activities every three years for hospitals subject to the new requirements. Guidance on the act's provisions is needed sooner rather than later. The Affordable Care Act mandates hospitals to assess financial assistance eligibility before collections. The Treasury Department will review community benefit activities every three years for compliant hospitals. Hospitals with tax-exempt status must report specific industry information on Schedule H of Form 990. IRS released a draft in June 2007 and finalized it after public feedback. Schedule H was finalized in December 2007 to increase transparency for tax-exempt organizations providing hospital or medical care. Concerns were raised about defining hospitals and the number of required schedules, but the IRS clarified that one Schedule H is needed per entity with a single employer identification number. Schedule H was finalized in December 2007 to increase transparency for tax-exempt organizations providing hospital or medical care. It contains six parts, each focusing on different aspects such as charity care program, community building activities, Medicare shortfalls, joint ventures, health care facilities, and other charitable activities. Part I quantifies the community benefit provided by hospitals annually through dollars spent. The IRS uses dollars spent to quantify community benefit, including free care, Medicaid costs, community health services, education, research, and contributions. Criticisms of Schedule H include concerns about underinclusive categories for charity care and community benefit. The IRS aims to objectively measure the community benefit standard for tax-exempt hospitals. The IRS did not specify a minimum level of expenditures for tax-exemption, leading hospitals to worry about appearing undeserving. Criticisms focused on omissions like community building, Medicare shortfalls, and bad debt. Community building refers to non-medical programs benefiting the community. The initial draft of Schedule H did not include community building activities in its calculation of community benefit. The CHA strongly opposed their exclusion, arguing that social and environmental factors are key determinants of health for vulnerable populations. Despite the subsequent inclusion of community building metrics, they are still separate from charity care and community benefit expenditures in Part I. The IRS commentary on the final draft reflected the importance of community building activities. The IRS commentary on the final draft of Schedule H emphasized the importance of community building activities and their link to health. Part III discusses Medicare shortfalls, where hospitals may not be fully reimbursed for treating Medicare patients, leading to financial shortfalls. Some commentators suggest including these shortfalls in calculations of total community benefit provided by hospitals. The American Bar Association and American Hospital Association argue that Medicare shortfalls should be considered charity care, as elderly patients are a charitable class. However, the Catholic Health Association opposes this, stating that for-profit hospitals aggressively compete for Medicare patients. For-profit hospitals compete aggressively for Medicare patients. The Catholic Health Association argues that measuring Medicare shortfalls is not a useful way to distinguish for-profit hospitals seeking tax exemption. However, if access problems arise for Medicare patients, including Medicare services as community benefit may become more important. The IRS does not consider Medicare shortfalls as a direct measure of community benefit, but hospitals are asked to describe the extent to which any shortfall should be considered as community benefit. Hospitals write off bad debts when it becomes clear they won't be repaid, which some argue should be included in community benefit calculations. Identifying individuals eligible for uncompensated care is challenging due to issues with separating traditional care from bad debt. Some argue that bad debt should be included in community benefit calculations, as it may involve providing care to individuals eligible for charity care. The Catholic Health Association believes bad debt is a cost of doing business that affects both taxable and tax-exempt organizations, and that reporting it does not justify tax exemption. They suggest improving charity care programs instead of relying on bad debt. The Catholic Health Association argues that hospitals should improve charity care programs to identify patients in need, rather than relying on bad debt for community benefit calculations. Patient advocates criticize hospitals for benefiting from bad debt after aggressive collection practices. Schedule H allows reporting bad debt alongside Medicare shortfalls, but it may not be included in the charity care and community benefit table. The IRS does not automatically consider bad debt as a community benefit for tax-exempt hospitals. Schedule H requires listing joint ventures, which can pose problems for non-profit healthcare organizations if there are conflicts of interest with physicians or hospital directors involved in the ventures. In St. David's Health Care System v. United States, the Fifth Circuit ruled that a joint venture's profit motive could jeopardize a non-profit partner's charitable status. The IRS requires reporting on joint ventures in Schedule H, particularly for organizations operating hospitals. This reporting requirement is unique to the special relationship between hospitals and physicians with medical staff privileges. Part V of Schedule H requires organizations to identify hospital or medical care facilities and the types of services provided. It excludes assisted living, vocational training, and medical education. Part VI allows for narrative explanations of community benefit, including justifying Medicare shortfall as community benefit and detailing other unquantifiable benefits provided by hospitals."
