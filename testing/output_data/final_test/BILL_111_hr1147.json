    "content": "The \"Local Community Radio Act of 2009\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The \"Local Community Radio Act of 2009\" is amended to modify rules for low-power FM radio stations, prescribing protection for channels and prohibiting licenses for those who operated stations in violation of the Communications Act of 1934. Any low-power FM license issued before April 2, 2001, must comply with these modifications. Any low-power FM license issued before April 2, 2001, that does not comply with the modifications adopted by the Commission in MM Docket No. 99-25 on April 2, 2001, shall remain invalid. The Federal Communications Commission will modify rules to eliminate minimum distance separation requirements between low-power FM stations and full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations. Existing separation requirements will be maintained for stations broadcasting radio reading services to avoid interference by low-power FM stations. The FCC will ensure spectrum availability for low-power FM stations. SEC. 5. ENSURING AVAILABILITY OF SPECTRUM FOR LOW-POWER FM STATIONS. The FCC will ensure licenses are available for FM translator, booster, and low-power FM stations based on local community needs. SEC. 6. PROTECTION OF TRANSLATOR INPUT SIGNALS. The FCC will address potential interference to FM translator input signals on third-adjacent channels. SEC. 7. ENSURING EFFECTIVE REMEDIATION OF INTERFERENCE. The Federal Communications Commission will modify the interference complaint process for low-power FM stations not meeting channel spacing requirements. These stations must provide interference protections similar to FM translator and booster stations for one year after construction on a third-adjacent channel. The Federal Communications Commission will require newly constructed low-power FM stations on third-adjacent channels to notify the FCC and affected stations of interference complaints within 48 hours and cooperate in addressing them. Low-power FM stations on third-adjacent channels must address interference complaints promptly. The Federal Communications Commission will require low-power FM stations on third-adjacent channels to address interference complaints promptly, including those from affected stations within the protected contour. The FCC will notify the low-power FM station of any interference complaints within 7 days of receiving a complaint. The Federal Communications Commission will grant low-power FM stations on third-adjacent channels technical flexibility to address interference by colocation of transmission facilities. This includes accepting informal evidence of interference and complaints from full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, or FM booster stations affected by low-power FM stations on third-adjacent channels. The Federal Communications Commission will grant low-power FM stations technical flexibility to address interference by colocation of transmission facilities and accept complaints of interference to mobile reception. The Federal Communications Commission will conduct an economic study on the impact of low-power FM stations on full-service commercial FM stations. A report will be submitted to relevant committees within a year. This study will not affect the licensing of new low-power FM stations. The Federal Communications Commission will conduct an economic study on the impact of low-power FM stations on full-service commercial FM stations. A report will be submitted to relevant committees within a year. This study will not affect the licensing of new low-power FM stations. Attest: LORRAINE C. MILLER, Clerk."
