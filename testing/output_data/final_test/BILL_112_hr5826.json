    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Coordinating Water Research for a Clean Water Future Act of 2012\" and establishes a National Water Research and Development Initiative. The \"Coordinating Water Research for a Clean Water Future Act of 2012\" mandates the implementation of a National Water Research and Development Initiative within 90 days. The Initiative aims to set goals, priorities, and metrics for federal water research, invest in related research activities, and coordinate interagency efforts in water research and development. Key activities include researching systematic water management methods. The curr_chunk focuses on conducting research to collect data on water resources, develop technologies for reliable water supply, enhance water quality, and assist water resource managers in planning for future water availability. It also includes research on barriers to sustainable water resource use. The Council oversees research on water-related ecosystems, invasive species, chemical contaminants, energy requirements for water supplies, and funding opportunities for minority serving institutions. The Council oversees the planning, management, and coordination of the Initiative, establishing goals and priorities based on national needs, coordinating federal activities related to water, and developing reports and plans. The Council oversees the planning, management, and coordination of the Initiative, establishing goals and priorities based on national needs, coordinating federal activities related to water, and developing reports and plans. Through the Coordination Office, public input and outreach are integrated into the Initiative, including workshops. The Council submits the Annual National Water Research Report to Congress annually, considering information from various stakeholders in its development. The report includes the Initiative budget for each participating Federal agency and the proposed coordinated Initiative. The curr_chunk provides an analysis of the progress made towards achieving the goals and priorities of the Initiative, as well as the incorporation of recommendations from the Advisory Committee and the public. It also includes the proposed coordinated Initiative budget for the next fiscal year. The curr_chunk focuses on program coordination. The President will establish a National Water Research Coordination Office with a Director and staff to provide support to the Council and Advisory Committee, act as a contact point for water research activities, and conduct public outreach. The National Water Research Coordination Office will conduct research activities, provide recommendations through a publicly accessible website, solicit input from stakeholders, and promote early application of innovations. Funding for the office will be supported by contributions from each agency. The Coordination Office will be funded by contributions from each agency on the Council, in proportion to their share of the total budget for the Initiative. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will report to Congress on the funding requirements, existing funding mechanisms, and actions taken to ensure stable funding within 180 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The National Water Research Initiative Advisory Committee shall be established with members primarily from academic institutions, industry, nongovernmental institutions, and regional, State, local, and tribal governments, appointed by the President based on qualifications to provide advice on water research and technology development. Recommendations from Congress, industry, and the scientific community may be considered in appointing members. The National Water Research Initiative Advisory Committee, composed of members from various sectors, advises the President and Council on water research and development trends, progress, revisions, funding levels, and goals to maintain a reliable water supply. The National Water Research Initiative Advisory Committee advises on workforce, management, and addressing concerns of governments to maintain a reliable water supply in the US. Reports are submitted every 3 years with recommendations for improvement. The Advisory Committee must submit reports every 3 years, and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will send copies to Congress. Non-Federal members may receive travel expenses while serving on the Committee. The Advisory Committee members who are officers or employees of the United States are not allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence. Section 14 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to the Advisory Committee. SEC. 5. NATIONAL WATER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIC PLAN. The Council, with the assistance of the Coordination Office, must develop a 5-year National Water Research and Development Strategic Plan within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The plan will be updated every 3 years and will prioritize research activities related to enhancing reliable and clean water supply systems. It will also specify goals, timeframes for achieving them, and metrics for assessing progress. The Initiative aims to foster the transfer of research results into new technologies for societal benefit through collaborations with various government levels. It encourages interdisciplinary research in water availability and quality technology, addresses long-term regional challenges, and prioritizes innovative projects with significant societal and ecological returns. The Strategic Plan for water research aims to strengthen development, technology transfer, and education programs, attract more women and minorities to pursue water-related degrees, and consider input from stakeholders and the Advisory Committee. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will report the Strategic Plan to Congress. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for key terms such as Advisory Committee, Annual Report, Coordination Office, Council, Initiative, and Institution of higher education. The curr_chunk provides definitions for key terms such as \"institution of higher education,\" \"minority serving institutions,\" and \"Strategic Plan\" in relation to the National Water Research and Development Strategic Plan."
