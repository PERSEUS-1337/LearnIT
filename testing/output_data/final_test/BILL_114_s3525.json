    "content": "The \"Strengthening American Transportation Security Act of 2016\" includes sections on short title, findings, definitions, conversion of screening personnel, transition rules, consultation requirement, no right to strike, regulations, delegations to Administrator, and authorization of appropriations. Congress found that on September 11, 2001, terrorists passed airport security and hijacked planes for a deadly attack. In response, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act was passed to improve aviation security and transfer screening to the TSA. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act established the TSA to improve screener performance through employment standards, training, and benefits. Section 111(d) authorizes the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security to manage the screening workforce. The TSA functions were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. TSA interprets authorization for Transportation Security Officers, while other employees are subject to different codes. In 2006, the Bush Administration violated labor law by prohibiting collective bargaining for Transportation Security Officers. After approval for an exclusive representative election, the Federal Labor Relations Board was involved. In February 2011, TSA Administrator John Pistole emphasized the importance of every TSA employee having a voice and feeling safe to raise concerns. However, a new determination in December 2014 imposed limitations on collective bargaining for Transportation Security Officers, restricting subjects that can be bargained and barriers to union representation. The 2011 and 2014 determinations cited TSA's authority to create a personnel system that denies Transportation Security Officers rights under title 5, including the right to appeal adverse personnel decisions, fair pay, raises, overtime guidelines, and access to earned leave. The Transportation Security Administration's personnel system lacks workplace protections for Transportation Security Officers, who secure the aviation system. Congress believes these officers should have the same protections as outlined in title 5, United States Code. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the official responsible for transportation security under the Department of Homeland Security. The term \"agency\" means an Executive agency as defined by law. The \"conversion date\" is the effective date of certain sections. A \"covered employee\" is also defined. The term \"covered employee\" refers to an employee in a covered position within the Transportation Security Administration or any position within the Department of Homeland Security related to transportation security. The term \"employee\" is defined as per section 2105 of title 5, United States Code, and the \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Homeland Security. The term \"TSA personnel management system\" refers to any personnel management system established under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act or title 49 of the United States Code. SEC. 4. CONVERSION OF SCREENING PERSONNEL. Termination of certain personnel authorities includes amendments to TSA personal management system, flexibility in employment of screener personnel, and human resources management system limitations. The amendments made by this section will apply to covered employees and positions as defined in the Strengthening American Transportation Security Act of 2016. All TSA personnel management policies will cease to be effective, and a new human resources management system will be established under title 5, United States Code. The current provision under section 9701 of title 5, United States Code, will no longer apply to covered employees and positions. Instead, they will be subject to the labor provisions under title 49, United States Code. Transition rules under section 5 will apply to covered employees and positions, subjecting them to labor provisions under title 49. The conversion of an employee from a TSA personnel management system to other provisions of law will not result in a reduction in their rate of pay. The Secretary will ensure that all service performed before the conversion date is credited for purposes of leave, pay, insurance, severance pay, tenure, and status. All accrued leave and paid leave remain available to the employee, and the Government's share of health insurance premiums stays the same while the employee is continuously employed by the Department of Homeland Security. SEC. 6. CONSULTATION REQUIREMENT. The labor organization certified by the Federal Labor Relations Authority on June 29, 2011, or successor organization is the exclusive representative of nonsupervisory personnel carrying out screening functions under section 44901 of title 49, United States Code. The Secretary must consult with the exclusive representative on plans for converting covered employees and positions under this Act. The Secretary must consult with the exclusive representative on the conversion of covered employees and positions, including the proposed conversion date and measures for compliance. The Secretary must consider any views or recommendations presented by the exclusive representative before taking final action and provide a written statement of reasons. The provisions of this section will cease to be effective as of the conversion date. SEC. 7. NO RIGHT TO STRIKE. This Act does not affect existing laws on disloyalty, loyalty, and striking. SEC. 8. REGULATIONS. The Secretary can create necessary regulations. SEC. 9. DELEGATIONS TO ADMINISTRATOR. SEC. 9. The Secretary can delegate authority to the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration. SEC. 10. Appropriations are authorized for carrying out this Act."
