    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Access to Infertility Treatment and Care Act\". Congress finds that infertility is a medical disease affecting men and women equally, with 1 in 8 couples experiencing difficulty getting pregnant. Infertility does not discriminate based on race, religion, sexuality, or economic status. Approximately one-third of infertility is attributed to the female partner, one-third to the male partner, and one-third to a combination of both partners or is unexplained. Infertility affects individuals with health complications like cancer patients undergoing treatments that harm reproductive organs. Causes include endocrine disorders, structural issues, exposure to diseases, and genetic factors. Recent improvements in therapy and cryopreservation have made pregnancy possible for more people. Infertility and its treatments should be covered by health insurance, as not all employers provide coverage for infertility services.
