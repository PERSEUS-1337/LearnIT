    "content": "The \"Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2006\" may be cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. Congress findings reveal that over 203,000 children in the US are abducted by family members annually, with motives often driven by revenge. These children suffer emotional, psychological, and physical abuse, forced to leave behind everything familiar to them. Children who are victims of family abductions face emotional manipulation, fear of discovery, denial of education and healthcare, and are classified as victims of child abuse. Many law enforcement agencies lack guidelines for handling family abductions. The recovery of an abducted child is crucial in the first few hours of a family abduction. Law enforcement must be prepared to employ effective techniques to locate and recover abducted children. Counseling and education for parents can greatly reduce the incidence of family abductions. Flagging school records has proven to be an effective tool for law enforcement to find abducted children. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"family abduction\" refers to the taking, keeping, or concealing of a child by a parent or family member, preventing lawful custody or visitation rights. \"Flagging\" is the process of notifying authorities of a person requesting school records of an abducted child. \"Indian tribe\" includes any organized group or community, including Alaska Native entities. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) recognizes Alaska Natives as eligible for special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians. The term \"State\" includes several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, any U.S. territory or possession, and any Indian tribe. SEC. 4. GRANTS TO STATES. The Attorney General will provide grants to States for projects related to family abduction, including extradition, investigation, training of law enforcement, outreach campaigns, and flagging school records. Non-Federal sources must cover at least 50% of project costs. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for carrying out the Act includes $500,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 and 2010."
