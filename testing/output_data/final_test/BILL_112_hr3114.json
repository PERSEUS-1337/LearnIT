    "content": "The \"Civic Justice Corps Act of 2011\" aims to provide educational and work opportunities for disadvantaged youth and young adults through service organizations. The Congress finds that over 500,000 juvenile court cases in the US result in incarceration or probation daily, costing states an average of $240.99 per day per young person in a juvenile facility. States spend nearly $6 billion annually on youth incarceration, with imprisoned youth being 50% more likely to reoffend than those in their communities. Additionally, almost 70% of youth in residential facilities have committed nonviolent offenses and could be managed safely in their communities. The most effective programs for youth focus on reducing recidivism rates and promoting positive outcomes within communities. In the US, there are over 150 service and conservation corps providing educational and economic opportunities to 30,000 young people annually. The Civic Justice Corps Model uses community service projects to deliver life skills, education, and workforce readiness. The Civic Justice Corps Model provides life skills, education, workforce readiness, and support services to formerly incarcerated youth aged 16-25. Data shows an 80% post-program placement rate and 11% recidivism rate, lower than the national average of 50-70%. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Civic Justice Corps Model\" in this Act refers to programs that recruit court-involved, previously incarcerated, and disadvantaged youth aged 16-25. These programs provide educational support leading to a high school diploma or equivalent, career planning, workforce readiness, and work experience for unsubsidized employment or postsecondary education. The Civic Justice Corps Model programs offer career pathways, industry-recognized credentials, and supportive services to court-involved youth. They engage participants in community service projects to develop life skills and foster civic engagement. Additionally, they establish relationships with local agencies, employers, and boards to provide appropriate opportunities for participants. The Civic Justice Corps Model programs provide career pathways, credentials, and support to court-involved youth. Participants engage in community service projects to develop life skills and civic engagement. Employers offer post-program placements, require a minimum of 6 months enrollment, and provide 12 months of post-program support. Data collection for 12 months post-program completion is mandatory, and sustainability plans must be in place after the grant expires. Local subgrantees are selected by national intermediaries to implement the program. The Civic Justice Corps program requires an intermediary to demonstrate local need, recruit court-involved youth aged 16-25, provide education and workforce development, have relationships with justice agencies. The Civic Justice Corps program requires an intermediary with relationships with local boards, employers, data collection abilities, and a sustainability plan. A national intermediary is defined as a national nonprofit organization with experience in program development and administration. The intermediary for the Civic Justice Corps program must have experience in developing and administering community service programs for disadvantaged youth, ability to select diverse local subgrantees, provide training and technical assistance, and collect performance data for reporting. The term \"service and conservation corps\" refers to any State or local corps, including those under national service laws, that provide annual reports to the Attorney General. SEC. 5. CIVIC JUSTICE CORPS GRANTS. The Attorney General awards grants to national intermediaries for Civic Justice Corps programs administered by local subgrantees in diverse locations. Grants and subgrants are for a 3-year period. National intermediaries must make subgrants to local subgrantees to implement the Civil Justice Corps Model. The grant under this section reserves 90% for subgrants to local subgrantees and 10% for training and technical assistance. Subgrantees must use funds for a Civic Justice Corps program implementing the model, including educational programming and support such as basic instruction, language instruction, and secondary education services. The curr_chunk focuses on providing drop-out prevention, tutoring, postsecondary education access, work readiness training, job-specific skills development, and job search assistance.

Each national intermediary receiving a grant under this Act must submit an annual report to the Attorney General, including performance measures reported by subgrantees. Subgrantees must report on participant progress, such as obtaining a high school diploma or industry-recognized credential, and post-program placement in unsubsidized employment. The annual report must include performance measures on participant progress in areas such as unsubsidized employment, postsecondary education, apprenticeships, job training, and career pathway programs. Additionally, post-program recidivism rates must be reported. Authorization of appropriations for this section includes $20,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2012 to 2018."
