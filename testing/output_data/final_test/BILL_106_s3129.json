The Secretary must certify to congressional committees that the Comptroller General has access to necessary information for auditing the Bank and the Fund.

The Fund is implementing policies for the suspension of financing if funds are diverted and to ensure funds are used for their intended purpose. Additionally, there are policies in place to measure progress towards graduation from receiving financing on concessionary terms. Policies for Fund financing focus on catalyzing private sector investment, disbursing funds based on specific reforms, promoting open markets, and prioritizing short-term assistance. The Fund focuses on short-term balance of payments financing and policies to measure progress towards graduation from receiving concessionary financing.
