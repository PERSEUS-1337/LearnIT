Mercury in dental amalgams, often called \"silver fillings\", contains 42 to 58 percent mercury. Consumers may be misled by the term \"silver\" as these fillings have more mercury than silver. The American Dental Association estimates that 70,000,000 dental amalgams are placed annually, each containing 1/2 to 3/4 gram of mercury. The mercury in dental amalgam is emitted as vapor, with the amount released depending on various factors. When inhaled, most of the mercury enters the bloodstream and accumulates in the brain and kidneys. Mercury toxicity builds up over years of exposure from various sources. Recently funded research by the National Institutes of Health found that inorganic mercury in brain tissue does not decrease over time, leading to a permanent increase in mercury body burden from dental amalgam exposure. The World Health Organization estimates daily intake of mercury from dental amalgam is higher than all other sources combined. California Dental Association requires warnings about mercury fillings in dental offices. The use of dental amalgam, which contains mercury, poses risks of birth defects and reproductive harm, especially for children and pregnant women. Health authorities have issued warnings about the dangers of mercury in dental fillings. Exposure to mercury from dental amalgam poses risks to pregnant women and newborns. Studies show that mercury can pass through the placenta and breast milk, increasing health risks for unborn children. The National Academy of Sciences estimates that over 600,000 children are at risk for neurodevelopmental effects due to in utero exposure to mercury. Bacteria in the body can methylate mercury, transforming mercury vapor from fillings. The use of mercury in dental fillings is opposed by health groups due to its transformation into highly toxic methylmercury. Effective alternatives exist but are not widely available in health plans. Mercury wastewater from dental clinics is considered hazardous waste by the EPA. The discharge of waste dental mercury into the environment can lead to methylmercury contamination in fish, posing a risk to human health. Numerous states and territories have issued fish consumption advisories due to mercury contamination, and the FDA has warned against consuming certain marine fish. According to the EPA, US dentists use 34 tons of mercury annually. A report by multiple organizations highlighted dental offices as the top source of mercury in wastewater due to mercury fillings. Mercury from dental amalgam can enter the environment at various stages, including placement, removal, bodily excretions, incineration of sewage sludge, and vapor release during activities like brushing or consuming hot foods. In 2000, human wastes from individuals with dental amalgam fillings were reported as the most significant source of domestic mercury entering treatment works, costing millions for removal. Mercury use by the dental industry increased significantly from 1980 to 2001. No requirements for mercury capture during cremation currently exist. The United States saw a decrease in mercury use by other industries in 2001. Amalgam restorations accounted for 55% of total mercury product reservoir in 2004. Approximately 238 pounds of mercury, mainly from dental fillings, were released from crematoria in 1999. Cremation is chosen in about 30% of deaths and is expected to increase annually. Dental offices show 6 to 16% exceeding air exposure levels. \"Dental offices exceed air mercury exposure levels set by OSHA standards.\" SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON INTRODUCTION OF DENTAL AMALGAM INTO INTERSTATE COMMERCE. Effective January 1, 2009, dental fillings containing mercury are prohibited under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Devices with mercury for dental fillings must be labeled as containing a highly toxic element and should not be used on children under 18, pregnant women, or lactating women."
