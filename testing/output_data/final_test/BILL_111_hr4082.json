    "content": "Authorization and determination of benefits for affected participants. The Secretary of Energy will establish a program to pay affected participants a one-time lump sum determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may procure necessary information for this program. An affected participant is defined under the USEC Privatization Act. The Secretary will pay affected participants a one-time lump sum based on the actuarial present value of their accrued benefits under the pension plan. The payment is determined by the ratio of the participant's benefits to the total recoverable amount. The total recoverable amount is calculated as the excess of the present value of benefits that would have been accrued by affected participants under the pension plan if no transfer had occurred, over the present value of benefits accrued by all affected participants. The Secretary will determine payments under this section based on benefits accrued and accruable under the pension plans involved in the transfer under the USEC Privatization Act. The Secretary will provide pro rata reductions in payment amounts to affected participants to adjust for amounts provided in appropriation Acts for the program under subsection (a). The Secretary may make findings of facts and decisions on participant rights for payments under this section. Regulations must be issued within 60 days of the Act's enactment, requiring applicants to consent to information release. Public notice will be given to potential payment recipients, and applications must be submitted within 240 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary must make timely payments to affected participants within 180 days of their application submission.

The Secretary must make timely payments to affected participants within 180 days of their application submission. Participants can request a hearing within 60 days of receiving notice of the Secretary's decision. The Secretary is authorized to hold hearings and conduct investigations as necessary. Judicial review is available to affected participants. Any affected participant can seek a review of the Secretary's final decision through a civil action within 60 days of receiving notice. The action must be filed in the district court where the participant resides or has a principal place of business. The court in the District of Columbia can enter a judgment on the Secretary's decision, which can be affirmed, modified, or reversed. The judgment is final but can be reviewed like other civil actions. Any action under this section will continue even if the Secretary changes. The Secretary is responsible for all payments and costs under this section, as well as answering questions from participants and applicants. Employers are not liable for communication, payments, or calculations. No third party liability is imposed by this section.
