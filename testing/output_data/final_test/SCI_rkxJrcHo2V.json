Human babies learn language with adult guidance, but current machine learning methods are not data efficient for this task. The goal is to develop an algorithm that can learn human language with minimal human interactions. In this paper, the Learning to Learn to Communicate (L2C) approach is proposed to train a meta-learning agent in simulation to interact with pre-trained agents with distinct communication protocols. The meta-learning agent can quickly adapt to different populations of agents, including humans, showing promise in preliminary experiments in a Lewis signaling game. Trained with L2C, agents can learn human language faster. The approach involves training a meta-learning agent in simulation to interact with pre-trained agents with different communication protocols. This allows the agent to adapt quickly to new populations, including those speaking human language, through Seeded Self-Play (S2P) technique. Agents trained with L2C and Seeded Self-Play (S2P) require fewer samples to learn a compositional language in a Lewis signaling game. Understanding language is crucial for artificial agents to achieve goals, and one approach is through emergent communication, where agents learn to use language to perform tasks in the real world. Emergent communication explores transferring communication protocols to human language learning. Current approaches use auxiliary tasks, but it's uncertain if this scales to complex concepts. Human-in-the-loop training is effective for language learning agents, similar to how babies acquire language. However, recent research suggests current algorithms are too sample inefficient for effective language learning. The paper introduces the Learning to Learn to Communicate (L2C) framework to address the sample inefficiency in current algorithms for language learning. The goal is to train agents to quickly learn new languages by leveraging meta-learning and available compute resources. Agents interact with an external environment to ground the language, making the training process more efficient. The Learning to Learn to Communicate (L2C) framework allows agents to quickly adapt to different populations of pre-trained agents with unique communication protocols. This meta-learning approach enables agents to interact with environments and learn grounded language, facilitating tasks involving language simulation. The framework also enables agents to both speak and listen, providing a more comprehensive language learning experience compared to traditional instruction following methods. The L2C framework shows promise in training agents to learn human language from few interactions. It consists of three main phases: training agent populations, training a meta-learner on these populations, and testing the meta-learner's ability. The L2C framework involves training agent populations, training a meta-learner, and testing its ability to learn new languages, either artificial or human. Phase 1 can be achieved through supervised learning or reinforcement learning. Each 'task' has its own emergent language, and Phase 3 involves interacting with humans using RL. Refer to Section 6 for a detailed discussion of the phases. Seeded self-play (S2P) is a technique for training agents in simulation to develop complex behaviors. Data is collected from a fixed seed population, representing the number of human demonstrations. Agents are trained through imitation-learning and then fine-tuned by deploying them against each other to solve tasks via emergent communication. The language used during communication is kept close to the original language of the fixed seed. Seeded self-play (S2P) involves training agents through imitation-learning and fine-tuning them to solve tasks via emergent communication. A referential game is constructed with a speaker and a listener describing and reconstructing objects using symbolic representations. The game is cooperative and involves describing objects with specific properties using one-hot vectors. The speaker uses symbolic representations to describe objects with specific properties using one-hot vectors. A compositional language is developed programmatically to simulate human language without the need for human testing. The speaker uses symbolic representations to describe objects with specific properties using one-hot vectors. They develop a compositional language programmatically called compositional bots (CBs). The message produced by the speaker is a sequence of categorical random variables discretized using Gumbel-Softmax. Training is done using Cross Entropy and Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. Initial experiments involve a meta-learning listener. In Section 5, L2C experiments were conducted to analyze factors affecting performance. The goal is to transfer learning a human language with minimal interactions. Success is measured by the number of samples needed for the meta-learner to reach 95% performance on a test population. Various meta-learning algorithms were tested. In Section 5, L2C experiments were conducted to analyze factors affecting performance in training a meta-listener for human language transfer. Various meta-learning algorithms were tested, including randomly initialized agent, pre-trained agent, Reptile algorithm, and FOMAML. FOMAML showed significant improvement over random initialization when enough training populations were available. Different listener parameterizations were also explored, with the best results achieved using FOMAML with an LSTM model. The best results were obtained with an over-parameterized linear model using FOMAML. Increasing the number of training populations improved performance, while too few populations led to overfitting. Models trained with L2C required fewer samples to generalize to test populations, prompting further exploration to reduce sample requirements. The study explored improving sample efficiency in training populations of agents using Seeded self-play (S2P) instead of L2C. By collecting seed data from a single compositional bot and partitioning it into train and test sets, the number of samples required was reduced from 60 to 20. Future work includes training the meta-agent via RL, exploring joint speaker-listener training, and scaling L2C to more complex tasks involving grounded language learning. The study aims to scale L2C training to more complex tasks like the Talk the Walk dataset involving agents navigating New York using language. Challenges remain for the L2C framework, especially in training agents to solve tasks and learning communication protocols in multiagent RL settings. This can be addressed by assuming differentiable environments or seeding populations. In Phase 2, the key question is how a small number of updates can help a meta-agent learn a new language. The agent doesn't need to fully learn the language in a few updates, but rather improve on the language-task to provide a useful training signal to the meta-learner. The algorithm can improve performance by taking multiple gradient steps at test time, even if trained with a single inner gradient step. Providing a dataset of agent interactions for each population can also enhance meta-learner performance. Generalizing to learn a human language depends on the similarity and diversity of training populations, with properties like compositionality being important for transfer. The importance of compositionality in training populations for transferring to human languages is highlighted. Progress has been made in transferring robots from simulation to the real world using domain randomization, improving learner robustness. Future work should focus on examining the properties of trained population languages for meta-learner generalization to human language."
