    "content": "The \"Parents as First Teachers Act of 1997\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The Congress recognizes the critical impact of experiences in the first 3 years of a child's life on brain development, preparing them for future challenges. High-quality child care services reduce the need for special education and grade retention. According to research, children who receive high-quality child care are less likely to require special education, repeat a grade, or engage in antisocial behavior as they grow up. A significant number of children under 5 are in non-parental care while their mothers work, with a majority of mothers with young children working outside the home. Demand for child care services in low-income communities is expected to increase significantly by 2002. The enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 is expected to increase the number of qualified early childhood education providers, reduce dependency on state assistance programs, and improve access to high-quality child care services for children. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to grant funds to eligible counties for programs that provide training in early childhood development and education to parents receiving state assistance under the Social Security Act. The grants also cover supportive services and job placement for parents to help them secure employment in high-quality child care services. Eligibility for these grants is outlined in Section 4. To receive a grant under section 3, a county must submit an application with an assurance of an established administrative committee including representatives from agencies responsible for workforce development, human services, training, employment services, and public education. The county must establish an administrative committee with representatives from various agencies, including public education, higher education, and child care providers. The committee must provide information on its members and how it will administer the program, including selecting parents from families receiving assistance under State programs.
