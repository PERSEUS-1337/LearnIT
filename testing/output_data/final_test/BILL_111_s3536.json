    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Securing Aircraft From Explosives Responsibly: Advanced Imaging Recognition Act of 2010\" or \"SAFER AIR Act of 2010\". Congress found that on December 25, 2009, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to detonate an undetectable explosive aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253. Advanced imaging technology can detect nonmetallic explosives like plastic explosives. Despite the attempted attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009, advanced imaging technology has not been fully deployed in the United States or abroad. The Department of Homeland Security plans to deploy 950 additional units by fiscal year 2011 for use at commercial airports. Other detection technologies can complement advanced imaging technology units. The Department of Homeland Security plans to increase efforts to address privacy concerns and conduct additional testing of advanced imaging technology for airport security. The Department of Homeland Security aims to standardize images from advanced imaging technology, remove personal identifiers, and upgrade equipment for detecting new threats without major costs. The United States policy is to develop and deploy primary screening technologies at airport checkpoints to detect threats to aviation travel. Advanced technology is used for screening aircraft passengers. The United States policy aims to deploy advanced technology for screening aircraft passengers to detect threats. Section 44901 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to ensure the timely deployment of advanced imaging technology and other technologies capable of detecting weapons and explosives for passenger screening. The Secretary of Homeland Security must certify to Congress that the Department has the capacity to deploy advanced technology at airport checkpoints to detect explosives and weapons by 2013. The Secretary of Homeland Security must certify to Congress that advanced technology, including advanced imaging technology or other approved technology, can detect weapons and explosives comparable to or better than advanced imaging technology. The Secretary of Homeland Security must certify to Congress that advanced technology can detect weapons and explosives. All primary screening of passengers must use advanced imaging technology or another approved advanced technology, with an alternative screening method available for passengers with privacy concerns. The alternative option for primary screening provided to passengers includes passing through a metal detector and undergoing a pat-down search or screening using other methods approved by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Passengers must be provided with information regarding the screening process. The advanced imaging technology used by the Department of Homeland Security at airport checkpoints detects nonmetallic explosives and provides privacy protections for passengers, including nonretention of images. Passengers are also given an alternative option for primary screening, such as passing through a metal detector or undergoing a pat-down search. Security at an airport checkpoint must ensure that images produced by equipment cannot be stored, transferred, copied, or printed, and must be permanently removed from the screen after the passenger is cleared. The Secretary of Homeland Security is responsible for ensuring that all facial features on a passenger's image are blurred when using advanced imaging technology for screening. Passenger images from advanced imaging technology must be standardized for threat detection, with nonstandardized images transferred securely to prevent public exposure. Cameras are prohibited in the presence of personal or nonstandardized images. The Department of Homeland Security prohibits the presence of cameras or cell phones when viewing passenger images from advanced imaging technology. Communication among employees must be done using wireless headsets to prevent image transmission. The Department of Homeland Security is required to submit reports to Congress every 2 years on the implementation of measures to detect on-body plastic explosives and other nonmetallic threats at airport checkpoints. The Department of Homeland Security must report to Congress every 2 years on the implementation and effectiveness of primary screening using advanced imaging technology and other advanced technology in combating threats. This includes estimating the percentage of passengers choosing advanced screening options versus alternative options provided. The Department of Homeland Security must report to Congress every 2 years on the implementation and effectiveness of primary screening using advanced imaging technology and other advanced technology in combating threats. This includes estimating the percentage of passengers choosing advanced screening options versus alternative options provided. The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a study and submit a report on the costs of carrying out this subsection, including technology procurement, airport construction, and training. The Department of Homeland Security is required to report to Congress every 2 years on the use of advanced imaging technology and other advanced technology for screening at airports. The definition of advanced imaging technology includes devices that create visual images of individuals to detect narcotics, explosives, and weapons components. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of terms related to airport security screening, such as airport checkpoint, pat-down search, and primary screening. These definitions are important for understanding the procedures followed by the Transportation Security Administration. The curr_chunk discusses screening technologies used at airport checkpoints to detect weapons, explosives, narcotics, or other unlawful actions to determine passenger clearance for boarding an aircraft. Development of new screening technologies for aviation security is encouraged, with authorization of necessary appropriations for implementation."
