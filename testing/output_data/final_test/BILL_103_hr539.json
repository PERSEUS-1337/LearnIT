The Investment Tax Incentive Act of 1993 amends Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code to allow a deduction adjustment for tangible property placed in service after December 31, 1992. The Investment Tax Incentive Act of 1993 amends Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code to allow a deduction adjustment for tangible property placed in service after December 31, 1992. For purposes of the deduction adjustment, the applicable neutral cost recovery ratio is determined by dividing the gross national product deflator for the calendar quarter ending in the taxable year by the deflator for the quarter when the property was placed in service. The applicable neutral cost recovery ratio for tangible property placed in service is calculated by multiplying a number by 1.035 to the power of the number of full years since the property was placed in service. The ratio is rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent and is only considered if it is greater than 1. The gross national product deflator is used for tax purposes, and taxpayers can elect not to apply this subsection to their property. In addition, a neutral cost recovery ratio is used for tangible property placed in service after December 31, 1992, calculated based on the number of full years since the property was placed in service. The deduction allowable for property placed in service after December 31, 1992, is determined by multiplying the amount allowable without this provision by the applicable neutral cost recovery ratio. This provision does not apply if there is an election not to have the cost recovery ratio apply. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1992. SEC. 3. Repeal of special depreciation rules under the adjusted current earnings provisions of the minimum tax. The depreciation deduction for property after December 31, 1992, will be the same as the deduction for alternative minimum taxable income.

The deduction for lost basis recovered over 5 years starting from the first month of the taxpayer's first taxable year after December 31, 1992, is allowed ratably.

The amendment applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1992, and allows for the deduction of lost basis recovered over 5 years starting from the taxpayer's first taxable year. The lost basis is the excess of the aggregate adjusted bases of depreciable property held by the taxpayer."
