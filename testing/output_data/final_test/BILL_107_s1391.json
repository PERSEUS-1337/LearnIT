    "content": "The \"SAFE Grant Act of 2001\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section is included in the Act. Congress finds that over 300,000 women are sexually assaulted each year in the United States, with rape not declining in frequency. Most victims seek treatment in hospital emergency rooms, where they may wait hours for care, leading some to leave without receiving help. Emergency room personnel often lack training in collecting forensic evidence and providing necessary care for sexual assault victims. Many hospitals lack up-to-date forensic tools for sexual assault victims, leading to delays in treatment. Some emergency room staff avoid treating these victims due to fear of involvement in legal proceedings. Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners (SAFEs) under the SAFE program provide prompt and specialized care for victims. Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners (SAFEs) provide specialized care for sexual assault victims, focusing on evidence collection using the latest forensic techniques and equipment to aid in prosecuting assailants. SAFE programs in the United States face financial obstacles in obtaining necessary funding for proper preservation and cooperation with law enforcement. Despite their specialized training, only a small percentage of sexual assault victims are treated by the approximately 500 SAFE programs nationwide. These programs struggle to compete for limited Federal funding against other law enforcement and victims' programs. Establishing Federal funding for SAFE programs will help them grow, aiding in prosecuting offenders and improving care for victims. Establishing a grant program for SAFE programs will support their growth and enhance efforts to prosecute offenders and provide better care for victims. The Attorney General will establish a grant program to award annual grants to SAFE programs that comply with national standards. Programs must submit an application with required information to be eligible for a grant. The Attorney General will prioritize grants for SAFE programs serving underserved populations and conduct audits to ensure compliance with national standards. The Attorney General prioritizes grants for SAFE programs serving underserved populations and conducts audits to ensure compliance with national standards. $10,000,000 is authorized for grants under this section for fiscal years 2002 through 2006. Compliance with national protocol, federal laws, and program effectiveness are required for grants awarded and disbursed."
