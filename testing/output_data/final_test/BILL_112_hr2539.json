    "content": "The Act titled \"National Youth Summer Jobs Act of 2011\" provides grants for summer jobs for out-of-school youth programs. The Secretary of Labor awards competitive grants to local governments for summer job placement of out-of-school youths. Eligible entities must apply and use funds for employment and job readiness activities. An eligible entity with an existing youth summer jobs program can use a grant to expand job training and support services, including health and nutrition referral, housing referral, financial literacy, and basic daily living skills instruction. The Secretary gives preference to entities in communities with higher than national average rates of high school dropout, poverty, or juvenile offender rates between 2002 and 2007. The Secretary gives additional preference to eligible entities in communities with higher than national average rates of poverty, juvenile offender, unemployment, and industry-depletion rates between 2002 and 2007 when awarding grants. Grants awarded under this section have a minimum duration of 5 years, with the grant amount determined by the Secretary. Grant recipients are limited to one grant at a time. The eligible entity must return any unspent grant funds within 30 days after the grant term ends. Reports on the grant-funded program's impact on out-of-school youths must be submitted annually to the Secretary. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on the effectiveness of grant-funded programs for out-of-school youths, assessing their impact on General Education Development attainment and job placement. Definitions include \"eligible youth\" as individuals aged 14-22 and \"out-of-school youth\" as those enrolled in secondary school or basic-skills deficient, unemployed, or underemployed. Authorization of Appropriations: The Secretary of Labor is authorized to appropriate the following amounts for grants under this section: $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2012, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2013, $40,000,000 for fiscal year 2014, $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2015, $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2016, and $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2017."
