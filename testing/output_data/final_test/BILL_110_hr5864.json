    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Vieques Bioluminescent Bay Conservation Act of 2008\". The island of Vieques, Puerto Rico, is known for its natural beauty, including bioluminescent bays like Puerto Mosquito Bay, which is one of the brightest in the world due to the presence of the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense. The unique properties of the bay, such as water quality and mangroves, support a high density of this bioluminescent organism. Puerto Mosquito Bay in Puerto Rico is ecologically, culturally, scientifically, educationally, and economically valuable. Its bioluminescence creates local pride and attracts visitors, but increasing popularity poses a threat to its fragile ecosystem. Action is needed to provide comprehensive protection for Puerto Mosquito Bay to maintain its unique ecological, cultural, and economic value. Cooperation between the Federal Government and the Government of Puerto Rico is essential to protect both terrestrial and marine areas surrounding the bay. Consideration should be given to designating Puerto Mosquito Bay as a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization Biosphere. Designating Puerto Mosquito Bay as a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization Biosphere Reserve would enhance research, management, and education through international cooperation, complementing its potential designation as a National Marine Sanctuary. The United States aims to protect Puerto Mosquito Bay in Puerto Rico, focusing on preserving its natural resources and unique bioluminescent organisms. The Act's purposes include safeguarding the bay, educating the public about its environment, using science for monitoring and management, and regulating human activities in the designated National Marine Sanctuary. The Puerto Mosquito Bay National Marine Sanctuary is designated under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972. It includes submerged lands and waters of Puerto Mosquito Bay. The Governor of Puerto Rico can object to the designation within 45 days, which would prevent it from taking effect in that area. The Governor of Puerto Rico can object to the management plan or regulations within 45 days, which would prevent them from taking effect in the Puerto Mosquito Bay National Marine Sanctuary. If the Secretary believes the Governor's action will hinder the goals of the Act, the entire designation can be terminated. The Secretary must notify Senate and House committees 30 days before terminating the Sanctuary designation. Boundary modifications can be made in consultation with the Governor of Puerto Rico, if needed, and must be reported to the committees. SEC. 5. COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT PLAN. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with relevant authorities, must develop a comprehensive management plan within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The plan should allow for public and private uses of the Sanctuary while prioritizing resource protection and defining enforcement responsibilities between Federal and State entities. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with relevant authorities, must develop a comprehensive management plan within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The plan should identify needs for research, establish a long-term ecological monitoring program, identify potential threats to the Sanctuary, find alternative funding sources, ensure coordination between authorities, and promote education on mangrove conservation and water quality concerns. The Secretary of Commerce will involve the public in developing a comprehensive management plan for mangrove conservation and water quality concerns."
