The \"Health Care Price Transparency Promotion Act of 2016\" seeks to enhance transparency of hospital charges and offer estimates of out-of-pocket costs for health care services by amending Title XIX of the Social Security Act. The \"Health Care Price Transparency Promotion Act of 2016\" aims to improve transparency of hospital charges and provide estimates of out-of-pocket costs for health care services by requiring states to disclose hospital charges and provide access to such information, as well as mandate the provision of estimated out-of-pocket costs for future health care services. The \"Health Care Price Transparency Promotion Act of 2016\" requires states to disclose hospital charges and provide estimated out-of-pocket costs for health care services upon request by individuals with health insurance coverage. It does not mandate uniform standards for state laws or override existing state laws that meet the requirements of the Act. The \"Health Care Price Transparency Promotion Act of 2016\" prohibits states from adopting laws that modify existing laws on hospital charge disclosure, except to address unmet requirements. It also ensures that individuals' out-of-pocket costs do not exceed the estimated costs provided. The term 'health insurance coverage' and 'health insurance issuer' are defined in the Public Health Service Act. This includes Medicaid managed care organizations and Medicare Advantage organizations. State laws can still apply to Medicare Advantage organizations and plans. The term 'hospital' is defined as an institution meeting specific requirements. The amendments made by subsection (a) will take effect on October 1, 2017, except in cases where State legislation is needed for compliance. The State plan will not fail to comply with requirements solely based on not meeting additional requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's session. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is considered a separate regular session. SEC. 3. RESEARCH ON CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTHCARE COSTS.
