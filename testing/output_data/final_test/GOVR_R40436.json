    "content": "Broadband infrastructure in the United States is primarily built and maintained by private sector companies like telephone, cable, satellite, wireless, and IT firms. Various technologies like cable modem, DSL, wireless, fiber, and satellite are used for broadband deployment. Government regulations and financial assistance programs can influence private sector decisions to invest in underserved areas. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5) allocated $7.2 billion for broadband grant programs to expand infrastructure in underserved areas. NTIA and RUS administered the funds, with $4.7 billion for NTIA's Broadband Technology Opportunities Program and $2.5 billion for RUS's grant and loan programs. This initiative, unprecedented in scale, aimed to develop a national broadband strategy. The broadband provisions in the ARRA, funded by P.L. 111-5, aimed to create jobs through infrastructure deployment and address concerns over inadequate broadband access in rural and lower-income areas. The scale and scope of the programs presented challenges for implementation and oversight. Leadership in the House and Senate, along with the Obama transition team, planned to include a broadband component in the economic stimulus package. Numerous stakeholders proposed government support for broadband infrastructure. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocated $7.2 billion for broadband grants, with $4.7 billion to NTIA for the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) and $2.5 billion to RUS/USDA for broadband programs. President Obama signed the ARRA on February 17, 2009. The $4.7 billion allocated to NTIA for the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) included funding for a competitive broadband grant program, public computer center capacity expansion, sustainable adoption of broadband service, audits and oversight, Broadband Data Improvement Act funding, broadband inventory map development, and a national broadband plan. The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program within NTIA is authorized by Division B, Title VI of the ARRA, with specific implementation requirements and guidelines for new broadband grants. It establishes a national broadband service development program to provide access to underserved areas, improve public safety agency access, and stimulate economic growth. NTIA is directed to consult with states to identify unserved areas and allocate grant funds accordingly. The NTIA is directed to award grants to underserved areas and improve public safety agency access. The program aims to stimulate economic growth by providing access to broadband services. NTIA must coordinate with states to identify unserved areas and allocate grant funds accordingly. The program also includes non-discrimination and network interconnection obligations to promote the openness and interconnected nature of the Internet. NTIA is directed to prioritize projects that provide high-speed broadband to a wide population without specific speed thresholds for eligibility. Eligible entities include states, territories, tribes, nonprofits, and broadband services. The goal is to promote job creation and economic growth through next-generation broadband deployment. The ARRA directed NTIA to prioritize projects for broadband deployment to various entities, including socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. Grantees must complete projects within two years and demonstrate financial need for federal assistance. The $2.5 billion appropriated to RUS was designated for grant and loan programs, with no specified division between grants and loans. The ARRA allocated $2.5 billion to RUS for broadband deployment projects, with no specified division between grants and loans. Projects must prioritize rural areas without sufficient access to high-speed broadband, offer choice of providers, serve the highest proportion of rural residents without access, and demonstrate full funding and prompt completion. Borrowers of rural telephone loans receive priority for funding. The ARRA allocated $2.5 billion to RUS for broadband deployment projects, prioritizing rural areas without sufficient access to high-speed broadband. Broadband USA is the official portal for applying for ARRA broadband funding. Two rounds of funding were announced, with the second round accepting applications between February 16 and March 15, 2010. The ARRA allocated $4 billion for broadband deployment projects, with applications accepted between February 16 and March 15, 2010. NTIA and RUS released the first Notice of Funds Availability (NOFA) on July 1, 2009, detailing requirements for applying for grants and loans. Funding was split between RUS Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) and NTIA Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP). Projects funded by BIP must serve at least 75% rural areas. BIP-funded projects must serve at least 75% rural areas, with specific definitions for rural, remote, unserved areas, and broadband speeds. Grants in the first round are exclusively for remote, unserved, rural areas. The first round of BIP funding offers loans and grants for projects serving non-remote and underserved rural areas, with up to 50% grant money available. To qualify as \"underserved,\" certain criteria must be met, such as lack of broadband access or low subscribership. Funding for last mile and middle mile projects totaled $2.5 billion. In the first round of funding, $2.5 billion was available for last mile and middle mile projects. Last mile projects included grants for remote unserved rural areas and loans for non-remote rural areas. Middle mile projects had loans and loan/grant combinations. Three categories of eligible projects were Broadband Infrastructure, Public Computer Centers, and Sustainable Broadband Adoption, with a reserve fund of $200 million available for augmentation or future rounds. The Broadband Infrastructure grants were available for last mile and middle mile projects serving unserved or underserved areas. The Public Computer Center category funds projects expanding public access to broadband service. The Sustainable Broadband Adoption category funds projects promoting broadband demand, especially among vulnerable populations. Applications for projects serving at least 75% rural areas were required to be submitted. Projects serving at least 75% rural areas had the option to apply to the Broadband Initiatives Program at RUS or both RUS and NTIA simultaneously. Other applications were submitted directly to the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program at NTIA. Both agencies evaluated applications based on purpose, benefits, viability, budget, and sustainability through a two-stage process. Lower scoring applications were eliminated after the first stage, with further documentation required for those advancing to the second stage. NTIA and RUS used different review processes for evaluating broadband project applications. NTIA employed volunteer expert reviewers in the first phase, while RUS relied on staff and contractors. Both agencies allowed for public input on proposed service areas before making final decisions. The Government Accountability Office identified challenges faced by NTIA and RUS in scheduling, staffing, and data management. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that NTIA and RUS face challenges in evaluating applications and awarding funds, including scheduling, staffing, and data issues. Deadlines for awarding funds may impact the thoroughness of the evaluation process, and there is a lack of funding for oversight beyond FY2010. Over 2,200 applications requested nearly $28 billion in funding for projects across all 50 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia. The first round of ARRA broadband funding saw a total of $4 billion available, with $2.275 billion awarded for 150 projects. The second round announced $4.8 billion available, split between $2.6 billion for BTOP and $2.2 billion for BIP. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, NTIA and RUS made significant changes based on public feedback. Each agency had its own NOFA, with BTOP focusing on middle mile projects and BIP on last mile projects. BTOP shifted towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure grants for anchor institutions, while BIP eliminated the \"Remote Last Mile\" category and offered a standard grant/loan combination for all projects. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, significant changes were made by NTIA and RUS based on public feedback. BIP projects must cover at least 75% rural areas without High Speed Access broadband service. Eligible BTOP projects require an eligible entity, a completed application, and a 20% nonfederal match. BIP added three new grant programs: Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, NTIA and RUS published separate Request for Proposals for various programs. NTIA received 867 applications totaling $11 billion, with requests for Comprehensive Community Infrastructure, Sustainable Broadband Adoption, and Public Computer Centers. RUS received 776 applications requesting nearly $11.2 billion, including 30 middle mile applications totaling $845.88 million. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, NTIA and RUS received a total of 1643 applications requesting $22.2 billion in federal funds. This was a decrease of 26% in the number of applications and 21% in funding compared to the first round. NTIA and RUS announced awards for 553 projects, totaling $7.5 billion in federal funding, with $6.2 billion in grants and $1.3 billion in loans. Award announcements were completed by October 1, 2010. NTIA released a NOFA for the State Broadband Data and Development Grant Program, awarding $293 million to states, territories, and DC. The program aims to gather data on broadband deployment and adoption rates to create a national broadband map by February 17, 2011. Grants will also fund data collection on broadband availability and speed, with up to $500,000 for state broadband planning. The FCC released the National Broadband Plan on March 16, 2010, outlining goals for U.S. broadband policy. The plan aims to create a high-performance America with affordable broadband available everywhere. The National Broadband Plan released by the FCC in 2010 sets six goals for U.S. broadband policy by 2020, including affordable access to high-speed internet for 100 million homes, leading in mobile innovation, and ensuring every American has access to broadband services. The National Broadband Plan, released by the FCC in 2010, sets six goals for U.S. broadband policy by 2020. These goals include ensuring the safety of the American people with a nationwide public safety network, leading in the clean energy economy with broadband usage, and maximizing innovation and investment through competition. The plan is divided into three parts, with recommendations on spectrum policy, broadband data collection, privacy, cybersecurity, and more. The National Broadband Plan, released by the FCC in 2010, sets goals for U.S. broadband policy by 2020. It includes recommendations on privacy, cybersecurity, child online safety, R&D funding, and promoting inclusion for all Americans. Part III focuses on maximizing broadband use for national priorities like healthcare and education. The National Broadband Plan, released by the FCC in 2010, outlines key areas where the government plays a significant role, including health care, education, energy, and public safety. It addresses issues such as telehealth, online learning, digital literacy, smart grid technology, cybersecurity, and public safety communications. The plan includes an implementation strategy involving the creation of an interagency Broadband Strategy Council to coordinate recommendations directed towards the Executive Branch. The National Broadband Plan calls for the FCC to quickly implement recommendations under its authority. The FCC released a Broadband Action Agenda detailing rulemakings and proceedings. The plan also includes recommendations for future assessment of BTOP projects, such as tracking program outcomes and involving experts for assessment approaches. The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) and Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) have been newly authorized and established to expand broadband loan and grant programs. The NTIA and RUS have flexibility in selecting grant recipients to meet broadband access needs. The NTIA and RUS play a significant role in shaping the BTOP program through implementation decisions. Public input was gathered through a request for information and public meetings in March 2009 to inform rules and regulations for the program. Topics included grant recipients, selection criteria, public computer center capacity, sustainable adoption of broadband service, broadband mapping, and financial contributions. The NTIA and RUS gathered public input on various topics such as sustainable adoption of broadband service, broadband mapping, and financial contributions for the BTOP program. Selected issues were addressed in the first and second NOFA released in 2009 and 2010. The purpose of BTOP is to provide broadband service to consumers in unserved and underserved areas of the US. Defining \"underserved\" and \"unserved\" areas is controversial, with factors like lack of providers, market competition, high prices, and slow speeds. The ARRA does not provide a clear definition. The ARRA does not define \"unserved\" or \"underserved\" areas for broadband service. NTIA is directed to consider increasing affordability and subscribership, providing high-speed broadband to the most users. Consultation with states is required to identify these areas, balancing policy concerns when defining \"underserved.\" The definition of \"unserved\" and \"underserved\" areas for broadband service is crucial for grant distribution. A balance must be struck to avoid excluding populations while not creating unnecessary competition for existing providers. Both BTOP and BIP use the same definitions, with \"unserved\" including areas with 10% or less households served by terrestrial broadband. The 90% threshold acknowledges some existing service while aiming to reach underserved areas. The RUS designated separate categories of \"remote\" and \"non-remote\" areas, with remote areas defined as unserved rural areas at least 50 miles from non-rural areas. For last mile projects, only remote unserved rural areas are eligible for BIP grants. The definition of \"underserved\" includes low broadband availability, adoption, and lack of higher-end broadband speeds. NTIA and RUS declined to define \"underserved\" in terms of broadband speed. In the second BTOP NOFA, NTIA and RUS did not define \"underserved\" in terms of pricing, median income, or demographic characteristics. Infrastructure projects connecting community anchor institutions no longer need to be in unserved or underserved areas. Projects serving unserved or underserved areas will receive more points during evaluation and have a higher chance of funding. In the second BIP NOFA, the definition of \"underserved\" has been removed. Eligible project service areas must lack High Speed Access broadband service in at least 50% of the area. \"Unserved\" now refers to areas without any terrestrial broadband service. The Satellite Project grants aim to provide broadband to unserved premises. Broadband is defined by minimum download and upload speeds and specific technologies. The ARRA broadband provisions are technology neutral and do not specify speed thresholds. The issue of speed thresholds is controversial as it may exclude current generation technologies suitable for some areas. Deploying next-generation speeds could lead to greater job creation and preservation. The ARRA broadband provisions are technology neutral and do not specify speed thresholds. Deploying next-generation speeds could lead to greater job creation and preservation. NTIA has the flexibility to balance constructing next-generation networks with providing broadband to unserved and underserved areas. RUS and NTIA define \"broadband service\" as two-way data transmission with advertised speeds of at least 768 kbps downstream and 200 kbps upstream. This threshold aligns with the FCC standard for minimum broadband speed and allows for cost-effective solutions. The second NOFAs for both BTOP and BIP maintain the definition of broadband service with a higher speed threshold of 5 Mbps for BIP projects. Congressional debate continues on ensuring the \"openness\" of the Internet, focusing on nondiscrimination and net neutrality. The debate over broadband network management has shifted to discussing nondiscrimination requirements for networks funded by BTOP and BIP. The ARRA directed NTIA and the FCC to establish non-discrimination and network interconnection obligations for grant recipients, aligning with FCC broadband policy principles to promote open access and consumer choice on the internet. Consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice, connect legal devices that do not harm the network, and have competition among network providers, application and service providers, and content providers. NTIA, RUS, and the FCC face the challenge of ensuring the \"openness\" of federally funded broadband networks while minimizing regulatory burdens on prospective grantees. Both BTOP and BIP require all applicants to commit to certain obligations. According to the NOFA, BTOP and BIP applicants must commit to nondiscrimination and interconnection obligations. BTOP applications are scored based on exceeding minimum requirements for interconnection and nondiscrimination. All applicants must adhere to FCC's Internet Policy Statement, not favor any lawful Internet applications, display network management policies, connect to the public Internet, offer interconnection at reasonable rates and terms. The RUS NOFA requires compliance with FCC rulings on net neutrality. BTOP grants are competitive and awarded by NTIA, with states playing a significant role in identifying unserved areas. States and municipalities can apply for broadband grants. NTIA consults with states to allocate grant funds. The ARRA specifies that NTIA shall award broadband grants to entities in each state. States are encouraged to assess community needs and aggregate demand for services. NTIA will seek advice from states in reviewing grant applications, while retaining sole authority to approve awards. Post-grant monitoring will ensure compliance with grant requirements. The NTIA will assist states in post-grant monitoring to ensure compliance with grant terms. States vary in their broadband initiatives, with some actively mapping availability and identifying underserved areas. States can recommend projects to NTIA, but final funding decisions rest with NTIA. The final decision on BTOP funding rests with NTIA, with input from states, territories, and tribal entities. States can recommend projects, but NTIA evaluates applications based on multiple factors. Eligible entities for BTOP grants include states, territories, tribal entities, nonprofits, and broadband providers deemed in the public interest by NTIA. NTIA was directed to expand eligibility for BTOP grants to include private sector for-profit broadband providers. The intent was to allow as many entities as possible to apply, such as wireless carriers, wireline carriers, backhaul providers, satellite carriers, public-private partnerships, and tower companies. NTIA found it in the public interest to include for-profit corporations and non-profit entities in the eligibility criteria for BTOP grants. This decision was based on the expertise of for-profit corporations in deploying and operating telecommunications facilities. For-profit corporations are eligible for RUS grants, loans, and loan/grant combinations. There is a need for more detailed broadband data in the United States to effectively direct broadband assistance to areas with the greatest need. The ARRA designated $350 million for funding broadband data. The ARRA allocated $350 million for the Broadband Data Improvement Act, signed into law in 2008, to develop a national broadband inventory map. It requires collecting demographic information on unserved areas, comparing broadband service internationally, studying data metrics, and providing grants for state broadband initiatives. NTIA was directed to create a comprehensive nationwide inventory map of broadband service in the US. The ARRA allocated $350 million for the Broadband Data Improvement Act to develop a national inventory map of broadband service in the US. The NTIA is directed to make the map available online in an interactive and searchable form within two years. Balancing the need for detailed broadband deployment data with protecting proprietary information from providers is a continuing issue. The ARRA required transparency in the use of grant funds for broadband programs, with reports to be submitted regularly. Nondisclosure agreements may be used to protect confidentiality, but grant recipients must still provide data to NTIA. There is a focus on evaluating and monitoring programs to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. The ARRA mandated transparency in broadband grant fund usage, with NTIA oversight. NTIA must report every 90 days to various committees on grant status. Grant recipients must submit quarterly reports on fund usage and progress. NTIA can establish additional reporting requirements and deobligate funds for poor performance or misuse. The ARRA mandated transparency in broadband grant fund usage, with NTIA oversight. NTIA must report every 90 days to various committees on grant status. Grant recipients must submit quarterly reports on fund usage and progress. NTIA can establish additional reporting requirements and deobligate funds for poor performance or misuse. NTIA is directed to create a searchable database containing information on grant applicants, recipients, and funds awarded. Both the first and second NOFAs implement ARRA requirements for transparency and program evaluation. The ARRA mandates transparency in broadband grant fund usage, requiring RUS and NTIA to publicly list grant applicants, recipients, and funds awarded. The $7.2 billion broadband programs are significant, with potential impacts on job creation and infrastructure improvement. Policy decisions by NTIA, RUS, and the FCC will influence program implementation and goal achievement. The ARRA broadband provisions are part of a broader national broadband strategy. Key issues to be addressed in a national broadband strategy include universal service fund reform, spectrum policies for wireless broadband, and balancing federal assistance for underserved areas with minimizing negative effects of government intervention on competition and private sector investment."
