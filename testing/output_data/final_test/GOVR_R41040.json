    "content": "In FY2006, the federal government spent $17.7 billion on energy for buildings and vehicles, with buildings consuming 40% and vehicles 63% of the energy. Energy costs represented less than 1% of total federal spending, which was $2,655 billion. Federal energy consumption in 2006 was 1.1% of total US energy use. Advocates urge the government to reduce energy consumption to show leadership in energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) was established in 1973 to reduce energy consumption in federal buildings. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA) in 1978 initiated retrofitting federal buildings for energy efficiency. The 1985 Deficit Reduction Act authorized energy savings contracts up to 25 years. NECPA required federal agencies to report annual energy consumption and FEMP estimates carbon emissions in a report to Congress. The Federal Energy Management Improvement Act in 1988 mandated a 10% reduction in energy consumption in federal buildings by FY1995. The 1992 Energy Policy Act further amended NECPA by adopting incentives to promote energy efficiency in federal buildings, including financial bonuses for outstanding energy managers and Energy Savings Performance Contracts. Agencies were encouraged to participate in utility-offered programs to increase energy efficiency, water conservation, and electricity demand. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandated energy savings measures in federal buildings. Executive Orders directed agencies to reduce GHG emissions and set goals for energy efficiency. The relevant provisions in recent laws affecting federal energy use are available in the report's Appendix. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) assists federal agencies in implementing energy management practices and alternative financing for energy projects. Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) allow agencies to work with energy service companies (ESCOs) to improve energy efficiency without upfront costs, with the ESCO guaranteeing energy cost savings to pay for the project. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) assists federal agencies in implementing energy management practices and alternative financing for energy projects through Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC). These contracts guarantee energy cost savings to pay for the project over the contract term, with additional savings accruing to the agency after the contract ends. FEMP-streamlined \"Super ESPCs\" allow agencies to undertake multiple energy projects under the same contract to bypass procurement procedures. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scores ESPCs as future financial obligations on the federal government, reflecting how ESPCs create future commitments to appropriations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that federal agencies could achieve ESPC benefits with lower financing costs by using upfront funds. Federal agencies can achieve ESPC benefits with lower financing costs by using upfront funds. They rely on ESPCs for energy efficiency improvements as they generally do not receive sufficient upfront funds. EISA 2007 allows agencies to use a combination of appropriated funds and private financing for ESPCs. DOE interprets this provision as authorizing payments from one-time avoided costs for energy improvements. The practical application of appropriated O&M funds to ESPCs is a key consideration. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires agencies to identify funds for energy conservation measures in their budget justifications. Through Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESCs), agencies can implement energy improvements with no initial capital investment, repaying the utility over the contract term from cost savings. Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) allow agencies to finance on-site renewable energy projects without upfront costs. Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) enable agencies to finance on-site renewable energy projects without upfront capital costs. A private developer installs, operates, maintains, and owns the renewable equipment on the agency's property. The agency agrees to purchase the power generated by the system and pay for it over the contract's duration. PPAs offer developers tax incentives and accelerated depreciation. Executive Orders 13423 and 13514 mandate energy reduction, increased renewable energy goals, and sustainability with a focus on GHG emission reduction for federal agencies. Legislation like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funds for energy improvements. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA\u2014 P.L. 110-140) expanded energy improvement financing for federal agencies through Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs), allowing for energy-efficiency improvements without direct appropriation. Agencies pay for the improvements through their operating funds. EISA included provisions that provided flexibility in funding ESPCs. EISA expanded funding for ESPCs, allowing a combination of appropriated funds and private financing. It increased contract life to 25 years, restricted agencies from limiting obligations, and permanently authorized ESPCs. Energy savings definition was extended to include cogeneration. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) expanded funding for Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) and allowed a combination of appropriated funds and private financing. It increased contract life to 25 years, restricted agencies from limiting obligations, and permanently authorized ESPCs. The act also included provisions for energy savings reduction through various methods such as cogeneration, heat recovery, and increased energy-efficient use of water resources. Additionally, it permitted agencies to retain the full amount of energy and water cost savings obtained from utility incentive programs and allocated funds for training contract officers in negotiating ESPCs. The Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE) were directed to study the potential use of ESPCs in nonbuilding applications, such as vehicles and federally owned equipment for generating electricity or transporting water. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocated funds for energy efficiency improvements in federal buildings and facilities, with a focus on job creation and economic recovery. The General Services Administration (GSA) was directed to use up to $30 million for a solar photovoltaic system at the Department of Energy headquarters building in Washington, D.C. Additionally, ARRA provided funding for high-performance federal facilities and energy efficiency improvements in Department of Defense facilities and the Department of Transportation. The Department of Transportation received $100 million for reducing energy consumption or greenhouse gases. The Department of the Interior and Department of Veterans Affairs received multi-purpose funds for energy efficiency or energy projects. The Department of Defense (DOD) is the largest energy consumer in the nation, with annual spending on facility energy use exceeding $3.4 billion in FY2007. ARRA provides $4.24 billion for DOD's Facilities Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization account, with $3.69 billion directed towards energy efficiency projects. The ARRA directs $3.69 billion for energy efficiency projects and modernization of DOD facilities. FSRM account covers maintenance expenses for DOD facilities in the US and territories. $300 million is allocated for research and development projects in the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Defense-wide. EISA established the Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings to reduce energy use in federal buildings by 30% by 2015. Agencies must also reduce fossil energy use in new federal buildings. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires federal agencies to purchase vehicles capable of running on alternative fuels. EISA mandates a 55% reduction in fossil energy use in new federal buildings by 2010 and elimination of fossil energy use by 2030. ARRA allocated funds for converting GSA facilities to high-performance green buildings and supporting the operations of GSA's Office of Green Buildings. In a given fiscal year, 75% of federal agency vehicles must run on alternative fuel, including hybrids and electric drive. ARRA allocated $300 million for GSA to purchase energy-efficient vehicles like hybrids, plug-ins, and electric cars. Additionally, ARRA provided $1 billion to the Department of Veterans Affairs for facility maintenance with energy projects, and $50 million to the National Cemetery Administration for monument repairs, including energy projects. EO 13514's GHG emission reduction goals require incremental energy efficiency improvements by the federal government. The federal government has set new goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with building energy use. FEMP developed a method for estimating emissions from agency energy use, with carbon dioxide being the largest component. In FY2006, federal buildings reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 7.4% compared to FY2003. EISA has set targets to reduce energy use in existing federal buildings by 30% by 2015. The GAO reported challenges for federal agencies in meeting EISA energy-reduction goals, citing funding and capital budgeting issues as key obstacles. Federal agencies rely on renewable energy credits (RECs) rather than site-generated renewable energy to meet EISA goals. The federal government purchases wind RECs to offset energy use, as wind-generated electricity is the main source of renewable energy. Solar photovoltaic electricity allows for site-generated renewable energy in certain regions. DOD may need to purchase electricity through the grid even if they offer property for photovoltaic farms. It is uncertain if agencies can receive double-credit for site-generated renewable energy. The Alliance to Save Energy identified barriers to increased energy efficiency in federal agencies, including lack of skilled personnel, budgeting challenges, and institutional behavior change. Despite training and incentives, capital budgeting remains a challenge. In 2006, electricity accounted for 17.6% of total federal energy use. In 2006, electricity accounted for 17.6% of total federal energy use, with buildings being the main consumers. The federal government spent $3.7 billion on electricity at an average cost of $78/megawatt-hour, representing one-third of 1% of the federal discretionary budget. EISA's 30% energy reduction goal for federal buildings could result in $1.1 billion in savings from reduced electricity use. Agencies can \"lock-in\" pre-improvement budgets for energy under ESPCs to pay for energy improvements and retain energy savings. The EISA allows agencies to combine appropriated funds with contractor-financed improvements. DOE has not finalized rules on using appropriated funds. DOD facilities could benefit from improvements under both funding mechanisms. The federal government may not see direct budget reductions from energy savings, but policymakers should consider the clean energy benefits. The federal government focused on energy efficiency by implementing low-cost improvements like replacing incandescent lights with fluorescent lights and upgrading insulation and window glazing. Further advancements in energy reduction rely on improved technology such as ENERGY STAR products and more efficient HVAC equipment. Recent laws and executive orders aim to enhance energy efficiency in federal facilities. The federal government has focused on energy efficiency through low-cost improvements and technology upgrades. Recent laws and executive orders, such as EO 13423 and EO 13514, aim to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency in federal agencies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included provisions for smart meters, efficiency standards for new buildings, and increased renewable energy use. Agencies are directed to install advanced meters to monitor electricity use by October 1, 2012. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005) amended the Energy Conservation and Production Act by adopting the 2004 International Energy Conservation Code and mandated a 30% reduction in energy consumption for new federal buildings. It also required the federal government to increase its use of renewable energy from 3% in 2005 to at least 7.5% by 2013. EPAct 2005 defines renewable energy sources and sets standards for energy efficiency. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 included provisions to reduce energy consumption in federal buildings, mandating a 30% reduction by 2015. It also focused on improving energy efficiency through measures like commissioning, energy managers, and green building standards. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandated a 30% reduction in energy consumption in federal buildings by 2015. It requires each federal agency to designate an energy manager responsible for annual energy evaluations and implementing efficiency measures. Sections 433 and 434 amended the Energy Conservation and Production Act to set standards for reducing fossil energy use in new federal buildings and major renovations. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandated a 30% reduction in energy consumption in federal buildings by 2015. It requires each federal agency to designate an energy manager responsible for annual energy evaluations and implementing efficiency measures. Sections 433 and 434 amended the Energy Conservation and Production Act to set standards for reducing fossil energy use in new federal buildings and major renovations. Additionally, the act includes provisions such as Section 435 prohibiting federal agencies from leasing buildings without an EPA ENERGY STAR label, Section 436 establishing high-performance green building standards, and Title V, Subtitle B promoting privately funded energy efficiency improvements through Energy Savings Performance Contracts. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandated a 30% reduction in energy consumption in federal buildings by 2015. It requires each federal agency to designate an energy manager responsible for annual energy evaluations and implementing efficiency measures. Sections 433 and 434 set standards for reducing fossil energy use in new federal buildings and major renovations. Section 514 enacted permanent authorization of ESPCs, Section 515 amended the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, and Section 518 directed DOD to study the potential use of ESPCs in nonbuilding applications. Section 526 prohibited federal agencies from procuring alternative or synthetic fuels. Executive Order 13423 revoked earlier executive orders and established new goals for federal agencies in environmental, energy, and transportation management. It provided guidance on energy and environmental efficiency, replacing previous goals with new target dates and expanding EPAct 2005 provisions. The Executive Order 13423 and EPAct 2005 provide federal agencies with guidance on energy and environmental management. Agencies are directed to reduce energy intensity and curb greenhouse gas emissions. Specific energy reduction targets are mandated for new construction and renovations, with a focus on building energy-efficiency goals. The MOU calls for new buildings to be 30% more cost efficient than industry standards. The MOU requires new buildings to be 30% more cost efficient than industry standards and mandates a 20% increase in cost efficiency for buildings undergoing major renovations compared to a 2003 baseline. Federal agencies are encouraged to incorporate sustainable practices, sell unneeded assets, and reduce energy intensity. EO 13123, which was revoked, focused on building energy efficiency, renewable energy use, and greenhouse gas emission reduction. In contrast, EO 13423 does not have specific greenhouse gas reduction targets but aims to cut emissions through energy intensity reductions in agency operations. EO 13423 required federal agencies to increase renewable energy purchases to 7.5% by 2013, with double credit for on-site generation. At least half of the renewable energy must come from new sources, including non-electric options like solar heating and biomass. In 2010, federal agencies could use non-electric renewables for 2.5% of electricity to meet EO 13423, and old renewables for 5% to meet EPAct, totaling 7.5% renewable energy use. EO 13514 focuses on sustainability, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing energy efficiency, cutting fleet petroleum consumption by 30% by 2020, conserving water, reducing waste, and supporting sustainable communities. The EO 13514 expands on EO 13423 by setting new goals and extending compliance dates for federal agencies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy efficiency, cut fleet petroleum consumption by 30% by 2020, conserve water, reduce waste, and support sustainable communities. Agencies are directed to assess their GHG footprint, set reduction targets, and implement new procurement practices for environmentally sustainable products and services. The Executive Order 13514 expands on previous goals by setting new targets for federal agencies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy efficiency. It also aims for a 30% reduction in fleet petroleum consumption by 2020 and promotes sustainable practices in procurement. Table A-2 provides a comparison of EO 13423 and EO 13514.
