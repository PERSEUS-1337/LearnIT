    "title": "SB 1113",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. SECTION 1. The Legislature supports partnerships between schools and county-funded Medi-Cal mental health services providers to address mental health issues in students before they require special education services. They encourage providing prevention and early intervention services to students in need, even if they do not have individualized education programs. The State Department of Education and the State Department of Health Care Services are urged to develop protocols to identify students who are Medi-Cal beneficiaries receiving education. The State Department of Education and the State Department of Health Care Services are urged to develop protocols to identify students who are Medi-Cal beneficiaries receiving educationally related mental health services as part of an individual educational plan for data tracking. Part 6 of Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code establishes County and Local Educational Agency Partnerships. These partnerships allow counties and local educational agencies to collaborate, including sharing health insurance information of pupils with the county mental health plan provider. The agreement between the county mental health plan or qualified provider and the local educational agency covers costs of mental health services not funded by paragraph (1). If costs exceed agreed funding, a reconciliation process determines how to cover the excess costs if the agency does not provide services through other means. The county mental health plan or qualified provider, along with the local educational agency, meet reporting requirements under state and federal laws, measure the impact of mental health interventions on students' goals, and participate in a performance outcome system to evaluate services provided. In the first year, a partnership will be established in at least one school within the local educational agency, with plans to expand to three additional schools within three years. The Legislature intends for health care service plans or insurers to participate in these partnerships as agreed upon by the school district. The County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund is created in the State Treasury to fund partnerships through a competitive grant program. Funds are allocated annually by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, with additional funds from the Legislature for the specified purposes. Funds in the annual Budget Act for educationally related mental health services, including residential care for emotionally disturbed pupils, must be used solely for that purpose and not put into the County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund."
