The \"Ethanol Stimulus Act of 2006\" offers tax incentives for ethanol production in states with high consumption and low production.

The \"Ethanol Stimulus Act of 2006\" increases the credit for ethanol production to 20 cents per gallon and raises the production limit to 50,000,000 gallons for eligible small ethanol producers in certain states. The credit amount is limited to production from each facility for a 5-year period. The term 'eligible ethanol production facility' refers to an ethanol production facility acquired by the taxpayer after August 8, 2005, and before August 9, 2010, without a binding contract in place before August 9, 2005. The taxpayer must have a written binding contract entered into between August 8, 2005, and August 9, 2010, or begin construction for their own use during the same period in a State that is a two-two State. The term 'two-two State' refers to a state that consumes more than 2% of gasoline but produces less than 2% of ethanol compared to all states. This definition is used in the Internal Revenue Code for eligible small ethanol producers. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to increase the eligible small ethanol producer capacity to 150,000,000 gallons in certain states. A conforming amendment is made to adjust gallon limitations. These changes apply to ethanol produced after the enactment of the Act."
