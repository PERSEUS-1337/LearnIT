It derives the optimal conditional distribution of the representation and maximizes it with the SV gradient method. The framework is applied to A2C and PPO algorithms, improving their sample efficiency. Additionally, the IB perspective in deep RL is studied using the MINE algorithm. In deep reinforcement learning, the information extraction-compression process is verified, and a framework is developed to accelerate it. The relationship between MINE and the framework is analyzed, leading to an algorithm for optimizing the IB framework without constructing the lower bound. Improving sample efficiency in RL is crucial, with techniques like experience reuse/replay being popular for off-policy algorithms. In deep reinforcement learning, efficient representations can reduce sample complexity. For example, using 128-dimension pre-defined RAM data instead of raw images in Atari games improves sample efficiency. This paper aims to enhance sample efficiency in RL through representation learning.

It constructs a lower bound and uses the Stein variational gradient method to optimize it. The framework accelerates the information extraction-compression process and combining actor-critic algorithms with it improves sample efficiency. The relationship between the framework and MINE is analyzed, leading to a derived algorithm for optimization without constructing the lower bound. The IB method is orthogonal to other sample efficiency methods and can be incorporated into off-policy and model-based algorithms in the future. The information bottleneck framework in reinforcement learning enhances sample efficiency by optimizing representations and discarding irrelevant data. Various methods have been explored, such as the iterative Blahut Arimoto algorithm and variational information bottleneck frameworks. Extensions include the variational discriminator bottleneck for improving GANs and other learning techniques. Additionally, approaches like experience-reuse have been utilized to improve sample efficiency in deep learning. In reinforcement learning, various techniques are used to optimize representations and improve sample efficiency. Some methods include learning a deterministic policy, mitigating off-policy delay, and learning the environment model. State representation learning and maintaining the optimality of representation space have also been explored. Additionally, new perspectives on representation learning based on geometric properties and information bottleneck in imitation learning have been proposed. There is a gap in directly using information bottleneck in basic RL. To the best of our knowledge, no work directly uses Information Bottleneck (IB) in basic Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. A Markov decision process (MDP) is defined by states, actions, reward and transition functions, and starting state distribution. RL aims to maximize expected return by selecting a policy. Actor-critic algorithms combine policy gradient and value function methods, like A2C (Mnih et al., 2016). In reinforcement learning, A2C approximates the policy gradient using an equation involving accumulated return, entropy, and a baseline function. It also minimizes the mean square error between the return and value function. The total objective function includes coefficients alpha 1 and alpha 2. The information bottleneck framework is used for extracting relevant information from input data in RL. It aims to compress irrelevant parts to improve prediction accuracy. The information bottleneck framework aims to compress irrelevant parts of input data to improve prediction accuracy in reinforcement learning. It involves deriving an embedding distribution P \u22c6 (Z|X) in a Markovian structure X \u2192 Z \u2192 Y, where X is the input, Z is the representation of X, and Y is the label of X. The framework includes a coefficient \u03b2 that controls the regularizer magnitude in supervised learning with a mutual information regularizer. The information bottleneck framework in reinforcement learning aims to compress irrelevant input data to improve prediction accuracy. It involves deriving an embedding distribution P \u22c6 (Z|X) in a Markovian structure X \u2192 Z \u2192 Y, with a coefficient \u03b2 controlling the regularizer magnitude. The framework formalizes the training of a decision function V \u03c0 (Z t ) to approximate the true label Y t, with a target distribution P (R|Z) used for simplicity. The ultimate formalization of the IB framework in RL involves mutual information I(X, Z) and common RL framework comparison. The near-optimality theorem is derived in the context of the information bottleneck framework in reinforcement learning. The optimization problem is solved by constructing a variational lower bound, leading to a distribution similar to Bayesian inference. The formulation follows a representation space approach, emphasizing the similarity to previous studies. The formulation in the current text chunk follows from the information bottleneck framework in Bayesian inference. It introduces a new representation distribution and discusses the difficulty in computing it. The text chunk discusses constructing a variational lower bound with a distribution independent of \u03d5 to compute P \u03d5 (Z). It mentions using Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) to optimize the lower bound due to its ability to handle unnormalized target distributions. SVGD iteratively updates particles via a direction function in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space to decrease the KL divergence. The text chunk discusses using a direction function to decrease the KL divergence between particles' distribution and the target distribution. The direction is chosen to maximize the directional derivative of the distribution. The closed form of this direction is shown, and in practice, a greedy direction is used to move towards the target distribution. The text discusses using Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) to compute mutual information between high dimensional random variables accurately and efficiently. This process accelerates the information exchange in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) and involves updating policy-value parameter \u03b8 and representation parameter \u03d5 using a common policy gradient algorithm. The text utilizes Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) to visualize the mutual information between input state X and its relative representation Z in deep Reinforcement Learning. The process involves sampling inputs, computing MI with MINE, and training MINE with shuffled representations. Results show that the framework extracts and compresses information faster than common A2C in Atari game Pong. The framework improves sample efficiency of basic RL algorithms like A2C and PPO by visualizing mutual information with MINE. The relationship between the framework and MINE is analyzed, leading to a derived algorithm for optimization. Experimental results show faster information extraction and compression compared to common A2C. The framework is implemented in A2C with sampling from a network, and code can be found on GitHub. The number of samples from each state X is 32, with the IB coefficient set as \u03b2 = 0.001. Two prior distributions U (Z) are used: uniform and Gaussian. The Gaussian distribution is defined for a given state X i. The kernel function used is the Gaussian RBF kernel. Hyper-parameters in RL are chosen as default parameters in A2C of Openaibaselines. In summary, four A2C algorithms are implemented: A2C with uniform SVIB, A2C with Gaussian SVIB, Regular A2C, and A2C with noise. Performance comparison in 5 gym Atari games shows that A2C with the framework is more sample-efficient than the other algorithms. Our framework improves sample efficiency of basic A2C and PPO algorithms in Atari games. A2C with Gaussian SVIB performs worse in SpaceInvaders due to information loss. More details are discussed in the appendix. The study explores the information bottleneck principle in RL by proposing an optimization problem for learning representation based on the information-bottleneck framework. A lower bound is constructed and the Stein Variational gradient method is used for optimization. The framework accelerates the information extraction and compression process in deep RL. An algorithm based on MINE is theoretically derived to optimize the framework in value-based algorithms. The study proposes an optimization problem for learning representation in RL based on the information-bottleneck framework. The algorithm, derived from MINE, accelerates information extraction and compression in deep RL by optimizing the framework in value-based algorithms. The objective function J \u03c0 is defined, and the target distribution is rigorously derived. The distribution of X and Z is denoted as P and P Z \u03d5 (Z) = P \u03d5 (Z) respectively. Functional derivatives are taken with respect to P \u03d5, leading to the proof of Theorem 2 (X, Z; \u03d5) under a fixed policy-value parameter \u03b8. The study introduces a new representation distribution in RL using the information-bottleneck framework. It includes algorithm details, hyper-parameter initialization, and the integration of MINE. Experimental settings for MI visualization are discussed, comparing A2C with the proposed framework. MI is computed every 2000 update steps using MINE. The study introduces a new representation distribution in RL using the information-bottleneck framework. MI is computed with MINE, showing fluctuations in the curve due to changing datasets and learning signals in reinforcement learning. As policy improves, the agent tends to follow the information E-C process. The MI tends to decrease overall, with visualizations in Qbert comparing A2C with the proposed framework. The MI visualization in Qbert shows that as policy improves, the agent follows the information E-C process, with MI tending to decrease overall. Experimental results in MsPacman suggest that A2C with the new framework performs worse than regular A2C. The MI visualization of MsPacman suggests that A2C with the new framework drops information excessively, impacting the learning process. This is evident in the sudden drop of information and rewards from step 80 to 100, indicating that the agent may be missing crucial details in the game environment. The complexity of MsPacman, with walls, ghosts, and beans, requires a slower information drop to maintain performance."
