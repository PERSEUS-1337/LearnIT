    "content": "There is no text provided in the prev_chunk, so I will summarize the curr_chunk directly.\n\nSummary: Section 1 discusses immigrants with advanced degrees. Section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to prioritize immigrants with advanced degrees in science, mathematics, technology, or engineering. The worldwide level of immigrants with advanced degrees is set at 55,000 for each fiscal year. Qualified immigrants with master's or doctorate degrees in specific fields will be granted immigrant visas or permanent resident status each fiscal year, not exceeding the worldwide level set under section 201(e). The Secretary of State, in consultation with other departments, will determine the eligible degrees after a year from the enactment of this provision. The Secretary of State will maintain information on immigrants with advanced degrees to meet workforce needs and protect the economic security of the United States. Immigrant visas and adjustment of status for those with advanced degrees will be issued according to specific criteria. If the Secretary of State has not determined immigrant visa issuance, it will be done randomly. If the number of eligible immigrants with a degree exceeds the specified level, visas will be issued randomly. If the Secretary of State determines that the number of eligible immigrants with degrees applying for visas is within the specified level, visas will be issued in a random order. The amendments made by this section will take effect on October 1, 2008, with visas being issued in a random order determined by the Secretary for the fiscal year involved. SEC. 2. ADVANCED DEGREE VISA CARRYOVER. An immigrant visa made available for fiscal year 2009 or later can be issued to eligible aliens even after the fiscal year ends, counting towards the yearly visa limits."
