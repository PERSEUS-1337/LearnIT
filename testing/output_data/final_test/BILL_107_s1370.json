    "content": "MECHANISMS. Each State is encouraged to establish alternative dispute resolution mechanisms for health care liability claims that are affordable, timely, and provide convenient access. Guidelines will be developed by the Attorney General in consultation with the Secretary and the Administrative Conference of the United States, including procedures for arbitration. Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms for health care liability claims include arbitration, mediation, early neutral evaluation, and early offer and recovery mechanism. Arbitration is a nonjury process that may result in a final decision, while mediation is a settlement process coordinated by a neutral third party. Early neutral evaluation involves presenting to a neutral evaluator for assessment, and early offer and recovery mechanism is used for early resolution. (4) Early offer and recovery mechanism allows health care providers to offer compensation for economic damages. (5) Certificate of merit requires a qualified specialist's report before trial in health care liability actions. (6) No-fault statute may be used for resolving claims. No-fault statute allows for barring certain health care liability actions and compensating claimants through health plans or other mechanisms. Further redress in Federal or State court depends on the alternative dispute resolution methods adopted by the State. If the claimant receives at least 25 percent less damages in court, they may seek further redress. The court decision may result in the party bearing costs if damages are at least 25 percent less or more compared to the State alternative dispute resolution method. The party may bear reasonable costs, including legal fees, in court actions. The Attorney General can provide technical assistance to States for alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and evaluations will be conducted on their effectiveness. SEC. 13. APPLICABILITY. This Act applies to civil actions commenced on or after its enactment, including actions where harm occurred before the enactment date. SEC. 14. SEVERABILITY. If any part of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected."
