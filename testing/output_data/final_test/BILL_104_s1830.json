    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996\". The Congress finds that NATO has been crucial for the security and prosperity of the US and its allies since 1949. The Alliance is defensive and poses no threat to any nation, including the inclusion of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe. The commitment to mutual defense has facilitated the democratic transformation of Eastern Europe. NATO has enlarged its membership on 3 different occasions since 1949, with Congress supporting further enlargement through acts in 1994 and 1995. New members assuming Alliance responsibilities help maintain stability in Eastern Europe. Alliance membership costs will be shared to maintain stability in Europe. NATO members, especially the United States, need to show political will to support new members. New members will have full rights and obligations under the Washington Treaty. Peacekeeping initiatives involving emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe are being supported. The Peacekeeping Battalion, Polish-Lithuanian Joint Peacekeeping Force, and Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping Force can contribute to European and international peace and security. The United States supports the political independence and territorial integrity of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe. NATO is the only organization capable of effective military operations in the Euro-Atlantic region and serves as an important diplomatic forum. NATO, a key diplomatic forum, has successfully prevented military conflicts between member states since its establishment in 1949. The admission of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to NATO would enhance international peace and regional security. Several Eastern European countries have shown interest in NATO membership and have taken steps to qualify for it. The eventual membership of Austria, Finland, and Sweden in NATO is expected, while Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have made the most progress towards meeting the criteria for NATO membership. Additional assistance should be provided to emerging democracies ready for closer ties with NATO. Future NATO membership for emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe hinges on meeting criteria for security enhancement and unanimous approval from all NATO members. The United States aims to redefine NATO's role post-Cold War, support Central and Eastern European democracies for NATO membership, and establish a cooperative relationship between NATO and Russia. The Congress supports promoting economic stability and security in several Eastern European countries by encouraging their NATO membership, urging the European Union to expedite the admission process for qualifying countries, and endorsing military cooperation among these nations, NATO, and Russia. Eligible countries for NATO enlargement assistance are designated accordingly. The NATO Participation Act of 1994 designates Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic as eligible for assistance. Other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe can also be designated if they meet specific criteria outlined in the Act. The NATO Participation Act of 1994 designates Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic as eligible for assistance. The President can also designate Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovenia, or other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe for assistance under the program established by the Act. Authorization of appropriations for NATO enlargement assistance is granted under Section 6. Authorization of $60,000,000 for fiscal year 1997 under the NATO Participation Act of 1994 for direct loans and grants for the Foreign Military Financing Program. Authorization of $10,000,000 for international military education and training under the NATO Participation Act of 1994 and Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Amounts authorized are in addition to other available funds. SEC. 7. EXCESS DEFENSE ARTICLES. Priority Delivery: Excess defense articles under certain acts shall be given priority over other countries, except those specified. Congress encourages providing assistance to regional peacekeeping initiatives in Central and Eastern Europe to enhance their NATO joining ability. The country expressed interest in joining NATO to enhance their contribution to European and international peacekeeping efforts. SEC. 8. MODERNIZATION OF DEFENSE CAPABILITY. The Congress supports the modernization of defense capability in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and other designated countries by exploring options for the sale or lease of NATO-compatible weapons systems. SEC. 9. TERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY. The NATO Participation Act of 1994 is amended to include a provision for the termination of eligibility for countries designated under subsection (d) if they no longer meet certain criteria, are hostile to the NATO Alliance, or pose a national security threat to the United States. The President must certify to Congress if such conditions are met, and eligibility will terminate unless Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving the termination within 60 days. The NATO Participation Act of 1994 is amended to include a provision for the termination of eligibility for countries if they no longer meet criteria, are hostile to NATO, or pose a national security threat. The President must certify to Congress, and eligibility will terminate unless Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving within 60 days. Congressional Priority Procedures are outlined for introducing joint resolutions in accordance with specific procedures. The NATO Participation Act of 1994 allows for termination of eligibility for countries not meeting criteria or posing a threat. The President certifies to Congress, and eligibility ends unless a joint resolution disapproving is passed within 60 days. Congressional committees are redefined for this process. SEC. 10 of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 is amended to replace \"countries emerging from communist domination\" with \"emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe\" in certain sections. Additionally, a new section is added defining \"emerging democracies\" to include specific countries. SEC. 11 of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 defines \"emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe\" to include specific countries like Albania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine.
