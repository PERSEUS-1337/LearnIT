    "content": "The Act is titled the \"9/11 Can You Hear Me Now Act\" and includes findings related to the legislation. The Congress finds that the New York City Fire Department's radio system failed during the 1993 and 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, leading to communication issues but no firefighter deaths. Fire department officials unsuccessfully tried to radio firefighters to evacuate the building before Tower One collapsed. The firefighters' radio system failed during the 9/11 attacks, leading to the deaths of many firefighters. Efforts have been made to improve communication systems, but issues persist in tall buildings, as seen during a blackout in 2003. Since the 9/11 attacks, there have been concerns about the reliability of the current dispatch system used by the New York City Fire Department, especially in high buildings. With New York City being a top terrorist target, there is a need for a new state-of-the-art communications system to improve communication with firefighters and provide detailed information about buildings and locations. A new state-of-the-art communications system and upgrades to the critical information dispatch system for the New York City Fire Department should be seamless from the receipt of a 911 call to the dispatch of the firefighter and interoperable with other public safety offices within the City of New York. The New York City Fire Department is required to procure a communications system. The Secretary of Homeland Security is mandated to procure a communications system for the New York City Fire Department within a year. The system must include radios for the entire department and upgrades to the critical information dispatch system. Radios must be capable of operating in all locations where firefighters work, and a supplemental communication device must be provided to each firefighter. The device allows firefighters to transmit audio and radio signals for help when in distress or incapacitated. Upgrades to the dispatch system must enable communication with the fire department. The radios must allow communication with firefighters in all locations, provide data on likely terrorist targets in NYC, and give instant details about buildings during emergencies. Testing of radios and communication devices is required. Supplemental communication devices must be tested for operation in all firefighter work locations in NYC. The Secretary will coordinate with NYC for system compatibility and interoperability with public safety systems. Progress reports are due on February 26, 2008, and September 11, 2008."
