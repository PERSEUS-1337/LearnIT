    "content": "The federal budget has been in deficit since 2002, with deficits peaking from 2009 to 2012. The federal debt held by the public increased from 39% of GDP in 2008 to 72% in 2013, the highest since World War II. Budget deficits averaged 1.7% of GDP from 1946 to 2008, but reached 10.1% in 2009. The deficit fell to 7% in 2012, and in 2014, it was projected to be $492 billion or 2.8% of GDP. Despite improvements, the deficit remains above its historical average. The deficit has improved but still remains above historical average. Projected deficits are large enough to cause federal debt to continuously grow faster than national income. The debt is projected to reach 100% of GDP by 2036. Spending cuts or revenue increases will be needed to restore fiscal sustainability. Congress is exploring policy options to reduce the deficit. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) provides information on reducing the deficit, including the size of projected deficits, necessary reductions for long-term sustainability, alternative time frames, and policy choices. The budget deficit increased significantly between 2008 and 2009, with unexpected growth. In FY2009, CBO projected a lower baseline deficit compared to 2008. Deficits decreased from 2012 to 2014, with the 2014 deficit projected to be $1 trillion lower than in 2009. Factors causing the deficit increase and decrease are explained in Table 1. The exact reasons for deficit changes vary each fiscal year, but it can be determined precisely what caused the actual deficit to be larger or smaller than projected. The CBO uses the September 2008 projection due to a significant deficit increase. Budget outcomes can differ from projections due to legislative, economic, and technical changes. Legislative changes since 2009 are categorized into three groups. Since 2009, changes in the federal budget can be categorized into three groups: changes that temporarily increased the deficit, including legislation like TARP and ARRA; changes that had a one-time effect on the deficit due to improvements in financial markets; and changes that were in place for a finite period of time, such as extended unemployment insurance and payroll tax cuts. In 2009, $243 billion was spent on TARP and the GSEs, with transfers declining in 2010 and 2011. ARRA's temporary spending spike peaked in 2010 and mostly dissipated by 2012. Extended unemployment insurance was in place from 2008 to 2013, and payroll taxes were temporarily reduced by two percentage points. From 2008 to 2013, payroll taxes were temporarily reduced by two percentage points. The Budget Control Act and winding down of overseas contingency operations have permanently reduced the deficit. Budget authority for overseas operations has decreased, leading to a reduction in discretionary defense spending. The Budget Control Act implemented spending cuts for 2012 to 2021. The Budget Control Act (BCA) implemented spending cuts through statutory caps for defense and non-defense discretionary spending for 2012 to 2021 and sequestration for mandatory spending for 2013 to 2021. The BCA exempted most mandatory spending programs from sequestration and capped Medicare cuts at 2%. On the discretionary side, the BCA exempted certain programs from the spending caps, leading to higher discretionary spending than originally envisioned. Congress has struggled to reach a consensus on which programs should absorb the necessary cuts each year. Overall, discretionary spending was $75 billion lower in 2013 and is projected to be $120 billion lower in 2014 than the September 2008 baseline level. Various legislative changes since September 2008 have permanently increased the deficit, including the extension of expiring tax provisions and temporary extensions of the \"doc fix.\" Most provisions from the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were permanently extended in the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) in January 2013, reducing revenues overall by $3.9 trillion over 10 years. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) extended tax cuts until 2017, reducing revenues by $3.9 trillion over 10 years. Legislative changes since September 2008 increased the budget deficit by $1,750 billion from 2009 to 2014. ATRA reduced the deficit by allowing certain provisions to expire in 2012, increasing revenues by $618 billion over 10 years. Congress has temporarily prevented Medicare's sustainable growth rate (SGR) from reducing physician payments. Medicare payments to physicians have been temporarily prevented from decreasing each year since 2003 through the \"doc fix.\" Continuing this policy will permanently increase the deficit, with legislative changes increasing net interest payments on the debt. Between 2009 and 2014, legislative changes increased net interest by $277 billion, mainly through increases in discretionary or mandatory spending. These changes had little effect on the deficit after 2012, except for increasing interest payments on the debt. The extension of expiring tax cuts increased the deficit by $1,750 billion over six years, while policies reducing the deficit focused on tapering discretionary spending. Legislative changes in 2013 and 2014 reduced discretionary spending but were offset by increases in mandatory spending and revenues. Economic changes due to the recession and slow recovery added around $100 billion annually to the deficit from 2009 to 2014. Revenues automatically rise and certain mandatory spending falls as the economy moves towards full employment. The role of automatic stabilizers in the economy is significant, with revenues falling in a recession and spending on means-tested programs increasing. In 2010, automatic stabilizers added 2.7 percentage points of GDP to the budget deficit. Technical changes also impacted the deficit, reflecting the uncertainty in budget projections. Despite some reduction in their impact, automatic stabilizers and technical changes continue to affect the deficit. The deficit would have been larger than projected each year from 2008 to 2010, with legislative changes having a greater impact than economic and technical changes from 2009 to 2014. Budget deficits are projected to decrease until 2015 before rising again, reaching 4.0% of GDP in 2022. The debt held by the public declines until 2017, then increases to 78.1% of GDP in 2024. Long-term projections show deficits exceeding 10% of GDP by 2073 under current policy, with high uncertainty due to forecast errors and assumptions. Budget projections are highly uncertain, with history showing outcomes can be much better or worse than projected, especially over the long run. The OMB and CBO provide budget deficit projections with average errors of 1.4% and 3.6% of GDP for the next budget year and five years ahead, respectively. CBO's economic growth projections for the next 10 years are modest due to slow labor supply growth from an aging population. The business cycle's impact on budget projections is only considered in the short term by CBO. The CBO's current projection assumes no recession in the next 10 years, implying the longest economic expansion in US history. However, past recessions have disproportionately affected the budget, with potential for increased deficits if a recession occurs. The CBO's current projection assumes steady growth, with potential for higher deficits if interest rates rise to historical levels. Policy assumptions can impact deficit projections, with ambiguity in defining current policy. The CBO's current projection assumes steady growth, with potential for higher deficits if interest rates rise to historical levels. Policy assumptions can impact deficit projections, with ambiguity in defining current policy. War and disaster spending projections are subject to change due to evolving circumstances. Disaster spending can vary significantly from year to year, with a cap based on a 10-year average but emergency spending is not constrained by the BCA, allowing any discretionary spending to be designated as such. Emergency spending under the Budget Control Act has been used once in 2013 for Hurricane Sandy relief, totaling $41.6 billion. The Congressional Budget Office assumes zero emergency spending going forward, but any amount is possible. The \"doc fix\" for the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) has been enacted temporarily, leading to higher budget deficits if not addressed. Many tax provisions are set to expire, with potential for a $1.1 trillion increase in deficits if all are extended permanently. Unforeseen circumstances and inaccurate assumptions led to budget deficits being $1.1 trillion higher over 10 years. Emergencies like war, natural disasters, and recessions were major contributors to deficits. Baseline assumptions, like growth in discretionary spending and expiring tax provisions, were unrepresentative of future events, causing deficit projections to repeatedly undershoot. This raises questions about the utility of baseline projections. The baseline projections for budget deficits often underestimate due to inaccurate assumptions and unforeseen contingencies. Congress has a history of intervening to prevent full implementation of spending cuts, suggesting future interventions are probable. The baseline assumes current law without accounting for potential policy changes. Under the Alternative Fiscal Scenario, the budget deficit continues to rise, peaking at 5.1% of GDP in 2022, with public debt reaching 86.7% of GDP by 2024. Deficits could reach 10% of GDP in 2032, and public debt could hit 100% of GDP by 2029. The targeted deficit reduction depends on the policy goal, with a balanced budget potentially having a neutral effect on national saving rates. The United States has a low national saving rate relative to other countries and domestic investment needs. To increase the national saving rate or reduce the federal debt, the government could target a budget surplus. Achieving generational equity would require large budget surpluses due to an aging population and elderly entitlement programs. Some economists advocate for a balanced structural budget. A call for a balanced structural budget to avoid deficit reduction during recessions and achieve sustainable fiscal policy in the long term. A structurally balanced budget in 2012 would have allowed for a deficit of about 2.3% of GDP. The current policy is not projected to be on a sustainable path as government debt would grow faster than GDP. The debt is projected to reach 79% of GDP in 2024 and 106% in 2039 under the baseline scenario. In the Alternative Fiscal Scenario, the debt would grow to 163% of GDP by 2039. As long as investors continue to finance deficits, the debt could keep growing. To maintain sustainability, reductions in spending or tax increases would be necessary over time. CBO projects a need to cut spending or increase revenues by 1.8% of GDP immediately to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio over the next 75 years. Today's high debt levels limit policymakers' flexibility to address future challenges. Mainstream economic theory suggests that reducing the deficit could have a short-term contractionary effect on GDP. During periods of economic growth, this effect can be offset, but during high unemployment, deficit reduction could worsen the situation. The budget deficit could lead to higher unemployment, especially during periods of high debt levels. There is disagreement among economists about the economy's proximity to full employment, and growth has been slow. Gradual deficit reduction may be necessary for sustainability without causing unwanted contractionary effects. The U.S. fiscal outlook is a concern due to above-average deficits, and delaying action could limit options for addressing future challenges. The budget deficit is a long-term issue that requires fundamental reforms to outlays and revenues for sustainability. While deficits have had minor negative economic consequences so far, continued deficits could eventually harm the economy. Larger deficits provided a stimulative boost during the recent recession but are expected to have a negative effect in the long run. Continued deficits could harm the economy by crowding out private investment spending, leading to higher interest rates and lower potential GDP and national income in the future. The financial crisis and Great Recession resulted in a decline in private-investment spending and an increase in private saving, reducing the potential for government deficits to crowd out private investment. Low interest rates post-recession suggest little crowding out occurred. Borrowing can be financed by foreign saving, with the stimulus potentially causing a rise in the trade deficit due to increased foreign capital attracted by higher domestic interest rates. Foreign borrowing is equivalent to the trade deficit, as a country can borrow from the world only if it imports more than it exports. Availability of foreign credit could mitigate crowding out effects. The United States relies heavily on foreign borrowing, which could make large budget deficits less effective at stimulating the economy. Despite a significant decline in the budget deficit since 2012, crowding out and higher interest rates may become more pressing issues as the economy returns to full employment. The trade deficit has fallen substantially since the recession began, reducing the problem of crowding out from the trade deficit for now. The trade deficit has decreased since the recession, reducing crowding out issues. Interest rates have risen slightly with a stronger economy. Budget deficits can be reduced through spending cuts, higher taxes, or a combination. Social Security, Medicare, net interest, and defense make up a large portion of total spending. Deficit reduction proposals should target these areas. The budget deficit is a significant portion of total spending, with spending reaching its highest share of GDP in 2009 and revenues at their lowest since 1950. From 2009 to 2011, outlays averaged 24.1% of GDP, while revenues were below 16% of GDP from 2009 to 2012. Revenues are projected to remain near current levels over the next 10 years. Over the next 10 years, revenues are projected to be near their historical average at 18.1% of GDP, while outlays are projected to be 21.5% of GDP. Returning the budget to balance would require a combination of outlay and revenue changes, as recent deficits are a result of past decisions. Total spending has decreased from 24% of GDP in 2009-2011 to 21% in 2013. Total spending has fallen from an average of 24% of GDP from 2009 to 2011 to 21% of GDP in 2013. It is projected to rise to 22% of GDP from 2020 to 2024 under current policy. Discretionary spending has decreased to its lowest share of GDP since data were first collected, while mandatory spending and net interest on the federal debt are expected to grow relative to GDP. The increase in net interest is due to the growth in federal debt and the return to more normal interest rates. Defense discretionary spending was lower from 2009 to 2012 compared to previous years, but began to grow as overseas military operations expanded. In 2014, it is projected to fall to its lowest share of GDP since 2002. Non-defense discretionary spending has shown no long-term trend relative to GDP, staying within 3% to 4% of GDP. It fell to its lowest level in the late 1990s and rose from there in the 2000s. Since 2009, non-defense discretionary spending has grown due to the 2009 stimulus, but is projected to fall back to 1990s levels in 2014. The CBO baseline shows a significant decline in discretionary spending relative to GDP over the next 10 years, reaching its lowest share of GDP ever recorded. The baseline assumes adherence to Budget Control Act levels through 2021, with discretionary spending not subject to caps rising at the rate of inflation. Long-term projections suggest discretionary spending will remain at its 2024 share of GDP. In projections, CBO assumes discretionary spending will remain at its 2024 share of GDP, leading to a smaller share of spending over time and not contributing to long-term budget deficit growth. If discretionary spending stayed at its current GDP share, deficits would be larger. Discretionary spending fell in nominal terms from 2011 to 2014, with both defense and non-defense spending declining in real terms annually until 2018 due to BCA caps and OCO spending. The discretionary spending fell in nominal terms from 2011 to 2014, with both defense and non-defense spending declining in real terms annually until 2018 due to BCA caps and OCO spending. This contrasts with the significant growth in discretionary spending from 2000 to 2010. Economic theory predicts that reducing discretionary spending could lead to a smaller economy in the long term. Further deficit reduction through discretionary spending would require reducing it even lower as a share of GDP. If discretionary spending were reduced to zero by 2030, there would still be a deficit in the extended baseline scenario. Mandatory spending has grown as a share of GDP since 1962, doubling from 4.7% to 9.4% of GDP from 1962 to 1975. It fluctuated between 8.7% to 10.4% of GDP from 1975 to 2007, peaking at 14.5% in 2009. Since then, it has fallen but remains significant. Mandatory spending has fallen as a share of GDP since 1962 but has remained above its pre-crisis level. It is projected to continue growing faster than inflation, exceeding 13% of GDP over the next 10 years. Outside of health and retirement programs, other mandatory spending is expected to decline relative to GDP. \"Automatic stabilizer\" spending has decreased significantly as the economy improves. The CBO projects that other mandatory spending will decrease from 2.7% of GDP in 2013 to 0.8% by 2088. Entitlement spending on the elderly, including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, makes up the majority of mandatory spending. Social Security and major health programs have seen increases in their share of GDP over the years. Social Security reached its highest share of GDP in 2013 at 4.9%, while major health programs peaked at 5% in 2011 before dropping to 4.6% in 2013. Within the next 10 years, Social Security and major health spending are projected to surpass total discretionary spending. In long-term budget projections, rising deficits are driven by growing entitlement programs for the elderly, particularly health spending. Social Security and federal health outlays are projected to increase significantly as a share of GDP by 2039. Health spending per capita is expected to outpace GDP per capita, leading to a substantial increase in federal health spending. If health spending grew at the same rate as GDP, one-third of the increase in federal health spending could be avoided through 2039. If health spending were to grow at the rate of GDP instead, one-third of the increase in federal health spending could be avoided through 2039. Spending on major health programs would decline from 14% of GDP to 7.7% of GDP in 2089 if there was zero excess cost growth over the next 75 years. The growth in elderly entitlement spending makes deficits unsustainably large in the long run. Revenues are projected to rise relative to GDP due to bracket creep, while health spending per capita will continue to grow faster than GDP. Reforming elderly entitlement programs would generate significant budgetary savings in the long run, but little in the short run. Immediate reduction of excess cost growth for federal health spending would result in 2% GDP reduction after 20 years. Mandatory spending could be reduced by restricting benefits or eligibility. Excess cost growth in health programs has been a long-standing issue with no clear solution. While there has been a downward trend over time, it still contributes to an unsustainable budget deficit. Revenues were historically low in 2009 and 2010, leading to a large budget deficit. Total revenues remained at historically low levels as well. Total revenues remained historically low in 2011 and 2012, with most coming from individual income tax and social insurance. In 2013, revenue as a share of GDP returned to average levels due to economic recovery and tax changes. Revenues are projected to be around 18% of GDP from 2015 onwards, gradually increasing over the next 10 years. \"Real bracket creep\" will contribute to revenue growth as incomes rise. In CBO's Long-Term Budget Outlook, projected revenues increase due to bracket creep, reaching 19.4% of GDP in 2039 and 23.9% in 2089. Revenues also rise by 0.3 percentage points by 2039 as temporary provisions expire. Current law may not reflect current policy in long-term projections, potentially leading to a larger fiscal gap if revenues do not keep pace with spending. Revenues may not increase in line with spending as a share of GDP. Policymakers have five main options to increase revenue: redesigning the tax system, introducing new revenue sources like a carbon tax or VAT, raising existing taxes, broadening the tax base by eliminating tax expenditures, or allowing tax cuts to expire. Redesigning the tax system or adding new revenue sources could enhance economic efficiency, but may not generate much additional revenue in practice. Economists generally prefer eliminating tax expenditures over raising marginal tax rates for efficiency reasons. Tax expenditures may promote economic efficiency but have been criticized for equity and complexity."
