    "content": "The Act titled \"Teacher Sabbatical Leave Grants Act\" provides grants to encourage the use of sabbatical leave for professional development by offering salary support during the leave period. The Act authorizes grants to State and local educational agencies to pay eligible teachers half of their salary for completing a course of study during a sabbatical term. Eligible teachers are those providing classroom instruction at a public school and have approval to participate in the program. Teachers eligible for sabbatical leave must obtain agency approval and submit an application with required documentation, including proof of approval and enrollment in a course of study. They must also assure the agency of their commitment to the program. The agency will reimburse some or all of the subgrant if the teacher fails to complete the course of study and must provide proof of completion within 60 days. Teachers selected for a subgrant must enroll in a course of study at an institution of higher education to meet classroom needs. A sabbatical term is a leave of absence granted to eligible teachers for professional development purposes, lasting not less than one academic semester and not more than one academic year. During this period, teachers receive half of their salary from State or local funds. The course of study aims to improve classroom teaching through academic and child development studies. During a sabbatical term, eligible teachers receive a leave of absence for professional development, with half of their salary paid from State or local funds and the other half from Federal funds. The State or local educational agency must agree to pay the teacher as if their regular employment had not been suspended. Additionally, any recovered amount must be repaid to the Secretary. The amendment authorizes $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and additional funds for fiscal years 2003 through 2006 to carry out the section. The effective date for the amendment is fiscal year 2002."
