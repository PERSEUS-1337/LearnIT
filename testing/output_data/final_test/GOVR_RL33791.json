    "content": "The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted in 1938, with the concept of minimum wage indexation being considered prior to its implementation. The federal minimum wage has evolved over the years, currently set at $5.85 per hour and scheduled to increase to $7.25 per hour by July 2009. Congress has the authority to adjust the minimum wage based on support in legislation. The federal minimum wage has fluctuated in real value since 1968, reaching its highest level then. Some suggest pegging it to an economic variable to prevent fluctuations. The concept of a minimum wage was to provide a minimum income, but questions arise about what constitutes a minimal standard and who should be paid at least the minimum wage. John A. Ryan proposed a living wage in the early 20th century to ensure safe and healthful living, procreation, and savings for old age. He argued that a laborer's right to a Living Wage is as valid as his right to life. Father Ryan suggested that a decent livelihood is essential for a worker to function effectively and live as a human being, not just as an animal. It includes food, clothing, shelter, recreation, religious and moral necessities, opportunities for intellectual development, and education for children. The concept of a living wage includes physical, mental, moral, religious, social, and recreational welfare for workers and their families. Scholars agree that a wage sufficient to maintain full economic efficiency is important, even though there may be differences in opinion on the specific amount. The living wage is seen as a basic standard that all wage adjustment boards should consider. The National Consumers' League was established in 1890 with a focus on social uplift and exploring the plight of low-wage workers. The minimum wage campaign began in 1911 in Massachusetts and spread to other states. Wage boards were utilized to examine industries and set minimum rates for workers. The wage boards were established to examine industries and set minimum rates for workers. The purpose was to increase the general standard and maintain the value of the minimum wage in line with the cost-of-living. The threat of statutes being declared unconstitutional loomed during the early years of the minimum wage movement. In 1937, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Washington state labor standards statute, leading to new minimum wage initiatives. The Fair Labor Standards Act was adopted in 1938, setting a basic rate of 25 cents an hour for covered workers, to increase to 40 cents an hour over seven years. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 set a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour for covered workers, to increase to 40 cents an hour over seven years. Representative Mary Norton argued for the bill to help underpaid workers, reduce relief rolls, and spread employment. In the wake of World War II, there were discussions about expanding coverage under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Mary Norton testified at the FLSA hearings, highlighting the challenges of surviving on a wage of 40 cents an hour in 1947. She proposed a minimum wage of 65 cents an hour, stating it would not cause inflation given the current cost of living. Mary Norton proposed a minimum wage of 65 cents an hour during the FLSA hearings, citing the high cost of living as a factor. Chairman McConnell questioned the basis for determining the minimum wage, to which Norton emphasized the need to consider the cost of living for unorganized workers. Norton firmly believed that the minimum wage should be tied to the cost of living. McConnell proposed tying minimum wages to a cost-of-living index to avoid political fluctuations. Norton expressed willingness to support this idea, suggesting automatic adjustments based on changes in the cost of living. McConnell proposed tying minimum wages to a cost-of-living index to avoid political fluctuations. Labor Secretary Maurice Tobin was questioned about a minimum wage based on average wages, with Senator Taft suggesting 60 percent of the average wages in the field as a possible approach. Tobin and Taft discussed setting minimum wages at 60 percent of average wages in various industries, such as manufacturing and service. Tobin illustrated the concept using the example of minimum wages for different skill levels in the shoe industry. Senator Taft and Secretary Tobin discussed the possibility of setting a minimum wage based on the average wages paid to all American workers, rather than having to adjust it frequently to fit changing conditions. Secretary Tobin mentioned that the factory wage is currently around $55 a week. The average factory wage is $1.38 an hour, with service employees earning substantially lower. Senator Taft and Secretary Tobin considered setting a minimum wage based on average wages paid to all American workers, rather than adjusting it frequently. Representative Hays emphasized the importance of considering the cost of living in determining the minimum wage. Hays discussed the importance of a cost of living provision in determining the minimum wage, citing a study by Gustav Peck on tying the minimum wage to the cost of living index. Peck's study highlighted the need for flexibility in minimum-wage legislation, emphasizing that wages fluctuate in response to various factors in a progressive society. Peck emphasized the impact of changes in the cost of living on the statutory minimum wage, highlighting the need for flexibility in minimum-wage legislation. Labor spokesmen pushed for a general revision of the minimum wage to be more realistic and proposed the inclusion of an escalator in any new law. Congress had resisted raising the minimum wage, with efforts to do so during post-war Congresses failing due to inaction. Labor spokesmen advocated for a general revision of the minimum wage, suggesting the inclusion of an escalator in new legislation. They argued that factors like cost of living, industry wages, profits, and productivity should determine the minimum wage. Some proposed that if prices decreased, the minimum wage should also decrease. Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of a wage board in adjusting the minimum wage promptly compared to Congress. During the late 1930s and war years, the issue of statutory minimum wages lagging behind increasing prices and living costs persisted. Peck highlighted the limitations of Wage Board technique in adjusting minimum wages, emphasizing the need for real flexibility to prevent industry contraction and unemployment during a depression. He suggested that indexation could be considered if wage rates could adjust both up and down at the right timing. Representative Wingate Lucas introduced a new minimum wage bill with a flexible minimum tied to the cost of living index to adjust wages based on inflation and deflation. He promoted the bill as a solution for stabilized employment and urged others to support it. Lucas introduced a minimum wage bill with a flexible minimum tied to the cost of living index. There was disagreement among constituencies, with employee groups favoring a fixed minimum wage while employers preferred a fixed figure that does not vary with the cost of living. Representative Charles Bennett (D-FL) supported a minimum wage tied to a cost-of-living formula, with exemptions for small businesses and regional variations in living costs. A bill by Representative John Lesinski (D-MI) replaced the original Lucas bill and was adopted by the House, leading to a flexible minimum wage system. Senator Allen Ellender proposed indexation of the federal minimum wage, urging an increase from 40 cents to 65 cents an hour with caution to avoid negative economic consequences. Senator Allen Ellender proposed increasing the federal minimum wage from 40 cents to 65 cents an hour, with a ban on flexibility in future calculations. He argued that the original 40 cent figure, if indexed, would be equivalent to a 66-cent minimum today. Ellender expressed frustration with the slow legislative process and objected to wage board procedures for changing statutory wages. Senator Allen Ellender objected to wage board procedures for changing statutory wages and proposed increasing the federal minimum wage to 65 cents an hour, with a ban on flexibility in future calculations. He suggested indexing the original 40 cent figure to be equivalent to a 66-cent minimum today. Ellender also read testimony endorsing a statutory plan tying minimum wage to living costs based on Bureau of Labor Statistics indices. The American Farm Bureau Federation opposes any increase in the maximum basic wage not tied to a cost-of-living index. They propose adjusting the minimum wage based on a flexible formula linked to the cost-of-living index. This approach would ensure that the minimum wage adjusts according to changes in the cost of living. Senator Ellender argued for a flexible minimum wage law, while Senator Taft believed in a fixed minimum wage with potential indexation in the future. Taft expressed concerns about using the cost of living as the sole basis for determining wages, citing its variability among individuals and families. The minimum wage debate in 1949 saw Senator Ellender proposing a 70 cents minimum wage amendment, which was ultimately rejected with a vote of 25 yeas to 51 nays. Despite this, the minimum wage was eventually raised to 75 cents an hour in 1949. In 1949, Congress considered adjusting the minimum wage with circumspection. The 84th Congress discussed exemptions, exceptions, and a potential FLSA expansion. Representative Graham Barden and Senator Paul Douglas proposed a $1.00 minimum wage citing the cost of living and productivity as factors. Senator Paul Douglas proposed raising the minimum wage to just over $1.00 an hour, taking into account the increase in the cost of living and productivity. He emphasized the need for a gradual increase to avoid shocks to industries and firms, suggesting a new method for future adjustments based on recommendations regarding changes in various economic factors. The House passed a stripped-down $1.00 minimum wage increase after two days of debate, sending the bill back to the Senate for adoption. The House passed a $1.00 minimum wage increase bill (P.L. 84-381) in 1961, 1966, and 1974, extending coverage to millions of workers and increasing the minimum wage to $2.30 per hour by 1976. Indexation was a recurring theme, but not a major issue during these amendments. In 1975, Representative John Dent introduced a bill to increase the minimum wage to $3.00 per hour with an indexation formula based on the Consumer Price Index. AFL-CIO's Andrew Biemiller supported the escalator provision to maintain purchasing power, while John Erlenborn opposed indexation, blaming wage demands for inflation. Organized labor set the stage for events that followed, with the Chamber of Commerce opposing indexation based on the Consumer Price Index for minimum wage increases. They argued that it would worsen inflation and increase unemployment. Several experts and organizations expressed strong opposition to indexing based on the Consumer Price Index for minimum wage increases. Carl Madden from the Chamber of Commerce called it \"genuinely terrifying,\" while Donald White from the American Retail Federation warned it could add momentum to inflation. Carl Beck from the National Small Business Association criticized the CPI as an inaccurate measure of wage rates. James McLamore from the National Restaurant Association argued that using the CPI for wage adjustments would represent a fundamental policy change. McLamore and others in the industry opposed indexing minimum wage increases to the Consumer Price Index, arguing that it would hinder productivity and merit increase systems. Abraham Weiss from the Department of Labor also expressed negative views on indexation during the 1975 hearings. The Congressman expressed the need for a mechanism other than periodic legislative enactments to ensure workers in certain categories do not rely on food stamps and welfare payments. Various submissions were made for the record, with interest in indexation. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America suggested greater flexibility and an escalator provision for adjusting rates, but noted that indexation would not eliminate the need to revise the basic rate. The focus seemed to shift from the minimum wage to the mechanism for its increase. The AGC and Farm Bureau criticized indexation as legislating inflation permanently, while Mr. Steak, Inc. called the proposal ill-advised. Congressman Dent postponed his bill for a year to consider all aspects of the legislation. In 1977, he introduced a new bill to increase the minimum wage. In February 1977, Representative Dent introduced H.R. 3744 to increase the minimum wage and repeal the tip credit, with provisions for automatic adjustments. The hearings included testimony from AFL-CIO's Andrew J. Biemiller and industry witnesses, advocating for an immediate raise to $3 an hour with indexation at 60% of average hourly earnings in manufacturing. Biemiller advocated for an immediate raise to $3 an hour with indexation at 60% of average hourly earnings in manufacturing, stating that it would boost the economy. He dismissed concerns about disemployment impact, citing reports from Secretaries of Labor showing minimal adverse effects. Industry witnesses argued against indexing the minimum wage to manufacturing wages, predicting it would fuel inflation. Hutchens and O'Malley argued against indexing the minimum wage to manufacturing earnings, fearing inflation. Dent, considering economic impact, gathered diverse views from research economists. He saw the minimum wage as a catch-up mechanism and preferred a balanced approach. Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall, an economist, analyzed the situation. Labor Secretary Ray Marshall, an economist in the Carter cabinet, proposed increasing the minimum wage to $2.50 per hour on July 1, 1977, with annual indexing starting in 1978. This proposal aimed to provide regular wage increases and eliminate the irregular pattern of adjustments, allowing businesses to anticipate and adjust wage costs more accurately. Labor Secretary Ray Marshall proposed increasing the minimum wage to $2.50 per hour on July 1, 1977, with annual indexing starting in 1978 to provide regular wage increases and reduce erosion of real income. Marshall's proposal represented a major departure from previous methods of adjusting the minimum wage, prompting a response from Congress. Representative Erlenborn questioned the Administration's endorsement of indexing, suggesting it reflected an inflationary psychology. However, Marshall clarified that indexing would not become a permanent fixture. Labor Secretary Ray Marshall proposed increasing the minimum wage to $2.50 per hour on July 1, 1977, with annual indexing starting in 1978 to provide regular wage increases and reduce erosion of real income. Marshall's proposal represented a major departure from previous methods of adjusting the minimum wage. Representative Joseph Gaydos and others criticized the Department's position on minimum wage, expressing disappointment and questioning the adequacy of the treatment of the problem. Congressman Dent mentioned Senator Taft's suggestion of putting minimum wage on a permanent increment base. Labor Secretary Ray Marshall proposed increasing the minimum wage to $2.50 per hour on July 1, 1977, with annual indexing starting in 1978 to provide regular wage increases. Congressman Dent criticized the recommendation of a $3.36 per hour minimum wage, stating it was out of line. Senate hearings began on S. 1871 to raise the minimum wage to $2.65 an hour in January 1978 and index it to 53 percent of average hourly earnings. Senator Williams emphasized the impact of inflation on poor workers and their families. Senator Javits reluctantly agreed to indexing. Senator Javits reluctantly agreed to indexing as a means to fight inflation, noting that many agreements and benefits are already indexed. Labor Secretary Marshall emphasized the importance of indexation in protecting minimum-wage workers and allowing employers to plan for wage adjustments. The President supported the minimum wage proposal included in the bill, which is now moving through Congress. Labor Secretary Marshall emphasized the importance of indexation in protecting minimum-wage workers and enabling employers to plan for wage adjustments. AFL-CIO president George Meany urged Congress to increase the minimum wage to $3 an hour and include an automatic mechanism to maintain it at 60 percent of average hourly earnings in manufacturing. Labor Secretary Marshall and AFL-CIO president George Meany advocated for increasing the minimum wage to $3 an hour and implementing an automatic mechanism to maintain it at 60 percent of average hourly earnings in manufacturing. Meany argued that the current system leads to minimum wage workers sinking further into poverty, while Robert Thompson of the Chamber of Commerce criticized the proposed indexation formula as bad economic policy. The Senate hearings discussed the proposal for indexing the minimum wage to address cost-push problems in the economy and criticized the current system for not adjusting to economic conditions. Various stakeholders suggested conducting a detailed study on the potential impact of indexing the minimum wage and establishing a Presidential Blue Ribbon Study Commission. The Senate hearings focused on the proposal for indexing the minimum wage. Economists testified, with Robert R. Nathan supporting indexing to protect low-wage workers from wage erosion. Walter Galenson, a professor of economics, also provided insights. Walter Galenson, professor of economics at Cornell University, discussed the lack of reliable quantitative work on the minimum wage during the 40th anniversary hearing of the Fair Labor Standards Act. He highlighted the benefits of the Act to low-wage workers and expressed reservations about wage indexing. Galenson expressed concerns about wage indexing, noting its challenges in countries that have practiced it for long periods. He acknowledged the need for protection for low-paid American workers, many of whom are not unionized. Levitan supported the concept of preventing minimum wage erosion due to inflation and wage increases, suggesting an index set at 50 percent of the average manufacturing wage. He viewed the bill as a workable compromise. The bill is seen as a workable compromise, with concerns raised about automation exacerbating issues with the minimum wage law. Thomas Sowell emphasized the importance of monitoring the effects on vulnerable individuals and criticized the U.S. Department of Labor for not critically evaluating minimum wage impacts. He called for a reevaluation of the minimum wage policy. Marvin Kosters and Walter Williams, from the American Enterprise Institute, expressed concerns about the impact of minimum wage policies. Kosters focused on the youth sub-minimum wage and suggested fixed increments over indexation for reassessment. Williams also emphasized the need for periodic reassessment of minimum wage policy. Walter Williams of Temple University, like Kosters, focused on the youth sub-minimum wage and expressed concerns about the rise in minimum wage leading to increased youth unemployment. Minimum wage legislation was considered by the House on September 14-15, 1977, with Senate consideration scheduled for October 6-7, 1977. Representative Phillip Burton introduced the minimum wage measure (H.R. 3744) with support from Representative Erlenborn and Perkins. The bill introduced by the Chair of the Committee on Education and Labor aimed to raise the federal minimum wage to $2.65 per hour after January 1, 1978, with indexation. Erlenborn criticized the bill, stating it replaces Congress' judgment with a mindless indexing formula that will continuously increase the minimum wage. Erlenborn proposed step increases for the minimum wage bill, arguing that indexation would be removed. Representative Quie supported the bill, linking the minimum wage to economic forces. He believed this approach was wiser than past practices. Erlenborn proposed removing indexation from the minimum wage bill, which was supported by a recorded vote resulting in 223 ayes to 193 nays. Representative Perkins then proposed an amendment to create a Minimum Wage Study Commission to analyze the economic consequences of automatic wage increases based on earnings index. Perkins highlighted past minimum wage increases, stating the current rate is $2.30. Perkins proposed a Commission to study automatic wage increases based on earnings index, with the proposal being adopted by a vote of 301 ayes to 118 nays. Despite debate, a new initiative by Phillip Burton was defeated along with indexation. Senator Williams then brought up the Senate version of the minimum wage amendments for floor debate. The Committee on Human Resources produced a bill with an indexation formula for minimum wage amendments (S. 1871), but it was removed during floor debate. Senator Williams decided to forego indexing due to concerns, with Senator Hatch commending the decision. Senator Tower criticized the removal, calling it \"back-door indexing.\" The Fair Labor Standards Act amendments of 1977 were passed without indexing provision. The Fair Labor Standards Act amendments of 1977 established a Minimum Wage Study Commission (MWSC) to explore the economic consequences of indexation. The Commission produced a seven-volume report before ceasing to exist in 1981, with a cost of $17 million. Former Congressman James O'Hara was the Chairman, leading a panel of representatives from industry, labor, and the public. The key issue in indexation was the purpose of the minimum wage, focusing on the post-World War II years. During the post-World War II years, the Minimum Wage Study Commission explored the impact of legislated minimum wage increases from the 1950s to the 1970s. While these increases improved purchasing power in the 1950s and 1960s, minimum wage earners in the 1970s saw a decline in purchasing power. Low-income workers, especially minimum wage workers, were unable to save enough to offset the erosion of their earnings' purchasing power. The earlier minimum wage increases were not sufficient to buffer against the high inflation of the 1970s and 1980s, as Congress did not anticipate economic phenomena like the oil crisis. The Commission discussed the pros and cons of indexation as a possible solution. The Report discussed the implementation of indexation and its impact on employment and corporate profits. It concluded that there is no ideal formula for indexation, but gradual adjustments in labor costs are more favorable for firms. If indexation had been tied to hourly earnings growth, the long-term effects on inflation, profits, and GDP would have been small but beneficial. The Commission found that the present minimum wage system has not maintained purchasing power. The Commission recommended indexing the minimum wage based on average hourly earnings in the private economy and adjusting it annually based on the previous year's overall rate of change in this index. This approach would have a small beneficial effect on the economy in the long run and could be non-inflationary if implemented regularly and predictably. The report recommended indexing the minimum wage to average hourly earnings in the private economy and adjusting it annually based on the previous year's overall rate of change in this index. S. Warne Robinson, representing industry on the Commission, argued that the minimum wage trade-off includes higher wages for some workers, fewer job opportunities for others, and higher prices for everyone. Robinson criticized the majority for not considering economic facts uncovered in studies. Robinson criticized the Commission's recommendation for automatic annual increases in the minimum wage, calling it inflationary and a refusal to address the underlying causes of inflation. He argued that this would deepen inflationary forces in the economy at the worst possible time. Robinson criticized the flaws of indexing, stating it leads to income redistribution and worsens employment prospects for low-skilled workers. He argued that inflation affects everyone negatively, including those supposedly protected by an index. Additionally, he warned against federal wage-setting, which creates inefficiencies in the labor market. Michael Wachter, a professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania, disagreed with the Commission's decision to index minimum wages on a general wage rate instead of a price index. He argued that the lack of a specified appropriate index was a significant issue, as all available indexes have serious weaknesses. Wachter believed that indexing minimum wages would result in surrendering control not only of the minimum wage level but also of the cost of the minimum wage policy. The decision to index minimum wages is a complex issue, with concerns about the choice of index and its potential impact on employers and workers. Phyllis Ann Wallace, an economics professor at MIT, highlighted flaws in proposed indexes and cautioned against immediate implementation. The Minimum Wage Study Commission's report was met with skepticism, with Wallace and others questioning the feasibility of indexation at that time. Ronald Reagan's stance on the minimum wage was clear during the 1980 campaign, with plans to repeal or lower it if elected. After his victory, there were expectations of a confrontation over youth minimum wage cuts in Congress. During the Reagan years, there were debates in Congress over a youth sub-minimum wage proposal and a higher general minimum wage. Few initiatives were considered, and no wage increases occurred for minimum wage workers. The trade-off suggested by Representative Erlenborn seemed to hold, with no youth sub-minimum wage enacted. The American Enterprise Institute announced a three-year plan as the MWSC was being organized. The American Enterprise Institute (AEI) launched a three-year research program to evaluate the effects of the minimum wage, with Simon Rottenberg as director. AEI's publications countered the more liberal MWSC report on the minimum wage, focusing on different aspects. The MWSC report on minimum wage was ignored when it was published in 1981. By the end of the decade, it was considered outdated and used by both sides to support their perspectives. In early 1987, bills were introduced to raise the minimum wage, with H.R. 1834 proposing an increase to $4.65 and indexation. On April 9, 1987, a hearing was held on raising the minimum wage to $4.65 and indexing it. Representative Austin J. Murphy chaired the hearing, with Mario Biaggi endorsing indexation and urging Congress to move the bill forward. Gerald Kleczka proposed his own bill without indexation, with two 50-cent increases planned. Kleczka expressed concerns about complicating the legislation and the chances of a veto. Murphy questioned Kleczka's stance on mandatory increases and indexing. During hearings on raising the minimum wage in April 1987, there were differing opinions on indexing the wage. Representative Kleczka proposed a bill without indexation, expressing concerns about the likelihood of a veto. Witnesses had strong opinions on indexation, with some supporting it, like Mary Dublin Keyserling and Lane Kirkland. AFL-CIO president Kirkland also supported indexation in the House bill. Kirkland supported indexation in the House bill, stating it is necessary to prevent the minimum wage from deteriorating. Indexing would ensure gradual adjustments in line with rising wage levels, bringing certainty and stability. Senator Kennedy introduced the Minimum Wage Restoration Act of 1987, calling for indexing at 50% of average hourly earnings in manufacturing. Senator Kennedy initiated hearings on the Minimum Wage Restoration Act of 1987, emphasizing the success of past minimum wage adjustments. Testimony in the Senate hearings included concerns about indexing, with Senator Quayle and Senator Pell questioning its necessity. Secretary of Labor William Brock had a different stance on indexing compared to his predecessor, Secretary Marshall. In 1988, Secretary of Labor William Brock largely ignored concerns about indexing the minimum wage. Industry opposed indexation, while labor was more supportive. Economists presented differing views on increasing the minimum wage, with some in favor and others critical. It had been nearly eleven years since Congress last acted to raise the minimum wage. In 1988, Congress had not increased the minimum wage for eleven years, causing workers to fall behind due to inflation. The House Subcommittee on Labor Standards debated removing indexation from H.R. 1834, with disagreements between members on the issue. Representative Timothy Penny wanted indexation removed, while Hawkins supported it. The dispute centered on indexation versus congressional oversight, with concerns raised about the size of the increase and indexing in the bill during a Subcommittee meeting on March 3. The Subcommittee debated the wage measure and voted 6-3 to report the bill to the full committee without the indexation provision. The Committee on Education and Labor later adopted a bill with a fourth increase in the minimum wage to $5.05. AFL-CIO lobbyist Jay Power mentioned that the final increase made losing the vote on indexation easier, but they hoped to restore it later. The House bill (H.R. 1834) did not come to the floor after delays. The Senate, led by Kennedy, began mark-up on S. 837 with a final rate of $4.55 per hour. The bill initially included indexing but it was later dropped. Presidential candidate George H. W. Bush supported a slight increase in the minimum wage, while President Reagan might consider an increase with a training wage. This compromise did not please everyone. In a new compromise, a training wage was included in the minimum wage bill, angering critics. Senator Hatch expressed frustration that efforts to educate the public about the dangers of raising the minimum wage were undermined. Labor refused to support the bill with a training wage. Despite failed cloture attempts, the bill was pulled from the floor in late September. In the 101st Congress, new minimum wage legislation was introduced with a focus on indexation. Hawkins introduced a bill to restore the minimum wage to a fair rate on January 3, 1989. The bill proposed an increase in the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour by December 31, 1991, along with other wage/hour changes and the creation of a Minimum Wage Review Board. Despite discussions on the impact of the wage increase and a sub-minimum wage for youth, the Board was not mentioned during hearings. The Committee on Education and Labor reported the bill on March 20, 1989, with some criticism towards the Board. The Minimum Wage Review Board proposed in March 20, 1989, would consist of five members tasked with analyzing economic data and making recommendations to Congress on adjusting the minimum wage to preserve its purchasing power. The Board aimed to prevent neglect of the minimum wage issue and provide expert advice on the economic impact of wage proposals. The proposed Minimum Wage Review Board aimed to advise Congress on adjusting the minimum wage to maintain its purchasing power. Views on the Board were mixed, with some supporting the objective economic data it would provide for bipartisan support, while others expressed concerns about potential annual pay increases. The proposed Minimum Wage Review Board was criticized for potentially leading to annual pay increases, with some lawmakers expressing concerns about delegating authority to an unelected commission. Representative Goodling called it a \"backdoor indexing mechanism\" that could result in the same issue being brought up repeatedly each year. The House adopted a Murphy substitute containing the Minimum Wage Review Board, with a vote of 248 yeas to 171 nays. The Senate-passed bill omitted the Review Board, but a conference committee sustained it, making it part of the final bill. The Board would have been a congressional entity with five congressional appointees. The conference report highlighted the importance of the Minimum Wage Review Board in assisting Congress with its oversight responsibilities over the FLSA. Representative Hawkins described the bill as a necessary step towards ensuring fair wages for low-paid workers, despite President Bush threatening a veto. Representative Goodling expressed skepticism about the bill's chances of passing. The House adopted the conference report on increasing the minimum wage with 247 ayes to 172 nays. In the Senate, Senator Kennedy supported the increase without mentioning indexation, while Senator Hatch raised concerns about \"backdoor indexing\" and the Minimum Wage Review Board's role in recommending annual increases. On June 13, 1989, the House adopted a conference report for a minimum wage increase with 247 ayes to 172 nays. President Bush vetoed the bill, citing concerns about job opportunities, inflation, and helping those in poverty. President Bush vetoed the minimum wage increase bill, stating that it would not help those in poverty and would result in job losses. He criticized the training wage included in the bill as ineffective and too short. He also objected to the provision requiring annual recommendations for increasing the minimum wage based on inflation. The veto override fell to the House, with parties split on the decision. Representative Charles Hayes was involved in the discussions. The House attempted to override President Bush's veto of the minimum wage increase bill. Representative Charles Hayes criticized the President's action as \"outrageous,\" while Representative Cass Ballenger supported the veto, stating that the focus should be on minimizing poverty. Despite a series of speeches, the override attempt failed with a vote of 247 ayes to 178 nays, falling short of the two-thirds majority needed. The issue of indexation was not raised during the debate. Following the veto, there was confusion in Congress regarding a joint House-Senate hearing on the minimum wage. Labor Secretary Dole could not testify at a joint House-Senate hearing on the minimum wage due to scheduling issues. New legislation was introduced in the Senate (S. 1182) and later in the House (H.R. 2710) as a basis for accommodation with the White House. The House Subcommittee on Labor Standards approved a bill with a $4.25 minimum wage limit on September 14, 1989. Despite this accommodation, negotiations with the White House continued, leading to the introduction of a substitute bill. A substitute bill was introduced and reported, giving the President the lower minimum wage rate he sought, a training wage for youth, an expanded small business exemption, and an increase in tip credit provisions. The measure passed in the House with 382 ayes to 37 nays and in the Senate with 89 yeas to 8 nays, signed into law on November 17, 1989 (P.L. 101-157). Key figures involved in minimum wage indexation retired from Congress in the 1980s and 1990s, suggesting a shift away from the issue. In 1938, federal minimum wage legislation was established with regular step increases. The minimum wage rate fluctuated based on economic conditions, maintaining its value at times but declining in real terms during certain periods. Since 1997, the federal minimum wage has remained at $5.15, with a proposed increase to $7.25 per hour. The federal minimum wage has remained at $5.15 since 1997, with a proposed increase to $7.25 per hour. Some states have higher minimum wages, with a few implementing indexation. Proposals for indexation of the minimum wage have been made since 1992, but none have been enacted as stand-alone legislation. Since 1992, proposals for indexing the minimum wage to the cost of living have been introduced but not enacted as stand-alone legislation. Representative George Miller introduced H.R. 6067 in 1992 and H.R. 281 in 1993 to index the minimum wage to the cost of living, emphasizing the need for a living wage to support families. Representative Bernard Sanders introduced H.R. 692 in 1993, proposing to increase the minimum wage to $5.00 and index it to the Social Security formula. He highlighted the struggles of millions of Americans working full-time but unable to maintain a decent standard of living, pointing out the reliance on food stamps and other programs to make ends meet. Sanders emphasized the need to address low wages that are subsidized by taxpayers. Senator Paul Wellstone introduced a bill in 1993 to raise the minimum wage to $6.75 and tie it to inflation, ensuring it would not erode over time. The bill aimed to gradually restore the value of the minimum wage and prevent it from being affected by inflation or congressional inaction. The bill introduced by Senator Sanders in 1995 aimed to permanently tie the minimum wage to one-half of average hourly U.S. private sector wages. It proposed an increase to $5.50 an hour by December 30, 1995, with indexing under the Social Security formula. Senator Kennedy also introduced a bill to raise the minimum wage to $5.75 an hour by September 1, 1997, and establish a Commission to study the minimum wage. The Commission, consisting of 9 members appointed by Secretaries of Labor, Commerce, and Health and Human Services, was tasked with studying and recommending ways to restore the minimum wage to its previous level relative to the average hourly wage from 1950 to 1980. The report was due by September 1, 1997, with members serving without compensation. Senator Wellstone introduced a bill to increase the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour in steps. The Wellstone bill proposed increasing the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour in steps, with indexing based on average hourly earnings. Representative Sanders introduced the \"Liveable Wage Act of 1997\" to raise the minimum wage to $6.50 after December 30, 1997, adjusting it annually based on Social Security benefits. Senator Kennedy introduced S. 1573 on January 1, 1998. Senator Kennedy introduced S. 1573 on January 1, 1998, to raise the minimum wage to $6.65 per hour and index it to the Consumer Price Index. Representative David Bonior introduced a similar bill in the House, H.R. 3100, with 107 co-sponsors. Representative Sanders later introduced H.R. 627 to raise the minimum wage to $6.50 by December 30, 1999. The minimum wage was proposed to increase to $6.15 per hour by September 1, 2001, with indexation based on the Consumer Price Index starting in 2002. Additional provisions included a 4% annual increase cap and a safeguard against the wage dropping below the previous year's level. Another bill aimed to raise the minimum wage to $8.15 per hour by January 1, 2003. The minimum wage was proposed to increase to $8.15 per hour by January 1, 2003, with indexation based on the Consumer Price Index. Bills introduced by Representative Chris Bell and Senator Hillary Clinton aimed to further increase the minimum wage to $7.00 and $7.25 per hour, respectively, with automatic adjustments. Senator Hillary Clinton introduced a bill to increase the federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, with automatic adjustments based on the annual rate of pay for Members of Congress. Representative Al Green also proposed indexation of the minimum wage in a separate bill. The bill proposed by Senator Hillary Clinton aimed to increase the federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour with automatic adjustments. The Secretary of Labor would determine the minimum wage rate annually, ensuring it is 12 percent higher than the Federal poverty threshold for a two-person household. If the determined rate is lower than the existing minimum wage, no adjustment would be made. Senator Clinton introduced a bill to raise the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour by 2011 and index it to Congressional salary increases. In the 110th Congress, legislation was passed to increase the federal minimum wage without addressing indexation. Minimum wage workers often accept low-wage jobs due to lack of alternative opportunities. Some stay in entry-level positions for a lifetime, not by choice. In the workforce, minimum wage workers may not be union members and often earn only the minimum wage required by law. Congressional action sporadically determines their wages, with gaps in mandating increases possibly due to the belief that the minimum wage is bad public policy or competing national priorities. For proponents of a higher minimum wage, indexation could provide regular wage increases for workers, automatically adjusting for inflation. However, not indexing the minimum wage allows some employers to avoid paying higher wages. Indexation may also reduce the need for oversight of worker remuneration but could lead to lower union involvement. Indexation could potentially eliminate the need for oversight of worker remuneration and discussions on topics like overtime pay and child labor. It may also lead to a periodic review of the minimum wage among Members of Congress, with some claiming credit for wage increases and others opposing them. However, the question remains whether indexation would truly resolve the issue of minimum wage increases, as different formulas could lead to new campaigns for adjustments. Some considerations for indexation include the need for adjustments, the possibility of automatic wage changes during economic fluctuations, the impact on other policies like trade and immigration, the relationship between productivity and wage increases, and the role of indexation in addressing inflation for lower wage workers. Indexation is seen as a way for lower wage workers to deal with the cost of living, but it is also viewed as a potential cause of inflation. States have been experimenting with indexation systems, which could have implications for policy makers."
