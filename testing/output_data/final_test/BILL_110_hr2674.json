    "content": "The \"Children's Act for Responsible Employment of 2007\" or the \"CARE Act of 2007\" includes provisions such as revised age requirements for child agricultural employment, increased civil penalties for child labor violations, special criminal penalties for aggravated child labor violations, reporting on work-related injuries to children, employer reporting requirements, pesticide-related worker protection standards, and application of Fair Labor Standards Amendments. Revised age requirement for child agricultural employment and repeal of waiver provision for hand harvest laborers. The Fair Labor Standards Act is amended to exempt employees under 16 years old working in agriculture from child labor provisions if employed by a parent or guardian on their farm outside of school hours. Additionally, the waiver provision for hand harvest laborers is repealed. Increased civil penalties for child labor violations. Section 16(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to increase civil penalties for violations related to serious work-related injuries or illnesses, ranging from $500 to $100,000 depending on the severity and repetition of the violation. SEC. 4 amends the Fair Labor Standards Act to impose criminal penalties for repeated violations resulting in death or disability of employees under 18. SEC. 5 introduces a new section for reporting work-related injuries to children. The Secretary will analyze data on children under 18 working in agriculture, focusing on serious work-related injuries, illnesses, and deaths. Sources include Department of Labor, State agencies, and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Definitions include 'serious lost-time work-related injury' for employees under 18. The Secretary will submit an annual report to Congress summarizing data on child labor in agriculture, including serious work-related injuries and illnesses for employees under 18. The report will also evaluate the status of child labor and related safety and health hazards. The Secretary will report to Congress on child labor in agriculture, including potential violations of employing children under 18. SEC. 6. EMPLOYER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to include a new section on employer reporting requirements. Employers must report serious lost-time work-related injuries, illnesses, or deaths of employees under 18 in agriculture to the Secretary within five days. The report should include employer and employee details, as well as information about the incident. Employers must report serious lost-time work-related injuries, illnesses, or deaths of employees under 18 in agriculture to the Secretary within five days. The report should include details about the injury, illness, or death of the employee, and any other information required by the Secretary. Failure to report may result in a civil penalty of up to $7,000 per violation. The terms 'serious lost-time work-related injury' and 'serious lost-time work-related illness' are defined in section 12A. SEC. 7. PESTICIDE-RELATED WORKER PROTECTION STANDARD. The Secretary of Labor must incorporate the worker protection standard for workers exposed to pesticides into the child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act within 180 days of this Act. Any revisions to the standard must also be included. Additionally, civil penalties under the Fair Labor Standards Act are reconciled with new subsections added to Section 16. The civil penalty imposed by the Secretary for a violation of the Act can be offset by the EPA Administrator against a penalty for violating the worker protection standard. This applies if the violations involve the same conduct affecting the same child workers. The Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act allows the Secretary to offset a civil penalty for violating section 12 of the Act if the violation involves the same conduct affecting the same child workers as a previous penalty. SEC. 8. APPLICATION OF FAIR LABOR STANDARDS AMENDMENTS. The Secretary of Labor must issue final rules within 180 days of the Act's enactment to implement the amendments. Violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act after the rules take effect will be subject to the amendments. State laws providing greater protections for employees will not be preempted. Employer reporting requirements under section 12B of the Act will apply. The final rules under section 12B of the Fair Labor Standards Act will take effect when issued under subsection (a)."
