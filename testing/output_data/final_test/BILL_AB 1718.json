    "title": "AB 1718",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 368 of the Penal Code is amended to provide special protections for crimes against elders and dependent adults, similar to those for minor children, due to their potential vulnerabilities. Any person who knows or reasonably should know that an elder or dependent adult is being harmed or endangered, and willfully causes or permits such suffering, is punishable by imprisonment or a fine. If a victim suffers great bodily injury in the commission of an offense, the defendant will receive additional prison time based on the victim's age. If the defendant causes the death of the victim, they will receive a longer additional term in prison based on the victim's age. If a victim is 70 years or older, the offender will receive an additional seven years in prison. Any person who knowingly causes an elder or dependent adult to suffer unjustifiable physical or mental pain is guilty of a misdemeanor. Repeat offenses can result in a fine or imprisonment. Any person who violates theft, embezzlement, forgery, or fraud laws with respect to an elder or dependent adult, knowing the victim's status, faces fines up to $10,000 or imprisonment for two to four years if the value of the property exceeds $950. Any caretaker of an elder or dependent adult who commits theft, embezzlement, forgery, fraud, or identity theft involving the victim's property or personal information may face a fine of up to $2,500 or imprisonment in a county jail for up to one year. Any person who commits theft, embezzlement, forgery, fraud, or identity theft involving an elder or dependent adult may face imprisonment in a county jail for up to one year or in the state prison for two to four years, depending on the value of the property taken. False imprisonment of an elder or dependent adult using violence, menace, fraud, or deceit is punishable by imprisonment for two to four years. In this section, \"elder\" refers to a person aged 65 or older, while \"dependent adult\" refers to someone between 18 and 64 with physical or mental limitations. A \"caretaker\" is defined as a person responsible for the care or custody of an elder or dependent adult. In cases of violating these provisions, the court may require counseling as a condition of probation, with the defendant responsible for the costs. The court will consider the defendant's ability to pay and won't deny probation based on financial constraints. Upon conviction for certain violations, the court may issue a restraining order against the defendant for up to 10 years to protect the victim and their family, regardless of the defendant's sentence. The length of the order is based on the seriousness of the offense and the likelihood of future violations."
