    "content": "The U.S. Border Patrol, under CBP and DHS, faces challenges in defining a secure border. Metrics are used to measure border security effectiveness, including tracking unauthorized migrant entries and apprehensions. These data inform decision-making and are crucial for evaluating border security. Border security is defined by CBP as having visibility and capacity to respond to border activities. Metrics are used at strategic and operational levels to assess effectiveness and efficiency. Border Patrol identifies risks and allocates resources accordingly to secure the border. Understanding the security risks at the border and developing methods to measure Border Patrol performance are crucial for congressional oversight. Metrics at strategic and operational levels aim to provide Congress with a sense of border security, despite challenges in determining unauthorized border flows. The report reviews the use of metrics at the department and agency level to measure border security and inform legislation. It discusses performance metrics at the strategic level, metrics used by DHS and INS since the early 2000s, and Border Patrol's operational level metrics. The report concludes with potential issues for Congress to consider when evaluating border security measures. The Appendix provides information on data and methodologies recommended by scholars and think tanks for evaluating border security measures. DHS has developed various performance metrics over the years, but there has been little continuity for historical assessment. Recently, DHS has been working on a new metric to estimate unauthorized entry of migrants into the US, although it may be influenced by external factors and not directly measure border security. DHS has been developing new performance metrics to better measure border security, such as the \"border conditions index\" (BCI) announced in 2011. These metrics aim to estimate the effectiveness of Border Patrol in apprehending and deterring migrants from re-entering the United States. In 2013, DHS officials discontinued the development of the Border Conditions Index (BCI) as a comprehensive measure of border security. Instead, in FY2015, DHS began developing a new metric to estimate unauthorized entry into the United States, focusing on migration. This metric aims to provide a baseline figure for future performance estimates and inform strategic decision-making. DHS has commissioned the Institute for Defense Analyses to estimate unauthorized entry of migrants into the US using the capture-recapture method. This method calculates the probability of apprehension for migrants attempting to cross the border, based on observable enforcement data. The Institute for Defense Analyses was commissioned by DHS to estimate unauthorized migrant entry into the US using the capture-recapture method, which calculates apprehension probabilities based on enforcement data. However, the model's limitations include fixed migrant pools, uniform apprehension probabilities, and the assumption that migrants will keep trying until successful, not factoring in deterrence efforts. This metric does not directly measure border security effectiveness due to external migration factors. DHS is working to incorporate deterrence into their calculations. DHS is incorporating deterrence into their estimates of unauthorized migrant entry by using a survey that measures characteristics, volumes, tendencies, and effects of migrant flows between the US and Mexico. The survey, EMIF Norte, provides information on various migrant populations. DHS is also developing two other methods to validate their estimates. DHS is developing new methods to validate estimates of unauthorized migrant entry, including using the ENOE survey and an econometric analysis of apprehension records. These measurements will be included in the State of the Border report alongside the BorderStat Report. DHS is also evaluating the performance of border security technology. The 2014 GAO report found that CBP lacks performance metrics to evaluate how technologies contribute to border security. DHS databases track \"asset assists\" but data is incomplete as Border Patrol agents are not required to record them. GAO recommends tracking asset assists to assess technology effectiveness. DHS will analyze border investments' impact on unauthorized entries in FY2016. The study focuses on unauthorized entries and forecasts future entries, analyzing the effectiveness of CBP border investments. DHS uses performance metrics like recidivism rate and interdiction effectiveness to assess border security efforts. Border Patrol has tracked unique subjects apprehended since 2000. Since 2000, the Border Patrol has monitored unique subjects apprehended using biometric data to calculate the recidivism rate along the Southwest border. This rate is used to evaluate the effectiveness of deterring unauthorized crossings, but it has limitations, such as not considering the distance from migrants' source countries to the US border. The recidivism rate along the Southwest border is influenced by factors like the distance from migrants' source countries to the US border, deterrence, and apprehension rates. Changes in these factors can impact the recidivism rate, making it challenging to assess the effectiveness of border security measures. Border Patrol's interdiction effectiveness rate along the Southwest border has fluctuated over the years, from 29% in FY2007 to 14% in FY2014 and FY2015. The goal set by DHS for this metric was less than 17% for FY2015-2017. This rate measures the percentage of detected unauthorized entrants who are apprehended or turned back. The target for interdiction effectiveness was 80% for FY2015 and 81% for FY2016 and FY2017 according to DHS's Annual Performance Report. The Border Patrol's interdiction effectiveness rate for FY2015-2017 was set at 80% for FY2015 and 81% for FY2016 and FY2017. This metric is used to evaluate the effectiveness of border security operations at the tactical level and to make strategic decisions. However, it has drawbacks such as being based only on observable events reported by the Border Patrol, which excludes undetected entries and allows for potential double counting. Additionally, the inclusion of turn back and got away data, which can vary across sectors, hinders the ability to compare rates across sectors. The federal government has collected immigration data since 1892, publicly reporting it since the 1950s. Various efforts have been made to expand data collection and develop performance metrics. DHS has used multiple performance metrics over the years, with a new one currently under development. The INS's annual performance reports established \"high priority entry corridors demonstrating optimal deterrence\" as a metric for border control. Optimum deterrence was defined as the level where adding more resources would not significantly increase arrests. Analyses were conducted for each corridor, with 11 corridors reaching optimum deterrence in FY2004. In 2005, operational control replaced optimum deterrence, defined as the prevention of all unauthorized entries. The 2006 Act (P.L. 109-367) defined operational control of the border as preventing all unlawful entries into the US, including by terrorists, illegal aliens, and contraband. By February 2010, 1,107 miles (57%) of the Southwest border were under operational control. However, after 2010, DHS stopped using operational control as a metric due to difficulties in assessing different border regions accurately. Instead, from 2011 to 2013, apprehensions were used as a performance metric for border security in annual reports. Apprehension data is used as a performance metric for border security in annual reports, but it has limitations. Factors outside of border security resources and tactics, such as immigration enforcement in transit countries and economic/political conditions, can affect the data. Apprehension data may not capture all migrants, as it excludes those who successfully enter the US or are deterred from entering. Additionally, the data may result in double counting of individuals apprehended multiple times. RAND noted that a measure reflecting performance changes has limited value as a management tool. The critique highlights that apprehension data may not inform program results or resource allocation decisions, leading to reduced oversight and accountability. Border Patrol uses risk assessments to estimate border risk, but these assessments are not used as metrics themselves. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes from incidents or events. The Border Patrol conducts risk assessments at an operational level to determine the level of risk in specific border sectors. These assessments inform decision-making on resource allocation and response, focusing on high-risk areas identified in the Border Patrol Strategic Plan. This plan utilizes a risk-based strategy, different from the resource-based approach in the previous National Border Patrol Strategy. The Border Patrol employs the \"State of the Border Risk Methodology\" to assess risks at the Southwest Border using intelligence, situational awareness, and risk methodology. Intelligence from U.S. agencies helps predict threats and proactive action, while situational awareness focuses on understanding conditions at specific locations. The Border Patrol increases situational awareness through traditional and technical methods, using geospatial intelligence in low activity areas. Geospatial intelligence technology detects activity, notifying sectors for investigation. Risk methodology includes 12 indicator metrics for apprehending migrants and seizing contraband. The Border Patrol uses various metrics to assess apprehensions and contraband seizures, reviewing them at the sector level for operational decisions. Standardized indicators are used to identify deviations from the norm, determining potential risks based on the level of deviation. The Border Patrol assesses risk levels based on deviations from the norm at the sector level. Intelligence is crucial in determining risk, with a focus on future outcomes. Congress should evaluate if current and new metrics effectively measure border security, such as DHS's unauthorized entry metric. The comprehensive metric of operational control may still be necessary for assessing border security. A clear measure of border security is essential for Congress to oversee CBP's performance. Congress should consider what oversight is needed for measuring effectiveness and setting meaningful thresholds for different metrics. Evaluating metrics at strategic and operational levels can help optimize resource allocation at the border. Congress could consider the allocation of funding for enforcement programs, implementation of metrics at operational and strategic levels, and the use of data and methodologies to measure border security. This includes assessing how changes at the departmental level impact Border Patrol agents' daily work and whether other metrics should be used to inform decision-making and strategy development. The unintended consequences and secondary effects of border security raise questions about the effectiveness of maintaining or changing security levels. Improved data and methodologies are needed to adjust measurements for shifting migrant demographics. Congress should also consider if DHS metrics account for actions of transit countries and capture correct data. Several pieces of legislation in the 114th Congress aim to enhance reporting and measurement requirements for DHS, including a Northern border threat analysis and the requirement for operational control of the Northern and Southern borders. Scholars and think tanks recommend collecting additional data and using varied methodologies for meaningful evaluation. The collection of additional data and varied methodologies is suggested to measure border security effectively. New data sources, such as survey data from interviews with migrants, can provide a more comprehensive view of unauthorized migration. Expanding on data collection and analysis methods can lead to new insights and perspectives on border security. The DHS commissioned a study on using surveys to estimate unauthorized border crossings, recommending the use of survey data along with enforcement data. RAND suggested using respondent-driven sampling for migrant surveys to account for social networks and recruitment patterns. RAND suggested using \"group answers\" in migrant surveys to address inaccurate responses and migrants' hesitation to participate. Surveys face limitations in sample representativeness and capturing migration metrics, especially with changing migrant populations. Adjustments in survey methodology may be needed for different source countries. Some suggest using models with proxy data like human smuggler fees to estimate unauthorized migrant flows. Border control effectiveness could impact smuggling fees, but other factors like risks, costs, and migrants' ability to pay also play a role. A model using proxy data must consider various factors. Some methodologies use enforcement data and population surveys to estimate unauthorized migrant flows between countries. Mexico's Censo de Poblaci\u00f3n y Vivienda could identify emigration risk factors by monitoring population demographics changes not explained by births or deaths. Comparisons across countries' surveys could estimate unauthorized migrant flows, but surveys have limitations like high costs and infrequent administration. Regression models can estimate the size of migrating populations and factors influencing migration decisions. Sizable samples and sensitivity to time periods and migrant cohorts are necessary for statistically significant results. Stratified sampling of border crossers by the Border Patrol can help estimate total apprehensions. The methodology of estimating total apprehensions at the border can improve Border Patrol performance by detecting new transportation routes and strategies. \"Red teaming\" involves recruiting migrants or agents to test the probability of interdiction in sampled areas."
