The Treasury of the United States receives energy development revenues totaling $8.6 billion for fiscal year 2022, $8.8 billion for fiscal year 2023, $9 billion for fiscal year 2024, $9 billion for fiscal year 2025, $9.1 billion for fiscal year 2026, $9.3 billion for fiscal year 2027, and $9.4 billion for fiscal year 2028. Energy development revenues include all revenues from oil, gas, coal, or other sources due to the United States. For fiscal years 2018 through 2027, a portion of energy development revenues will be deposited in the Fund, equal to half of the available receipts for each year.
