    "content": "The \"Aviation Biometric Technology Utilization Act\" may be cited as the short title. It focuses on the use of biometric technology in aviation. The Aviation Biometric Technology Utilization Act, in section 44903(h) of title 49, United States Code, mandates the issuance of guidance for the use of biometric technology in airport access control systems within 4 months. The Under Secretary, in consultation with the aviation industry, must establish technical and operational requirements for effective biometric systems. The Aviation Biometric Technology Utilization Act mandates guidance for effective, reliable, and secure biometric systems in airport access control. It includes procedures to prevent identity fraud, resolve enrollment issues, and best practices for integrating biometric technology into existing airport systems. Additionally, it addresses the use of biometric technology for law enforcement officer travel. The Under Secretary is required to establish a uniform biometric law enforcement officer travel credential by December 31, 2004, to verify identities without revealing their status as officers when carrying weapons on aircraft. The Under Secretary is mandated to create a biometric travel credential for law enforcement officers to verify their identities discreetly when carrying weapons on planes. Procedures will be established to ensure only government officers receive the credential, resolve enrollment issues, and invalidate lost or stolen credentials. The Under Secretary is authorized to issue a biometric travel credential to government law enforcement officers for carrying weapons on aircraft. Funding is available for this purpose. Biometric information refers to unique physical or behavioral characteristics used for identification. Biometrics technology enables automated identification based on unique physical or behavioral characteristics. Failure to enroll refers to the inability to enroll in a biometric system due to various reasons. False match occurs when one individual's biometric information is incorrectly matched to another individual's. Biometrics technology allows for automated identification based on unique physical or behavioral characteristics. False non-match refers to the rejection of a valid identity by a biometric system. The term 'secure area of an airport' includes the sterile area and the Secure Identification Display Area as defined in regulations. SEC. 3. Funding for biometric technology in airport access control systems is amended to include projects implementing biometric technologies. Authorization of appropriations is adjusted for fiscal years 2004-2007."
