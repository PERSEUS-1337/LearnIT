    "content": "The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 rewrites eligibility provisions for federal foster care and adoption assistance under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. This change, known as the Rosales provision, aims to reduce federal outlays to the foster care program by $380 million over five years and $863 million over 10 years. The Senate did not include this provision in the reconciliation legislation it approved. The provision in P.L. 109-171 restates eligibility for federal foster care to clarify interpretations by HHS and overturn a 2003 court decision. Changes were made to adoption assistance eligibility criteria to align with foster care changes and simplify the test. The legislation allows foster care maintenance payments to children living with grandparents but may affect children living with non-parent relatives. Children who lived with a non-parent relative before entering foster care in the 9th Circuit states may be eligible for federal foster care assistance. Eligibility is based on income, deprivation, and resources tests linked to the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. HHS uses these tests to determine if a foster child would have been considered needy if still living with their biological parents. In March 2003, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against HHS, allowing states to determine AFDC eligibility for foster children living with non-parent relatives. Wealth of the relative is not considered in determining eligibility for federal foster care assistance. The 9th Circuit Court's decision allows expanded eligibility for federal foster care assistance based on a child's personal income, even if they lived with a non-parent relative before formal placement in foster care. HHS instructed 9 states in the 9th Circuit to amend their plans accordingly, while other states must continue using the traditional eligibility criteria. HHS also sought a statutory change to support its interpretation of Title IV-E. The 9th Circuit Court decision allowed expanded eligibility for federal foster care assistance based on a child's personal income. HHS sought a statutory change to support its interpretation of Title IV-E eligibility rules, affecting states in the 9th Circuit. States will need to redo their Title IV-E plans due to the Deficit Reduction Act, requiring children to meet eligibility criteria used in states outside the 9th Circuit. HHS issued an Information Memorandum allowing 9th Circuit states to continue making Title IV-E foster claims until annual re-determination. The 9th Circuit Court decision allowed expanded eligibility for federal foster care assistance based on a child's personal income. HHS sought a statutory change to support its interpretation of Title IV-E eligibility rules, affecting states in the 9th Circuit. States will need to redo their Title IV-E plans due to the Deficit Reduction Act, requiring children to meet eligibility criteria used in states outside the 9th Circuit. HHS issued an Information Memorandum allowing 9th Circuit states to continue making Title IV-E foster claims until annual re-determination. This may result in a decline in federal reimbursement for foster care costs in these states, leading to a greater need for state funding or other capped federal sources. The Deficit Reduction Act (P.L. 109-171) made changes to adoption assistance eligibility requirements to simplify the process and limit federal reimbursement for certain Title IV-E foster care program costs. The Act eliminated the second AFDC test for adoption assistance eligibility, aiming to have little impact on the number of eligible children. The Deficit Reduction Act (P.L. 109-171) made changes to adoption assistance eligibility requirements and limited federal reimbursement for Title IV-E foster care program costs. The proposed regulations in January 2005 defined \"candidate for foster care\" more narrowly, reducing federal outlays by $174 million over five years and $405 million over 10 years. Under current law, states can seek federal reimbursement for eligible administrative costs for foster care programs, including social worker time for placements and reviews of placement settings and permanency goals. These costs are only reimbursed if the child meets federal Title IV-E eligibility requirements, such as living in a licensed family home or child care institution. Some states previously claimed Title IV-E administrative costs for children in unlicensed settings, permitted by a 1993 HHS memorandum. However, HHS now argues against this interpretation, stating that a child already in foster care cannot be considered a candidate for Title IV-E. The Administration in the January 2005 NPRM acknowledged the challenge of prohibiting Title IV-E administrative claims for placing foster children with unlicensed relatives. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to make such claims for a limited time until the relative's home is licensed, or up to 12 months, whichever is shorter. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to make Title IV-E administrative claims for placing foster children in ineligible settings for a limited time, such as juvenile detention homes or psychiatric hospitals, for one calendar month. Additionally, states can make claims for children at imminent risk of removal from their homes, considered as \"true\" candidates for foster care. The new law requires states to redetermine a child's foster care status every six months to claim federal funds for administrative costs. This change aims to reduce states' ability to make claims for children placed in unlicensed relatives' homes, prompting them to use state funds for administrative costs or license relatives' homes to continue receiving federal matching funds. States and advocates argue that many relatives are reluctant to undergo the necessary government intrusion to obtain a foster care license. Licensing requirements for foster family homes are set by state authorities and include standards for the home environment and training. States must apply the same standards to both relative and non-relative foster homes, but can waive certain requirements on a case-by-case basis if it does not endanger the child. The exact number of states affected by this provision is unknown. The impact of a new statutory provision on states varies widely, with some states estimating annual financial impacts ranging from $200,000 to $79 million. A survey by HHS ACF and APHSA shows that some states anticipate significant financial impacts, while others expect little to no impact. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 is mentioned in relation to these findings. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 increased funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program to $345 million for FY2006. This funding, combined with discretionary funds, would total $434 million for the program. The cost of this provision over five years is estimated at $200 million. Congress did not propose this funding increase in reconciliation legislation. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 increased funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program to $345 million for FY2006. If Congress reauthorizes the program, $345 million in mandatory funding would be available each fiscal year without additional costs. Additionally, the Act amended the Court Improvement Project to provide funding for two new grant programs to support courts in cases of child abuse and neglect. These provisions were not included in the reconciliation bill but were proposed by the bipartisan Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care. $100 million is appropriated for these grants, with $10 million specified. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 increased funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program to $345 million for FY2006. It also amended the Court Improvement Project to provide funding for two new grant programs to support courts in cases of child abuse and neglect. $100 million is appropriated for these grants, with $10 million specified for each of the two new CIP grants in FY2006-FY2010. State highest courts may apply for separate CIP grants to improve timely action for foster children and provide training in child welfare proceedings under P.L. 109-171. Courts applying for grants must show collaboration with state child welfare agencies and Indian tribes. State highest courts must provide additional information as required by HHS. To receive funding for improving actions for children, courts must describe joint planning with child welfare agencies for data collection and sharing. State highest courts seeking training funds under the Court Improvement Program must demonstrate joint planning with state child welfare agencies for data collection and sharing. The Deficit Reduction Act provides $100 million in mandatory funds for Court Improvement over five years, with two new grants funded at $10 million each year. The state highest court is required to supply at least 25% of the funds. The state highest court must provide 25% of funds for Court Improvement Program grants. Each court can receive a minimum grant of $85,000 and additional funds based on the state's population under 21 years of age. The Deficit Reduction Act maintains this formula for new grants, with each court eligible for multiple grants in FY2006. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires states to collaborate with state courts for funding eligibility under various child welfare programs. This provision was proposed by the bipartisan Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care. Legislation introduced in 2005 further emphasized the collaboration between states and state courts. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended state plan requirements for foster care and adoption assistance to clarify confidentiality provisions. This provision was not included in the reconciliation bill but is consistent with similar language in the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 includes statutory language clarifying Medicaid claims for optional targeted case management services, especially for Medicaid-eligible foster care children. HHS is required to issue formal regulations to implement this clarification. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 includes statutory language clarifying Medicaid claims for optional targeted case management services for Medicaid-eligible foster care children. The Administration requested clarification on TCM claims in its FY2006 Budget, but the legislative language in P.L. 109-171 differs significantly. The changes are estimated to increase federal Title IV-E foster care spending by $350 million over five years and $940 million over 10 years, offsetting savings to the Medicaid program. Net federal savings are estimated at $760 million over five years and $2.1 billion over 10 years. Medicaid is an open-ended entitlement to states for medical assistance to eligible individuals, including federal foster care children. Case management is an optional benefit under Medicaid law, providing services to help beneficiaries access needed services. Targeted case management (TCM) refers to services provided to specific groups, not statewide. For FY2002, the total federal share of TCM expenditures for targeted groups was $1.3 billion, with $171.5 million reimbursed for 165,265 foster care children. States varied in TCM services for foster care children, with some states not submitting any TCM claims. Among states that did, federal shares ranged from under $1,000 to over $1 million. The federal share of TCM claims for foster care children varied among the 19 states, ranging from $1.1 million in West Virginia to $38.9 million in Texas. The Deficit Reduction Act aimed to clarify conflicting policies regarding TCM claims for Medicaid-eligible individuals, particularly for Title IV-E eligible foster care children. This policy was originally outlined in a 2001 letter to state Medicaid directors and has now been incorporated into statute by P.L. 109-171 to address TCM claims for various populations. The Deficit Reduction Act (P.L. 109-171) clarifies TCM claims for various populations, with special attention to foster care-related claims. TCM services involve assessing needs, developing care plans, referrals, and monitoring service use. It does not cover underlying service costs or direct delivery of foster care services. The Deficit Reduction Act (P.L. 109-171) clarifies TCM claims for various populations, with a focus on foster care-related claims. TCM services involve assessing needs, developing care plans, referrals, and monitoring service use, but do not cover underlying service costs or direct delivery of foster care services. Medicaid can only be billed for case management or TCM when no other third parties are liable to pay for such services. States can use federal cost allocation methods to ensure proper billing. The Deficit Reduction Act clarifies that states may allocate costs of Medicaid TCM services to children in foster care, contrary to current CMS policy. This supports TCM claims for foster care children but also states that Medicaid may not be billed for TCM services if other parties are liable. The new statutory provision in the Deficit Reduction Act clarifies that Medicaid may not be billed for TCM services if there is another party liable for the cost, including reimbursement under other programs. Senator Reed expressed concern about potential forced payment by third parties, states, or others, while Senator Grassley stated the proposal aimed to codify a policy from the Clinton Administration. The final bill did not significantly change third party liability provisions. The Deficit Reduction Act clarifies that Medicaid cannot be billed for TCM services if another party is liable for the cost. The CBO estimates savings based on states potentially shifting costs from foster care and other programs to Medicaid. This provision aims to prevent forced payments by third parties and aligns with a policy from the Clinton Administration. The new provision under Title IV-E may reduce access to Medicaid TCM claims, particularly for Medicaid-eligible foster care children. Reconciliation legislation included other provisions related to child welfare, such as extending HHS authority to issue waivers and a federal student loan forgiveness program for child welfare workers. Amendments to the Higher Education Act aimed to improve access for youth aging out of foster care but were not included in the final legislation. The final conference agreement did not include provisions for aging out of foster care. HHS no longer has the authority to approve new waivers for federal child welfare programs. Waivers allow states to demonstrate innovative programs for foster care and child welfare services. The Deficit Reduction Act reauthorized the TANF block grant but did not extend the waiver authority. The Deficit Reduction Act reauthorized the TANF block grant but did not extend child welfare waiver authority past March 2006. The House reconciliation bill would have extended HHS authority to grant child welfare waivers through FY2010, removed limits on demonstration programs, and made other related changes, but these provisions were not included in the final legislation. The House reconciliation bill aimed to extend HHS authority for child welfare waivers through FY2010, but this provision was not included in the final legislation. The Higher Education Act would have clarified that youth in foster care are considered independent students for federal student financial aid eligibility, but this change was also not enacted. The Senate reconciliation bill aimed to amend programs providing support services to potential post-secondary students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including youth in foster care. These changes were not included in the final legislation."
