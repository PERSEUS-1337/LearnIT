This trend raises concerns about financial security for retirees, especially as the aging population grows. Household debt among older Americans has significantly increased from 1989 to 2016, with a rise in the proportion of elderly households holding debt and the median debt amount. This trend raises concerns about financial security for retirees, especially those relying on fixed incomes and government-sponsored income transfers. Higher levels of debt may lead to increased financial insecurity, psychological stress, and decreased physical health for older individuals. The report analyzes changes in household debt among older Americans, focusing on types of debt, debt ratios, and debt burdens. Major types of debt discussed include residential debt, auto loans, student loans, and credit card balances. Nonloan debt is not covered in the report. During 1989 to 2016, Americans' debt patterns followed life-cycle theories, with higher debt levels among those aged 35 to 54. Household debt for individuals aged 20 to 64 increased from $59,134 to $110,204 in 2016, an 86% rise. Older households saw faster debt growth compared to younger ones. Household debt increased significantly for individuals aged 20 to 64, with an 86% rise from $59,134 to $110,204 in 2016. Debt levels for those aged 65 and older also grew substantially, with average debt nearly doubling. The share of elderly households with debt and the median and average debt levels have all increased from 1989 to 2016. Household debt among elderly households has increased significantly from 1989 to 2016. The share of elderly households with debt rose from 37.8% to 61.1%. Median debt increased from $7,463 to $31,050, and average debt rose from $29,918 to $86,797. Debt levels peaked in 2010 post-recession but declined thereafter. In 2016, median debt was similar to pre-recession levels, while average debt was midway between 2004 and 2007 averages. The financial crisis had a significant impact on the older population due to employment instability and the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans. Older individuals faced challenges in finding new jobs and experienced lower pay. Defined contribution plans fluctuate with the market, putting the risk on employees. Mismanagement of retirement accounts and stock market drops during the crisis exacerbated the situation. The financial crisis and retirement account mismanagement reduced retirement income for older Americans. Household debt grew mainly from mortgages and auto loans. In 2016, primary residential mortgages made up the majority of elderly household debt. Residential loans are seen as long-term wealth builders. Elderly households have seen an increase in various types of debt from 1989 to 2016, including debt on primary and other residences, auto loans, student loans, and credit card balances. The share of elderly households with debt secured by a primary residence rose from 15.4% to 33.4% during this time, with the median primary residential debt increasing from $16,793 to $72,000 in real 2016 dollars. Residential debt is considered less stressful than other types of debt, such as credit card debt, and is seen as a long-term wealth builder. Studies suggest that the growth in elderly households' mortgage debt may have been influenced by the availability of mortgage credit before the financial crisis. Older Americans are carrying more mortgage debt, with recent cohorts purchasing more expensive homes with smaller down payments. Tightening mortgage underwriting standards since 2010 have made it harder for young borrowers to qualify for mortgages, leading to a shift towards older borrowers. Some elderly households also hold debt secured by other residential properties. The share of elderly households with other residential debt increased from 2.7% to 4.4% between 1989 and 2016, with median debt rising from $23,323 to $98,000. Auto loans also increased among households headed by individuals aged 65 and older, with the share of elderly households holding auto loans rising from 10.3% to 21.2%. Additionally, a small percentage of elderly households held student loans, increasing from 0.5% in 1989 to 2.4% in 2016. In 1989, the share of elderly households with student loans was 0.5%, increasing to 2.4% in 2016. The median amount owed by elderly borrowers rose from $7,463 to $12,000 in 2016. Elderly borrowers are more likely to default on student loans. Social Security benefits can be offset to pay off student loans, with the number of individuals affected increasing from 6,000 in FY2002 to 38,000 in FY2015. Credit card balances among elderly households also increased from 1989 to 2016. Credit card debt among elderly households increased from 1989 to 2016, becoming the most common type of debt for them. The share of elderly households with credit card debt rose from 10.0% to 35.1%, with the median balance increasing from $952 to $2,400. Higher interest rates on credit card debt may require older Americans to allocate more income towards debt servicing, leading to bankruptcy filings. Older consumers in bankruptcy carry 50% more credit card debt than younger debtors, citing interest and fees as the main reasons for filing. The debt payment-to-income ratio is a measure of debt burden on households, comparing required debt payments to available income. Among elderly households with debt, the ratio increased from 8.7% in 1989 to 16.7% in 2010, then declined to 12.4% in 2016. This ratio was lower for elderly households compared to nonelderly households in 1989. The debt payment-to-income ratio for elderly households increased from 8.7% in 1989 to 16.7% in 2010, then declined to 12.4% in 2016. Delinquency on loan payments for households aged 65 and older was around 3.9% in 2016, fluctuating between 1% and 5% from 1989 to 2016. The ratio for nonelderly households was 13.8% in 2016, compared to 12.4% for elderly households. The debt-to-asset ratio for elderly households increased from 5.1% in 1989 to 9.0% in 2016, while remaining stable for nonelderly households at around 20% during the same period. The residential debt-to-asset ratio also rose from 2.7% in 1989 to 7.4% in 2016 for elderly households. The debt-to-asset ratio for elderly households increased significantly from 2.7% in 1989 to 11.7% in 2010, with a residential debt-to-asset ratio of 10.0%. The proportion of elderly households with a debt-to-asset ratio greater than 50% also rose from 7.4% in 1989 to 11.2% in 2016. Additionally, there was a notable increase in older Americans filing for bankruptcy, with the proportion of filers aged 65 and older rising from 2.1% in 1991 to 12.2% in 2013-2016. The elderly cohort is the fastest-growing age demographic, with older filers in worse financial shape than younger filers in terms of debt, income, assets, and debt-to-income ratio. Bankruptcy is more problematic for older debtors as they struggle to accumulate assets postbankruptcy due to difficulty finding well-paying jobs and building retirement savings. Research suggests that older bankruptcy filers, especially those aged 80 and older, continue to struggle financially post-bankruptcy. The oldest Americans experienced the largest increase in debt over the past three decades, with a growing share of elderly households holding debt. In 2016, around 70% of households headed by individuals aged 65-74 had debt. In 2016, the proportion of elderly households with debt increased for all age groups, with the largest growth seen in the oldest age groups. Median household debt generally increased over time for each age group and peaked around the financial crisis. For households headed by those aged 80 and older, real median debt was $933 in 1989 and increased. Elderly households across all age groups have seen a significant increase in debt from 1989 to 2016, with real median debt rising from $933 to $20,000. Primary residential debt showed the largest growth, followed by other residential debt, auto loans, credit card balances, and student loans. The debt-to-asset ratio also increased for all age groups, with the most significant increase among households headed by individuals aged 80 and older. The debt-to-asset ratio among elderly households increased significantly from 1989 to 2016, with the most significant rise seen in households headed by individuals aged 80 and older. Residential debt explained the majority of the total debt growth for every elderly household age group. It is important to analyze changes in debt across different asset levels to accurately reflect the financial situations of less wealthy elderly households. Elderly households are more likely to draw down assets like retirement savings and investments to afford debt obligations. From 1989 to 2016, changes in household debt varied across asset distribution levels. Middle and top asset distribution elderly households saw growth in debt, while those at the bottom had the largest debt burden. Top asset distribution households held the most debt but had the smallest debt-to-asset ratio. The data in Table 4 shows household debt distribution among elderly households based on asset quintiles. Elderly households in the lowest asset quintile were least likely to have debt, with an increase from 36.2% to 49.5% holding debt. The probability of holding debt increased by about 30 percentage points for elderly households in the second, third, and fourth asset quintiles. The share of elderly households in the highest 20% of the asset distribution holding debt increased from 37.3% in 1989 to 54.9% in 2016. Median debt increased for elderly households in all asset quintiles, with a larger percentage increase for those in the middle of the distribution. Real median debt for elderly households in different asset quintiles increased by varying multiples from 1989 to 2016. The distribution of assets among elderly households varied across asset quintiles from 1989 to 2016. Average debt for elderly households increased significantly, with the lowest asset quintile experiencing a doubling of debt, mainly from primary residential debt, credit card debt, and auto loans. Primary residential debt contributed to 54% of the debt growth, while credit card debt and auto loans also played a significant role. Elderly households in different asset quintiles saw varying increases in debt from 1989 to 2016. The bottom asset quintile experienced a doubling of debt, mainly from primary residential debt, credit card debt, and auto loans. Growth in debt among middle- and high-asset elderly households was also driven by residential debt, including mortgage debt for second homes. For households in the top asset quintile, primary residential debt explained almost 70% of the debt growth. Additionally, elderly households in the bottom asset quintile had a higher proportion of other debt types like lines of credit and installment loans. Elderly households in the lowest asset quintile saw a decrease in debt-to-asset ratio from 1989 to 2016, with most of the debt being nonresidential loans like credit card debt and auto loans. Despite the decrease, in 2016, these households still had a 43% debt-to-asset ratio, indicating a reliance on less effective long-term wealth-building loans. Debt among elderly households has increased significantly over the past 30 years, with a rise in residential debt-to-asset ratio. The share of elderly households with debt has almost doubled, and median debt has increased fourfold. This increase in debt is not necessarily linked to financial insecurity in retirement. Debt among elderly households has increased significantly over the past 30 years, with a rise in residential debt-to-asset ratio. The debt-to-asset ratio among elderly households with debt increased from 5.1% to 9.0% from 1989 to 2016. Older adults may adjust behavior to meet debt obligations, leading to an increase in working individuals among elderly households. However, rising debt burden is evident among certain elderly households, particularly those headed by individuals aged 80 and older. The debt burden among elderly households, especially those aged 80 and older, has increased significantly over the past 30 years. This demographic group has seen a rise in debt levels, which could pose challenges due to lower income, reduced retirement resources, and high housing debt. Managing debt alongside retirement income and savings adequacy is crucial for ensuring retirement security."
