    "title": "SB 254",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Overturn Citizens United Act is declared by the Legislature of California, stating that the Constitution protects individual human rights and does not grant corporations separate rights. This is supported by a dissenting opinion in Connecticut General Life Insurance Company v. Johnson (1938) by Justice Hugo Black. In Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990) 494 U.S. 652, the Supreme Court recognized the threat of immense corporate wealth on the public's support for political ideas. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) 558 U.S. 310, the Court overturned limits on corporate election spending, allowing unlimited influence on elections and policy decisions. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, dissenting Justices highlighted that corporations, with their special advantages like limited liability and perpetual life, can spend large amounts on campaign messages that may not align with the beliefs of natural persons. They have used these advantages to overturn laws aimed at curbing corporate abuses, hindering local governments' ability to protect citizens from harm. In Buckley v. Valeo (1976) 424 U.S. 1, the Supreme Court upheld contribution limitations based on the appearance of corruption but failed to consider other important interests like creating a level playing field. In First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978) 435 U.S. 765 and Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. City of Berkeley (1981) 454 U.S. 290, contribution limits for ballot measure campaigns were rejected due to no threat of candidate corruption. Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC (2000) 528 U.S. 377 emphasized that money is property, not speech. The Washington Post-ABC News poll in February 2010 showed that 80% of Americans oppose the Citizens United ruling. The US Constitution's Article V allows for amending decisions of the Supreme Court that impact democracy. The California Constitution's Article I guarantees the right to petition the government and instruct representatives. Ballot measures have been used by Californians and Americans to direct their elected officials, including amending the US Constitution. A special election is called in California on November 8, 2016, to provide voter instructions on the Citizens United ruling and other judicial precedents to Senators and Representatives. The Secretary of State will include voter instructions in the consolidated election ballot. California's special election on November 8, 2016, will ask voters if elected officials should use their authority to overturn Citizens United v. FEC and other rulings, allowing regulation of campaign contributions to ensure equal expression of views and deny corporations the same rights as individuals. The Secretary of State will certify the election results and communicate them to Congress. The provisions of the Elections Code apply to the ballot measure submitted. Section 4 of the act will be submitted to voters in the November 8, 2016, statewide general election. Section 4 of the act will be placed on the ballot for the November 8, 2016, statewide general election, following all other ballot measures in the order of qualification. The Secretary of State will include information about the ballot measure in the ballot pamphlets. If the Secretary of State is unable to comply with the act before November 8, 2016, due to a court order, the measure will be submitted to voters at the next election. The act calls for an election and will take immediate effect."
