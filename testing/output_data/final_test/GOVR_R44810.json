Manufacturers must submit a new drug application (NDA) to demonstrate safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality. FDA assesses NDAs for safety, labeling appropriateness, and manufacturing adequacy. FDA's approval indicates a suitable benefit-risk balance for the drug's intended use. Routine risk minimization measures like labeling and postmarket studies are usually sufficient, but in some cases, FDA may recommend or require additional measures. The FDA regulates drug safety and effectiveness in the US through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Manufacturers must submit a new drug application (NDA) to demonstrate safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality. FDA's approval indicates a suitable benefit-risk balance for the drug's intended use. Routine risk minimization measures like labeling and postmarket studies are usually sufficient, but in some cases, additional measures may be recommended or required. The report provides a brief history of FDA drug regulation and focuses on current risk management authorities, specifically risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS). It also discusses issues related to REMS and their impact on generic drug competition. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) was enacted in response to safety concerns surrounding drugs, requiring manufacturers to demonstrate safety and effectiveness before marketing. Amendments in 1951 introduced a prescription-only category for drugs needing health practitioner supervision. Further amendments in 1962 mandated manufacturers to prove a drug's effectiveness for its intended use in addition to safety. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 established an expedited pathway for generic drugs by allowing manufacturers to submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to the FDA for premarket review. Generic drugs must demonstrate bioequivalence to the reference listed drug (RLD) in terms of active ingredients, strength, dosage form, and route of administration. Additional requirements include reviews of chemistry, manufacturing, controls, labeling, and testing. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 gave FDA the authority to require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) for certain drugs. REMS is a risk management plan that goes beyond FDA-approved labeling. Concerns have been raised about brand pharmaceutical companies using REMS to delay competition by restricting access to samples needed for bioequivalence testing. Legislation was introduced in 2012 to address misuse of REMS. During the 2017 user fee reauthorization, concerns over high drug prices led to discussions on reforming REMS to increase generic competition and reduce prices. The inappropriate use of REMS to delay access to cheaper generic drugs was highlighted by the FDA and others. Legislation addressing REMS misuse in generic drug development has been a topic of discussion in Congress. Legislation addressing REMS misuse in generic drug development was introduced during the 114th and 115th Congresses. FDA approval requires drugs to be safe and effective, with an appropriate benefit-risk balance. Risk management programs for drugs began in the 1980s at FDA. In the 1980s, FDA developed risk management programs for drugs, including the Accutane Pregnancy Prevention Program. Accutane was approved for severe acne treatment but had teratogenic risks, leading to warnings in package inserts and education programs for healthcare providers. Reports of malformations in 1983 prompted revisions to highlight warnings. The Accutane package insert was revised to emphasize warnings, and health communication letters were sent to prescribers and pharmacists. The Accutane Pregnancy Prevention Program (PPP) was the first risk management program introduced by a pharmaceutical company, including elements like boxed warnings, informed consent for female patients, and regular meetings with the FDA. Before FDAAA in 2007, 16 drugs had restrictive risk management programs, such as Clozapine's \"No Blood, No Drug\" program and Thalidomide's \"System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety\" program. In 2002, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act (P.L. 107-188) was signed into law, reauthorizing prescription drug user fees through FY2007. FDA committed to performance goals related to risk management activities, including reviewing pre-NDA/BLA meeting packages with safety information, discussing proposed risk management plans, and issuing guidance on risk assessment and pharmacovigilance practices. FDA issued risk management guidance documents, including guidance on RiskMAPs for prescription drugs and biologics. RiskMAPs are safety programs designed to minimize known risks while preserving benefits. FDA can recommend or require REMS if necessary to ensure benefits outweigh risks. The FDA expanded its risk management authority with the FDAAA in 2007, allowing them to require REMS for certain drugs to ensure benefits outweigh risks. REMS is a structured risk management plan that goes beyond FDA-approved labeling. Manufacturers must submit a proposed REMS with their NDA. The FDA may require a REMS for certain drugs to ensure benefits outweigh risks. A REMS includes providing information to patients and healthcare providers, imposing restrictions on drug distribution or use, and considering factors like population size and disease seriousness. The FDA may require a REMS for certain drugs to ensure benefits outweigh risks. A REMS includes providing information to patients and healthcare providers, imposing restrictions on drug distribution or use, and considering factors like population size and disease seriousness. The REMS must include details on treatment duration, potential adverse events, and reporting timelines for FDA assessment. Patient information materials may also be required for distribution. The FDA may require a REMS for certain drugs to ensure benefits outweigh risks, which includes providing information to patients and healthcare providers. The REMS may involve restrictions on drug distribution or use and consider factors like population size and disease seriousness. Patient information materials, such as a Medication Guide or patient package insert, may be required for distribution. Manufacturers with REMS that only include a Medication Guide and assessment timetable can request a modification to eliminate the REMS. Additionally, a communication plan may be required, which could involve sending letters to healthcare providers or disseminating information about drug risks and safety protocols. The FDA may require a REMS for certain drugs to ensure benefits outweigh risks, which includes restrictions on drug distribution or use. An ETASU is a restriction intended to allow access to beneficial drugs while minimizing risks, with an implementation system for monitoring. According to FDA's website, there are 72 active REMS as of January 2018, with 45 including ETASU, 10 with only a communication plan, and 17 with only a medication guide. FDA can require REMS for individual drugs or drug classes, with some drugs being released from REMS under certain circumstances. The REMS for Mifeprex (mifepristone) is a regimen with misoprostol to terminate pregnancy up to 70 days gestation. It includes ETASU for certified providers, distribution requirements, and limitations on dispensing locations. An example of a class-wide REMS is for Opioid Analgesics. The FDA implemented a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for Opioid Analgesics in 2009 to address the risks associated with these medications. This REMS includes additional safety measures for extended-release and long-acting opioids to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks. In 2017, immediate-release opioids were also included in the REMS requirements. The REMS requirements for ER/LA opioids also apply to generic drugs, which must demonstrate sameness to the brand drug. Biologics and biosimilars are regulated under the Public Health Service Act and licensed by the FDA. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) created an abbreviated licensure pathway for biosimilar biological products that are highly similar or interchangeable with FDA-licensed biological products. Manufacturers of follow-on biologics face challenges in demonstrating sameness due to the complex structure of biologics made from living organisms. Marketing a biosimilar product in the United States requires submitting an application to the FDA with data from analytical, animal, and clinical studies to demonstrate biosimilarity. REMS-related concerns have been raised for biologics and biosimilars, with a REMS-restricted distribution program controlling drug supply. The law prohibits the brand company (RLD holder) from using ETASU. Some brand companies may use REMS to delay competition by withholding samples from generic product developers and delaying negotiation of a single, shared system REMS, effectively preventing or delaying FDA approval of the generic drug application. Safety concerns are often cited as justification for refusing to sell samples. Generic drug developers need samples of the Reference Listed Drug (RLD) to conduct bioequivalence testing for FDA approval. While brand companies may cite safety concerns to withhold samples, the law does not require them to provide samples. Generic companies typically obtain samples from wholesale distribution channels, but face challenges when RLDs are under restricted distribution. The wholesale distributor of the RLD may violate REMS terms by selling samples to unauthorized parties. FDA guidance allows generic companies to request FDA letters to RLD holders for bioequivalence testing. The FDA letter does not compel RLD holders to provide samples but confirms safety protocols are comparable to the brand's REMS program. The FDA guidance allows generic companies to request letters to RLD holders for bioequivalence testing. The generic drug developer must complete a disclosure authorization form to disclose information to the RLD holder, agreeing to hold FDA harmless for any injury caused by sharing such information. The RLD holder may still choose to withhold samples. The FDA guidance allows generic companies to request samples from brand companies for bioequivalence testing. Brand companies have cited safety and liability concerns as reasons for refusing to sell samples to generic drug applicants. The FDA guidance allows generic companies to request samples from brand companies for bioequivalence testing, but there are challenges due to safety concerns. Congress and FDA recognize risks with drugs requiring REMS, including serious safety issues like shortened overall survival and increased risk of tumor progression. Generic drugs referencing products subject to REMS must comply with specific requirements, including entering into a shared system of ETASU. The FDA guidance allows generic companies to request samples from brand companies for bioequivalence testing, but there are challenges due to safety concerns. Generic drugs referencing products subject to REMS must comply with specific requirements, including entering into a shared system of ETASU. The Secretary may waive this requirement for the generic drug under certain conditions. The process of developing a single, shared system REMS begins with the Office of Generic Drugs notifying the ANDA sponsor, who then contacts the RLD holder for discussions. The FDA guidance allows generic companies to request samples from brand companies for bioequivalence testing, but challenges exist due to safety concerns. Generic drugs referencing products subject to REMS must comply with specific requirements, including entering into a shared system of ETASU. The process of developing a single, shared system REMS involves the sponsor initiating discussions with the RLD holder, forming an industry working group (IWG) to develop a proposal, and submitting it to FDA for review. If there are issues with collaboration, the agency may facilitate resolution. The purpose of a single, shared system is to reduce burden for stakeholders. Negotiations for a single, shared system REMS between generic and brand drug companies involve issues like cost-sharing, confidentiality, and antitrust concerns. While a waiver is possible if a shared system is not feasible, it is considered a last resort by the FDA, which has issued three waivers to date. During negotiations, FDA may allow ANDA sponsors to use a \"different, comparable aspect\" of the ETASU if a waiver is needed. In November 2017, FDA issued draft guidance to streamline the submission process for shared system REMS, reducing paperwork for sponsors and FDA reviewers. CDER plans to release guidance on Development of a Shared System REMS and Waivers of the Single, Shared System REMS Requirement. In June 2016, a representative of brand drug companies testified about the complexities of negotiating a single, shared REMS due to safety issues and the healthcare system. FDA may require a REMS with ETASU for drugs with serious safety risks, and some brand companies have implemented restrictions. Some brand companies have implemented restricted distribution programs not mandated by FDA, raising antitrust concerns. While REMS allows FDA to approve drugs with safety risks, issues arise with access to samples and bioequivalence. Brand companies are withholding samples for bioequivalence testing, using REMS-restricted distribution systems to delay competition. Generic drug companies face difficulties accessing samples, with brand companies citing safety concerns as a reason for refusal to sell samples. FDA has received numerous inquiries from generic product developers regarding this issue. Brand companies are concerned about potential liability for injuries caused by generic products, leading to possible FDA actions. Adverse events linked to generics could harm the reputation of the Reference Listed Drug (RLD) holder. FDA can review bioequivalence protocols of generic developers and request samples for testing, but cannot force RLD holders to provide them. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the FTC have provided feedback on ensuring safety measures in bioequivalence studies. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows brand-name drug manufacturers to use restricted drug distribution programs, but generic companies need access to samples for testing. Entry into a single, shared system REMS is required by law to reduce burden for stakeholders. Concerns have been raised about brand companies using this requirement to delay competition. Brand companies and industry stakeholders have conflicting views on the requirement for a single, shared REMS system. Brand companies argue that negotiations are complex due to safety issues and the healthcare system, involving discussions on REMS design, adverse event reporting, cost sharing, decision-making authority, and legal issues. FDA presentations highlight issues like cost-sharing, confidentiality, product liability, antitrust concerns, and access to patented elements in shared REMS negotiations. In response to concerns about misuse of REMS, legislation in the 112th Congress aimed to prohibit the use of ETASU to restrict access to covered drugs for bioequivalence testing. However, this provision was not included in the final version of the bill signed into law as FDASIA. In the 115th Congress, bills were introduced to prevent brand companies from using REMS to delay generic drugs from entering the market. The FAST Generics Act and CREATES Act aim to prevent brand companies from using REMS to delay generic drugs from entering the market by defining terms like \"covered product,\" \"eligible product developer,\" and \"license holder.\" The FAST Generics Act aims to limit a license holder of a covered product from restricting its availability for testing purposes by an eligible product developer. It allows the developer to seek authorization from the Secretary to obtain a covered product subject to a REMS with ETASU, specifies the procedure for obtaining authorization, and requires the license holder to designate wholesalers or distributors to fulfill product requests. The Secretary can prohibit or limit product transfer if it poses an \"imminent hazard\" to public health. The CREATES Act aims to facilitate the development of a single, shared system of ETASU by exempting license holders from liability for certain claims and requiring negotiations in good faith. It also allows product developers to sue for injunctive relief and damages for violations. The CREATES Act allows product developers to sue license holders for failure to provide sufficient quantities of a drug on market-based terms. If successful, the license holder must provide the product developer with the drug, cover legal fees, and pay damages. The Act also permits the Secretary to modify approved REMS and waive the requirement for a single shared system of ETASU. The CREATES Act allows product developers to sue license holders for failure to provide sufficient quantities of a drug on market-based terms. The Act also permits the Secretary to modify approved REMS and waive the requirement for a single shared system of ETASU, unless no other comparable aspect would satisfy statutory requirements. There are no formal cost estimates on how the Act would function as a cost-saving measure, but some informal estimates have been shared. The Section 1131 bill aimed to allow product developers to seek authorization for covered drugs for bioequivalence testing, but did not address the issue of developing a single, shared system REMS. Unlike the FAST Generics and CREATES bills, Section 1131 had a narrower definition of \"covered drug\" and only included drugs subject to a REMS with ETASU. The implementation of Section 1131 was estimated to reduce direct spending for mandatory health programs by $753 million over a 10-year period, but it was ultimately not included in the final version of the bill. In July 2017, FDA held a public meeting to discuss the balance between innovation in drug development and availability of lower cost alternatives. Comments addressed REMS issues and the generic drug industry supported efforts to prevent restricted distribution programs from delaying generic entry. A study estimated that misuse of REMS and restricted distribution programs costs the US $5.4 billion annually. The AAM supports the CREATES Act to address anticompetitive practices in the healthcare system. Opponents argue that changes to the REMS program could undermine drug safety precautions and deter the development of higher-risk drugs. Brand companies express concerns about the CREATES Act's impact on safety criteria for drug developers. The curr_chunk discusses safety criteria that drug developers must meet to protect patients and others during drug distribution."
