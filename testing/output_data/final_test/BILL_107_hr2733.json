    "content": "The \"Enterprise Integration Act of 2002\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. The Congress finds that the majority of US manufacturing companies are small- and medium-sized businesses, with many producing goods for larger companies. The use of the World Wide Web and international product data exchange standards has led to increased integration in supply chains. European and Asian countries are investing in electronic enterprise standards to help smaller manufacturers adapt to the changing business environment. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is uniquely positioned to assist US manufacturers in various industries like home building, furniture, textiles, and apparel by accelerating efforts to develop standards and enterprise integration processes. This investment could provide overseas companies with a competitive advantage, especially in the changing business environment where electronic commerce expertise is crucial. The Enterprise Integration Initiative is outlined in Section 3. The Director will establish an initiative for advancing enterprise integration in the United States, involving various units of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and addressing the needs of major manufacturing industries through consortia including government and industry. The Director will work with industry to identify enterprise integration standardization activities and assess the current state of enterprise integration within major manufacturing industries. Reports will be submitted to relevant committees annually. The Director may work with industry, trade associations, and professional societies to raise awareness of enterprise integration activities, develop roadmaps, support standards development, and provide technical assistance as needed. The Director will provide technical assistance and financial support to small- and medium-sized businesses for pilot projects in enterprise integration. The Manufacturing Extension Program will advise businesses on acquiring expertise, equipment, and training for supply chain participation. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"automotive\" as land-based engine-powered vehicles, \"Director\" as the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \"enterprise integration\" as electronic linkage of manufacturers, and \"major manufacturing industry\" as including aerospace, automotive, electronics, and other designated industries.
