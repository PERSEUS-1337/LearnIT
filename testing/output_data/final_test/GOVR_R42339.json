Lebanese concerns center on the potential for conflict or regime change in Syria to disrupt Lebanon's security and reshape its fragile sectarian political balance. The complex relationship between Lebanon and Syria is influenced by geography, history, and political, economic, and social ties. Lebanese leaders have aimed to manage Syria's influence while maintaining domestic stability. Syrian leaders exert influence in Lebanon to prevent hostile forces from gaining strength, leading to direct intervention. Syria maintains strong influence in Lebanon through patronage relationships with Hezbollah. The unrest in Syria and potential spillover into Lebanon raise security concerns for both countries. The United States' policy priorities in Lebanon include preserving regional peace, strengthening democratic institutions, limiting Iranian and Syrian influence, and countering threats from militant groups like Hezbollah. Congress has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars for Lebanon since 2006 to support UN resolutions, reduce sectarianism, provide military equipment to the Lebanese Armed Forces, and assist the Internal Security Forces. These efforts began after the withdrawal of Syrian forces in 2005 and the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. The withdrawal of Syrian military forces in 2005 and the Israel-Hezbollah war of July and August 2006 have shaped recent developments in Lebanon. U.S. programs have improved nonsectarian security forces while Lebanese politics remain deadlocked. The prospect of political change in Syria challenges core assumptions of regional powers. This report reviews these developments and analyzes potential concerns for Congress. Lebanon has avoided the unrest seen in other regional states due to its lack of a strong, repressive government and its history of civil war. In 2011, political turmoil arose in Lebanon following the collapse of the government and the appointment of pro-Syria Prime Minister Najib Miqati, leading to sectarian tensions and public demonstrations. In March 2011, political uncertainty in Lebanon led to public demonstrations calling for an end to the confessional system. Clashes in Tripoli in June 2011 highlighted sectarian tensions. Prime Minister Miqati formed a new cabinet dominated by the pro-Syria, Hezbollah-led March 8 coalition, with 18 out of 30 seats. Walid Jumblatt switched allegiance from March 14 to March 8 coalition, breaking political stalemate. Syria's instability affected Lebanon's government formation. Some wanted to wait on Syrian uprising impact. Special Tribunal for Lebanon indicted four Hezbollah members for Rafiq Hariri's assassination. Hezbollah disavowed allegations of assassinating former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and refused to turn over named individuals to the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. The STL announced its intention to try the accused in absentia due to their disappearance. Concerns were raised about the impact on Prime Minister Miqati's government and Lebanon's financial responsibility to the STL. The debate over the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) highlights sectarian divides in Lebanon, with the Sunni community supporting it to hold Hariri's killers accountable, while Hezbollah and the Shiite community see it as a conspiracy to weaken Hezbollah. Miqati paid Lebanon's dues to the STL, avoiding government collapse, reportedly under Syrian President Assad's instruction to maintain the pro-Syria government. The Druze community is divided, and the Christian community also has conflicting views on the STL. Many analysts were concerned that the STL would ignite sectarian tensions and foster domestic instability in Lebanon. The Lebanese government maintained neutrality on the Syrian uprising, abstaining from voting on resolutions criticizing the Syrian regime. Nawaf Salam, Lebanon's Special Envoy to the U.N., emphasized Lebanon's commitment to defending Syria's sovereignty and unity. Lebanon abstains from voting on Syria-related issues to protect its unity and stability. Pro-Syrian politicians, including Prime Minister Miqati and Parliament Speaker Berri, support the Asad regime. Hezbollah backs Asad's claims of foreign interference causing unrest in Syria. Hezbollah's unwavering support for Syria has caused dissent within the March 8 coalition, with Prime Minister Miqati trying to maintain neutrality while facing political challenges. Walid Jumblatt has diverged from March 8's position, creating further tension. Walid Jumblatt, known for his shifting political alliances, has become increasingly critical of the Asad regime since 2011, calling for political reforms in Syria. While he hasn't explicitly stated that Asad should step down, he urged Russia and Iran to push for regime change in Syria. Jumblatt also advised the Syrian Druze community against joining the attacks on protesters. In contrast, the Sunni-dominated March 14 coalition strongly opposes Asad, accusing the regime of violating Lebanese sovereignty. The March 14 coalition has criticized the Asad regime for violating Lebanese sovereignty and has shown solidarity with the Sunni opposition movement in Syria. They have rallied their Sunni-based constituency by calling for Asad to step down and supporting the protestors. This has rejuvenated their base after losing control of the government in 2011. The mobilization against the Asad regime in Syria has potential to increase tensions in Lebanon, especially among Christians and Hezbollah supporters. Christians fear a Sunni Islamist government may discriminate against them, creating a dilemma for the Maronite Church. Archbishop Bechara Rai, the current head, is seen as having better relations with Syria and March 8 coalition than his predecessor. Archbishop Bechara Rai has better relations with the Syrian regime and March 8 coalition than his predecessor, Nasrallah Sfeir. Rai expressed concern for the Christian population in Syria and suggested that the end of Asad's government could negatively affect them. His comments caused dismay among some states and split opinions within the Lebanese Christian community. The March 8 coalition supported Rai's remarks. The March 8 coalition supported Rai's comments on the importance of a stable Syrian government for Lebanon. Most Syrian Christian leaders continue to support the Asad regime due to their prominent role in the business community and fears of a Sunni-led government. Pro-Syrian business interests have a significant influence on the Lebanese economy, which has been greatly affected by the current unrest, particularly in trade, banking, and tourism. The Syrian economy is also suffering, with estimates indicating a potential 2% shrinkage in 2012 due to sanctions, a weakened currency, and recession. The Lebanese economy is under scrutiny due to the unrest in Syria and international sanctions. Lebanon's hesitation to participate in the Arab League sanctions is due to its reliance on Syria for trade. Bilateral trade between Lebanon and Syria amounts to $560 million. The Lebanese economy is closely tied to Syria, with bilateral trade totaling $560 million. Imposing sanctions on Syria could harm Lebanon's economy, especially the banking sector, which has significant ties to Syrian operations. Governor Riad Salameh of Lebanon's Central Bank states that the Bank has not been impacted by the sanctions as the Syrian government has not deposited any funds. The Bank of Byblos reported a 20% decrease in deposits, while tourism in Lebanon decreased by 25% in the first seven months of 2011. Tourist activity on the Lebanese-Syrian border has decreased significantly, with concerns about border security due to the lack of demarcation between Syria and Lebanon. Since 2008, no official appointment has been made for the border between Syria and Lebanon. The Syrian army has crossed into Lebanese territory multiple times during the uprising, resulting in deaths and kidnappings. The U.S. State Department expressed concern over Syria's violations of Lebanese sovereignty and urged Lebanon to protect security and rights, including those of refugees. Syria claims the incursions are necessary to combat foreign agents entering through Lebanon. Syrian forces began laying landmines along the border in October 2011. Syrian forces laid landmines along the Lebanese border in October 2011 near Homs to prevent arms smuggling and refugee movement. The porous border facilitates arms transfers in both directions, posing challenges for the Asad regime and Lebanese government. U.S. officials note extensive arms smuggling unlikely to be curtailed soon. The Syrian government accuses some Lebanese of involvement in these activities. Hezbollah has reportedly moved long-range missiles from Syria to Lebanon due to fears of Asad's regime collapsing. There are concerns that if Asad falls, Hezbollah may acquire Syria's chemical weapons. Asad claims that al-Qaeda militants are entering Syria from Lebanon, inciting violence. In December 2011, Lebanese Defense Minister Fayez Ghosn claimed that Al Qaeda militants were based in the Lebanese town of Arsal under the guise of Syrian dissidents. This sparked a national debate in Lebanon about the presence of Al Qaeda and its implications for both Syria and Lebanon. Syrian dissidents are seeking refuge in Lebanon, particularly in the north near Wadi Khaled, due to the violence in Syria. The porous border allows for significant movement, with nearly 5,000 Syrian refugees arriving by the end of December. Nearly 5,000 Syrian refugees registered with UNHCR in Lebanon by December. Wealthy Syrians have enrolled their children in Lebanese schools due to unrest. Dissidents in Lebanon are not necessarily safe, with reports of detentions and disappearances. Syrian operatives have targeted protestors who fled Syria in Lebanon. Lebanese forces accused of aiding Asad regime. Human Rights Watch has called for action. Human Rights Watch has urged Lebanon to provide temporary asylum for detained refugees fleeing the Asad regime. Analysts predict the regime's potential collapse within the next six to 18 months, with Israel, Iran, and other actors playing unpredictable roles. The responses of key players will determine the impact of Syria's unrest on Lebanon, with Hezbollah and Sunni communities playing significant roles. Hezbollah and Sunni communities in Lebanon are key players in potential sectarian strife. Hezbollah's response to threats could either escalate tensions or align more with Lebanese interests to prevent political infighting. Increased sectarianism in Syria could destabilize Lebanon, leading to possible civil conflict. The rise of a Sunni-led government in Syria may embolden Lebanese Sunnis, potentially upsetting the political balance and prompting a military response from Hezbollah or Christian groups. While a full-scale civil war is unlikely, some level of conflict is possible. Key factors to monitor include the flow of refugees fleeing the Asad regime and the regime's potential collapse within the next six to 18 months. Hezbollah's legitimacy among Lebanese Sunnis is dwindling due to its support for the Asad regime in Syria. Despite this, Hezbollah remains a powerful political actor in Lebanon, supported by Shiites and some Christians. The ongoing unrest in Syria presents complex challenges for Hezbollah, including questions about its future and domestic political legitimacy. Hezbollah's support for the Asad regime in Syria is driven by operational concerns and fear of losing a major ally. Analysts suggest that if Asad falls, Hezbollah may need to adjust its operations, which could be challenging due to divergent priorities within the group. The potential regime change in Syria could alter the power dynamics in the region. A potential change in Syria could impact the power dynamics between Syria, Israel, and Lebanon, with Hezbollah possibly being encouraged to attack Israel by Asad if he feels threatened. Israel would likely respond by targeting Hezbollah to neutralize its rocket threat. Conflict could escalate if either party reacts provocatively. A potential change in Syria could impact the power dynamics in the region, potentially leading to conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel's military superiority could defeat Hezbollah, but the war could destabilize Lebanon and shift power dynamics in the Levant. A new Syrian government may align less with Iran and Hezbollah, potentially aligning more with the Arab League and GCC countries. The potential change in Syria could impact the power dynamics in the region, particularly in relation to Israel and Hezbollah. This could lead to conflict and destabilization in Lebanon. The United States may need to reassess its security assistance to Lebanon in light of these developments. The potential impact of the Syrian uprising on Lebanon, including security forces, border control, and combating terrorism, as well as the potential spillover from Syria into Lebanon. Questions arise regarding U.S. foreign assistance programs in Lebanon, changes in U.S. goals and engagement, imposing conditions on aid to curtail Hezbollah's influence, circumvention of international sanctions, potential civil war spillover, Hezbollah's involvement, weakening of Hezbollah, ramifications of attacks on Israel, U.S. responses, impact on religious sects/minorities in Lebanon, and the aftermath of Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon. Since 2006, U.S. assistance to Lebanon has exceeded $1 billion, focusing on implementing UN resolutions, reducing sectarianism, supporting the Lebanese Armed Forces and Internal Security Forces, and boosting economic opportunities. The current $1.1 billion plan aims to modernize and equip the LAF. The $1.1 billion plan aims to modernize and equip the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) with continued funding to help secure Lebanon's borders and improve internal stability. U.S. officials hope that strengthening the LAF will prevent outside actors from destabilizing Lebanon's political situation. Cooperation between the United States, LAF, and Internal Security Forces (ISF) has been praised by the U.S. State Department. The U.S. aims to provide economic assistance to Lebanon to stabilize its economy amidst political unrest and external shocks. However, implementation has been hindered by Syrian unrest and border issues. Lebanon's economy faces challenges like fiscal debt and infrastructure problems. U.S. assistance may help, but concerns about Hezbollah's role in the government remain. The U.S. aims to provide economic assistance to Lebanon to stabilize its economy amidst political unrest and external shocks. Current Economic Support Fund (ESF) program priorities focus on promoting economic opportunity and stabilization in impoverished areas. Plans for FY2012 assistance include improving competitiveness in agribusiness and tourism, facilitating a pro-business environment, and providing financial access to Lebanese entrepreneurs. U.S. assistance may be influenced by developments in Syria and changes in Hezbollah's strategic position. Some Members of Congress have questioned funding U.S.-sponsored initiatives in Lebanon due to increasing Hezbollah participation in the government. In June 2011, Representatives proposed H.R. 2215, the Hezbollah Anti-Terrorism Act, to limit assistance to the LAF while Hezbollah is part of the governing coalition in Lebanon. Some Members support assisting the LAF as a counterweight to Hezbollah. P.L. 112-74, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, provided $100 million for U.S.-sponsored initiatives in Lebanon. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012 allocated $100 million in Foreign Military Financing for the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), with a condition that the funds cannot be given if the LAF is controlled by a foreign terrorist organization like Hezbollah. The future of Lebanon is uncertain due to unrest in Syria, posing challenges for U.S. policy priorities in the region. The impact of developments in Syria on assistance programs and goals, concerns about religious minority protection in Syria and Lebanon, minimizing risks posed by Hezbollah in Lebanon, enhancing protection for Israel amidst regional unrest, and safeguarding the Lebanese economy from political unrest through U.S. assistance and trade policies."
