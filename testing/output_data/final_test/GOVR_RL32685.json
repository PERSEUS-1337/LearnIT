    "content": "The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) established the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) as an independent federal agency to replace the Office of Election Administration (OEA) of the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The EAC is bipartisan and responsible for grant programs, testing and certification of voting systems, studying election issues, and issuing voluntary guidelines. Members serve four-year terms and may be reappointed once. The agency does not have rule-making authority or enforce HAVA requirements. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) does not have rule-making authority or enforce HAVA requirements. It was initially delayed in its establishment and faced funding challenges, limiting its ability to assist states in preparation for the 2004 election. However, it has since been fully staffed and engaged in major activities under its HAVA mandate. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) has been fully staffed and engaged in major activities under its HAVA mandate, including the release of best practices for election administrators, Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, and distribution of payments to states. HAVA established grant programs for election administration improvements and system replacements, with funding provided through Title I and Title II. Additional funding was appropriated in FY2008. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) provided funding for various programs, including making polling places accessible to persons with disabilities and supporting research and pilot programs for voting technology. Some programs to encourage student participation in elections were also established. However, concerns remain about the sufficiency of payments to states to meet HAVA requirements, leading to funding uncertainty. Funding uncertainty for HAVA requirements persists due to controversies over electronic voting systems. HAVA established federal requirements for election administration, with most going into effect in January 2006. Congress has provided funding beyond FY2005 for major programs under HAVA. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) established federal requirements for election administration, including the use of provisional ballots for first-time voters and those casting ballots during court-ordered extensions of polling hours. States were required to replace lever machines or punchcard voting systems by November 2004. The provisional ballot requirement has been somewhat controversial but was included in HAVA to address issues from the 2000 election controversy. States vary in implementing the provisional ballot requirement under HAVA, leading to potential disenfranchisement if policies are unclear. Provisional ballots can impact close contests, with outcomes delayed and subject to litigation. Congress may need to clarify the applicability of provisional ballots for federal contests cast outside the home precinct. The voter-identification requirement under HAVA was controversial during the 2002 Senate debate but has not been a major issue in implementation. Some states have broader identification requirements, including photographic identification, which has raised questions. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that voter-identification requirements are permissible. Starting January 1, 2006, voting systems for federal elections had to allow for error correction by voters. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) requires voting systems to have error correction, manual auditing, accessibility for disabled persons, and alternative languages. It also mandates voter privacy, uniform voting standards, and a paper record for manual audits. States must use computerized voter registration systems and replace outdated voting machines. Beginning in 2007, new voting systems purchased with Title II requirements payments had to be fully accessible for persons with disabilities. States like Maryland and Georgia adopted direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting systems to meet HAVA requirements. However, concerns over the reliability and security of DREs led to the adoption of paper ballots in many states, with a voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) allowing for inspection before casting the ballot. The use of paper ballots with a voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) or paper-based optical-scan voting systems has been proposed for federal elections. Bills have been introduced in Congress for this requirement, but its enactment is uncertain. The EAC's technical committee has suggested that certified voting systems should have an independent means of auditing votes, aligning with HAVA's performance standards. This allows for the development of new systems with higher levels of verifiability, security, and accessibility compared to paper ballots. The introduction of new voting systems with higher levels of verifiability, security, and accessibility is hindered by specific design standards in introduced bills. Some states have faced challenges in replacing voting equipment to meet HAVA requirements, leading to delays in implementing new systems. Despite waivers for developing computerized voter-registration lists, at least 11 states missed the 2006 deadline for compliance. The absence of a clear national standard for voter lists has led to uncertainties about implementation. Issues such as new-voter registration, concerns about fraud, and challenges to voter registrations at polling places have arisen. State and local jurisdictions vary in data collection and availability, impacting informed decision-making. The EAC, responsible for election research under HAVA, lacks authority to ensure necessary actions. The EAC lacks authority to ensure necessary data for election administration. Congress provided $10 million for grants to improve data collection in FY2008. Legislation like HAVA and the Defense Authorization Act have amended voting processes for military and overseas citizens. Despite efforts to help military and overseas voters, challenges remain with timing and reliance on mail for absentee ballots. Some states allow faxed voting materials, but privacy concerns exist. Delays in printing and sending out ballots have persisted in past elections, including in 2004 and 2006. In the 2006 elections, the EAC reported that only 33% of military and overseas ballots were counted, with 70% returned as undeliverable. Congress could address timing issues by launching an information campaign before elections. The Overseas Vote Foundation's website launched in October 2007 to assist UOCAVA voters. Each state must designate an office to administer the law, and a hotline number in each state could help individual voters. The Federal Voting Assistance Program provides toll-free numbers for voters, allowing the use of federal blank ballots without restrictions. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) required the development of Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) by the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to replace previous standards. The VVSG, developed in cooperation with NIST, include new sections on security, human factors, and testing procedures. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) mandated the creation of Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) by the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) in cooperation with NIST. These guidelines include sections on security, human factors, conformance, and testing procedures, which took effect in December 2007. The EAC is responsible for establishing testing and certification procedures, with NIST providing advisory support and developing a laboratory accreditation program. The EAC has accredited laboratories for testing and certifying voting systems under the VVSG, despite delays and funding uncertainties. Congress has provided appropriations for NIST support activities as part of the EAC funding. The VVSG, created under HAVA, have faced criticism for their scope, approach, and effectiveness. The 2007 revision aimed to address security concerns about DREs and align more closely with international standards. However, controversy surrounds the burden on manufacturers and the perceived lack of comprehensiveness in revising only part of the VSS. Calls for increased openness and certification changes have also been made. Calls for increased openness and changes to the certification process have been made regarding absentee ballots. While federal standards do not exist, the EAC is required to study absentee voting under HAVA. Some states allow any voter to request an absentee ballot, with Oregon conducting all elections by mail. Concerns have been raised about the vulnerability of mail-in voting to fraud and coercion. Absentee ballots are a classic example of state-by-state election administration, with eligibility, types of ballots, deadlines, and counting procedures varying widely. Absentee voting is increasing, with some voters opting for it to avoid using DREs at polling places. Congress may consider legislation like the Universal Right to Vote by Mail Act of 2007, which aims to establish universal absentee voting by mail and require signature matching for absentee ballots. Some states offer early voting programs where voters can cast a ballot in person before election day. The number of states with early voting is increasing, with different procedures for voting locations and hours. Critics argue that early voting can distort the electoral process and be susceptible to fraud. Early voting is a form of remote voting that can increase turnout and lessen certain distortions in the electoral process. The trend of states offering early voting is on the rise, with potential legislation to require all states to establish early voting programs. A Defense Department program for military members to vote online was cancelled in 2004 due to concerns about tampering. In 2004, an expanded Internet voting program was planned in the United States, building on a pilot program from 2000. Arizona's Democratic party had a primary in 2000 with 40% of voters casting ballots online. Switzerland has been using Internet voting experimentally for years, with different approaches in various cantons. Limited Internet voting may continue for certain elections in the US. Efforts to facilitate Internet voting in the United States have declined due to security concerns, particularly with the use of DREs. The Defense Department's initiatives are the most likely prospect for the future. There are around 10,000 election jurisdictions in the US, varying in size and resources. Some jurisdictions prioritize periodic elections less than other needs like schools and roads. Funding and personnel also vary among jurisdictions. The demographic profile of local election officials is unique, with funding and personnel varying among jurisdictions. Most pollworkers are older citizens, often unpaid or receiving a small stipend, required to work long hours on election day. Training levels among election administrators vary, with limited provisions for recruiting pollworkers. The expertise of election administrators varies, with concerns about the age and number of pollworkers, especially in high-turnout elections. Recruiting pollworkers has become more difficult, leading to potential errors in elections, impacting voters and outcomes. HAVA requires states to submit plans to the EAC for Title II requirements payments. The Help America Vote Act requires states to submit plans to the EAC for Title II requirements payments, including education and training of election officials and pollworkers. Congress could establish a program to fund training or require the EAC to accredit organizations for certification programs. Voting information must be posted at polling places, disability access ensured, and mail-in voters verified. Some jurisdictions are experimenting with vote centers instead of traditional precinct polling places. HAVA grants aim to improve polling place accessibility, but controversy surrounds provisional voting and voter identification requirements, which vary by state. State legislatures may revisit these topics as HAVA left implementation details to the states. Some states have modified voter identification requirements and procedures for provisional ballots. Issues such as challenging voter eligibility at polling places and proof of citizenship for registration have emerged, with varying state laws and controversies. The security environment post-9/11 raised concerns about potential disruptions to elections. Questions arose regarding postponement and security enhancement, with the executive branch lacking authority to change election times. Congress or states could pass legislation in response to a terrorist attack. Some states have laws allowing for temporary election postponement in response to emergencies, including the power for Governors to suspend certain laws. However, actual election postponements have been rare in the last 150 years. State and local governments are responsible for polling place security, with recommendations for election-security planning including scenario preparation. Reactions to election security varied in the November 2004 election, with some officials making minimal changes and others increasing police presence. Polling-place security issues were less prominent during the 2006 elections. Congress may consider actions to safeguard future elections, including delegating authority to the executive branch and encouraging early and absentee voting. The President and Vice President are elected indirectly by the electoral college, balancing equal state representation with population differences. The U.S. Constitution, through the electoral college system, appoints electors who vote for the President and Vice President. Criticisms include potential for House of Representatives to decide if no majority, winners not reflecting popular vote, and smaller states having advantage in electoral votes. In recent years, there has been heightened interest in reforming the electoral college system, especially after closely contested presidential elections where the electoral college winner did not win the popular vote. Despite efforts to address election administration and voting issues, there has been no significant public mandate for changing or abolishing the electoral college."
