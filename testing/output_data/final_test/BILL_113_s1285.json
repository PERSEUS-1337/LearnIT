The Small Business Innovation Act of 2013 authorizes a program with a total amount not exceeding $4,000,000,000 each fiscal year. The amendment increases the fund limit from $225,000,000 to $350,000,000 for the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. A Small Business Early-Stage Investment Program is established under Title III of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. The term 'early-stage small business' refers to a small business domiciled in a State or Indian country with gross annual sales revenues not exceeding $15,000,000 in the most recent 3 years. An 'eligible applicant' includes incorporated bodies, limited liability companies, or limited partnerships organized under Federal or State law. The term 'participating investment company' refers to an applicant approved to join the early-stage investment program established under section 399B. The program targets small business concerns with gross annual sales revenues not exceeding $15,000,000 in the most recent 3 years. A 'small business concern in a targeted industry' is primarily engaged in researching, developing, manufacturing, producing, or bringing goods, products, or services to market in specific sectors such as advanced manufacturing, agricultural technology, biotechnology, clean energy technology, digital media, environmental technology, information technology, life sciences, and water technology. The Administrator will establish an early-stage investment program to provide equity financing for small businesses. The program will be administered by the Associate Administrator, and applications will be accepted. The program requires applicants to submit a business plan, information on venture capital qualifications, and meeting selection criteria. An abbreviated application process is available for managers of Small Business Investment Companies.

SEC. 399E outlines the selection of participating investment companies. The Administrator must make a determination within 90 days of receiving an application from an eligible applicant under section 399D. The determination will either conditionally approve or disapprove the applicant for the program, with identified conditions to be met within a year. Selection criteria will be considered in the decision-making process. The Administrator evaluates eligible applicants based on their likelihood to meet business plan goals, create or preserve jobs, management character and fitness, experience, investment focus on early-stage small businesses, profitability, and track record. The eligible applicant's investment focus on small businesses in targeted industries that have received funds from federal agencies like NIH, NSF, and SBIR/STTR programs is considered for final approval. Final approval for eligible applicants to participate in the program must be provided by the Administrator within 90 days of meeting specified conditions, with an exception for those whose partnership or management agreement aligns with approved models, in which case approval must be granted within 30 days. Failure to meet the conditions will result in revocation of conditional approval. If the applicant does not meet the conditions set by the Administrator within the specified time frame, the conditional approval will be revoked. \"SEC. 399F. EQUITY FINANCINGS.\" The Administrator may provide equity financings to participating investment companies, with limits on the amount based on non-federal capital and an aggregate cap of $100,000,000. The Administrator can provide equity financing to participating investment companies, with a maximum limit of $100,000,000. The equity financing process involves committing an amount to the investment company for new investments over 5 years and follow-on investments over 10 years. Additional 1-year periods may be available at the Administrator's discretion. The Administrator must commit funds for equity financings within 2 years of appropriation for the program. \"SEC. 399G. INVESTMENTS IN EARLY-STAGE SMALL BUSINESSES.\" As a condition of receiving equity financing, a participating investment company must invest all received amounts in small businesses, with at least 50% in early-stage small businesses in targeted industries. The Administrator will evaluate compliance after 50% of the financing commitment is spent, and may waive requirements if necessary. The Administrator may allow a participating investment company to invest in the fund if it benefits the long-term solvency of the fund established in section 399J. Each investment made by a participating investment company under the program will be treated based on the ratio of capital from equity financings to all available capital for investment. As a condition of receiving equity financing, a participating investment company must convey an equity financing interest to the Administrator. This interest grants the Administrator a pro rata portion of any distributions made by the company, without control or voting rights. The participating investment company must convey an equity financing interest to the Administrator, with allocations of income and profits limited to 20 percent for managers. The participating investment company must distribute excess manager profits interest to investors and the Administrator based on capital contributions. Distributions must be made in cash to investors within a reasonable time after exiting investments. The fund for equity financings is established in the Treasury as a revolving fund for the program. All amounts received by the Administrator will be deposited in the fund. The Administrator may apply certain sections to activities under this part, and participants in the investment company must comply with the requirements. Annual reporting is also required. The Administrator must include program performance information in the annual performance report of the Administration as required by the Small Business Act."
