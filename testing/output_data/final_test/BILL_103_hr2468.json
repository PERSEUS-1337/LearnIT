    "content": "The \"School-Based Childhood Immunizations Program Amendments Act\" establishes a program for childhood immunizations through elementary schools under the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary may provide grants to local educational agencies for children's immunizations in areas with high cases of vaccine-preventable diseases or low immunization rates. The Secretary may provide grants to local educational agencies for children's immunizations in areas with high cases of vaccine-preventable diseases or low immunization rates. The local educational agency must make agreements for the program, including providing immunizations at school premises and having a registered nurse with the principal responsibility for the program. The nurse must be licensed by the state to practice as a nurse and have appropriate credentials or experience in school nursing. Each participating elementary school must make recommended vaccines available to students and siblings below school entry age. Vaccines should also be available to children in family child care homes or child care centers. Immunizations should be administered by school nurses or registered nurses without charge to families. Each participating school will provide immunizations to students and educate the community on the importance of early immunization. The school will also inform parents about the availability of vaccines and the recommended immunizations for children. The participating schools will educate individuals caring for children in child care homes and centers, as well as parents of newborn infants, on the importance of immunizations. The program will also coordinate activities among schools to avoid duplication in the community. The program will coordinate activities among schools to avoid duplicative activities in the community and will be coordinated with local health departments, hospitals, maternity wards, birth registries, and community health centers. Local educational agencies receiving grants must maintain expenditures of non-Federal amounts for specified purposes at a level not less than the preceding fiscal year. Grants are contingent on the agency having an agreement with the State for the supply of vaccines. The program requires local educational agencies to have agreements with the State for the supply of vaccines satisfactory to the Secretary. Additionally, the Secretary may only grant funds if the agencies ensure participation from various public and private entities for educating individuals. The Secretary may only grant funds if an application containing necessary agreements is submitted. Permissible expenditures include carrying out the education program and recruiting a school nurse. The Secretary may authorize funds for a program, with a limitation on costs not directly related to immunizations at schools. Definitions include immunizations against vaccine-preventable diseases and the meaning of 'local educational agency'. The Education Act of 1965 authorizes funds for immunizations at participating schools, with a grant of $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and additional funding for subsequent years. The term 'school nurse' is defined as a nurse providing immunizations."
