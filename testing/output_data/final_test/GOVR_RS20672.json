    "content": "Sources of arsenic in water include natural sources like rocks and soils, as well as releases from its use in wood preservatives, semi-conductors, paints, mining, and agriculture. Arsenic is more commonly found in elevated levels in ground water compared to surface water. Small communities relying on wells for drinking water are more likely to have higher concentrations of arsenic. In the United States, the average arsenic level in ground-water samples is less than or equal to 1 part per billion (ppb), but higher levels are not uncommon, especially in Western states where some water systems exceed 10 ppb and even 50 ppb in some locations. Parts of the Midwest and New England also have water systems with arsenic levels exceeding 10 ppb. The EPA estimated that about 5.5% of regulated water systems, serving 13 million people, were likely to exceed the new arsenic standard of 10 ppb. The previous standard of 50 ppb was set in 1942 and updated in 1975. Congress required new standards for arsenic by 1989, but EPA missed the deadline due to extensive risk assessment issues. Due to assessment issues, the EPA missed the 1989 deadline for setting a new arsenic standard. A citizen suit led to a consent decree with a new deadline of November 1995. In 1995, the EPA decided to delay the rule to better understand health effects and cost-effective removal technologies for small utilities. Congress directed the EPA to propose a new standard for arsenic by January 1, 2000, and to finalize it by January 1, 2001. The EPA was also required to develop a research plan in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences to reduce uncertainty in assessing health risks from arsenic exposure. The National Research Council (NRC) reviewed arsenic toxicity data for EPA in 1999, recommending a lower standard without specifying a level. The NRC affirmed arsenic as a human carcinogen but questioned EPA's dose-response assessment based on a Taiwan study lacking detail. Research indicated higher arsenic intake in Taiwan than the US, complicating risk assessment efforts. The NRC concluded that high levels of arsenic exposure can cause lung and bladder cancers, recommending studies to improve risk assessment. EPA proposed lowering the arsenic standard from 50 ppb to 5 ppb, considering options of 3 ppb, 10 ppb, and 20 ppb based on NRC analysis and recent research. EPA planned to further assess arsenic's cancer risks before finalizing the rule. The EPA set the arsenic standard at 10 ppb for both community and non-transient, non-community water systems, giving them five years to comply. Approximately 3,000 community water systems and 1,100 non-transient, non-community water systems would need to take measures to meet the standard. EPA is required to establish a maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) to ensure no adverse health effects. The EPA sets the maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) at a level where no adverse health effects occur, with an enforceable standard, the MCL, set as close to the MCLG as feasible. Cost considerations are taken into account, with a focus on large water systems. Congress recognizes that technologies for large cities may not be applicable to small systems. In 1996, Congress expanded SDWA variance and exemption provisions to address small system compliance concerns. EPA must list affordable compliance technologies for small systems for each rule establishing an MCL. If not listed, variance technologies can be used, which do not need to meet the MCL but must be protective of public health. EPA has not identified variance technologies for arsenic or any other standards as affordable compliance technologies are available for all standards. In 2002, Congress directed EPA to review criteria for determining affordable compliance treatment technologies for small systems. EPA proposed three options to revise affordability criteria in 2006, with the current threshold at 2.5% of median household income. The proposed options are 0.25%, 0.50%, and 0.75%. EPA aims to address ensuring affordability in the revised criteria. EPA plans to address the issue of ensuring variance technology is protective of public health in the revised criteria for the new Stage 2 Disinfectants/Disinfection Byproducts Rule. Exemptions provide compliance flexibility for small systems, allowing temporary relief from standards for reasons such as cost. The arsenic rule allows systems up to five years to comply, with exemptions granting an additional three years for qualified systems. Systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons may receive up to three two-year extensions, totaling a nine-year exemption duration. EPA emphasizes exemptions as a crucial tool for states to assist systems needing financial support. Exemptions are crucial for states to assist systems with compliance. To grant an exemption, a public hearing is required to ensure no unreasonable health risks. States have rarely granted exemptions due to the complex process and undefined health risk criteria. EPA must determine if the benefits of a rule justify the costs, setting standards accordingly. EPA found that feasible arsenic levels are necessary for health risk reduction benefits. The EPA proposed a standard of 5 ppb for arsenic levels, citing cost-benefit considerations. The final rule applies to schools and non-community water systems, estimating it could prevent bladder and lung cancer cases and deaths each year. The EPA estimated that 19 to 25 lung cancer cases and 16 to 22 lung cancer deaths could be prevented each year by meeting the 10 ppb standard for arsenic levels in water. The cost of meeting the standard could range from $38 to $327 per year for smaller systems serving fewer than 10,000 people, with an estimated national cost of $181 million annually. The EPA's Science Advisory Board raised concerns about the economic and engineering assessment of the rule, suggesting further consideration of affordability. The EPA faced opposition from municipalities and water system representatives regarding the affordability of the new arsenic standard. The American Water Works Association estimated the annual cost to be $600 million, with potential costs of up to $2,000 per household in certain regions. The final rule was issued in January 2001 but was delayed multiple times due to concerns about the science and cost to communities. The EPA delayed the effective date of the arsenic standard until February 22, 2002, without changing the 2006 compliance date for water systems. The NRC reviewed EPA's arsenic risk analysis and health effects research, while the NDWAC reassessed the rule's cost and the SAB reviewed its benefits. Public comments were requested on setting the standard at 3, 5, 10, or 20 ppb. Studies showed that chronic arsenic exposure is linked to increased bladder and lung cancer risk below the current MCL of 50 \u03bcg/L. The NDWAC found EPA's cost estimate credible and suggested improvements, while the SAB provided suggestions for enhancing the benefits analysis. In October 2001, EPA affirmed 10 ppb as the appropriate arsenic standard and allocated $20 million for research on treatment technologies to aid small systems comply. Congress expressed concerns over the regulation's cost to rural communities, directing EPA to review affordability criteria and small system programs for arsenic compliance. EPA submitted a report in 2002 addressing these directives. EPA addressed directives by developing a small community assistance plan, sponsoring research on arsenic treatment technologies, and issuing guidance for exemptions. Congress provided $8.2 million for arsenic removal research in FY2005 due to concerns over economic impact on rural communities. EPA was directed to report on community impacts and propose compliance alternatives. In the 110th Congress, legislative efforts focused on helping economically struggling communities comply with the arsenic rule and other drinking water standards. Various bills were offered to promote small system compliance by providing technical and financial assistance. The Water Infrastructure Financing Act proposed to increase funding authority for EPA's Drinking Water State Revolving Fund program and create a grant program for small or economically disadvantaged communities. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed to assist small water systems with compliance, funding, and technical assistance. S. 1933 would have created a grant program for small water systems, while S. 1429 and H.R. 6313 sought to reauthorize funding for technical assistance. S. 2509 proposed promoting affordable technologies and revising affordability criteria, with a focus on high-priority rules like the arsenic rule. H.R. 2141 aimed to grant exemptions for naturally occurring contaminants. In the 111th Congress, legislation addressing arsenic in drinking water has been introduced, along with broader infrastructure bills. The Water Infrastructure Financing Act would authorize $14.7 billion for the DWSRF program over five years and establish a grant program for small and economically disadvantaged communities. The Water Protection and Reinvestment Act aims to create a water infrastructure trust fund for funding drinking water and wastewater projects. H.R. 2206 proposes funding for water infrastructure projects through an excise tax on beverages and pharmaceuticals. It also includes reauthorization of technical assistance for small water systems. H.R. 4798 and S. 3038 address arsenic in drinking water, with the House bill requiring exemptions for small systems from contaminants if compliance is not feasible, and S. 3038 focusing on barriers to treatment technologies. The bill aims to study barriers to using treatment technologies, develop guidance for states, revise affordability criteria, ensure funds for smaller systems, and establish a research pilot program. Safe Drinking Water Act compliance and infrastructure issues are longstanding concerns in Congress, but new funding legislation prospects are uncertain due to resource competition and policy agenda ambiguity."
