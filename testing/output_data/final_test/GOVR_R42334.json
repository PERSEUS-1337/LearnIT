    "content": "After years of rapid growth in defense budgets, federal budget deficits are leading to a projected substantial decline in military spending. The Department of Defense is facing a reduction of about $490 billion in planned programs through FY2021 due to limits on discretionary spending. Senior defense officials warn that deeper cuts could weaken critical capabilities and risk creating a hollow force. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates emphasizes the need to manage reductions prudently to avoid past mistakes. The Administration warns against repeating past mistakes of meeting budget targets by making across-the-board cuts, which led to a hollowing-out of the military in the 1970s and late 1990s. There is concern that significant cuts to the defense budget could result in a hollow force, a situation where proper training, maintenance, equipment, and manpower are lacking. Newer Members and staff may not fully understand the conditions that led to a hollow force in the past and the actions taken to address it. The Administration warns against repeating past mistakes that led to a hollow force in the military. Congress will likely encounter claims of a potential hollow force due to budget constraints and strategic changes. Understanding how the military became hollow in the past can provide context for legislative action. Recent warnings about avoiding a hollow force refer to historical periods post-Vietnam and the 1990s. In the 1970s, concerns about declining military capabilities were focused on personnel quality, exacerbated by challenges in adapting to the All-Volunteer Force. By the early 1990s, after the Cold War, worries shifted to potential erosion of gains in personnel quality and training due to budget cuts. In the mid-to-late 1990s, concerns about military readiness focused on sustaining pay, benefits, training, equipment, and personnel support to prevent a decline in capabilities. Issues evolved from strain on personnel due to contingency operations to recruiting and retention challenges, and eventually to funding for major weapons programs. Defense spending limitations led to a \"procurement holiday\" that hindered financing for weapons programs. The U.S. military faced challenges in the 1970s after the Vietnam War, with issues such as low education levels among recruits, recruitment scandals, and desertions. The end of the draft in 1973 worsened the situation. During the 1970s, the U.S. military faced challenges with low education levels among recruits, recruitment scandals, and desertions. Military base pay increased but fell behind inflation, leading to a decline in real terms by 1980. Efforts to narrow the gap with pay raises were insufficient due to continued high inflation levels. High inflation levels persisted in the 1970s, causing a decline in take-home pay. The structure of pay raises favored new enlistments over experienced non-commissioned officers, leading to discontent. Additionally, military family benefits, such as housing and moving allowances, lost value relative to inflation and base pay. In the 1970s, military pay and benefits eroded, causing financial difficulties for service members with families. By 1979, junior enlisted salaries were below the poverty level, leading to reliance on food stamps. This decline in pay and benefits resulted in a shortage of qualified recruits, impacting unit readiness and soldier quality. The Army faced serious shortages in qualified soldiers in the late 1970s, with 40% of new recruits being separated for disciplinary reasons. By 1979, 6 out of 10 Army divisions in the US were deemed \"not combat-ready,\" and even units in Europe were facing readiness issues. General Fredrick Kroesen criticized the readiness of the US Army in Europe, stating it had become \"obsolescent.\" The Reserve components faced even more dire readiness posture than the Active component, with personnel shortages, equipment deficiencies, and inadequate training. Shortages of critical equipment, repair parts, and declines in operational training were recurring concerns, making it difficult to maintain readiness. In the late 1970s, there was a decline in important military readiness measures despite consistent growth in funding for operation and maintenance. DOD tracking of this funding has been inconsistent, making it challenging to follow trends accurately. Lack of funding for weapons procurement also contributed to perceptions of a hollow force during that time. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a lack of funding for modern weapons procurement, leading to concerns about military readiness. The development of new weapons systems, such as the M-1 tank and F-15 fighter, was hindered by budget constraints. The service chiefs called for a substantial increase in the defense budget to finance planned weapons programs, which eventually led to a growth in defense spending during that period. Defense spending in the late 1970s and early 1980s focused on weapons acquisition, with procurement funding fluctuating disproportionately compared to overall budget trends. Concerns arise that procurement and research accounts may be reduced disproportionately as funding declines. A 1996 study by the Center for Naval Analysis suggests seven possible causes of the post-Vietnam hollow force. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw a focus on weapons acquisition in defense spending, with concerns about disproportionate reductions in procurement and research accounts as funding declined. The post-Vietnam hollow force was attributed to low public support, pressure to cut defense spending, difficulties in maintaining a high-quality volunteer force, declining pay, poor morale, delays in modern armaments, and inadequate equipment maintenance. Public disillusionment with the Vietnam War led to rapid reductions in defense spending, delaying the acquisition of modern weapons further. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, defense spending focused on weapons acquisition, with concerns about reductions in procurement and research accounts. The decision to prioritize modernization over readiness was criticized, leading to an imbalance between defense resources and national security commitments. General Edward C. Meyer played a role in this period as Chief of Staff of the Army. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, defense spending focused on weapons acquisition, with concerns about reductions in procurement and research accounts. General Edward C. Meyer, Chief of Staff of the Army (1979-1983), introduced the term \"hollow Army\" during a House Armed Services Committee hearing in 1980. He highlighted the under-strength tactical forces in the United States, with many units being \"zeroed out.\" Defense officials had the option to reduce the number of Army divisions and keep them at full strength, suggesting a degree of culpability in creating the hollow divisions. The Army maintained divisions and headquarters but reduced their strength to address potential contingencies, such as countering the Warsaw Pact in Europe, North Korean aggression in Korea, and ensuring the sovereignty of the Panama Canal. War plans focused on specific formations and unit-to-unit ratios for victory. General Meyer's testimony popularized the term \"hollow force\" to describe the under-strength tactical forces in the United States. After General Meyer's testimony popularized the term \"hollow force\" to describe military readiness shortages in the mid and late 1970s, anecdotal press accounts in 1980 highlighted issues such as a fleet oiler unable to deploy due to lack of experienced personnel and a fighter wing failing a mobilization test. The reversal of the Army's decline in the 1980s was attributed to congressional support for higher military spending, training reorganization, doctrinal emphasis, and improved personnel policies. Congress initiated a rapid infusion of funds in 1980 and 1981 to address these issues. In the 1980s, Congress increased servicemember salaries by 25% and implemented targeted improvements in compensation, such as the Montgomery G.I. Bill. These changes, along with advancements in military combat planning and training, helped close the personnel quality gap. Army Major General Maxwell Thurman led reforms in Army recruiting practices and training during this period. During the 1980s, the Army developed Air Land Battle Doctrine, improved unit cohesion, and reduced personnel stripping for deploying units. Similar efforts were made by other services to enhance personnel quality, training, and readiness. Assessing the results of these initiatives is challenging due to the long-term effects, problematic readiness measures, and difficulties in evaluating new weapons programs. Revisions in military enlistments addressed concerns about the hollow force at the end of the 1970s. Revisions in military pay and benefits in the late 1970s led to significant improvements in recruit quality, as shown by performance on the Armed Forces Qualification Test. The proportion of recruits in the lowest qualification category declined from 31% in FY1980 to 8% by FY1983, demonstrating a strengthened U.S. military. This was evident in the successful performance during the 1991 Gulf War. In the early 1990s, there were substantial defense budget cuts following the Gulf War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. General Colin Powell introduced the \"Base Force\" plan, reducing the size of the military due to the diminished Soviet threat. The Clinton Administration further trimmed $60 billion from the defense budget through FY1997. The Clinton Administration made significant defense budget cuts in the early 1990s, following the Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. The outgoing Administration's defense plan included reducing active duty end-strength from 1.6 million to 1.4 million. The 1993 \"Bottom-Up Review\" set new force planning requirements for two Major Regional Contingencies, similar to Operation Desert Storm. Critics argued that planned force levels were inadequate and budget cuts had already impacted military readiness. Senator McCain raised concerns about potential reductions leading to a hollow force similar to the 1970s. Senator McCain analyzed the readiness status of service chiefs and presented his findings in a series of speeches on the Senate floor. He highlighted concerns such as high operational tempo affecting equipment maintenance, excessive deployment of personnel, strains on combat equipment, depot maintenance backlogs, underfunding of personnel pay and benefits, and inadequate end-strength. Senator McCain highlighted concerns such as maintenance backlogs, underfunding of personnel pay and benefits, inadequate end-strength, excessive turbulence in personnel deployments, underfunding of weapons modernization, and funding peacekeeping operations at the expense of readiness. He emphasized the importance of measuring readiness in real-world terms, citing the Gulf War as an example of readiness challenges despite high funding levels. During the Gulf War deployment, adjustments were made to combat forces, reserves faced training issues, and equipment modifications were necessary. Senator McCain and other Members of Congress expressed concerns about readiness challenges and overseas operation costs. Representative John Murtha warned of weakening the military force if costly deployments continued without hardware program cuts. The U.S. military faced concerns about becoming a 'hollow force' in FY 95 due to funds being used for deployments instead of readiness. A readiness task force chaired by General Meyer was established to review readiness status and propose measures to sustain readiness. The task force found that current readiness was acceptable but recommended measures to address legitimate concerns about continuing force reductions. The task force recommended measures to address concerns about readiness degradation, including improved tracking of funding allocations and development of a system for funding contingency operations without disrupting readiness. Increased emphasis on Joint and Combined readiness was also advised. During the Clinton Administration, there was a focus on Joint and Combined readiness, with efforts to develop joint mission essential task lists. Budget trends showed sensitivity towards readiness, with concerns about funding falling short of levels needed to sustain readiness due to growing operating costs. The Department of Defense responded by adding funds to operation and maintenance accounts annually. During the 1990s, the Department of Defense responded to budget insufficiencies by prioritizing funds for operation and maintenance accounts over weapons procurement. This led to a \"procurement holiday\" as procurement funding remained frozen at around $45 billion annually from FY1994 to FY1998. The focus on readiness was further strained by repeated military operations abroad, including interventions in Haiti, operations in Bosnia and Kosovo, and maintaining no-fly zones in Iraq. The Army faced strain due to frequent deployments for operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq, leading to concerns about retention and sustainability of the force. The military faced concerns about retention due to repeated deployments, but readiness issues from the 1990s did not materialize. Recruitment and retention fell short of targets, but O&M funding remained consistent. The Clinton Administration prioritized increasing military pay and benefits, including boosting housing allowances. Operations abroad strained the force, but deployments to the Balkans were regularized and assigned to reserve units. The term \"hollow force\" was used to describe the effects of defense budget declines. The defense budget decline in the 1990s mainly affected weapons modernization, with procurement dropping to half of its peak in the mid-1980s. Budgets began to increase in FY1998, with a significant acceleration after FY2000. Some officials are concerned about the possibility of a new hollow force as the U.S. government considers defense budget cuts to reduce the deficit and shift focus to the Asia-Pacific region. Leon Panetta emphasized that despite fiscal challenges, there will be no hollow force. During a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Readiness, General Peter W. Chiarelli expressed concerns about a potential hollow force due to budget cuts and force reductions. He emphasized the strain on equipment, soldiers, and families after a 10-year war, urging responsible decision-making to avoid a hollow force. General Joseph Dunford, Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, emphasized the need for responsible force reductions to avoid creating a hollow or unbalanced force. He stated that Defense Secretary Panetta's strategy refinement will inform recommendations, with a focus on maintaining balance in cuts to prevent a hollow force. Marine Corps Lieutenant General Richard Mills disputed the idea of a return to a hollow force, highlighting the importance of rational debate on national defense priorities. General Joseph Dunford and Marine Corps Lieutenant General Richard Mills emphasized the need for responsible force reductions to prevent a hollow force. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey remains confident in the military's ability to function well despite budget constraints. Army leaders should focus on reshaping the Army for a post-Iraq and Afghanistan world instead of worrying about specific budget line items. Comparing projected budget trends to past eras like the hollow force of the 1970s or the procurement holiday of the 1990s may not be appropriate, as current public support for the military is high. In a May 2010 survey by Rasmussen Reports, 74% of Americans had a favorable opinion of the U.S. military. The CRS Report RL32965 noted that in FY2010, all Active Components met recruit quantity goals with improved recruit quality. Retention was strong across all services, with the Army and Navy exceeding goals. The Air Force fell short in some areas, while most Reserve Components met their goals. In FY2010, all Reserve Components except the Army National Guard met or exceeded recruit quantity goals. The National Guard intentionally reduced recruiting to lower its strength. Recruit quality improved for most Reserve Components, with lower attrition rates than in FY2009. A smaller military and budget could lead to more selective recruiting and better retention. Declining pay is not a significant factor in the potential return to a hollow force. In the past decade, military compensation has increased by over 55% above inflation, with average annual cost per servicemember exceeding $100,000. Calls have been made to reduce military compensation as part of deficit reduction measures. The morale of U.S. troops is declining due to repeated deployments to combat zones, causing stress and anxiety. As deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan decrease, morale may improve. Congress is focusing on funding reset to repair equipment used in these conflicts. The military services have discretion in allocating operation and maintenance funds for equipment reset, despite concerns about future budget cuts. The Budget Control Act of 2011 does not limit funding for Overseas Contingency Operations, a key source for reset expenditures. Large-scale budget cuts could hinder modernization efforts, potentially putting the U.S. at a military disadvantage. The military services utilized increased procurement funding to modernize their forces significantly. The Army upgraded its M-1 Abrams and M-2 Bradley fleets, support vehicles, and small arms inventory. The Air Force fielded next-generation systems like the F-22 fighter and C-17 transport, along with new capabilities such as unmanned aircraft. The Navy advanced its shipbuilding plans and modernized its aircraft fleet. Despite potential future budget constraints, the services invested in modernized forces comparable to the weapons-driven buildup of the 1980s. The recent investments in weapons modernization have resulted in a robust dollar value of modern equipment available to forces today. Comparing to the 1980s buildup, the term \"hollow force\" is deemed inappropriate under present circumstances. Unlike the 1970s, conditions today do not suggest a decline in recruit quality, pay, benefits, or public support for the military. A more fitting analogy would be to the mid-1990s when defense officials had similar concerns. In the mid-1990s, defense officials were concerned about over-extending a smaller but capable military. After Iraq and Afghanistan, the US may rely less on deploying large military forces and instead use other national power instruments. Recent limited US involvement in NATO's Libya operations and sending military personnel to Uganda could be the future model for measured military responses to security challenges. It may be necessary to deploy large numbers of U.S. forces in the future for an extended duration to respond to a crisis or conflict. Military leaders should avoid referencing a hollow force and instead inform decision makers about concerns for the future state of the U.S. military. While significant cuts to the defense budget could impact force structure and weapons programs, senior military leadership plays a key role in resource allocation to prevent a return to the hollow forces of the post-Vietnam era."
