    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"America's Wildlife Heritage Act\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that wildlife conservation is a core American value, providing economic, social, educational, and recreational benefits. The economic value of hunting, fishing, and wildlife-related activities contributes significantly to the American economy. Wildlife habitat is essential and protected by Federal and State entities. Federal public lands are crucial for wildlife conservation in America, protecting endangered species and providing intact habitats away from human development. The changing landscape, especially in the West where most Federal public lands are located, highlights the importance of preserving wildlife and its habitat on these lands. Public lands serve as refuges for species impacted by global climate change, helping them adapt and survive. The goal is to sustain diverse fish and wildlife communities on Federal lands through stewardship guided by long-standing principles of multiple use and sustained yield management. The text defines key terms related to the management of public lands for diverse fish and wildlife communities. The Act defines terms related to managing public lands for diverse fish and wildlife communities, including desired non-native species, indicator species, native species, and planning areas. The Act defines terms related to managing public lands for diverse fish and wildlife communities, including planning areas, Secretaries, Secretary, and species-at-risk. The Act defines terms related to managing public lands for diverse fish and wildlife communities, including planning areas, Secretaries, Secretary, and species-at-risk. State special status species are identified as declining or of special concern through comprehensive wildlife conservation strategies, as well as sensitive or special status species identified by the Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management. A viable population is defined as a population of a species that has the estimated numbers, distribution, and reproduction and survival rates to ensure its persistence for at least 100 years into the future.

A viable population is defined as a population of a species that has the estimated numbers, distribution, and reproduction and survival rates to ensure its persistence for at least 100 years into the future. SEC. 4. VIABLE POPULATIONS. The Secretary must plan and manage lands to maintain viable populations of native and desired non-native species within each planning area. Coordination is required for populations that extend across multiple planning areas. The Secretary must use the best available science to make findings on conditions outside their authority. The Secretary must manage habitat within planning areas to support species viability and ensure activities do not harm species populations. SEC. 5. MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF SPECIES VIABILITY. To determine species population viability, a comprehensive monitoring program is required for National Forest System and Bureau of Land Management lands. This program includes monitoring indicator species, identifying species-at-risk, and conducting population surveys at regular intervals to ensure accurate information on habitats and ecological conditions. The Secretary shall conduct monitoring in cooperation with State agencies to ensure accurate information on species populations in the planning area, including surveys of indicator species and species-at-risk. Relevant population data from Federal and State agencies will be considered. SEC. 6. COORDINATION. The Secretaries will coordinate the management of species populations across different federal agencies and organizations to achieve viable populations, reintroduce extirpated species, establish habitat linkages, and address the impacts of changing climatic conditions. The Secretaries will coordinate the management of species populations across different federal agencies and organizations to achieve viable populations, reintroduce extirpated species, establish habitat linkages, and address the impacts of changing climatic conditions. Additionally, they will conduct joint efforts to support sustainable plant and animal communities across jurisdictional boundaries, without affecting the legal authorities or management standards of the National Wildlife Refuge System or National Park System."
