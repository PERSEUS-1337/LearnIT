    "content": "The United States is concerned about Iran's pursuit of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, as well as advanced conventional weapons. Laws and sanctions have been used to deter countries like Russia, China, and North Korea from providing related technologies to Iran. The Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 added provisions to widen sanctions on foreign persons and banned U.S. government payments to Russia for the International Space Station unless certain conditions are met. This caused difficulties for U.S. access to the ISS when NASA's planned Crew Return Vehicle was cancelled in 2001. The cancellation of NASA's planned Crew Return Vehicle in 2001 by President Bush left astronauts on the International Space Station dependent on the Soyuz. The retirement of the space shuttle fleet in 2010 further increased this dependence. The ISS is a research laboratory in space built through a U.S.-led international partnership, with Expedition crews rotating every 4-6 months since November 2000. Russia, Europe, Canada, and Japan are partners in NASA's space station program, with Russia joining in 1993 through the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission. In 1993, Russia joined the space station program and agreed to abide by the MTCR. The US paid Russia $400 million for cooperation. Russia's commitment to MTCR guidelines was emphasized in the mid-to-late 1990s. However, Russia also provided sensitive technology to Iran, signing an agreement to finish the Bushehr nuclear power reactor in 1995. Russia signed an agreement with Iran to complete the Bushehr nuclear power reactor, valued at $800 million. Reports in 1996 revealed Russian entities aiding Iran's ballistic missile program with various technologies. Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet testified in 1998 that Russian assistance had advanced Iran's missile capabilities. The \"Rumsfeld Commission\" concluded that Russian help significantly accelerated Iran's missile program. The 105th Congress responded with the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act. The Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act (H.R. 2709) was passed to impose sanctions on countries aiding Iran's ballistic missile technology. President Clinton vetoed the bill due to concerns about evidentiary thresholds and mandatory sanctions. He imposed sanctions on Russian entities under Executive Order 13094. Despite these actions, Iran conducted a test flight of the Shahab-3 missile, and reports of Russian assistance continued. In response, H.R. 1883, the Iran Nonproliferation Act, was introduced by House International Relations Committee Chairman Gilman. Relations Committee Chairman Gilman introduced H.R. 1883, the Iran Nonproliferation Act, to address the transfer of dangerous weapons technology to Iran. The bill aimed to provide the Administration with additional tools and countries with incentives to stop proliferation. It allowed for sanctions but not mandatory ones. The House and Senate unanimously passed the bill, which was signed into law on March 14, 2000 (P.L. 106-178). Section 6 of the Act pertained to U.S. Government payments to Russia in connection with the ISS. During markup of Section 6 by the House Science Committee's Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics in 1999, Chairman James Sensenbrenner mentioned concerns about Russian Space Agency violating the MTCR. NASA had paid Russia $800 million for space station activities from 1994 to 1998, but payments were stopped by Section 6 of the bill after January 1, 1999. Exceptions were made for crew safety and other necessary payments, with the possibility of lifting the prohibition based on the President's determination of Russia's actions. President Bush made a major space policy address on January 14, 2004, directing NASA to focus on returning humans to the Moon and eventually sending them to Mars. This \"Vision for Space Exploration\" included retiring the space shuttle in 2010 and fulfilling commitments to finish construction of the ISS. The space shuttle fleet was shut down after the Columbia disaster, leaving the ISS dependent on Russian Soyuz vehicles for crew transport. The shuttle Discovery returned to flight in 2005, but the retirement of the shuttle in 2010 would leave the US without a means to transport astronauts to the ISS until a new vehicle is developed. Russia expected payment for providing Soyuz as a \"lifeboat\" service starting in 2006. NASA applied to Congress for an exemption from the INA to contract with Russian space entities for Soyuz use for ISS missions. The Iran Nonproliferation Amendments Act of 2005 was introduced to ensure American access to the ISS. Critics questioned if exempting payments would encourage alleged proliferation, while supporters argued it was only for ISS-related expenses temporarily. The exemption from the Iran Nonproliferation Amendments Act of 2005 allowed for ISS-related expenses temporarily, without impacting nonproliferation policy. P.L. 109-112 granted an exemption for U.S. government payments related to the ISS made before January 1, 2012. The amendment also applied nonproliferation penalties to trade with Syria and Iran, renaming the act the Iran and Syria Nonproliferation Act to strengthen nonproliferation provisions. The President was directed to submit a report to Congress identifying Russian entities receiving payments since 2005. Since the enactment of the INA in 2005, the United States has made payments under the Agreement Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station. An amendment in 2006 added North Korea to the act, now known as the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA). NASA has started designing spacecraft for Moon missions and flights to the ISS, with plans to finish the ISS before the shuttle is retired in 2010. NASA has also contracted with Russian space entities for astronaut flights to the ISS, with the exemption running out in 2012. On April 11, 2008, NASA proposed extending the exemption for Soyuz flights until the ISS is fully operational or a commercial crew transport vehicle is available. The exemption would not apply to the Russian Progress cargo vehicle. NASA must contract with Russian entities in 2008 for Soyuz vehicles to be available in 2012. Senator Biden introduced S. 3103, the International Space Station Payments Act of 2008, to incorporate NASA's requested measures. The Space Station Payments Act of 2008, incorporating NASA's requested measures, was reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. H.R. 6574, the United States-Russian Federation Nuclear Cooperation Agreement Act of 2008, extended exemption of payments until July 1, 2016, or until a U.S. flight vehicle is operational. The U.S.-Russian civilian nuclear cooperation agreement was withdrawn from congressional consideration. Representative Tom Feeney introduced bill H.R. 7062 authorizing extraordinary payments to the Russian space agency for the use of the Soyuz. Provisions in H.R. 2638 authorize payments to the Russian space agency for using the Soyuz before July 1, 2016, despite restrictions. The waiver expires on July 1, 2016, allowing continued shuttle flights to transport components for the ISS. The Soyuz also transports astronauts and serves as a \"lifeboat\" on the ISS in emergencies. After the space shuttle retires, only the Soyuz will be available for transporting astronauts to and from the ISS until NASA develops new crew and cargo vessels as part of the \"Vision\" to return to the Moon. NASA is investing in private industry efforts to develop transport vehicles for the ISS, including the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. The Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program is still in development. Other options being developed include the European Space Agency's Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) and Japan's H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV). These vehicles are not reusable like the space shuttle. Depending on their progress, the Russian Progress vehicle may still be used for transporting U.S. equipment to the ISS. Exemption from the INKSNA would be required for contracting these services. The 2006 Director of National Intelligence report to Congress on WMD Acquisition highlighted Russian entities supplying ballistic missile-related goods and know-how to China, Iran, India, and North Korea. Russia has increased cooperation with the US and other countries in negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, following revelations of Iran's clandestine nuclear activities. Russia has been involved in negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, delivering fuel to Iran's civilian nuclear reactor at Bushehr with the condition that spent fuel will be returned to Russia. They have also offered Iran participation in their uranium enrichment center at Angarsk. The Bush administration supports this approach, and President Bush has praised Russian President Putin for his leadership in offering a solution to the Iranian nuclear negotiations. Russia prefers a diplomatic solution to the crisis and has been reluctant to support U.N. Security Council resolutions imposing penalties."
