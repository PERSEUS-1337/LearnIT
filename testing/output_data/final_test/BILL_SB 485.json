    "title": "SB 485",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that the county sanitation districts of Los Angeles County provide solid waste management and wastewater services for a large population. These districts are regulated under a permit for the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System. The City of Long Beach operates its own MS4 permit, adopted in 2014, covering over 3,000 square miles. The system is maintained by the Los Angeles County Flood Control District and serves multiple cities for flood protection and water conservation. Stormwater and nonstormwater are conveyed across municipal boundaries within the MS4, discharged into water bodies like the Los Angeles River. The Los Angeles Region MS4 permit requires cities, Los Angeles County Flood Control District, and Los Angeles County to spend millions annually for compliance. One effective technique to clean up nonstormwater discharges is diverting dry weather runoff into the sanitary sewer system if capacity allows. Many entities are developing watershed management plans to improve water quality in receiving water bodies. The sanitation districts' boards of directors, including city presiding officers and the Chair of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, requested authority to manage stormwater and urban runoff for compliance with the Los Angeles Region MS4 permit. The Legislature aims to ensure that these activities do not disrupt existing water management efforts by other agencies. Special legislation is needed to enhance the powers of sanitation districts in the Los Angeles Region MS4 for managing stormwater and urban runoff. The legislation grants additional powers to specific county sanitation districts for diverting stormwater and dry weather runoff within their districts. The legislation grants additional powers to specific county sanitation districts for managing stormwater and dry weather runoff, including treatment, discharge, and beneficial use of the water. The districts may consult with the watermaster before initiating projects in adjudicated groundwater basins to ensure consistency with the adjudication. Before starting stormwater or dry weather runoff projects, districts must consult with the water replenishment district to avoid conflicts. They should also consult with the Los Angeles County Flood Control District to prevent conflicts with flood protection and water conservation activities. This section does not exempt districts from obtaining required permits for their activities. The terms \"stormwater\" and \"dry weather runoff\" have the same meaning as defined in the Water Code. The section clarifies that local agencies are not required to participate in projects authorized under this section. It also ensures that existing water rights, laws, and obligations are not affected by the projects. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for the unique circumstances of the county sanitation districts of Los Angeles County."
