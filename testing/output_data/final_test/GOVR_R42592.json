    "content": "Article V of the U.S. Constitution outlines two methods for amending the Constitution. The first method involves Congress proposing amendments with a two-thirds vote, which must then be approved by three-fourths of the states. The second method allows for a convention to be called by Congress if two-thirds of the states' legislatures request it. This alternative method, known as the \"Article V Convention,\" has never been used successfully. The curr_chunk discusses the Article V Convention procedure, its origins, history, and the role of states in the process. It also mentions a companion report analyzing congressional issues related to the convention alternative. The curr_chunk discusses the President's role, checks and balances in the convention alternative, questions on convention composition and voting methods, and the function of the District of Columbia and U.S. territories in the Article V Convention. Congress holds exclusive responsibilities over the amendment process, including proposing amendments directly to states and calling a convention with two-thirds of state legislatures. Congress historically claims broad responsibilities in connection with a convention. Congress historically claims broad responsibilities in connection with a convention, including receiving, judging, and recording state applications; establishing procedures to summon a convention; setting the amount of time allotted to its deliberations, determining the number and selection process of its delegates; setting internal convention procedures, and providing arrangement for the formal transmission of any proposed amendments to the states. The need for Congress to examine its Article V options and responsibilities may be questioned, as historical precedent shows the difficulty in attaining petitions from two-thirds of the states for an Article V Convention in a timely manner. The Article V Convention mechanism has faced challenges in gaining support from two-thirds of the states, with unsuccessful drives in the latter part of the 20th century. Despite organized efforts, there has been little interest in this process since the 1980s. The legislative process in states serves as a check to haste in calling such a convention, as seen in the balanced budget amendment drive of the 1970s and 1980s. The Article V Convention device is not widely known or understood currently. The Article V Convention device, although not widely known, could be used by issue organizations for constitutional amendments. With modern technology, campaigns for specific amendments could be launched quickly. The availability of instant communication can facilitate rapid growth in awareness. Social media platforms like email have played a significant role in the rapid growth of political movements, such as MoveOn.org and the Tea Party. The Tea Party movement, for example, quickly gained momentum through online discussions and media coverage, leading to large-scale demonstrations across the nation. Additionally, interest in new constitutional amendment proposals has been on the rise in recent years. In recent years, interest has grown in new constitutional amendment proposals, including the \"Repeal Amendment\" and the repeal of the 17th Amendment. Groups supporting these measures may see the Article V Convention as a way to promote their amendments, despite the daunting obstacles set by the Constitution. Congress may need to revisit the issue of the Article V Convention for the first time since the 1980s. Article V of the U.S. Constitution outlines two methods for amending the Constitution: proposals by Congress and conventions called for by two-thirds of state legislatures. Amendments must be ratified by three-fourths of the states through either method, with equal validity. The U.S. Constitution provides two methods for amending it: proposals by Congress and conventions called for by two-thirds of state legislatures. Congress has successfully ratified 27 out of 33 proposed amendments since 1789. Key elements include approval by two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate, followed by ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures or ad hoc conventions. The U.S. Constitution allows for amendments through proposals by Congress or state conventions. Congress must approve amendments with a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate. Amendments are added as supplementary articles, with a seven-year ratification deadline set by Congress. The U.S. Constitution allows for amendments through proposals by Congress or state conventions. Amendments can be ratified by three-fourths of the states. Presidents do not have a role in proposing or approving amendments. The Article V Convention allows states to petition Congress for a convention to consider amendments. An Article V Convention allows states to propose amendments to the Constitution, which must be ratified by three-fourths of the states. The convention may follow traditional practices of proposing amendments as addenda with a seven-year time limit for ratification. The President has no role in proposing amendments by a convention, unlike amendments proposed by Congress. The concept of directly forwarding constitutional amendments to the states was discussed during the Constitutional Convention of 1787. During the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the amendment clause evolved to allow states and Congress to propose amendments. Delegates were concerned about not giving exclusive amending power to Congress. James Madison's version of Article V finalized the process. Article V in the Constitution allows for amendments to be proposed by two-thirds of both Houses of Congress or by two-thirds of the state legislatures. Amendments must be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures or by conventions in three-fourths of the states. Two amendments were added, one regarding the slave trade before 1808 and the other ensuring equal suffrage for states. The second amendment, guaranteeing equal suffrage in the Senate, was added to reassure less populous states. The Federalist confirms that proposing amendments should involve both Congress and state legislatures, as it guards against easy changes while allowing for necessary adjustments. The Federalist emphasizes the importance of allowing both Congress and state governments to propose amendments to address discovered faults and ensure a spirit of accommodation to constituents. Alexander Hamilton highlights the state petition process as a potential remedy to congressional inaction. The Constitution's fifth article mandates Congress to call a convention for proposing amendments when nine states agree, ensuring a method for future amendments to be discussed and implemented. This can be done through recommendations from Congress or by states if Congress fails to act. The Article V state application process complements the congressional process for proposing amendments. It allows states to call a convention for proposing amendments if two-thirds of state legislatures apply, ensuring a backup method in case Congress neglects to recommend amendments. This provision is seen as excellent and necessary in case the federal government shows signs of corruption. The founders crafted Article V with the intention of balancing power and not favoring Congress as the predominant method of amending the Constitution. They believed in checks and balances, leading to the need for a second mode of amendment. The founders crafted Article V to balance power and provide a second mode of amendment, empowering the people through their state legislatures to propose amendments. James Madison emphasized the need for government to control itself in Federalist 51. The Article V Convention allows for proposing amendments to the Constitution, requiring approval by three-fourths of the states. It has been a part of American history since 1789, with a surge in applications between 1900 and 1999. The late 19th-century movement for direct election of U.S. Senators is considered the first organized campaign for an Article V Convention. It achieved its goal without a convention, while other campaigns for state legislature apportionment and a balanced federal budget came close to meeting the constitutional threshold. During the late 19th century, the movement for direct election of U.S. Senators aimed to address vacancies and influence from corporate interests. Public opinion and reform groups sought popular election as a solution. During the late 19th century, the movement for direct election of U.S. Senators aimed to address vacancies and influence from corporate interests. The House of Representatives proposed a relevant amendment in 1894, but direct election amendments in the Senate did not progress. In 1893, Nebraska's legislature revived Article V, allowing states to apply for a convention to consider amendments. Pennsylvania led the way by approving a \"model\" application for an Article V Convention in 1899, reflecting growing support for direct election. The movement for direct election of U.S. Senators gained momentum in the late 19th century. States began applying for a convention to consider amendments, leading to the adoption of the \"Oregon Plan\" where state legislators committed to voting for the Senate candidate with the most popular votes. This eventually led to the proposal and adoption of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution in 1912. The 17th Amendment to the Constitution was proposed through a concerted effort by states, known as the \"prodding effect,\" to push Congress to take action. While the 20th century saw various attempts by state legislatures to call for an Article V Convention on different issues, none were successful in reaching the required number of applications. In the 20th century, successful drives for an Article V Convention focused on apportionment in state legislatures and a balanced federal budget. The 1960s campaign followed the 17th Amendment and was sparked by a Supreme Court ruling on equal population districts in state legislatures. In the 1960s, districts were drawn in rural areas to preserve influence for \"farm interests\" and \"the rural vote.\" Critics feared excessive dominance of state governments by \"urban interests.\" Opponents, led by Everett M. Dirksen, tried to delay the Supreme Court's decision through legislation and then introduced a constitutional amendment allowing states to use factors besides population in apportioning legislatures. In the 1960s, districts were drawn to preserve influence for \"farm interests\" and \"the rural vote.\" Opponents, led by Everett M. Dirksen, introduced a constitutional amendment allowing states to use factors besides population in apportioning legislatures. Dirksen's proposal failed to win the necessary two-thirds margin in the Senate, leading to a shift in focus to an Article V Convention endorsed by the General Assembly of the Council of State Governments. The first state applications for a convention to consider amendments on legislative apportionment were submitted in 1963, with 33 states filing by the 91st Congress (1969-1970). By 1963, 33 states had filed Article V applications for a convention on legislative apportionment, just one short of the required two-thirds. However, opposition grew as the likelihood of a convention increased, leading to several states rescinding their applications. The unexpected death of Senator Dirksen in 1969 marked the effective end of the campaign. The movement for an Article V Convention to consider a balanced budget amendment began in the mid-1970s, led by the National Taxpayers Union. Throughout the 1970s, there was a wave of public interest in restraining tax increases, creating a favorable environment for the movement. The movement for a balanced budget amendment through an Article V Convention gained momentum in the mid-1970s, with support from California Governor Jerry Brown and Senator Robert Dole. By 1979, 30 states had applied for a convention, just shy of the required number. Critics raised concerns as the number of state applications increased. Critics mobilized against the state applications for an Article V Convention, forming Citizens for the Constitution to oppose a balanced budget amendment. The opposition warned of financial constraints and a potential runaway convention, while supporters accused them of scare tactics. The campaign lost momentum as new applications faced tough debates in state legislatures. The Article V Convention campaign faced tough debates in state legislatures, with no further applications made after 1983. Despite failing to meet the constitutional hurdle, the campaign led to congressional consideration of a balanced budget amendment, with the Senate passing S.J.Res. 58 in 1982. In 1982, a vote for an Article V Convention failed to meet the two-thirds requirement. Supporters turned to legislative alternatives like the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act to achieve a balanced budget. This led to a decrease in state applications for a convention. The House Republicans' \"Contract with America\" included a balanced budget amendment proposal in 1994. The proposal, H.J.Res. 1, passed in the House but fell short in the Senate. Despite ongoing efforts to propose a balanced federal budget amendment, the campaign for an Article V Convention effectively ended in the mid-1980s. Between 1988 and 2010, 17 state legislatures rescinded their applications for a convention. Between 1973 and 1992, 17 state legislatures passed resolutions of rescission, some specifically citing a convention for a balanced budget amendment. Congress addressed the convention issue with study and legislative proposals in the 1970s and 1980s. 22 bills and resolutions were introduced in the House of Representatives, while 17 were introduced in the Senate, seeking to provide standards and procedures for a potential Article V Convention. The Article V Convention can only be called when two-thirds of state legislatures submit applications. The Constitution lacks details on the enabling procedure, leaving it up to the states to determine the process. The legislatures of the states play a crucial role in the potential convention, as they must submit applications or petitions to Congress. Minimal guidance is provided in the Constitution for the state petition process. The Constitution provides minimal guidance for the state petition process for an Article V Convention, stating that Congress should call a convention on the application of two-thirds of the states' legislatures. Precedents suggest that applications should come from both houses of state legislatures, with approval required in both chambers of the proposing legislature. The only modern exception is Nebraska, which has a unicameral legislature. The states have used various parliamentary instruments for an Article V Convention application, including concurrent resolutions, joint resolutions, and memorials. Questions have been raised about the standards for approval, such as the necessary margin and type of vote required. Nebraska is the only state with a unicameral legislature. Currently, 33 states require supermajorities for approving constitutional amendments, with margin requirements ranging from three-fifths to three-fourths of the whole membership in both legislative chambers. This issue was addressed in constitutional convention procedures bills introduced in Congress in the 1980s and 1990s. The bills introduced in Congress in the 1980s and 1990s addressed constitutional convention procedures, with earlier bills dictating state legislature adherence to specific rules while later bills allowed states to determine their own requirements. Establishing clear procedures before applying for an Article V Convention could reduce legal uncertainties and challenges to the validity of an application, as the Constitution offers little guidance on the petition process for such a convention. The permissible scope of state applications for an Article V Convention remains unclear. Questions include whether petitions must address a single issue, if they need to be identical, who they should be addressed to, and how long they remain valid. Most commentators agree that state applications must address the same issue but do not need to be identical. The Constitution does not mandate identical petitions, and the House Judiciary Committee has stated that they do not need to be. The House Judiciary Committee and the American Bar Association's Constitutional Convention Study Committee both agree that state applications for an Article V Convention do not need to be identical but must address the same issue. The consensus is that a general agreement among two-thirds of the States is required to call a Constitutional Convention. Legislative language in proposed constitutional convention procedures bills supported the interpretation that only applications requesting a Convention on the same issue should be counted. The Friends of an Article V Convention argue that the specifics of the applications are immaterial, stating that once Congress receives applications from two-thirds of the states for a convention on any subject, or for a general convention, it should proceed. The Friends of an Article V Convention argue that once Congress receives applications from two-thirds of the states for a convention on any subject, it should proceed. 49 out of 50 states have submitted an Article V petition, and Congress was obligated to call a convention by 1911. Concerns have been raised about state applications with various conditions, such as nullifying if Congress proposes a balanced budget amendment or being valid only if the convention is limited to a specific issue. In the 1980s, problematic state applications for an Article V Convention included a mix of proposals and specific amendment language. Some applications called for a convention only if Congress did not act, while others limited the convention to their own amendments. The House Judiciary Committee in 1993 stated that applications requesting a vote on a specific amendment are not valid as they undermine the deliberative function of the Convention as outlined in Article V. The deliberative function of an Article V Convention is compromised if state legislatures propose exact wording for amendments, as it goes against the founders' intent to allow sub-federal communities to propose amendments without determining the exact text. Former Solicitor General Walter Dellinger argues that this approach bypasses the checks and balances built into Article V. The Madison Amendment, also known as H.J.Res. 57, has been introduced in the 112th Congress. The timeliness of state Article V Convention applications is a debated issue, with FOAVC arguing that there is no set time limit on their validity. They claim that state applications remain valid indefinitely as the Constitution offers no guidance on this matter. State applications for an Article V Convention are a debated issue, with differing opinions on their validity period. The House Judiciary Committee suggested a seven-year time limit, while other commentators proposed a two- or four-year \"shelf life\" for state applications. This debate stems from the lack of specific guidance in the Constitution on this matter. During the 1970s and 1980s, 32 states submitted applications for a convention to consider an amendment to require a balanced federal budget. Support for the convention waned as interest in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act grew. Concerns over a runaway convention led to some states rescinding their applications between 1988 and 2010. Some states rescinded their Article V convention applications, with differing opinions on the validity of these rescissions. Constitutional scholars debate whether states can withdraw applications before the two-thirds threshold is met. Bills in Congress allowed states to rescind applications if the threshold had not been reached. In the past, Congress refused to accept rescissions of state ratifications of the 14th Amendment, upheld by the Supreme Court in Coleman v. Miller. Some Article V Convention applications included self-canceling clauses, associated with \"prodding\" strategy. The final action by a state legislature that has approved an application for an Article V Convention is to transmit news of its action to the appropriate authorities, as stated in the House Judiciary Committee's 1993 report. The report noted that states had sent applications for a balanced budget convention to various congressional officials, including the Clerk of the House, the Secretary of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, and others. The final decisions on Article V Convention applications are made by state legislatures. Congress could establish procedures for transmission and retention of state applications. Potential recipients of applications include the Speaker and Clerk of the House, Vice President, President Pro-Tempore, Secretary of the Senate, and the Archivist of the United States. Notification of a state's Senators and Representatives is also important. The final decisions on Article V Convention applications are made by state legislatures. Notification of a state's Senators and Representatives might be considered a courtesy, as they could advocate for the Convention. State governors are not believed to have responsibilities in the Article V state petition process. The President's approval is not required for a constitutional amendment proposed by Congress, as stated in the Supreme Court's 1798 decision in Hollingsworth v. Virginia. Some scholars argue that State Governors should be excluded from the Article V Convention process, citing historical evidence and the need for a rigorous amendment process. However, there are differing views, with some suggesting that including governors could provide an additional check on the process. The inclusion of State Governors in the Article V Convention process has been a topic of debate. Some argue that governors should be included, as they can better represent the views of citizens within their states. There is variation in state practices regarding governor participation, with some suggesting that their inclusion could provide an additional check on the process. Constitutional Rights in 1993 noted that governors were not completely excluded from the Article V Convention process. A survey of state legislatures' petitions in the balanced budget amendment campaign in the 1970s and 1980s showed that governors were involved in approving some applications. The founders intended the Article V Convention as a balance to Congress's power to propose amendments, giving state legislatures an alternative means to consider amendments. The Article V Convention, never implemented, raises questions for Congress. This report offers historical perspectives to aid Members in considering the issue. Additional resources are available for further study if a convention becomes a serious possibility."
