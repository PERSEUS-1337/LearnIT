    "content": "Legislation and administrative actions since 1996 have aimed to reduce immigration litigation by limiting appeal and review procedures, making certain aliens ineligible for relief, and restricting judicial review. Despite efforts to streamline processes, changes made by the 1996 Acts have actually increased litigation by broadening grounds for inadmissibility and deportation. Increased enforcement efforts and a rise in the number of illegal aliens have led to more litigation and removal proceedings. In 2002, Attorney General Ashcroft implemented reforms in the Board of Immigration Appeals to address backlog and improve efficiency. This resulted in a shift of cases to federal appellate courts, as shown by increased caseloads in U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal and immigration courts. The increase in immigration appeals in federal appellate courts has significantly outpaced the growth in immigration court and BIA caseloads. Factors contributing to increased litigation include rulings by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The REAL ID Act established new statutory evidentiary standards for asylum claims to reduce litigation. Major immigration bills like S. 2454 and S. 2611/S. 2612 contain provisions for immigration litigation reform. H.R. 4437, the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005 passed by the House of Representatives, does not include broad litigation reform provisions. Title V of S. 2454 incorporates some immigration litigation reduction provisions from the initial Chairman's mark text in the Senate Judiciary Committee and similar provisions to those in H.R. 4437. Judicial review of removal orders is available in the federal appellate court for the judicial circuit where the removal proceedings were completed. The U.S. nationality claims process involves transferring cases to federal district courts for new hearings and declaratory judgments. Judicial review of challenges to expedited removal of inadmissible aliens lies in the District Court for the District of Columbia. Proposed changes in S. 2454 would consolidate appeals regarding removal of aliens in the U.S. Court of Appeals. The provision in S. 2454 aims to consolidate appeals on removal of aliens in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. It would increase the number of judges on the Federal Circuit from 12 to 15 and provide necessary funds for the increased caseload. This consolidation would alleviate pressure on other federal appellate circuits, particularly due to a rise in immigration appeals. It would also prevent future inconsistencies in interpretations of immigration law among different circuits. The provision in S. 2454 aims to consolidate appeals on removal of aliens in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which could reduce litigation and inconsistencies in immigration law interpretations among different circuits. Senator Specter excluded the litigation reduction Title VII from the Chairman's mark pending a hearing on judicial review of immigration matters. Senator Specter has decided to drop the consolidation provision and certain judicial review provisions from legislative proposals. S. 2611 focuses on reforming the Board of Immigration Appeals and Immigration Courts. A GAO study on the appellate process for immigration appeals is included in \u00a7 707 of S. 2611/S. 2612, exploring options like consolidating appeals into one U.S. Court of Appeals. The proposed changes in legislation would mandate increases in personnel for immigration-related agencies from 2007 to 2011, impacting each circuit and litigants. There are no specific directives in current authorizations regarding personnel increases for immigration-related agencies. The Chairman's mark mandates personnel increases for immigration-related agencies from 2007 to 2011 to handle the increased caseload efficiently. Appropriations are authorized for the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice, but not for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The legislation aims to increase the number of attorneys in the Federal Defenders Program for criminal immigration defendants in federal courts. The current law defines \"order of deportation\" as the conclusion by an administrative officer that an alien is deportable. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 reformed enforcement procedures, replacing exclusion and deportation with removal proceedings. The absence of a definition for \"order of removal\" seems to be an oversight. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the BIA must remand a case to the immigration judge for entry of an order of removal if the judge's decision is reversed. Proposed changes in S. 2454 and the Chairman's mark would clarify the BIA's authority to directly enter an order of removal upon reversal of the judge's decision. The Secretary of Homeland Security would be added as the delegating authority for removal orders. The BIA's authority to enter an order of removal upon reversal of a judge's decision is clarified in proposed changes in S. 2454 and the Chairman's mark. Section 504 of S. 2454 and \u00a7 704 of the Chairman's mark would amend the current statute concerning visa revocation to provide clarity on the process. The current statute on visa revocation is being clarified to remove judicial review and court jurisdiction for revocation claims, aiding DHS in removing aliens with revoked visas. H.R. 4437 and S.Amdt. 3192/S. 2611 do not include this provision, dropped by Senator Specter for further study. If an alien reenters the U.S. illegally after removal, the original removal order is reinstated. The current statute clarifies that if an alien illegally reenters the U.S. after removal, the original removal order is reinstated without judicial review. Proposed changes aim to amend the statute to require a hearing before an immigration judge in such cases. The current statute allows for reinstatement of a removal order without judicial review if an alien illegally reenters the U.S. Proposed amendments would require a hearing before an immigration judge in such cases. H.R. 4437 includes a provision for limited judicial review of the reinstatement statute. The current law restricts the removal of an alien to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened. Proposed changes would clarify evidentiary standards for asylum and withholding of removal, placing the burden of proof on the alien to establish the threat to their life or freedom. The proposed changes in H.R. 4437 and S. 2454 aim to clarify evidentiary standards for asylum and withholding of removal, requiring aliens to prove a threat to their life or freedom. Senator Specter dropped a provision for pre-screening in judicial review of removal orders, pending further study. The administrative record must be available by a certain date or the appeal will be dismissed. A federal appellate judge or circuit justice must issue a certificate of reviewability for a petition to be granted. H.R. 4437 includes a provision for a substantial showing that a petition is likely to be granted, which was dropped by Senator Specter for further study. Proposed changes in S. 2454 and the Chairman's mark clarify that motions to reopen or reconsider are discretionary decisions of the Attorney General and establish safeguards for motions to reopen in removal proceedings. These amendments apply regardless of the timing of the final administrative order. H.R. 4437 also contains a similar provision. The provision in S.Amdt. 3192 and S. 2611 / S. 2612 regarding fees and expenses for attorneys in civil actions involving the United States is being further studied after being dropped by Senator Specter. Proposed changes in S. 2454 and the Chairman's mark would restrict the awarding of fees and expenses to aliens in removal order proceedings unless approved by the court of appeals. The provision in H.R. 4437 and S.Amdt. 3192/S. 2611 regarding fees and expenses for attorneys in civil actions involving the United States is being further studied after being dropped by Senator Specter. The amendment would apply to proceedings related to a removal order issued on or after the date of enactment, regardless of when fees were incurred. This provision is not found in current law, and visa waiver program admittees only need to waive this as a condition of admission to the United States. Proposed changes in H.R. 4437 would make nonimmigrant visa issuance contingent on waiving the right to review inadmissibility determinations at ports of entry. Current law restricts judicial review for denials of discretionary relief and bars review of removal orders for certain criminal grounds. Section 807 of H.R. 4437 would clarify bars on judicial review. Section 807 of H.R. 4437 proposes clarifications on bars to judicial review for denials of discretionary relief and removal orders for criminal aliens. Current procedural guidelines for EOIR are not explicitly stated in the INA but in regulations. Attorney General Ashcroft implemented BIA procedural reforms in 2002 to address backlog and improve case disposition efficiency. Proposed changes aim to address the existing BIA backlog by reducing its size, expanding single-member review for certain cases, and implementing time limits for actions. The changes would require cases to be heard by a 3-member panel, with exceptions for single-member hearings in specific circumstances. Consideration or reconsideration of cases by the full BIA sitting en banc would be authorized by a majority vote. Regulations must be promulgated by the Attorney General within 180 days of enactment. The Attorney General must promulgate regulations within 180 days of enactment for the establishment and structuring of the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR), including qualifications and appointment procedures for BIA members and immigration judges. No immigration judge or BIA member can be removed without cause. Section 714 of the Chairman's mark outlines the process for removal of BIA members or immigration judges for good cause by the Director of EOIR. Additionally, Section 705 of S. 2611 / S. 2612 and \u00a7 715 of the Chairman's mark focus on the continuation and expansion of a legal orientation program for detainees nationwide. Former Representative Bill McCollum has introduced similar legislation in multiple Congresses, most recently H.R. 185, the United States Immigration Court Act. Various immigration authorities have proposed different restructuring plans for immigration courts since the 97th Congress. H.R. 4437 and S.Amdt. 3192 do not address the statutory establishment of the EOIR. The Fairness in Immigration Litigation Act of 2006 would limit injunctive relief against the Federal Government in immigration law-related civil actions."
