Studies have shown that increased use of body cameras reduces use of force incidents and citizen complaints. The Act aims to promote accountability and transparency in policing through a grant program. \"Grant program authorized for body-worn cameras for law enforcement officers under the Safer Officers and Safer Citizens Act of 2015.\" The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance can grant funds to States, local governments, and Indian tribes for purchasing body-worn cameras for law enforcement officers. Funds must be used for buying cameras and necessary technological infrastructure. Preferential consideration is given to certain grant applications. Preferential consideration is given to grant applications from jurisdictions with comprehensive policies developed in consultation with criminal justice experts and community members, addressing deployment, privacy protections, use, storage, audits, and controls. The policy should also be supported by a communication and education campaign involving various stakeholders. The Department of Justice gives priority to grant applications from jurisdictions with comprehensive policies on body-worn cameras, developed in consultation with experts and community members. The selected jurisdictions must have a high need for body-worn cameras, a violent crime rate at or above the national average, and commit to submitting usage metrics for data collection and analysis. Matching funds are available for program costs. The grant under subsection (a) may cover up to 75 percent of program costs, with the non-Federal share potentially funded by appropriated funds for law enforcement functions on Indian lands. To apply for a grant under this part, the chief executive of a State, local government, or Indian tribe must submit an application to the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance. The Director will establish regulations within 90 days of enactment, outlining the required information and submission criteria for States, local governments, and Indian tribes. Definitions for the grant program are also provided. The term 'Indian tribe' refers to the same meaning as in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. A 'law enforcement officer' includes officers authorized to prevent, detect, or investigate criminal violations. 'State' encompasses all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and other territories. 'Unit of local government' refers to a county. The term 'unit of local government' includes various local government entities below the State level such as counties, municipalities, towns, townships, villages, parishes, and boroughs. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2016 through 2021 totaling $100,000,000 annually, with unobligated funds returned to the Treasury for debt reduction. Congress finds that administrative leave is not an entitlement, agencies are not required to grant it, and it does not include various types of leave such as annual, maternity, sick, or military leave. A Government Accountability Office report showed that from fiscal year 2011 to 2013, about 97 percent of Federal employees used 20 days or less of paid administrative leave. Some Federal employees were charged between 1 and 3 years of paid administrative leave, with the most common reason being personnel matters like misconduct investigations. Administrative leave is defined as leave without loss of pay, entitlements, or service credit. The Office of Personnel Management will limit administrative leave to 20 days per year for employees unless approved by the agency head. The Office of Management and Budget will adjust agency staffing levels to account for increased work hours per employee."
