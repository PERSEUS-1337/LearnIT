Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces Part VIII on Qualified State Tuition Programs, specifically addressing Sec. 529 on these programs. A qualified State tuition program is exempt from taxation but subject to taxes on unrelated business income. It allows the purchase of tuition credits for designated beneficiaries for qualified higher education expenses. A qualified State tuition program must meet specific requirements, including allowing contributions for education expenses of the beneficiary and imposing penalties on non-qualified withdrawals. Contributions must be made in cash, and refunds must incur a penalty if not used for qualified higher education expenses. A qualified State tuition program must provide separate accounting for each designated beneficiary and not allow investment direction by contributors or beneficiaries. A qualified State tuition program prohibits contributors or beneficiaries from directing investments or using program interest as loan security. Distributions and earnings under the program are not taxable for designated beneficiaries or contributors. Any distribution under a qualified State tuition program is taxable to the recipient, similar to section 72 rules. Education provided to a beneficiary is considered a distribution. Changes in beneficiaries can be rolled over within 60 days. Any change in the designated beneficiary of an interest in a qualified State tuition program shall not be treated as a distribution for tax purposes if the new beneficiary is a family member of the old beneficiary. Operating rules apply for tax purposes. Operating rules apply for tax purposes regarding qualified State tuition programs. Contributions to these programs are treated as qualified transfers for gift tax purposes. Reporting requirements are also specified. Reporting requirements for qualified State tuition programs mandate that officers or employees in control of the program must submit reports to the Secretary and beneficiaries or individuals receiving distributions, as required by section 2503(e). The reports must include information specified by the Secretary and must be submitted in a timely manner. The reporting requirements for qualified State tuition programs dictate that reports must be filed to the Secretary and beneficiaries by January 31 of the following year, as per section 2503(e). Designated beneficiary refers to the individual initially named or changed in the program. The term 'member of family' has the same meaning as defined in section 2032A(e)(2). Qualified higher education expenses include tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment necessary for a designated beneficiary's enrollment at an eligible educational institution. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending after the enactment date. A State maintaining a program for education expenses must meet certain requirements. The amendments made by this section apply to contributions made to a qualified State tuition program before specific dates, regardless of meeting new requirements. For the purposes of subparagraph (B)(ii), if a State has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such session is considered a separate regular session of the State legislature."
