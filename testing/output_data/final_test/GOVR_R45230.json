    "content": "Congress passed the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act on February 15, 2019, after multiple continuing resolutions and a government shutdown. Both the House and Senate had previously reported Agriculture appropriations bills in 2018. The Senate passed its version in August 2018, while the House attempted to reopen the government with various bills during the shutdown in January 2019. The Senate did not consider these measures until the Consolidated Appropriations Act moved in February 2019. The FY2019 Agriculture appropriation totaled $152 billion, with $23.03 billion in discretionary funds. This amount was slightly higher than FY2018, excluding the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The bill funded USDA, excluding the U.S. Forest Service, and included mandatory spending of nearly $129 billion. The Related Agencies Appropriations Act funds USDA, FDA, and CFTC in even-numbered fiscal years. It is under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The bill includes mandatory and discretionary spending, with discretionary amounts being the primary focus. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts and receives most attention during the appropriations process. In the FY2019 Agriculture appropriations act, discretionary appropriations are 15% ($23 billion) of the $152 billion total, with mandatory spending comprising $129 billion. The largest discretionary spending items include the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women. Some programs like FDA, WIC, and child nutrition are not under the authorizing jurisdiction of the House or Senate Agriculture Committees. The largest discretionary spending items in the FY2019 Agriculture appropriations act are WIC, agricultural research, rural development, FDA, foreign food aid, farm assistance program salaries, food safety inspection, and conservation programs. Mandatory spending includes SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity programs funded through the USDA's CCC. SNAP requires an annual appropriation, while the CCC operates on a line of credit. The annual appropriation for Agriculture funding reimburses the Treasury for the line of credit used. Changes in the Agriculture appropriations bill have generally mirrored changes in the total discretionary limit. Agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010, declined through FY2013, and have been higher since then. In FY2018, USDA reorganization affected program placement in the bill. The stacked bars in Figure 3 show discretionary authorization for each appropriations title. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request proposed a 25% reduction in Agriculture appropriations, totaling $17 billion. Congressional committees evaluated the request and began considering their own bills in spring 2018. The budget request preceded Congress, with detailed summaries released by USDA, FDA, CFTC, and FCA. Scorekeeping adjustments and limits on mandatory programs contributed to negative amounts in Title VII. The Administration's budget request for FY2019 preceded Congress enacting the final FY2018 appropriation. Budget enforcement for appropriations has procedural and statutory elements, with procedural limits on discretionary budget authority and statutory limits on discretionary spending from FY2012-FY2021. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed discretionary budget caps through FY2021 to reduce federal spending. Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 raised the caps to avoid sequestration, with the latest in 2018 increasing nondefense and defense spending for FY2019. This allowed appropriations committees to proceed with marking up the FY2019 budget without following the usual procedures. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees marked up the FY2019 appropriations bills for Agriculture. The subcommittee allocations for agriculture appropriations are House: $23.273 billion and Senate: $23.235 billion. Sequestration effects on agriculture accounts are discussed, with discretionary and mandatory accounts impacted since FY2013. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee passed its FY2019 bill on May 9, 2018, and the full Appropriations Committee reported an amended bill on May 16, 2018. The full Appropriations Committee passed an amended bill (H.R. 5961, H.Rept. 115-706) with a $23.23 billion discretionary total for the FY2019 Agriculture appropriation, which was $14 million less than FY2018. The bill did not include most of the proposed reductions by the Administration and continued appropriations from prior years. The primary changes included increasing base FDA appropriations by $308 million. The FY2019 Agriculture appropriation bill included increased funding for agricultural research, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and Rural Utility Service. However, it did not continue separate funding for rural water and telemedicine for the opioid crisis. Discretionary appropriations for domestic nutrition assistance programs were decreased. The FY2019 Agriculture appropriation bill reduced funding for domestic nutrition assistance programs, including WIC and commodity assistance programs. It also decreased base funding for international food assistance programs. Additionally, the bill included funding for mandatory spending, which was lower than in FY2018 due to automatic changes in economic conditions and entitlement enrollment. The House passed various appropriations bills in an attempt to reopen the government during the funding gap in 2019. The Agriculture appropriations bill was essentially identical to the Senate-passed bill from the previous Congress. On January 10, 2019, the House passed a stand-alone Agriculture appropriations bill. The House passed H.R. 648, a six-bill omnibus appropriation with Agriculture appropriations in Division A, on January 23. The Senate also passed a four-bill minibus with agriculture as Division C on August 1, 2018. The Senate bill would have provided about $250 million more than the House-reported bill. The Senate bill proposed a $228 million increase in funding compared to the House-reported bill. Key changes included a $159 million increase for FDA, a $19 million increase for APHIS, and a $25 million reduction for WIC. The Senate bill also had larger rescissions compared to the House bill. The Senate bill proposed a $228 million increase in funding compared to the House-reported bill, with key changes including increased funding for FDA and APHIS, and a reduction for WIC. The Senate bill had larger rescissions than the House bill, including decreased funding for agricultural research agencies and rural development. The total discretionary and mandatory appropriations in the Senate bill amounted to $145 billion. In FY2019, Congress enacted multiple CRs to continue government operations due to the absence of a final agriculture appropriation. A 34-day funding gap occurred between the second and third CRs, leading to a partial government shutdown. To end the shutdown, a third CR was passed, followed by an omnibus appropriation to cover the rest of the fiscal year. Total discretionary and mandatory appropriations amounted to $145 billion. The CRs in FY2019 continued funding rates and conditions from the previous year's appropriation, prorating funding through apportionment. They maintained terms of the FY2018 Agriculture appropriations act and excluded CHIMP on the Biomass Crop Assistance Program not authorized for FY2019. Funding was provided to maintain mandatory program levels, including for nutrition programs. Some authorizations in the 2014 farm bill began expiring after FY2018. CRs may adjust prior-year amounts through anomalies or make specific administrative changes. Five anomalies specifically applied to the agriculture appropriation during the CRs: Child Nutrition Programs, Rural Utilities Service, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Without the anomaly, CCC might have exhausted its $30 billion line of credit. The anomaly in the agriculture appropriation during the CRs prevented the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) from exhausting its $30 billion line of credit. Additionally, funding gaps may cause operations to cease at affected agencies when appropriations expire without further budget authority. Exceptions under the Antideficiency Act allow certain activities to continue, such as law enforcement and protection of human life or property. During the FY2019 funding gap from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, agencies funded by discretionary appropriations were affected, including those under Agriculture appropriations. The Senate passed a CR to extend funding to February 8, 2019, but the House added provisions for homeland security and natural disaster funding that were not accepted. This was the first shutdown since a two-day shutdown prior to FY2019. During a government shutdown, agencies furlough personnel and reduce services. Shutdowns have occurred in FY2019, January 2018, and October 2013. Agencies determine which activities are exempt from furlough and publish contingency plans. Employees do not receive pay during a shutdown. During a government shutdown, agencies furlough personnel and reduce services. Employees may not receive pay during this time. However, exempted employees could receive pay from a separate funding source. Back pay was guaranteed to furloughed and excepted employees after the shutdown ended. The number of excepted and furloughed personnel varied by agency. During the government shutdown, various agencies retained staff for essential services. This included food safety inspections, commodity grading, transportation preclearance, quarantine certification, and protection of research facilities. The Farm Service Agency initially retained 72% of staff but later reduced to only 0.3%. During the government shutdown, the Farm Service Agency (FSA) initially retained 72% of staff but later reduced to only 0.3%. FSA announced the recall of 2,500 employees to reopen county offices for a limited time, providing administrative services to farmers. The shutdown ended before a plan to keep FSA offices open full-time could be implemented. All 9,342 staff of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) were exempted from furlough using carryover and mandatory funding. During the government shutdown, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) planned to furlough some employees to conserve funds and focus on mandatory farm bill programs, but the shutdown ended before this could be implemented. The USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) programs rely on funding from appropriations acts, with operations varying based on available resources and USDA decision-making. FNS released program-specific memoranda to states and program operators during the shutdown. During the government shutdown, FNS released program-specific memoranda to states and program operators regarding nutrition assistance programs. SNAP benefits for January were issued as scheduled, and an early distribution of February benefits was allowed. FDA retained 59% of its employees for food safety inspection, while CFTC excepted 9% of its employees to address risks. During the government shutdown, USDA furloughed 61 staff out of 673, affecting various functions such as data collection, regulation development, trade aid payments, loan approvals, and international assistance programs. The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $23.03 billion for agriculture, with an additional $129 billion in mandatory spending. The total appropriation for agriculture is approximately $152 billion. Table 3 summarizes agency-level appropriations in the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act, showing a $35 million discretionary increase. Key changes include a $387 million increase for agricultural research agencies, a $269 million increase for FDA, and a $200 million net increase for WIC funding. Carryover balances were rescinded by $500 million in FY2019. In FY2019, $500 million is rescinded from carryover balances, with a smaller rescission compared to FY2018. The base WIC appropriation is reduced by $100 million to $6.075 billion. APHIS sees an increase of $29 million (+3%) to $1.014 billion. Food for Peace appropriations are maintained at $1.716 billion by adjusting funding between Title V and Title VII. Salaries and expenses for the Foreign Agricultural Service increase by $14 million. Overall discretionary farm production and conservation funding remains stable, with a shift in administrative funding. Rural development funding remains essentially the same. In FY2019, the budget for rural development remains stable with a slight increase in mandatory spending and a decrease in extra appropriations for water, wastewater, and rural broadband programs. The budgetary offset from other scorekeeping adjustments also increases. The Agriculture appropriations bill for FY2019 saw changes in costs for crop insurance, CCC reimbursement, child nutrition, and SNAP. It also includes policy provisions that guide how the executive branch implements the appropriation, with potential long-term effects if included in the U.S. Code. The explanatory statement in the conference report and report language provide additional policy instructions. The explanatory statement in the conference report and report language provide additional policy instructions for the Agriculture appropriations bill for FY2019. Congressional directives in committee and conference reports are crucial for understanding congressional intent, and executive branch wishes cannot replace them as the best evidence of congressional intentions. Table 4 compares major policy provisions in the FY2019 Agriculture appropriations bills and act, excluding those addressed in report language or explanatory statement. Sequestration is a process to reduce federal spending triggered when spending exceeds budget goals, authorized by the Budget Control Act of 2011. Sequestration is authorized by the Budget Control Act of 2011 to reduce federal spending when it exceeds budget goals. Discretionary spending is subject to sequestration through FY2021 if defense and nondefense spending exceed specified caps. Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 have raised discretionary budget caps to avoid sequestration. The Bipartisan Budget Acts (BBAs) raised discretionary budget caps to allow for larger appropriations. Sequestration for mandatory spending is authorized through FY2027 and continues annually, unaffected by the BBAs. The original FY2021 sunset on sequestration for mandatory accounts has been extended multiple times. Congress extended the duration of mandatory sequestration multiple times as budgetary offsets in various authorization acts, extending it until FY2027. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration, including nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and farm commodity programs may be exempt from sequestration as determined by OMB. OMB has ruled that most crop insurance is exempt, while farm commodity programs, disaster assistance, and conservation programs have been subject to sequestration. Nonexempt mandatory spending is reduced by a 6.2% sequestration rate in FY2019, resulting in a $1.5 billion reduction from mandatory agriculture accounts."
