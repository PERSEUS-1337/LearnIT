    "content": "The Act titled \"Hazardous Materials Cooperative Research Act of 2009\" is established for the purpose of conducting research on hazardous materials. Congress acknowledges the significant volume of hazardous materials shipments in the United States, totaling 2.1 billion tons annually. Various transportation modes are used, with a large number of trucks, railroad tank cars, and tank barges dedicated to this purpose. Multiple federal agencies, along with state and local entities, are responsible for ensuring the safety and security of these shipments. Federal agencies, state, and local governments, along with industry groups, are responsible for regulating and overseeing hazardous materials shipments. Research on transportation of hazardous materials is continuously conducted by these entities. There is a need for a cooperative research program involving all modes and actors in the transportation of hazardous materials to conduct national and multi-modal assessments. SEC. 3. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a hazardous materials cooperative research program with an independent governing board comprised of representatives from various federal agencies and departments. The hazardous materials cooperative research program will include representatives from federal agencies, state departments, emergency management agencies, nonprofit organizations, hazmat employers, labor unions, manufacturers, research institutions, and additional representatives as deemed appropriate by the Secretary of Transportation. The hazardous materials cooperative research program prioritizes cross-cutting research studies that address issues not covered by existing programs. The Secretary will provide grants to the National Academy of Sciences for project implementation. Definitions for \"hazmat employer\" and \"hazmat employee\" are based on section 5102 of title 49, United States Code. Authorization of Appropriations: $5,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 2010 through 2013 to carry out section 5102 of title 49, United States Code."
