General Provisions set limitations on assistance, administrative requirements, and funding for specific accounts. Title VII of the legislation outlines detailed funding requirements for various aid sectors, including education, democracy promotion, water and sanitation, and food security. It also specifies aid allocations for certain countries and regions. Since FY2012, there has been a distinction between \"core\" international affairs funding and funding for \"overseas contingency operations\" (OCO), which initially focused on Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan but later expanded to include other activities and countries. OCO funds do not count towards spending caps. OCO funds are used to maintain international affairs funding levels without exceeding budget restraints. The Trump Administration proposed eliminating OCO funding for FY2019 and FY2020, but Congress continues to designate it in legislation. OCO funding supports accounts in Titles I-V separately identified in Title VIII."
