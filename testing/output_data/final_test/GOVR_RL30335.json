    "content": "Congress is responsible for enacting all appropriations for agency programs, including mandatory spending for trust funds and special funds. Issues arise for Congress in providing mandatory spending, with advocates seeking greater fiscal security for their preferred programs. Mandatory spending offers stability compared to the annual budget and appropriations processes. Opponents of mandatory spending argue against providing sustained authority due to concerns about funding sources, impacts on federal spending levels, and lack of congressional oversight compared to annually debated programs. The restrictions on the use of mandatory spending for administrative and overhead costs have raised concerns about oversight. Congress limited the use of funds for indirect obligations to 20% in certain programs, leading to ceilings on administrative costs for other accounts. Competitive and formulaic grant programs have generally faced little controversy. The Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson/Wallop-Breaux Funds are among the largest mandatory spending programs in federal land management agencies. Controversies are avoided as the programs benefit those who fund them through excise taxes on hunting equipment. This direct linkage between funders and beneficiaries reduces controversy and increases accountability for mandatory spending on federal lands. Before 1990, FS mandatory spending was a major focus of congressional attention due to its significant share of agency funding for land management activities. Six of the seven largest accounts were mainly funded by timber sale receipts, which can be controversial for their environmental impact. The Knutson-Vandenberg (K-V) Fund allows agency managers broad discretion over funded activities and locations, leading to concerns about creating perverse incentives for environmentally damaging actions. The K-V Fund creates \"perverse incentives\" for FS wildlife managers by funding projects with timber receipts to mitigate environmental damages. Controversies over mandatory spending have decreased due to the decline in FS timber sales since 1990. Mandatory spending is now more significant for the BLM, with funding sources like selling helium and developable land in Las Vegas being less controversial. The southern Nevada land sales and NPS mandatory spending programs have been less controversial compared to timber sales. The funds from these sales are more narrowly prescribed, with less agency discretion. The FWS accounts have faced relatively little concern as their largest accounts are grant programs, not discretionary land management activities. Compensation for state and local governments for the tax-exempt status of federal lands has generally not been a major issue. The compensation for state and local governments for the tax-exempt status of federal lands has been a topic of debate. The level and basis of compensation vary widely, with some lands receiving no compensation at all. Payments to state and local governments can range from 4% to 90% of receipts for mineral leasing in Alaska. Some compensation programs reduce payments under the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) Program, raising questions about consistent and comprehensive compensation for all federal lands. One controversial arrangement is the decline in FS 25% Payments and BLM Oregon and California (O&C) grant land payments in the 1990s due to falling timber harvests. In the 1990s, California (O&C) grant land payments decreased significantly due to a decline in timber harvests, leading to major cuts in local programs, particularly school funding. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (SRS) was enacted to provide counties with payments based on historic compensation rather than current receipts. Reauthorization efforts in 2006 and 2007 faced controversy over funding sources and allocation favoring areas with high timber sales. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (SRS) provides counties with payments based on historic compensation rather than current receipts. When the current authorization for SRS expires, debates are likely to arise. The Constitution prohibits withdrawing funds from the Treasury unless appropriated by law, with no limit on the duration of an appropriation. Trust funds and special funds in federal budget documents are often misunderstood, with trust funds designated as such in their authorizing legislation. Trust funds and special funds in federal budget documents are often misunderstood. The authorizing legislation for these funds may include mandatory spending authority, allowing funds to be spent without further appropriation. Funds without this language require Congress to enact an appropriation for spending. The federal land management agencies receive funding from various sources such as excise taxes, license fees, and donations. These funds are used for specific purposes like site rehabilitation and federal land management. The federal land management agencies receive funding from various sources for specific purposes, with discretion over the disposition of receipts varying among agencies and programs. Critics have expressed concerns about the use of receipts, with different agencies directing varying portions of receipts to specific purposes. This discretion over receipt disposal is a key factor in controversies surrounding the accounts. The National Park Service (NPS) and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) receive receipts from recreation and various activities, with NPS receipts totaling $352 million in FY2009. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service (FS) focus on sustained yields of goods and services, with timber sales historically generating the majority of receipts for both agencies. In FY2009, Forest Service (FS) receipts were $581 million, mainly from timber sales, a significant decrease from their peak in FY1989. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) receipts were $564 million, with timber contributing only 5% of the total, as helium and land sales in Nevada have increased. Mineral leasing on federal lands also generates revenue, managed by DOI Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement. In FY2009, the MMS reported $3.7 billion in collections from onshore leases. Federal excise taxes fund major FWS programs like the Dingell-Johnson/Wallop-Breaux and Pittman-Robertson Acts. Licensing fees support the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund and minor programs like Woodsy Owl and Smokey the Bear. Programs funded by excise taxes or license fees may not be mandatory spending, but federal land management agencies have mandatory spending authority for these receipts. Excise taxes are charged on specific items and can be deposited in special funds for various purposes. In the FWS Federal Aid programs, taxes from sales of guns, ammunition, and fishing equipment are used for wildlife and sport fishing programs. Gasoline taxes on motorboats also contribute to the Sport Fish Restoration account. Licensing fees provide funds for specific privileges or rights. Licensing fees provide funds for specific privileges or rights, such as duck stamps for waterfowl hunters and refuge visitors. The funds may benefit outside user groups or support agency programs. Import duties and tariffs contribute to funding accounts, like the FS's Reforestation Trust Fund receiving up to $30 million annually from wood product tariffs. The authorizing legislation does not specify why wood import tariffs were chosen to fund this account. Tariffs on fishing equipment go to the FWS's Sport Fish Restoration, while hunting product tariffs fund the FWS's Bird Conservation Fund. Federal land agencies can accept donations for specific projects. NPS and FWS have mandatory spending authority for donations, BLM has two programs, and FS has a small fund requiring annual appropriations for research donations. Contributions for specific projects can be made through private organizations. Contributions for specific sites or projects can be made through private foundations that support the NPS, FWS, and FS. The National Park Foundation, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and National Forest Foundation match federal appropriations with nonfederal contributions to expand agency activities. These foundations were created by acts of Congress and provide an alternative means for donors to support agency activities directly. Mandatory spending accounts are funded partly from the General Treasury, while certain FS and BLM receipt-sharing accounts are funded from payments. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 temporarily replaced certain FS and BLM receipt-sharing accounts with payments funded from the General Treasury. Payments are directed from annual appropriations, revenues, fees, penalties, and miscellaneous receipts. Several mandatory spending authorities for natural resource trust funds and special funds are funded largely from the General Treasury. These funds support agency activities, compensate state or local governments for tax-exempt federal lands, and fund specific state or local agency programs. Competitive grants are becoming more common, and the funds are used for activities like reforestation, land restoration, and investing in federal lands and resources. Some mandatory spending authorities for natural resource trust funds and special funds are funded from the General Treasury. These funds support agency activities, compensate state or local governments for tax-exempt federal lands, and fund specific state or local agency programs. Funding allocation among multiple purposes can be specified, with agencies having discretion to allocate funds among various purposes. Some federal programs allocate funds to state and local governments for tax-exempt federal lands. The funds are often based on agency receipts and can have specific or unrestricted uses. Payments to states are limited to roads and schools, while others, like BLM grazing receipts, can be used for any local governmental purpose. States, territories, and tribal governments receive payments based on formulas from federal agencies. Certain federal programs allocate funds to state, territorial, and tribal governments based on formulas, with parameters such as the area of the state and population size taken into account. These programs provide predictability of federal funding through a fixed formula and mandatory spending, with some programs requiring matching funds. Additionally, there are natural resource special funds with maximum and minimum allocations. Some mandatory spending is not formula-based, and funds are allocated through competitive projects. The funds allocated through federal programs are not formula-based but are distributed through competitive projects. For example, the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund is used for acquiring migratory bird habitat, with specific purchases determined by a federally appointed panel. The Recreation Fee program allows 80% of collected funds to remain at the collecting unit, while the remaining 20% can be used for other locations or purposes. This creates competition for funds among habitat acquisitions, recreation projects, and other activities. The curr_chunk provides detailed information on the mandatory spending authority of federal land management agencies, listing funds with at least $25 million in budget authority from FY2005-FY2009. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has 31 trust funds and special funds with mandatory spending authority, mostly funded from agency receipts. Some accounts had $0 budget authority due to being relatively new. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has 31 trust funds and special funds with a total average annual budget authority of $824 million from FY2005-FY2009. Nine accounts are compensation programs, while 22 accounts fund BLM activities. Laws authorize the sale of public lands in Nevada, with the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act allowing the BLM to sell land in the Las Vegas Valley. 85% of receipts are used for acquiring environmentally sensitive lands in Nevada, while the remaining 15% go to state and county governments. The Helium Privatization Act of 1996 discontinued federal helium refining and provided for the sale of crude helium. Receipts are deposited in the Helium Fund for helium leasing and extraction from federal lands, crude helium sales, storage, and transmission, as well as cleanup of unneeded facilities. Excess funds are returned to the General Treasury after cleanup. The FY2005-FY2009 budget authority for the Helium Fund is detailed in Table 2. The O&C and CBWR grant lands were returned to federal ownership for not meeting grant terms. The government compensates western Oregon counties for tax-exempt federal lands. Payments for O&C lands are 50% of receipts, while CBWR payments can be up to 75% but not exceed private landowner taxes. Due to declining timber sales, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 was enacted to provide payments based on historic receipts. Payments decreased after FY2008. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 provides payments to western Oregon counties based on historic receipts. Payments declined after FY2008 and will return to original payment programs in FY2012 if not reauthorized. The act allocates funds for county compensation (Title I and Title III) and agency activities (Title II). Additionally, SNPLMA and related acts allocate 15% of land sales receipts to Nevada state and county governments. 15% of receipts from land sales in Nevada are allocated to the state and county governments. Specifically, 5% goes to the general education program of the State of Nevada, and 10% is allocated to the Southern Nevada Water Authority for water treatment and transmission facilities in Clark County. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes 50% of rents from onshore mineral leases on federal land to be deposited in a fund for improvements in processing applications for permits to drill. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act allows the BLM to sell or exchange lands identified for disposal. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA) allows the BLM to sell or exchange lands identified for disposal in land and resource management plans. Up to 96% of receipts from sales can be used to acquire nonfederal lands, with at least 80% to be used in the state where the receipts were generated. Additionally, at least 80% of the receipts are to be used to acquire \"inholdings\" within federally designated areas. Administrative costs can be covered using up to 20% of the retained receipts. This authority has been extended until July 24, 2011. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act (FLTFA) allows the BLM to sell or exchange lands for disposal. Up to 96% of sales receipts can be used to acquire nonfederal lands, with at least 80% in the state of origin. Administrative costs can be covered using up to 20% of retained receipts. Budget authority for FY2005-FY2009 under FLTFA is shown in Table 6. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) authorizes recreation fees for certain federal lands areas through December 8, 2014. At least 80% of receipts are used at the collection sites. BLM budget authority from recreation fees under FLREA for FY2005-FY2009 is shown in Table 7. The Lincoln County Land Act and the Lincoln County Conservation, Recreation, and Development Act authorize the BLM to sell public lands, retaining 85% of receipts for BLM activities in the state. The SNLPMA funds are available for acquiring environmentally sensitive lands in Nevada and for managing archaeological resources. Mineral leasing in Alaska generates receipts, with 50% given to the State of Alaska. Since FY2007, receipts are collected by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The Timber Sales Pipeline Restoration Fund was authorized by the Omnibus Consolidated Act. The Timber Sales Pipeline Restoration Fund (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1611 note) was established to fund additional timber sale preparation from federal receipts of certain O&C timber sales. Three quarters of the funds are for timber sales preparation, and a quarter is for recreation projects. The fund operates as a revolving fund, with remaining money transferred to the General Treasury when the allowable sales level is reached. The Timber Sales Pipeline Restoration Fund was created to finance timber sale preparation and recreation projects from federal receipts of certain O&C timber sales. The fund operates as a revolving fund, with excess money transferred to the General Treasury. Additionally, a separate fund was established from the sale of salvage timber from BLM lands, which can also be used to reduce the risk of catastrophic events and respond to damage events. Budget authority for the fund for FY2005-FY2009 is shown in Table 11. Section 234 of EPACT05 authorizes the BLM to retain 25% of geothermal bonuses, rents, and royalties from FY2006-FY2010 for expedited development of geothermal steam. The BLM has 19 other accounts with mandatory spending authority, including 12 for agency operations and 7 for local compensation. Payments for local compensation are made annually. Table 13 shows the budget authority for these accounts. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 transferred administration of Naval Oil Shale Reserve Numbers 1 and 3 to the BLM, with subsequent amendments authorizing retention of mineral leasing funds for site remediation. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 authorized Alaska Native Corporations to choose cash valuations for their lands, with various laws authorizing Treasury appropriations for Native Corporations. The BLM can collect money for road maintenance and reconstruction under Section 502(c) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. BLM collects funds for road maintenance and reconstruction from O&C lands. Excess collections are refunded or transferred. States receive payments from selling public land and products, with 5% of net receipts (4% of gross) allocated for education and public roads. Grazing fees from public lands inside grazing districts are also paid to states. The Taylor Grazing Act allows for payments to states from grazing fee receipts within grazing districts for the benefit of counties containing the grazing lands. It also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to accept contributions for administering, protecting, and improving grazing lands, with receipts used for specified rangeland activities. Refunds of deposits in excess of cooperative efforts' costs are also allowed. The Taylor Grazing Act allows for payments to states from grazing fee receipts outside grazing districts, benefiting counties with grazing lands. The BLM pays 25% of net receipts from national grasslands to counties for schools and roads. Land survey laws authorize payments for public surveys, with excess money refunded. The BLM collects rents and charges from employees in agency housing for maintenance. Stewardship contracts allow for timber removal with excess receipts retained by the BLM. The BLM retains excess funds from land management services for restoration work. Payments to Oklahoma are made from oil and gas royalties. Non-Native Alaskans can acquire town lots by depositing funds. White Pine County has a land-sale authority, but no sales have occurred yet. Section 2601 of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 authorizes the sale of federal land for various purposes, including acquiring environmentally sensitive land in Carson City. Additionally, Section 1505 of the same act allows for the sale of public lands in Boise County, ID, with proceeds to be used for acquiring lands near designated wilderness areas. Another provision in the act, Section 2601, permits the sale of 62 acres to Carson City, NV, with proceeds allocated for BLM oversight and enforcement. Section 1978 of P.L. 111-11 authorizes the sale of public lands in Washington County, UT, for conservation purposes. The NPS has 17 accounts with varying budget authority, totaling $335 million annually. FLREA supports agency activities and compensation programs. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) authorizes federal land management agencies to charge fees at recreation sites for 10 years. It provides criteria for charging fees, public participation, and the establishment of a national recreation pass. At least 80% of the fees are to be used at the sites where they were collected, with the Secretary able to reduce that to not less than 60% if collections exceed reasonable needs. Up to 15% can be used for administering. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) authorizes federal land management agencies to charge fees at recreation sites for 10 years. At least 80% of the fees are to be used at the sites where they were collected, with the Secretary able to reduce that to not less than 60% if collections exceed reasonable needs. Up to 15% can be used for administering the recreation fee program. The agencies have discretion in using the retained fees for maintaining and improving recreation facilities, providing visitor services, and restoring wildlife habitats. NPS has a larger budget authority under FLREA compared to other agencies. The National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998 directs franchise fees and other monetary considerations from concessions contracts to be deposited into a special account for supporting contract development, concession activities, and high-priority resource management programs and operations. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act allows federal land management agencies to charge fees at recreation sites for 10 years, with a percentage used for site maintenance and improvement. The National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act directs franchise fees from concessions contracts to support contract development and resource management programs. Budget authority for annuity benefits for U.S. Park Police retirees is mandatory since FY2002, funded by donations received by the Secretary of the Interior. The program for collecting rent from employees using government-owned housing was authorized in 1964 but became mandatory spending in 1984. The funds collected are used by the National Park Service to operate and maintain housing throughout the National Park System. Additionally, the account created in 1965 requires concessioners to contribute a portion of their gross receipts for maintenance and improvement activities within the parks. The National Park Service collects fees for public transportation services within the Park System, with funds used for transportation costs in the park unit where fees were collected. Concessioners contribute a portion of their gross receipts for maintenance and improvement activities within the parks. The National Park Service collects fees for transportation services and concessioners contribute to maintenance and improvement activities within the parks. Funds from Spectrum Relocation and Park Buildings Lease and Maintenance are used for infrastructure projects and facility maintenance in the National Park System. The National Park Service received $14.7 million from the Spectrum Relocation fund to upgrade communication systems at Blue Ridge and Natchez Trace Parkways. Additionally, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) receives 12.5% of oil and gas leasing revenues from the Outer Continental Shelf for state assistance programs. LWCF is used for federal land acquisition and state recreation assistance, with funds allocated based on a statutory formula. In 1998, the LWCF Act was amended to establish an account for recreation fees collected from parks with deed restrictions. An account was established in 1998 for recreation fees collected from parks with deed restrictions, including Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Lincoln Home National Historic Site, and Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site. Another account, established by the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996, consists of 60% of fees paid by boat operators and permit holders entering Glacier Bay National Park for resource protection. Additionally, fees for commercial filming and photography on park lands were authorized by P.L. 106-206. Fees collected from park lands for commercial filming and photography are retained at the sites where collected. Special accounts are created for specific purposes, such as educating dependents of park employees at Yellowstone National Park and restricting commercial traffic at Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. The Water Gap National Recreation Area has a special account for fees from commercial vehicles, authorized by the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996. Funds can be used for managing Route 209. Tax losses on land acquired for Grand Teton National Park are compensated using fees collected from visitors. The Preservation Fund for the Birthplace of Abraham Lincoln consists of an endowment used for preservation purposes. The Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950 established trust funds for the preservation of the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site. The funds, totaling $798 million annually, are mainly derived from fuel and excise taxes and provide grants to states. Additionally, the funds support land acquisition and agency activities. The Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Fund, established in 2005, receives deposits from various sources including taxes on motorboat fuel and small engine fuel. The fund supports grants for projects benefiting sport fish habitat, research, education, and stocking of sport fish into suitable habitat. Allocation is based on the number of licensed anglers and the land and water area of the state. The Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Fund, established in 2005, receives deposits from various sources including taxes on motorboat fuel and small engine fuel. The fund supports grants for projects benefiting sport fish habitat, research, education, and stocking of sport fish into suitable habitat. States and territories can receive up to 75% of the cost of restoration projects, with funds allocated to various programs including boating safety and the Coastal Wetlands Program. The Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act created the Pittman-Robertson Fund, which receives excise taxes on guns, ammunition, and bows. The fund supports wildlife restoration projects, hunter education programs, and multi-state conservation grants. States and territories can receive up to 75% of project costs, with funding also allocated for FWS administration and interest to the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund. The Wetlands Conservation Fund was established in 1989 under the Act (P.L. 101-233; 16 U.S.C. \u00a74401-4414) to conserve wetland ecosystems through voluntary partnerships with cost-sharing. Funding comes from annual appropriations, interest on hunting equipment excise taxes, transfers from Dingell-Johnson/Wallop-Breaux, and fines for violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The fund is mandatory spending for acquiring habitat for migratory birds, with deposits from duck stamp sales and import duties on arms and ammunition. The Refuge Revenue Sharing Act (P.L. 95-469; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 715s) compensates counties for revenue loss from tax-exempt NWRS lands. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund accumulates receipts from product sales and pays counties based on a complex formula. The Refuge Revenue Sharing Act compensates counties for revenue loss from tax-exempt NWRS lands through a complex formula that includes payments of 1% of fair market value of the land or 25% of net receipts. Congress authorizes annual appropriations to cover any shortfalls in receipts, with 38% to 51% of authorized payments and 53% to 68% of actual payments covered over the past five years. FLREA allows refuge managers to retain 80% of entrance and user fees to improve visitor experiences and protect resources, with the authority to use up to 20% of receipts at other refuges delegated to regional offices. The FWS is authorized to accept donations of property or services to further its purposes. The Lahontan Valley and Pyramid Lake Fish and Wildlife Fund was established in a water rights settlement act. The Operation and Maintenance of Quarters Fund collects rents from employees occupying FWS quarters for maintenance. The Truckee-Carson Pyramid Lake Water Rights Settlement Act established a fund to support wetlands and fisheries restoration in Nevada. The Sales Fund uses receipts from sales of resources on Corps of Engineers land to cover expenses for managing sales and land development. The FS has 23 trust funds and special funds with mandatory spending authority, totaling $764 million in average annual budget authority from FY2005-FY2009. The FS has 23 accounts with an average annual budget authority of $764 million from FY2005-FY2009. Three accounts are compensation funds totaling $375 million, while the other 20 accounts fund agency activities. The FS grants 25% of its receipts to states for roads and schools in counties with national forests based on forest land area. The program was established in 1908 and amended in 1976 to include deposits to the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund and road construction. The Knutson-Vandenberg Fund (K-V Fund) and Salvage Sale Fund deposits were initially excluded from receipt-sharing but were included as receipts subject to 25% payments starting in FY1988. This allocation can exceed 100% of timber sale receipts due to non-cash \"receipts\" like road values. Declining timber sales led to changes in legislation to address habitat protection and other values. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (SRS) was enacted by Congress to provide counties with payments based on historic receipts instead of current receipts, with declining payments after FY2008. The act also amended the 25% payments to be based on a seven-year rolling average of receipts to reduce annual fluctuations. 80%-85% of the funds are Title I funds for roads and schools in counties with national forests, while 15%-20% must be spent on Title II or Title III programs in counties receiving over $100,000 in payments. Title III allows up to 7% of the total funds to be spent on other programs. Title II and Title III programs allocate funds for county compensation and agency activities. Title III allows up to 7% of funds for local governmental activities like search-and-rescue. The K-V Fund, established in 1930, collects money from timber purchasers to reforest timber sale sites and enhance non-timber resource values. The K-V Fund, established in 1930, collects money from timber purchasers to reforest timber sale sites and enhance non-timber resource values. The FS determines funding for authorized activities, including watershed restoration, wildlife habitat improvement, and maintenance of forest roads. The fund also allows the agency to retain recreation fees at selected sites for maintenance and repair of recreation facilities. The Salvage Sale Fund, established in 1976, receives timber sale receipts designated as salvage to recover costs for preparing and administering salvage timber sales. It was funded with appropriations in FY1977, FY1979, and FY1988, and allows national forests to retain 50% more than estimated costs for each salvage sale. The Salvage Sale Fund, established in 1976, allows national forests to retain 50% more than estimated costs for each salvage sale. This fund collects deposits from cooperators, mainly commercial users like timber purchasers, to fund road maintenance costs and other services. The amount of deposits is specified in cooperator agreements, and the fund was created to collect recoveries from permittees or timber purchasers. The Salvage Sale Fund, established in 1976, allows national forests to retain 50% more than estimated costs for each salvage sale. This fund collects deposits from cooperators, mainly commercial users like timber purchasers, to fund road maintenance costs and other services. The money is used to complete required work, with deposits coming from tariffs on imported solid wood products. The account was created to eliminate the backlog of reforestation and stand improvement work. The program was established as a pilot program in the FY2002 Interior appropriations act. The Salvage Sale Fund, established in 1976, allows national forests to retain 50% more than estimated costs for each salvage sale. This fund collects deposits from cooperators, mainly commercial users like timber purchasers, to fund road maintenance costs and other services. The money is used to complete required work, with deposits coming from tariffs on imported solid wood products. The program was established as a pilot program in \u00a7 329 of the FY2002 Interior appropriations act ( P.L. 107-63 ), extended in subsequent Interior appropriations acts, and then established as a three-year mandatory spending program in Title V of the FY2006 Interior appropriations act ( P.L. 109-54 ), and extended again. The agency is authorized to sell unneeded facilities and administrative sites, and use the funds to assess, restore, and/or replace facilities (buildings and other structures), as appropriate. This fund was created in 1937 by the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012). The act authorized the acquisition of lands for conservation purposes; these acquisitions are now largely the national grasslands. The payment account is akin to FS 25% receipt-sharing payments, but requires payments of 25% of net (rather than gross) receipts directly to the counties (rather than through the states) for roads and schools in the counties where the national grasslands are located. The Salvage Sale Fund, established in 1976, allows national forests to retain 50% more than estimated costs for each salvage sale. This fund collects deposits from cooperators, mainly commercial users like timber purchasers, to fund road maintenance costs and other services. The money is used to complete required work, with deposits coming from tariffs on imported solid wood products. The program was established as a pilot program in \u00a7 329 of the FY2002 Interior appropriations act ( P.L. 107-63 ), extended in subsequent Interior appropriations acts, and then established as a three-year mandatory spending program in Title V of the FY2006 Interior appropriations act ( P.L. 109-54 ), and extended again. The agency is authorized to sell unneeded facilities and administrative sites, and use the funds to assess, restore, and/or replace facilities (buildings and other structures), as appropriate. This fund was created in 1937 by the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012). The payment account is akin to FS 25% receipt-sharing payments, but requires payments of 25% of net (rather than gross) receipts directly to the counties (rather than through the states) for roads and schools in the counties where the national grasslands are located. The allocation is based on the national grassland acreage in each county. This account was authorized by the Act of August 11, 1916 (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 490). It receives money from timber purchasers; on each timber sale, the FS identifies the required deposits (in addition to payments for the timber). The fund is used on timber sale sites to dispose of tree tops, limbs, and other debris from timber cutting, to reduce fire and insect hazards, assist reforestation, and related activities. Because of the decline in timber sales, the deposits to the fund are much smaller than in the 1980s. This account is described above, under the National Park Service. It allows the agency to collect rent from employees who use government-owned housing, and to use the funds to maintain and repair the structures. This account, also called the purchaser election program (PEP), was established in \u00a7 14(i) of NFMA (16. The Purchaser Election Program (PEP) was established in NFMA to collect receipts from timber sales where qualified purchasers elect to have the FS build required roads. Two conditions limit this option: road cost must exceed $50,000, and the purchaser must be a small business operator. Deposits to the 10% Fund are determined by estimating road construction costs and are used to supplement annual appropriations for road and trail construction. The 10% Fund was initially used to offset annual appropriations for road and trail construction, but this provision was removed in 1996. Since then, the Fund has been available to the Forest Service for building roads and trails at its discretion. In 1999, the authorized uses of the Fund were expanded to include projects to improve forest health conditions and reduce risks to human safety and public health. Funds have been returned to the General Treasury since 2008 to offset appropriations for roads and forest health projects. The Forest Service has 10 accounts with mandatory spending authority, including the Timber Sales Pipeline and the Land Between the Lakes Management Fund. Stewardship Contracting allows the FS to enter into contracts for forest management. The Forest Service has various accounts for funding, including the Timber Sales Pipeline and the Land Between the Lakes Management Fund. The FS can enter contracts for timber removal and land management services, retaining excess timber receipts for restoration work. Additionally, the FS can collect fees for rights-of-way, commercial filming, and other special uses, with mandatory spending provided through FY2012. Minnesota counties receive payments based on land appraised value, and the FS can administer forest botanical products. The Forest Service has various funding accounts, including the Timber Sales Pipeline and the Land Between the Lakes Management Fund. They can retain fees for harvesting forest botanical products and administer the Valles Caldera Fund for preservation. The Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie account was established for prairie improvement work. The Land Between the Lakes Trust Fund was established by the Land Between the Lakes Protection Act of 1998 to receive annual deposits from the Tennessee Valley Authority. The fund supports local school grants for environmental education.
