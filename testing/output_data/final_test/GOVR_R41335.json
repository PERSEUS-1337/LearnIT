    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which has been under review for potential legislative changes. Senator Lautenberg introduced S. 3209 to amend TSCA, while Representatives Waxman and Rush proposed H.R. 5820. A comparison of key provisions between S. 3209, H.R. 5820, and current law is provided in this report. The proposed legislation would amend or delete most of the original provisions of TSCA Title I, while keeping the basic organization unchanged. New provisions related to reduced animal testing would be added at the end of Title I. The proposals would not affect recently enacted changes, such as the ban on exports of elemental mercury. The proposed legislation would shift the burden of demonstrating chemical safety from the EPA to manufacturers, prohibit the use of chemicals without EPA approval, allow exemptions for national security or economic reasons, and require data submission for all chemicals in commerce. The proposed amendments to TSCA would require data submission for all chemicals in commerce, increase public access to information, target chemicals with specific characteristics for evaluation, and prompt risk management actions for chemicals of highest concern. The proposed amendments to TSCA aim to increase public access to information, target chemicals with specific characteristics for evaluation, and prompt risk management actions for chemicals of highest concern. The scope of EPA oversight would be expanded to include various distinct forms of substances and broaden the scope of environmental risks managed by EPA. The proposed amendments to TSCA aim to expand EPA oversight to include the indoor environment and authorize control of risks posed by articles formed from substances. The amendments would allow EPA to implement international agreements on hazardous chemicals and persistent organic pollutants, with specific authority provided by S. 3209 and H.R. 5820. Both proposals would prohibit production and use of certain chemicals, with S. 3209 aligning with U.S. treaty obligations and H.R. 5820 directing EPA to ban activities accordingly. H.R. 5820 directs EPA to ban activities for specified chemicals not already regulated under U.S. law. TSCA may modify state and local chemical laws. EPA can require testing under section 4, preempting state testing requirements for the same substance. EPA rules under sections 5 or 6 may also preempt state requirements unless they are identical or adopted under another federal law. States can petition EPA under TSCA. The proposed amendments to TSCA would simplify the process for states and political subdivisions to petition EPA for exemptions from federal laws if their own laws provide greater protection without unduly burdening interstate commerce. S. 3209 and H.R. 5820 aim to ensure that federal law does not preempt state or local regulations unless compliance with both is impossible. The proposed legislative amendments aim to harmonize state and local regulations with TSCA requirements. Novel provisions include identifying areas with high toxic chemical exposure, conducting biomonitoring studies on pregnant women and infants, and mandating disclosure of chemical uses. The proposed legislative amendments aim to establish a children's environmental health research program at EPA, promote green chemistry and engineering, encourage the development of safer alternatives to hazardous chemicals, and minimize the use of animals in toxicity testing. An advisory committee would be established to publish a list of testing methods that reduce animal use. The proposals for toxicity testing programs differ in key details, including the time allowed for testing chemicals and the safety standards required. H.R. 5820 allows five years for data development and requires chemicals to meet a safety standard of no harm to health or the environment. S. 3209 proposes EPA ensure negligible risk of adverse effects from chemical exposure, with a health-based standard that may limit consideration of other factors. EPA could still consider benefits and costs under certain circumstances. The current law requires chemicals to not pose an unreasonable risk to health or the environment, with regulation using the least burdensome means. H.R. 5820 expedites action for specified chemicals, while S. 3209 gives discretion to the Administrator to manage high-risk chemicals quickly. H.R. 5820 addresses persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals directly, requiring EPA to establish criteria for identifying them and listing them every three years. The EPA is required to list all PBTs within 18 months of enactment and every three years thereafter. They must impose conditions to reduce exposure and conduct safety evaluations for all PBTs, implementing risk management controls as necessary. These requirements are summarized in Tables 1 through 6."
