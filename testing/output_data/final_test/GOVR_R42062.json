    "content": "In 1794, Congress authorized President George Washington to establish national arsenals for the United States Army. In 1853, the Secretary of War was given the power to close unnecessary arsenals. In 1920, Congress required all Army supplies to be produced in government-owned factories or arsenals. These provisions are still part of the Arsenal Act today. Critics question the effectiveness of the act as most Army materiel is now made by private companies. There are concerns that the act could disadvantage arsenals in the event of base closures. The Arsenal Act (10 U.S.C. \u00a74532) is directed towards industrial arsenals that have provided materials for the Army since the 18th century. Unlike other countries, the US has never relied on private manufacturing establishments for heavy munitions production. The Arsenal Act established federal manufacturing arsenals in the 18th century to supply the Army with munitions. Congress authorized President George Washington to establish an arsenal in Springfield, MA in 1794. By 1795, the arsenal had produced its first 295 muskets. Additional arsenals were built after the War of 1812, specializing in different types of munitions production. The Arsenal Act established federal manufacturing arsenals in the 18th century to supply the Army with munitions. Congress authorized President George Washington to establish an arsenal in Springfield, MA in 1794. By 1795, the arsenal had produced its first 295 muskets. Additional arsenals were built after the War of 1812, specializing in different types of munitions production. In the mid-nineteenth century, facilities were built in Frankford, PA for ammunition, Rock Island, IL for artillery recoil mechanisms, and Picatinny, NJ for artillery ammunition, propellants, and explosives. Harpers Ferry was destroyed during the Civil War and never rebuilt. The surviving factories and Department of the Navy shipyards formed a military production complex. The Army arsenals were under the command of Ordnance Department officers and civilian superintendents, focusing on production rather than innovation. During the mid-19th century, the government arsenals collaborated closely with small arms manufacturers to nurture the nation's precision gauge and machine tool industries. As industry evolved, competition between commercial enterprise and government arsenals intensified to supply the Army's needs. Attempts to privatize arms production were made prior to the Civil War. During the mid-19th century, attempts to privatize arms production were made prior to the Civil War, with the Secretary of War given authority to abolish unnecessary arsenals. Resistance from officials like Colonel Henry K. Craig and Jefferson Davis prevented further commercialization, arguing for the benefits of government manufacturing facilities. Federal arsenal production was not seriously threatened again until the late 1960s. During the 19th century, the peacetime Army had limited arsenals and relied on private enterprise during war. Public confidence in American industry led to complacency in arms development. By the early 20th century, Congress championed arsenal production. During the early 20th century, Congress supported arsenal production, while Brigadier General Crozier opposed federal manufacturing, fearing it could hinder rapid production expansion in emergencies. The U.S. entered World War I in April 1917, leading to an unprecedented industrial mobilization effort to supply troops in France. However, the Army's Ordnance and Quartermaster Departments faced challenges in orchestrating the mobilization by December 1917. During World War I, the Army's Ordnance and Quartermaster Departments faced challenges in orchestrating the industrial mobilization effort. By December 1917, new civilian management was established for military supply and procurement responsibilities. The post-war period saw stress at the arsenals within the Ordnance Department, with contracts being abruptly cancelled and litigation lasting for decades. Private industry returned to civilian production, leaving the task of supplying the postwar Army to the traditional arsenal system. The Defense Act of 1920 mandated that Army supplies be made by federally owned factories and arsenals. Despite large stockpiles of munitions post-war, appropriations and personnel strengths drastically decreased. Ordnance Department personnel dropped from 10,597 in 1919 to 3,087 in 1922, with civilian employment also declining. By 1921, over 14,000 civilians were employed, but by 1922, only 8,119 remained. The combined military and civilian workforce continued to shrink in the following years. The Arsenal Act, consisting of only two subsections, mandates that Army supplies be made in federally owned factories or arsenals on an economical basis. The statute combines provisions from different laws enacted 70 years apart, reflecting the impacts of industrialization and post-World War I defense contraction. The Arsenal Act, enacted in the early 1950s, requires the Secretary of the Army to have supplies manufactured in government factories and arsenals on an economical basis. The language of the provisions has remained unchanged since their origin in the 1850s, reflecting debates on civilian vs. military management of federal arsenals and their role in supporting domestic industries. The Arsenal Act of the early 1950s mandated the Secretary of the Army to oversee manufacturing in government factories and arsenals economically. In 1853, an amendment proposed by Representative Willis Arnold Gorman allowed the Secretary of War to abolish unnecessary arsenals. Despite this, Secretary of War Jefferson Davis aimed to maintain manufacturing capabilities. In 1920, the emphasis shifted towards retaining surge manufacturing capacity in federally owned arsenals for wartime mobilization. Concerns were raised about maintaining manufacturing skills and industrial capacity in arsenals to respond to emergencies, leading to the reorganization of the Army under the Defense Act of 1920. The Arsenal Act of 1920 established a permanent Assistant Secretary of War responsible for military procurement and arsenal regulation. Despite minimal economic impact due to low Army appropriations, the Act aimed to enhance arsenal efficiency. The War Department did not heavily rely on private industry for military supplies until after World War I. The Arsenal Act of 1920 established a permanent Assistant Secretary of War for military procurement and arsenal regulation, impacting Army supply. This policy is detailed in Army Regulation (AR) 700-94, dated December 14, 2004, outlining the use of arsenals and factories for Army supplies manufacturing. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology determines which supplies arsenals can manufacture, following a \"make or buy\" analysis. AR 700-94 outlines policy for the government-owned industrial base to support the Army's supply needs efficiently and economically. The Army relies on the private sector for defense production support, but may establish Government-owned facilities if necessary. Responsibilities include ASA(ALT) deciding on arsenal production and AMC managing government-owned production installations. The curr_chunk discusses managing government-owned production installations, analyzing make or buy decisions, exercising command over contractor-operated production installations, and developing ownership phase-down plans in coordination with PEOs/PMs. PEOs/PMs are responsible for assessing industrial base support, conducting cost analysis, and performing \"make or buy\" analysis under 10 U.S.C. \u00a74532. They collaborate with AMC for analysis preparation and review, ensuring program milestones are not disrupted. The PEOs/PMs have the responsibility for assessing industrial base support, conducting cost analysis, and performing \"make or buy\" analysis under 10 U.S.C. \u00a74532. They collaborate with AMC for analysis preparation and review to ensure program milestones are not disrupted. Federal manufacturing arsenals have supported the Army and the nation since their inception, designing and manufacturing military arms and supplies, contributing to early industrialization, and providing competition to private enterprise. Congress has provided statutory guidance for the operation and continued existence of the arsenals in legislation now consolidated in 10 U.S.C. \u00a74532. The Arsenal Act, now consolidated in 10 U.S.C. \u00a74532, gives the Secretary of the Army the authority to \"abolish\" unnecessary arsenals and requires supplies for the Department of the Army to be made at U.S. factories and arsenals on an economical basis. However, the Act lacks definitions for \"supplies\" and \"economical basis.\" The ASA(ALT) decides whether items are manufactured in federal facilities or by commercial suppliers, relying on AMC and PEOs/PMs for analysis. The Arsenal Act allows the Secretary of the Army to abolish unnecessary arsenals and mandates supplies for the Army to be made economically at U.S. factories. AR 700-94 instructs PEOs/PMs to use private sector resources unless Army-owned factories are more cost-effective."
