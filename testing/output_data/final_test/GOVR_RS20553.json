    "content": "The U.S. EPA has taken actions since the mid-1990s to reduce air pollutants, particularly nitrogen oxides, from electric generating facilities. This led to the Ozone Transport Rule and enforcement actions against utilities in the Midwest in November 1999. The U.S. EPA initiated enforcement actions in November 1999 against utilities in the Midwest and South for violating NSR requirements of the Clean Air Act. These actions are related to the Ozone Transport Rule and Section 126 petitions aimed at controlling NOx emissions to help states in the Northeast meet air quality standards. EPA's Section 126 determinations would involve a subset of states from the NOx SIP Call. The EPA's NSR enforcement action focuses on reducing NOx emissions from utilities in the Midwest and South to help states in the Northeast meet air quality standards. This action involves existing regulations and aims to reduce NOx, sulfur dioxide, and particulate emissions in the eastern United States to reduce interstate ozone transport. The EPA's initiatives focus on reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants to help localities along the eastern seaboard meet ozoneNAAQS and mitigate acid rain. Coal-fired power plants are targeted for emissions reductions due to being major sources of NOx, SO2, CO2, and mercury emissions. EPA's actions include Section 126 determinations, NSR enforcement, and NOx SIP Call to achieve substantial reductions from these sources. The EPA's initiatives focus on reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants to help meet ozone NAAQS and mitigate acid rain. The initiatives target affected power plants to reduce NOx emissions by 75%-85%, with flexibility for utilities to achieve reductions through various strategies. The Midwest is the primary location of affected power plants, with five states - Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia - being impacted. The EPA's initiatives target coal-fired power plants in the Midwest to reduce NOx emissions by 75%-85%. Five states - Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia - are affected by all three initiatives. The costs and benefits of these initiatives could be substantial, with the NOx SIP Call having estimated costs of $1.7 billion annually and quantifiable benefits of $1.1-$4.2 billion annually. The utility industry would bear the majority of the costs. The Section 126 determinations have a smaller scope, impacting emissions abatement and costs. The evolving scope of EPA's NSR action makes estimating costs and benefits difficult. Significant actions have occurred with the initiatives since January 2000, with a key decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upholding EPA's Ozone Transport Rule. The court upheld EPA's authority in developing the NOx SIP Call but made modifications excluding Wisconsin, Missouri, and Georgia. States were ordered to submit revised SIPs within 4 months. The compliance deadline was moved to May 31, 2004. The Supreme Court denied a hearing on the SIP Call in March 2001. By November 2002, all affected states except Michigan had submitted revised SIPs. Michigan is the only state that has not submitted a revised SIP, instead submitting a draft. The Supreme Court ruled in February 2001 that EPA's interpretation of the 1-hour and 8-hour ozone standards was unreasonable. EPA granted four out of eight petitions for the 1-hour ozone standard. EPA is still on an indefinite stay for the 8-hour ozone standard. The EPA granted four out of eight petitions for the 1-hour ozone standard on January 18, 2000. The rule specified NOx allocations for facilities in 12 states and the District of Columbia, implemented through a cap-and-trade program. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld EPA's authority to issue the rule on May 15, 2001, but ordered a reconsideration of emission limits. EPA announced a compliance deadline extension for the Section 126 rule from May 1, 2003, to May 31, 2004, aligning with the NOx SIP Call deadline. In January 2000, EPA indefinitely stayed final determinations for the 8-hour standard due to litigation. Several significant actions have occurred since the filing of NSR lawsuits in 1999, including an agreement with Tampa Electric Company to reduce NOx emissions by over 85% and SO2 emissions by almost 80%. The EPA reached agreements with Tampa Electric, Virginia Power, and Cinergy to reduce emissions through fuel switching and pollution control equipment investments totaling $1 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.4 billion respectively. PSEG Fossil LLC also settled with EPA to reduce SO2 emissions by 90% and NOx emissions by 83% at a cost of $337 million. PSEG agreed to reduce SO2 emissions by 90% and NOx emissions by 83% at a cost of $337 million. Litigation has slowed as participants assess the impact of the Bush Administration's recommendations on the New Source Review process. EPA recommended new rulemaking on the definition of \"routine maintenance,\" with no formal proposal yet. Congress is working on a comprehensive, multi-pollutant alternative to address emissions from fossil fuel-fired utilities. In June 2002, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee proposed a comprehensive bill, S. 556, to control emissions of NOx, SO2, CO2, and Hg through market-oriented mechanisms. No floor action has been scheduled yet."
