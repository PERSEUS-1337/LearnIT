    "content": "Recognizing the potential harm of hazardous chemical releases, state and federal governments regulate safety practices at chemical facilities. After 2001, Congress passed legislation giving DHS authority to regulate security at these facilities. This authority is set to expire on December 13, 2014, prompting calls for Congress to take action. Advocacy groups and policy makers urge Congress to reauthorize DHS authority to regulate security at chemical facilities. H.R. 4007 extends this authority for four years through the Homeland Security Act. The explosion at the West Fertilizer Company in 2013 raised concerns about DHS's ability to identify noncompliant facilities. Congressional policymakers question the effectiveness of DHS efforts in this regard. The report provides an overview of the statutory authority and regulation for chemical facility security. It highlights policy issues and options for Congress to consider. The 109th Congress granted DHS authority to regulate chemical facilities, with some aspects left to the Secretary of Homeland Security's discretion. The statute includes a sunset provision expiring on December 13, 2014. The 113th Congress passed H.R. 4007 to regulate chemical facilities for security purposes. DHS issued an interim final rule on CFATS on April 9, 2007, implementing new statutory authority. DHS interpreted the statute to determine Congress's intent. The interim final rule on CFATS gives the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to determine security requirements for chemical facilities based on risk levels posed by each facility. DHS identifies 322 \"chemicals of interest\" and assesses threats of release, theft/diversion, and sabotage/contamination. Facilities exceeding screening threshold quantities of these chemicals must submit information to DHS for risk assessment. Certain facilities like water systems are exempt from this requirement. The DHS determines high-risk facilities based on specific criteria and assigns them into tiers with varying security requirements. Performance-based security measures are mandated, with facilities required to conduct security assessments and develop site security plans. The interim final rule mandates high-risk facilities to perform a security vulnerability assessment, develop an effective site security plan, and submit these documents to DHS for approval. The assessment determines facility placement in a risk-based tier and serves as a baseline for evaluating security plan activities. Plans must address facility vulnerabilities, preparations for terrorist attacks, and meet risk-based performance standards set by DHS. DHS reviews and approves submitted documents, audits, and inspects chemical facilities. The DHS reviews and approves security vulnerability assessments and site security plans submitted by chemical facilities. If disapproved, DHS must specify areas for improvement. Non-compliant facilities are given a chance to consult with DHS and comply by a specified date, with potential fines and orders to cease operation for continued non-compliance. The interim final rule establishes the process for chemical facilities to appeal DHS decisions and rulings, with certain protections for information under the Chemical-terrorism Vulnerability Information (CVI) category. Judicial and administrative proceedings treat CVI as classified information, with DHS having sole discretion on who can access it. The DHS has sole discretion over who can access CVI, with disclosure punishable by fine. The interim final rule preempts conflicting state and local regulations, allowing for requests for conflict resolution. Congress amended P.L. 109-295 to require \"actual conflict\" for preemption. The NPPD oversees chemical facility security regulations, including the CFATS program. The NPPD oversees the CFATS program, focusing on funding, facility inspections, and DHS implementation efforts. Staffing and funding for the program increased since creation but decreased since FY2011. DHS received authority to regulate chemical facilities in 2006, leading to the creation of a security office and inspector cadre. In February 2012, DHS hired most of the inspector cadre. In March 2013, a working group requested 64 additional inspectors for facility inspections in FY2014 and FY2015, but the request was not approved. Congress appropriated $81 million for ISCD in FY2014, directing DHS to provide reports on CFATS implementation and facility security efforts. The DHS has received over 48,000 Top-Screen submissions from 36,000 chemical facilities. More than 7,800 facilities were required to submit security vulnerability assessments, with approximately 3,700 identified as high-risk. These high-risk facilities were assigned to one of four risk tiers. In May 2010, an anomaly was found in a risk-assessment tool, which was believed to be resolved by DHS. In June 2011, a new acting ISCD Director identified an issue with the risk tiering of facilities, leading to a review of approximately 500 facilities. The number of facilities in the highest-risk tier was reduced from 219 to 102, with some no longer qualifying as high-risk. The total number of chemical facilities assigned a risk tier has decreased since the CFATS program began, indicating its effectiveness. The CFATS program is increasing security by encouraging regulated entities to reduce chemical holdings below the regulatory threshold. Factors contributing to this decline include erroneous filings, process changes, and business decisions. The reported number of facilities may not fully reflect those possessing chemicals above screening thresholds, as some facilities may not have reported their holdings. For example, DHS was not aware of the chemical holdings at the West Fertilizer Company prior to its explosion. The DHS was not aware of chemical holdings at the facility before the explosion. Facilities not reporting their holdings could be considered high-risk and unregulated. Delays in inspections of Tier 1 facilities were caused by additional regulatory requirements and the need to establish an inspector cadre and regional infrastructure. The DHS established a Chemical Security Academy to train inspectors to assess security measures at chemical facilities. Despite delays, inspections of Tier 1 facilities began in February 2010, with only 10 site security plans authorized by the end of 2011. By the end of 2011, DHS had only authorized 10 site security plans and approved no implementation. An interim review process was implemented to authorize more plans, with 2,456 plans authorized by December 2014. 1,366 facilities had their plans inspected and approved. DHS focused on higher-risk tier facilities for plan authorization and approval. The DHS aimed to approve Tier 1 facilities by October 2013 and Tier 1 and Tier 2 facilities by May 2014, but fell behind schedule. They now estimate approving over 90% of Tier 1 and Tier 2 facilities by the end of FY2014. Facilities can move between tiers, causing delays in approving site security plans. Iteration between DHS and regulated entities also contributed to inspection schedule delays. The DHS has issued administrative orders to compel facilities to complete site security plans and established a pre-authorization inspection process. Approximately 180 pre-authorization inspections were conducted by February 2012, with this type of inspection included in compliance assistance visits. By December 2014, DHS had conducted 1,691 compliance assistance visits and the CFATS program underwent three reviews. The CFATS program has undergone three reviews of its processes and progress, including internal reviews and reports from the DHS Office of the Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office. In December 2010, a management review of ISCD was initiated, followed by a leadership change in July 2011. A report presented to Under Secretary Beers in November 2011 focused on challenges faced by ISCD. The review report highlighted challenges faced by ISCD, including delays in approving site security plans, compliance inspection issues, lack of a records management system, human resource problems, difficulties in adjusting workplace requirements, resolving security requirements, and managing a unionized workforce. The report identified challenges faced by ISCD, including managing workplace behavior, tracking consumable supplies, hiring qualified individuals, and low morale. Top priorities included clearing the backlog of security plans, developing a chemical inspection process, and addressing statutory responsibilities. ISCD developed an action plan with NPPD oversight to address these challenges. The GAO reviewed the DHS action plan developed by ISCD with NPPD oversight. As of July 2013, DHS had completed 90 of the 95 action items in the plan, including updated policies, staff engagement, and supervisory training. The GAO noted ISCD's progress but highlighted the need for performance measures to assess results. The DHS OIG report criticized the prior performance of the CFATS program, citing inadequate tools, poorly executed processes, and limited program oversight. The DHS OIG report criticized the prior performance of the CFATS program for limited oversight and confusion in terminology. The Infrastructure Security Compliance Division faces challenges with contractor reliance and lack of employee training, resulting in systematic noncompliance with internal controls. Despite perceptions of suppressed opinions, no evidence of retaliation was found. The regulated community sees the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program as essential for creating a level playing field. The DHS OIG issued 24 recommendations to improve the ISCD's Standards Program, including enhancing internal processes, refining tiering methodology, and reducing reliance on contractors. ISCD provided a corrective action plan and has addressed 12 recommendations as of February 2014. ISCD addressed 12 of the DHS OIG recommendations, including administrative and programmatic changes to improve the CFATS Program. Administrative recommendations focused on leadership, reducing reliance on contractors, and implementing internal controls. Programmatic recommendations aimed to streamline processes and improve program metrics. The ISCD is still addressing 12 DHS OIG recommendations, including programmatic changes to improve the CFATS Program tools and processes. GAO issued a report in April 2013 assessing DHS's assignment of chemical facilities to tiers and its communication with facility owners and operators to enhance security. The DHS approach to assessing risk for facility placement in tiers lacks consideration of all elements like consequence, threat, and vulnerability. The risk assessment primarily focuses on human casualties, neglecting economic consequences. The GAO found inconsistencies in how threat was assessed, with current threat data not always used. DHS was also not tracking data on site security plan reviews, hindering quantification of process improvements. It may take seven to nine years for DHS to complete reviews on submitted plans. The GAO found that DHS does not systematically obtain feedback on outreach activities. Recommendations were made for DHS to develop a plan with timeframes to address risk components and conduct an independent peer review. ISCD has taken steps to address these recommendations, such as engaging in an examination of the CFATS risk assessment model. The Studies and Analysis Institute recommended revising the current risk-tiering model for CFATS and creating a standing advisory committee. President Obama signed an executive order on improving chemical facility safety and security, directing federal agencies to take actions in this area. The executive order aims to improve information sharing and coordination in the CFATS program by developing a plan to enhance collaboration among federal agencies, first responders, and state, local, and tribal entities. It specifically focuses on assessing the feasibility of sharing CFATS data with SERCs, TEPCs, and LEPCs to identify noncompliant chemical facilities and improve safety measures. The order also calls for a proposal for a coordinated data-sharing process to track submitted information effectively. The executive order directs a working group to develop a flexible data-sharing process for tracking submitted data, involving state, local, and tribal entities. It includes consideration of safer alternatives and a pilot program to test innovative methods for federal interagency collaboration on chemical facility safety and security. The pilot program aims to inform standard operating procedures for a unified federal approach to chemical facility risks, incident reporting, enforcement, and information management. It includes agency referrals and joint inspection procedures. The executive order also calls for identifying additional chemicals for the CFATS list, potentially expanding regulation. The group issued a report to the President on progress in modifying the CFATS program to improve performance. Efforts include better information sharing among federal agencies, outreach to state agencies, and coordination with other security programs. The report also mentioned planned modifications to address ammonium nitrate and updates to the list of chemicals of interest. The Office of Management and Budget received proposed ANPRM language from DHS regarding the CFATS program on May 30, 2014. The working group calls for congressional action in three specific areas: providing permanent authorization for CFATS, streamlining enforcement processes, and removing exemptions for water and wastewater treatment facilities. Contentious policy issues include funding for DHS oversight, federal preemption of state regulations, and sharing chemical security information. The 2007 CFATS regulations establish oversight through DHS personnel inspecting chemical facilities to ensure implementation of security plans. Performance-based measures offer flexibility but may require more training for DHS inspectors. Congressional oversight questions DHS's appropriation requests. The oversight raised concerns about DHS's funding adequacy for staff hiring and compliance inspections. Challenges in creating nationwide inspection infrastructure led to mismatches in initial expectations and final needs, resulting in hiring mismatches and unnecessary equipment purchases. Funding adequacy for agency needs is uncertain. The funding adequacy for DHS's infrastructure needs depends on external and internal factors, such as the number of regulated facilities, security plan implementation, workforce requirements, and inspection cycles. Once DHS engages more in facility inspections, it can better determine long-term resource needs and staffing requirements. The DHS's funding adequacy for infrastructure needs relies on various factors, including the number of regulated facilities, workforce requirements, and inspection cycles. Training inspectors for CFATS inspections is crucial for program efficacy. By December 2014, 1,366 chemical facilities had been approved in the CFATS process, with 1,851 authorization inspections conducted. GAO projected that DHS may need seven to nine years to review site security plans, with an approval rate of 30 to 40 facilities per month. Some policy makers are surprised by the pace of DHS inspections and question whether it should continue or accelerate. Factors like internal operations and insufficient detail in security plans slow the process. DHS gathers necessary information through compliance assistance visits. Compliance assistance visits may improve site security plan submissions and reduce future inspection burdens for CFATS inspectors. Higher risk-tier facilities benefit more from these visits due to complexity and stricter performance standards. Smaller facilities with less security experience may also benefit from such visits. Some policy makers question if low inspection rates are due to constraints in hiring chemical facility security inspectors or funding availability. CFATS regulations require inspections every two to three years for facilities. DHS would need to perform over 1,400 inspections annually, each taking one week with two or more inspectors. The DHS may need several years to reduce the backlog of initial site security plan submissions, even with a staffing level that allows for inspections every two to three years for different facility tiers. Hiring additional inspectors could help reduce the backlog but may also pose a risk of increasing the workload. The DHS may hire temporary staff to reduce the backlog of site security plans, potentially increasing unnecessary staff in the future. Inspecting lower risk tier facilities could be less complicated, quicker, and involve fewer inspectors, allowing DHS to inspect more facilities and gain experience. The original statute did not address federal preemption of state and local chemical facility security regulations. The CFATS regulations preempt state and local chemical facility security statutes or regulations only in cases of actual conflict. Currently, there have been no conflicts identified between federal and state activities. Advocates for federal preemption argue for a uniform security framework nationwide. Advocates for federal preemption argue for a uniform security framework nationwide to prevent a \"patchwork\" of regulations and competitive disadvantages based on geographic location. Supporters of state regulation believe states should be allowed to develop more stringent regulations than the federal minimum standard to increase security. Some suggest that conflicting state regulations should preempt federal regulations if they mandate specific security approaches at chemical facilities. If Congress allows the statutory authority for CFATS to expire, state and local jurisdictions would be solely responsible for regulating chemical facility security. The CFATS process involves identifying vulnerabilities and creating security plans, with information kept confidential. Some advocates argue for greater transparency in the CFATS process despite restrictions on disclosing Chemical-terrorism Vulnerability Information (CVI). They believe surrounding communities need this information for emergency planning. Policy makers question if limiting information dissemination hinders efforts, as only \"covered persons\" can access CVI. First responders, community representatives, and worker representatives have raised concerns about how information protection regimes for chemical facility security may impede emergency response, community reaction, and worker input into security plans. The current regimes, CVI under CFATS and SSI under MTSA, do not penalize incorrectly marked information but only penalize disclosure of correctly marked information. Chemical facilities are responsible for marking protected information, which would only be assessed in case of dispute. The existing statute lacks provisions protecting individuals who disclose CVI or challenge information categorization, potentially leading to penalties for revealing protected information. CFATS regulations allow for disclosure to a DHS point of contact but do not provide whistleblower protection. The DHS does not have authority to provide whistleblower protection, and specific protections are not included in the regulation. Chemical facilities regulated by DHS include a variety of entities beyond chemical manufacturers and distributors, such as agricultural facilities and universities. Concerns have been raised about the potential unwieldy regulation of many low-risk facilities instead of focusing on higher-risk ones. DHS revised its threshold for propane possession based on stakeholder feedback. The DHS set the screening threshold quantities for propane at 60,000 pounds, focusing on industrial and major consumers while excluding non-industrial users. They may extend screening efforts to smaller facilities in the future after public input. In 2007, DHS estimated the number of regulated facilities by primary risk category. In 2012, they analyzed facilities with final tier assignments. Academic institutions argue against CFATS regulations due to dispersed chemical holdings. DHS notes high-risk facilities at colleges may implement security measures. The DHS has implemented regulatory extensions for agricultural chemical users, but not distributors. Compliance costs vary based on risk tiers, with all regulated entities incurring annual expenses. Water and wastewater treatment facilities are exempt from CFATS regulations, with current security efforts being voluntary. Some advocate for including these facilities in regulations. Advocates argue for security regulations at water and wastewater treatment facilities due to hazardous chemicals and proximity to population centers. Water sector representatives caution against inclusion in existing regulations, citing potential public impacts like loss of essential services. The United States has around 52,000 community water systems and 16,500 wastewater treatment facilities. If the exemption for these facilities is removed, the number of regulated facilities under the CFATS program could significantly increase. It is estimated that approximately 6,000 facilities would likely meet the CFATS threshold for chemical possession. The DHS has identified non-compliant facilities as \"outliers\" for not reporting under CFATS. Concerns have been raised about facilities not properly reporting to DHS, with an unknown number of facilities failing to comply. If DHS lacks information on a facility's chemical holdings, it cannot identify it as an outlier. DHS has the authority to direct facilities to comply with CFATS but may not issue orders without sufficient information. In 2009, DHS listed identification mechanisms for CFATS compliance, including the CFATS Tip Line and cross-referencing with other federal programs. DHS has since created the CFATS Share tool for stakeholders to access data on regulated facilities. Additionally, DHS engages with State Homeland Security Advisors and other security partners. The DHS engages with various state and local security partners, including State Homeland Security Advisors, in meetings with different committees and councils. Some activities have been terminated, but others continue. Integration of information with the CFATS program may face challenges due to different data formats and resource availability. The DHS is seeking funding to develop an automated process to collect and analyze data from federal, state, and local partners. This includes comparing information from EPA programs to identify non-compliant facilities. Previous debates on chemical facility security have included discussions on mandating adoption. In previous debates on chemical facility security, the discussion has focused on mandating the adoption of changes in chemical processes to reduce consequences following a terrorist attack. Suggestions include reducing onsite chemical storage and changing chemicals used, known as inherently safer technologies. However, comparing these technologies for safety is challenging without established metrics, requiring further research. The National Research Council of the National Academies recommends DHS support research for cost-effective, safer chemistries and processes. Inherently safer process analyses may need broader considerations beyond homeland security implications, such as cost, technical challenges, supply chain impacts, and worker effects. Reducing or removing certain chemicals from facilities can enhance security. Facility security argues that reducing or removing certain chemicals can reduce the incentive for terrorist attacks and mitigate risks to the surrounding population. They cite examples of facilities voluntarily changing chemical amounts or processes. Opponents question the effectiveness of mandating inherently safer technologies as a security tool, arguing that process safety engineers already use safety methods. Experts and business executives should assess the feasibility and financial practicality of changing processes at chemical facilities. A 2011 industry survey found that 66.4% of respondents deemed alternative chemicals or processes not technically feasible. Opponents of a safer technology mandate question the government's technical expertise to evaluate alternative approaches and express concerns about potential side effects. The DHS is involved in research and development activities in Science and Technology. The DHS has conducted research on inherently safer technology within its Science and Technology Directorate, but the NPPD has not integrated these findings into its regulatory framework. Congress has requested the DHS to define inherently safer technology for chemical facilities under CFATS. Some industry representatives are concerned about the financial impact of an inherently safer technology mandate, as regulated entities already face costs complying with CFATS requirements. Small businesses may struggle with additional capital investments. The CFATS program may have a significant economic impact on small entities, especially in terms of adding an inherently safer technology requirement. This could increase compliance costs and disproportionately affect small businesses. Policy makers have raised concerns about the impact on productivity. The program also addresses the issue of preventing individuals with terrorist affiliations from accessing high-risk facilities through a personnel surety risk-based performance standard. The DHS has not fully established the process for CFATS-regulated facilities to conduct background checks on employees and visitors for screening against the Terrorist Screening Database. Stakeholders raised concerns about duplicating requirements with the TWIC program, and DHS withdrew the proposed personnel surety program in 2012. The DHS proposed a personnel surety program for compliance with the CFATS standard, evolving its position based on industry feedback. The program involves providing identifying information to DHS before granting access to restricted areas in chemical facilities for screening against the TSDB. Industry outreach activities were conducted to gather input on the program. The DHS is proposing a personnel surety program for chemical facilities to screen employees and visitors against the TSDB. Facilities must provide identifying information, even for those with TWIC cards, to verify credentials. The program will be implemented in phases, starting with Tier 1 and Tier 2 facilities. Third-party submission of information will be accepted. The DHS is implementing a personnel surety program for chemical facilities in phases, accepting third-party submission of information. Industry stakeholders have concerns about the new information collection request, including the recognition of other credentials and the number of individuals requiring screening. The 113th Congress has passed H.R. 4007, authorizing DHS to regulate chemical facilities for security purposes. This bill will repeal existing statutory authority and provide DHS with new authorities, such as self-certification of security plans. Congress may oversee DHS's implementation of the program and consider legislative action to extend it further. Congress may need to take legislative action to extend the existing statutory authority for regulating chemical facility security. If Congress allows the statutory authority to expire, but funds are appropriated for enforcement, DHS will likely still be able to enforce the regulations. The GAO has found that programs can continue to operate without interruption if funding is explicitly provided by Congress. If Congress allows the statutory authority for regulating chemical facility security to expire and does not appropriate funding for the CFATS program, the regulations may lapse. States could then become the primary source of regulation. Congressional oversight may focus on program performance due to DHS's failures in self-assessment and identifying regulated facilities. Congressional oversight of CFATS-regulated facilities may increase focus on program performance, appropriations, and internal oversight. The existing statutory authority gives discretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security, with Congress potentially extending regulations or allowing them to expire. Maintaining funding for implementation is crucial to avoid lapsing regulations. The current statutory authority for CFATS-regulated facilities may be extended by Congress to provide continuity and avoid competitive advantages. H.J.Res. 130 extends the authority through December 13, 2014. This extension allows for assessment of existing regulations and potential revisions in the future. The Obama Administration FY2015 supports a simple extension without changing statutory requirements. The Obama Administration supports extending the statutory authority for CFATS program until October 4, 2015, with the possibility of enacting longer or permanent authorization. Congress is urged to provide permanent statutory authorization for the program, potentially by removing the sunset date. Some regulated entities also support converting the program to have permanent or long-term authorization, which would allow for continued discretion in developing regulations and assessing their effectiveness. The existing statute for the CFATS program may be made permanent to provide consistency in authority and remove the need for reauthorization. However, some argue that keeping a sunset date increases congressional attention to chemical facility security. Codifying the regulations in statute could limit the Secretary of Homeland Security's discretion in altering the regulations in the future. Future Secretaries may alter the CFATS program's structure while complying with the existing statute. Policy makers could identify key components to retain in future regulations, balancing flexibility with predictability for the regulated community. Congressional policymakers have the authority to modify regulations, address stakeholder concerns, or make broader changes to the regulatory program. The DHS schedules facility CFATS compliance based on assigned risk tiers, with higher-risk facilities facing more accelerated timelines. Policy makers could accelerate CFATS compliance by increasing DHS funding for feedback, review, and inspections. Additional funding could reduce inefficiencies. Alternatively, DHS could use third-party inspectors to meet demand and assess site security activities. Defining roles and responsibilities for these inspectors would be necessary. The DHS may need to define roles and responsibilities for third-party inspectors and assess their qualifications. Concerns may arise about equal treatment of facilities by different inspectors and whether homeland security inspections should be done only by federal employees. Congress could direct DHS to increase efforts in identifying noncompliant facilities, especially after the West, TX explosion revealed noncompliance with CFATS. Congressional policy makers may prioritize identifying facilities that have not reported over other CFATS processes. Congressional policy makers may direct DHS to refine internal procedures, streamline the review process, and accelerate compliance activities. Concerns about the impact on small businesses could lead to a decelerated implementation schedule of chemical facility security regulations. The DHS has implemented regulatory extensions for certain agricultural operations. Policy makers may direct DHS to provide longer timelines for entities facing economic burdens from compliance. Statutory exclusions from the CFATS program might be removed, and the Administration supports a more comprehensive security approach. Modifications to exemptions for facilities under MTSA and Nuclear Regulatory Commission are also being considered. The Department of Homeland Security and the Environmental Protection Agency are calling for additional authorities to regulate water and wastewater treatment facilities in the United States. They believe there is a gap in the framework for regulating the security of chemicals at these facilities and are working with Congress to close this gap and secure chemicals of interest to protect communities. The EPA and DHS are seeking more authority to regulate security at water and wastewater treatment facilities to protect communities from chemicals of interest. The Obama Administration supports EPA as the lead agency for chemical security, with DHS providing support. The Administration's Chemical Facility Safety and Security Working Group recommends Congress remove the exemption for water and wastewater facilities to allow DHS to regulate security in collaboration with the EPA. Congress may consider granting statutory authority to regulate water and wastewater treatment facilities for chemical security purposes. Policy decisions include which facilities to regulate, the level of security measures, oversight agency, and practicality of compliance. One option is to include these facilities under existing CFATS regulations, removing the current exemption and placing them under DHS oversight. Opponents may argue against this, citing concerns about vulnerability assessments. Opponents of regulating water and wastewater treatment facilities for security purposes argue that activities under CFATS may duplicate existing requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act. They also raise concerns about the essential role these facilities play in daily life and the appropriateness of DHS authorities, such as the ability to require a facility to cease operations. Congressional policy makers could address these concerns by requiring DHS to consult with EPA and harmonizing vulnerability assessment requirements. Another option is to grant EPA statutory authority to regulate these facilities for security purposes, with some stakeholders suggesting that EPA should retain the lead for efficiency. The EPA could oversee security and public health operations at water and wastewater treatment facilities to improve efficiency and reduce redundancy. If different agencies are responsible for chemical facility security, they may create separate rules based on their authority and interpretation. Industry representatives are concerned about conflicting regulations if multiple agencies regulate these facilities. Congress may need to assess the similarities and differences in regulations for drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities to provide appropriate authorities. New regulations for these facilities could result in costs for both the regulated entities and the federal government. Representatives from the water and wastewater sectors argue that local ratepayers will ultimately bear the costs of increased security measures. Congressional policymakers may need to decide whether these costs should be borne by the regulated entities and their customers or by taxpayers through federal financial assistance. The DHS supports modifying existing exemptions for MTSA-regulated and NRC-regulated facilities to increase security to the CFATS standard. The EPA believes DHS should ensure consistency of high-risk chemical facility security across critical infrastructure sectors. Congress may need to address conflicts that could arise if exemptions are modified. One approach to resolving conflicts between chemical facility security regulations is to identify which statute would supersede the others. Another approach is to require agencies to harmonize regulations to meet statutory requirements while reducing duplication. Harmonization could reduce regulatory burden on companies regulated under multiple frameworks. For example, equivalent credentialing of workers could limit compliance costs. The DHS has established a working group to harmonize CFATS and MTSA regulations, aiming to reduce regulatory burden on industry. Congress has urged DHS to execute a memorandum of agreement between NPPD and USCG for chemical security responsibilities. The White House is coordinating a review of chemical safety and security regulations across federal agencies to identify gaps and improve coordination. DHS has identified reconciling CFATS submissions with EPA RMP facility information as a way to improve regulatory compliance. The DHS is looking into comparing federally held information on regulated facilities to identify outliers for regulatory compliance. This process would involve data analysis rather than outreach activities and could be more cost-effective. DHS has reengaged with EPA regarding RMP data and identified some outlier facilities, and may also collect chemical holdings data from other governmental entities. State and local regulatory agencies may have more diverse information about chemical holdings at facilities than federal agencies. For example, EPCRA requires certain facilities to submit chemical inventories to state and local authorities, resulting in chemical inventories like the presence of ammonium nitrate at the West Fertilizer Company in Texas. This information may be requested by DHS from state or local agencies. The DHS may request information from state or local authorities to verify facility compliance with CFATS reporting requirements. They are contacting state officials to establish capacity for annual analysis. This approach may provide insight into non-compliant facilities but could be resource-intensive due to data storage in different formats. Industry stakeholders may have concerns about protecting proprietary information. Congressional policy makers may need to address these issues. Congressional policy makers may need to address the issue of inherently safer technologies at regulated chemical facilities. The current statute prohibits DHS from mandating specific security measures, including inherently safer technologies. Congress could choose to give DHS authority in this area or require efforts towards implementing inherently safer technologies. Possible policy approaches include mandating the use of these technologies for certain processes, requiring their consideration based on specific criteria, or implementing a combination of both. The Obama Administration supports the use of inherently safer technologies to enhance security at high-risk chemical facilities. They have established principles for consistent implementation of these technologies across all sectors. Stakeholders could assess the viability of adopting these approaches at lower costs if centralized information is made available. Alternatively, an incentive-based structure could be established to encourage regulated entities to adopt inherently safer technologies outside of the chemical facility security mandate. The Obama Administration supports the use of inherently safer technology approaches for high-risk chemical facilities. They propose that all Tiers 1-4 facilities should assess and report on these methods in their security plans. Regulatory entities should have the authority to require Tiers 1 and 2 facilities to implement safer technology if feasible and enhancing security. Tier 3 and 4 facilities should also undergo assessment with recommendations provided by regulatory entities. The Administration supports the use of inherently safer technology for high-risk chemical facilities, proposing that all Tiers 1-4 facilities assess and report on these methods in their security plans. While a congressional mandate for adopting these technologies may have benefits and drawbacks, experts suggest that existing safety activities already consider these approaches. Assessments may lead to changes in chemical processes for increased safety, reliability, and cost-effectiveness, although the extent of homeland security impact on industry decisions is unknown. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified cases where chemical facilities voluntarily modified processes to lower their CFATS tier. Assessing inherently safer technology is complicated by varying amounts of information available. The differences among chemical facilities challenge mandatory implementation of safer technologies. The chemical industry lacks a common understanding of these technologies. The chemical industry lacks a common understanding and set of practice protocols for identifying safer processes. Any mandate for safer technologies may impose financial burdens on small regulated entities. Congress could limit mandatory measures to high-risk facilities or provide financial assistance. Incentives may be used to encourage adoption of safer technologies, potentially leading to a reduction in stored chemicals of interest at facilities. In 2014, over 3,000 facilities reduced chemicals stored onsite, no longer high-risk. Policy makers may offer incentives for adopting safer technologies, shifting assessment costs to the government. Transparency in CFATS process could be increased by altering information security provisions. The Obama Administration supports maintaining Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) in its current form. Congress may consider amending statutory authority to address policy concerns and increase transparency in the CFATS process. Congressional policy makers could require identifying threats or vulnerabilities from releasing certain information. Congressional policy makers may consider expanding access to chemical facility security information for first responders to minimize barriers to disclosure during accidents. Alternatively, they could choose to further limit dissemination of sensitive information to address policy concerns and increase transparency in the CFATS process. Congressional policy makers may choose to further limit dissemination of CVI to increase barriers to its release, potentially prohibiting sharing outside the federal government or restricting access to state and local officials. This could make it harder for malicious actors to obtain security information, but may also hinder emergency response and targeted protection efforts. Policy makers might also mandate review of marked documents to address the identification of protected information. Congressional policy makers may address concerns about the certification and review of marked CVI documents, potentially assigning this responsibility to chemical facilities or the federal government. Industry representatives may oppose this requirement due to increased regulatory burden. There are also concerns about incorrect marking and the need for a penalty to deter it. Additionally, creating a whistleblower reporting mechanism for reporting misdeeds is suggested. Congressional policy makers may consider codifying a mechanism for reporting concerns to federal entities or creating a general exemption for whistleblowers disclosing protected information. Protections against retaliation for individuals using reporting mechanisms could be extended. The 110th Congress addressed federal preemption of state chemical facility security regulations by requiring federal regulation to preempt state regulation only in cases of \"actual conflict.\" Policy makers may choose to further limit federal preemption of state regulations on chemical facility security or expand the types of conflicts that lead to preemption. The 113th Congress extended statutory authority for CFATS implementation and passed a bill authorizing DHS to regulate chemical facilities for security purposes. The bill, H.R. 4007, repeals existing statutory authority on the effective date of the act, providing DHS with new authorities for certain chemical facilities to self-certify security plans. The DHS may issue new regulations as needed. Other legislation in the 113th Congress modifies existing authority, with H.R. 4007 passing both the House and Senate. The Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2014, H.R. 4007, passed the Senate on December 10, 2014.

Chemical facilities of interest possess certain chemicals in threshold quantities, while covered facilities meet specific security risk criteria. The Protecting and Securing Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2014, H.R. 4007, establishes a Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program within DHS. It requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to set risk-based performance standards and identify chemical facilities of interest and covered chemical facilities. Chemical facilities of interest would submit Top-Screen information to DHS, while covered chemical facilities would also submit a security vulnerability assessment and develop a site security plan. The Secretary would review and approve security vulnerability assessments and site security plans, and could approve alternative security programs meeting DHS requirements. The act allows Tier 3 and Tier 4 chemical facilities to self-certify their site security plans to DHS, prohibiting disapproval for \"expedited approval facilities.\" DHS can assess compliance with performance standards and self-certified plans, with the Secretary recommending additional security measures if needed. Templates for self-certified plans can be developed by the Secretary, who must evaluate this aspect of the chemical facility security program and report to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security. H.R. 4007, passed by the Senate, requires the Secretary to audit and inspect covered facilities, allowing non-departmental and nongovernmental entities to assist. The Secretary sets standards for inspectors and approves site security plans. Covered facilities can use federal screening programs to meet personnel surety standards. The act passed by the Senate would address noncompliance at chemical facilities by allowing penalties and emergency orders. Owners failing to comply with CFATS regulations could face civil penalties. The Secretary would consult with other agencies to identify noncompliant facilities and protect information developed under the act. The Senate-passed act would allow the Secretary to share information with covered facilities, state and local officials, and first responders. It establishes a reporting procedure for employees to submit information confidentially to DHS, prohibits retaliation, and grants discretion to use regulations. The act also directs DHS and GAO to provide reports on the program. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program Authorization and Accountability Act of 2014, H.R. 4007, passed by the House of Representatives on July 8, 2014, would repeal Section 550 of P.L. 109-295 and commission a third-party study on vulnerabilities associated with the existing CFATS program. It contains a sunset date, expiring four years after the effective date of the act, without an authorization of appropriations. The bill also allows the Secretary to provide guidance on recordkeeping, reporting, physical security, and cybersecurity compliance to regulated small chemical facilities. The House Committee on Homeland Security amended the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program Authorization and Accountability Act of 2014, establishing a program within DHS to set risk-based performance standards for chemical facilities. Chemical facilities of interest would need to submit security assessments and implement security plans. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program Authorization and Accountability Act of 2014 establishes a program within DHS to set risk-based performance standards for designated chemical facilities. The act requires security assessments and site security plans to be reviewed and approved by the Secretary, allowing for alternative security programs that meet DHS requirements. Covered facilities can use federal screening programs for personnel surety performance standards. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program Authorization and Accountability Act of 2014 establishes a program within DHS to set risk-based performance standards for designated chemical facilities. H.R. 4007, as passed the House, would require the Secretary to audit and inspect covered facilities, set standards for inspectors, and address noncompliance with penalties. It also allows non-departmental entities to perform inspections and requires consultation with federal agencies and business associations. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program Authorization and Accountability Act of 2014, known as H.R. 4007, aims to identify noncompliant facilities and provide protections for information sharing. The Secretary can share information with covered facilities, government officials, and first responders. The bill also directs DHS and GAO to provide reports on the program and authorizes appropriations from FY2015 through FY2018. Additionally, the Secretary is required to establish physical security compliance guidance for small chemical facilities. The bill H.R. 4007 aims to identify noncompliant facilities and improve information sharing. It requires the Secretary to establish an outreach plan, submit metrics to Congress, and commission a study on vulnerabilities. The bill does not have a sunset date and has received support from the Secretary of Homeland Security and industry organizations. H.R. 4007 is a supported bill that aims to improve chemical facility security. Industry organizations back the bill, but a labor representative criticizes it for not addressing all weaknesses in the current program. The bill would mandate security measures in facility plans and treat CVI as sensitive information. It also allows third parties to sue the Secretary of Homeland Security for enforcement of security regulations. S. 67, the Secure Water Facilities Act, authorizes the EPA Administrator to regulate community water systems and wastewater treatment facilities for security purposes. It also allows for the implementation of methods to reduce the consequences of a chemical release from an intentional act. The Administrator would be directed to promulgate regulations to prohibit unauthorized disclosure of controlled information and provide grants for regulatory compliance. S. 68, the Secure Chemical Facilities Act, aims to codify aspects of the CFATS program and was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The Secure Chemical Facilities Act (S. 68) aims to codify aspects of the CFATS program. It would require facilities to evaluate safer measures in case of an attack and increase employee participation in security plans. The act would align information control with sensitive security information and allow third parties to enforce compliance with the statute. The Protecting Communities from Chemical Explosions Act of 2013 (S. 814) aims to enforce compliance with chemical facility security regulations. It includes civil penalties for not filing Top-Screen information and criminal penalties for intentional non-compliance. The current statutory authority for regulating security at chemical facilities expires in 2014, with a budget request to extend it to 2015. The current statutory authority for regulating security at chemical facilities is set to expire in 2014. Various legislative acts aim to extend this authority, with different proposed extension dates. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015, includes provisions to restrict certain personnel surety activities at chemical facilities. The proposed act aims to verify an individual's legal authorization to work and identify those with terrorist ties. It allows facilities to use federal screening programs for this purpose. The House Committee on Appropriations recommends $83 million for Infrastructure Security Compliance to enhance efforts related to compliance with CFATS. The report recommends that DHS should not mandate how covered chemical facilities meet personnel surety standards if they already have rigorous identity verification processes in place. It also directs the Under Secretary of NPPD to provide regular updates on the CFATS program implementation and encourages collaboration with the Chemical Sector Coordinating Council to share information on advanced sealing technologies. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015, would extend current statutory authority to October 4, 2015. The report recommends $87 million for Infrastructure Security Compliance, directs reporting on CFATS program implementation, and briefs on improving chemical facility security coordination among federal agencies. The report urges NPPD to enhance security coordination among federal agencies and consider chemical neutralization technologies for risk response in chemical facilities. It also emphasizes finding a balance between safety and industry regulations, and suggests eligibility of chemical security inspectors for overtime. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 extended statutory authority through October 4, 2014, and provided appropriations for the federal government for FY2014. Specific directions for the CFATS program were included in the joint explanatory statement for P.L. 113-76.
