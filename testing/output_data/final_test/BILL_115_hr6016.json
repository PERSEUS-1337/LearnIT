    "content": "The \"Bus Operator and Pedestrian Protection Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a program for reducing safety risks in bus operations. The Bus Operator and Pedestrian Protection Act includes a Bus Operations Safety Risk Reduction Program that mandates recipients of fixed route bus service to develop and implement safety programs to reduce accidents, injuries, assaults on bus operators, and fatalities. The Bus Operator and Pedestrian Protection Act requires recipients of fixed route bus service to develop a risk reduction program for bus operations. This program involves conducting risk analysis, incorporating it into a safety plan, and collaborating with bus operators and collective bargaining representatives. The Bus Operator and Pedestrian Protection Act mandates a risk reduction program for bus operations, including a plan for reducing accidents involving buses through driver assistance technologies and visibility improvement measures. The Bus Operator and Pedestrian Protection Act requires measures to reduce visibility impairments, prevent bus operator assaults through infrastructure and training, and modify seating on buses. The Bus Operator and Pedestrian Protection Act mandates updates to bus operator safety programs, including seating modifications and ergonomic improvements to prevent injuries. Additionally, the Secretary may require other measures to reduce accidents, injuries, assaults, and fatalities related to bus operations. Recipients must annually update their programs and resubmit them for approval every three years. The Transportation Act is amended to require the Secretary to issue a final rule within 1 year of the Bus Operator and Pedestrian Protection Act enactment, regarding the protection of public transportation operators from assault risks. Authorization of appropriations for implementation plans under the risk reduction program is set at $25,000,000 annually from 2019 to 2023. Funds will be distributed based on specific formulas outlined in the Transportation Act. Additionally, operator assault data is addressed in Section 4. Section 5335 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to require recipients of grants under this chapter to report any assault on an operator to the Secretary for inclusion in the National Transit Database. This reporting should be separate from other safety incidents, and assault on an operator is defined as endangering safety or health with intent or reckless disregard. The term 'recipient' in section 5329(a) refers to individuals who interfere with or incapacitate transportation personnel without causing immediate medical attention or fatalities."
