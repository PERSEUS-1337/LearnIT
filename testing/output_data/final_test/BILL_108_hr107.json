The findings of Congress highlight consumer confusion and burdens caused by copy-protected compact discs, emphasizing the need for adequate notice to consumers and labeling of digital music disc products by recording companies. SEC. 3. INADEQUATELY LABELED COPY-PROTECTED COMPACT DISCS. The Federal Trade Commission Act is amended to include a new section addressing inadequately labeled copy-protected compact discs. The Federal Trade Commission Act is amended to define terms related to audio compact discs and prerecorded digital music discs. The term 'Red Book Audio' refers to audio data digitized at 44,100 samples per second with a range of 65,536 possible values. The Act prohibits the mislabeling or deceptive advertising of prerecorded digital music disc products. Prior to selling a prerecorded digital music disc product to consumers, it is illegal to remove or deface any required label. Violating this rule is considered an unfair method of competition and a deceptive act in commerce. Prerecorded digital music discs are considered mislabeled if they bear markings identifying them as audio compact discs, fail to provide clear labeling indicating they may not play properly in all devices, or do not include information about their recordability on personal computers. The Federal Trade Commission may develop rules to prevent prohibited acts related to prerecorded digital music discs, such as improper labeling and failure to disclose playback restrictions or return policies for consumers. The Commission may establish labeling requirements for new audio discs to address consumer confusion about playability and recordability, especially for discs like DVD-Audio and Super Audio Compact Discs. This includes ensuring proper labeling for playback on standard devices and addressing issues with recordability on personal computers. The Commission aims to establish labeling requirements for new audio discs to address consumer confusion regarding playability and recordability. The rules developed should impose labeling requirements comparable to those under paragraph (1). The Commission aims to establish labeling requirements for new audio discs to address consumer confusion regarding playability and recordability, with rules comparable to those under paragraph (1). Additionally, a report to Congress is required. The Federal Trade Commission must report to Congress within 2 years of this Act on the market entry of prerecorded digital music discs, consumer complaints about return policies, and the impact of returns on manufacturers and retailers. The Federal Trade Commission must report to Congress on enforcement actions, convictions, settlements, and proposed changes related to prerecorded digital music disc products. SEC. 5. FAIR USE AMENDMENTS. Scientific research exemptions and fair use restoration amendments are proposed to sections of title 17, United States Code, allowing circumvention of technological measures for research purposes and ensuring that such actions do not infringe on copyright. The proposed amendment allows the manufacturing and distribution of hardware or software products that enable significant noninfringing use of copyrighted works without violating copyright laws."
