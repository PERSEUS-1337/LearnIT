    "content": "The ACA requires health insurance exchanges to be established in every state by January 1, 2014, offering private health plans to individuals and small businesses. These exchanges provide comprehensive health services and comply with ACA market reforms, with plans categorized by actuarial value (AV) - bronze (60%), silver (70%), gold (80%), and platinum (90%). Higher AV percentages result in lower cost-sharing. The ACA requires health insurance exchanges in every state to offer private health plans to individuals and small businesses. Exchanges are structured to assist these two customer types, with the option for states to merge them. Enrollees in individual exchanges may be eligible for premium assistance in the form of federal tax credits, which are not available in SHOP exchanges. The premium credit is an advanceable, refundable tax credit that can be claimed monthly, regardless of federal income tax liability. The ACA requires health insurance exchanges to offer private health plans to individuals and small businesses. Enrollees in individual exchanges may be eligible for premium assistance in the form of federal tax credits, which lower monthly insurance premiums. The Treasury Department and IRS have issued regulations and guidance on premium credits, available to applicable taxpayers with household income at or above 100% of the federal poverty level starting in 2014. The premium assistance in the form of tax credits is available to applicable taxpayers with household income between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. The credits are administered through the tax system and can only be obtained by qualifying individuals who file federal tax returns. Married couples must file joint tax returns to claim the credit, with special rules for changes in filing status during a tax year. The final regulation acknowledges challenges for taxpayers in certain circumstances like domestic abuse or abandonment when filing jointly. The IRS will propose additional rules to address these situations. Premium credits are available to individuals and families enrolled in plans offered through individual exchanges, not through small business exchanges. Only lawful residents can obtain exchange coverage, while undocumented individuals are prohibited from purchasing coverage through an exchange, even if they can pay the entire premium without a subsidy. The final regulation clarifies premium credit eligibility for family members of individuals who are not eligible for exchange coverage due to incarceration or legal status. Household income must meet defined guidelines based on the federal poverty level for individuals to be eligible for premium credits. The income eligibility for premium credits under the ACA is based on \"modified adjusted gross income\" (MAGI) between 100% and 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). To qualify, individuals must not have minimum essential coverage, with exceptions. Minimum essential coverage includes various government health plans and programs. The ACA provides exceptions for eligibility for minimum essential coverage and receipt of premium credits. Individuals may be eligible for premium credits if they can only obtain coverage through the individual health insurance market or if their employer's coverage is unaffordable or does not provide minimum value. The ACA provides exceptions for eligibility for premium credits if the plan exceeds 9.5% of household income or does not provide minimum value. Medicaid expansion under ACA may affect eligibility for premium credits for low to middle-income individuals. States have the option to expand Medicaid eligibility to include childless adults and certain parents. The ACA Medicaid expansion includes non-elderly, non-pregnant individuals with income up to 133% FPL. States that implement the expansion receive federal subsidies. If eligible for Medicaid, individuals cannot receive premium credits. Medicaid eligibility affects premium credit eligibility for low to middle-income individuals. The premium tax credit under the subsidized health coverage program varies based on household income, the exchange plan premium, and other factors. It can cover the entire premium or require the taxfiler to pay a portion. The premium tax credit amount is calculated by comparing two scenarios: the premium for the exchange plan and a formula involving the premium for a standard plan in the local area. The credit will be the lesser amount between the two scenarios. The taxfiler's required contribution is capped as a percent of household income under Scenario B. The premium tax credit amount is determined by comparing the premium for the exchange plan with a standard plan in the local area. The taxfiler's required contribution is capped as a percentage of household income under Scenario B, with specific percentages based on income levels relative to the federal poverty level. The ACA statute specifies the applicable percentage of taxfiler's required premium contribution at different income levels relative to the federal poverty level. The contribution amount changes gradually for incomes between 133% and 300% FPL but jumps for those below 133% FPL. The contribution amount increases sharply at 133% FPL, reflecting statutory and regulatory requirements. Premium credit calculation involves subtracting the taxfiler's required contribution from the second-lowest cost silver plan premium. If the required contribution equals or exceeds the reference plan premium, the taxfiler receives zero credit. Credits are based on the reference plan but can be used for any metal-tier plan. Enrolling in a more expensive plan requires the taxfiler to pay the difference. Premium tax credits for health insurance in the exchanges became available in 2014. Table 2 and Table 3 show income levels used for credit calculation and maximum monthly contributions for individuals and families. The cliff effect occurs at 133% FPL, where individuals below pay 2% of income for the silver plan, while those at or above pay up to 3% for their reference plan. For example, someone at 132.99% FPL may be required to pay additional amounts. In 2014, premium tax credits for health insurance in the exchanges were introduced. Individuals at 132.99% FPL may pay $26 in monthly premiums, while those at 133% FPL may pay $39. An additional $1 in income could result in an extra $156 in premium contributions. Before the ACA, there were no federal subsidies for individuals at this income level. The ACA expanded eligibility for subsidized private coverage. The information in Table 4 compares premiums, enrollee contributions, and premium credit amounts for individuals and families in Autauga County, Alabama. Premiums vary based on age due to age rating restrictions in health insurance policies. ACA's age rating requirements result in different premiums for adults aged 21 to 64+ in the same metal-tier plan and geographic area. Premiums for adults aged 21 to 64+ in a metal-tier plan in Autauga County, AL vary by a 3:1 ratio. Lower-income individuals receive greater premium credits compared to higher-income individuals of the same age. For self-only coverage, monthly premiums in the second-lowest cost silver plan are $201 for a 21-year-old and $603 for a 64-year-old. The premium for older adults is three times higher due to the age-rating among adults. Premium contributions for older adults are three times higher than for younger adults, but for premium credit recipients, age does not affect the amount contributed. Contributions are based on income, not age, so individuals with the same income level will pay the same amount towards premiums, regardless of age. Person C pays the entire premium amount for the second-lowest cost silver plan available in the county, as their premium contribution is lower than the maximum allowed. Family coverage follows similar rules to self-only coverage, with older adults facing higher premiums but the same income level resulting in the same premium contribution. Under the ACA, premium credits are based on prior year's income tax returns and reconciled when filing tax returns for the actual year. If income decreases during the tax year, additional credit may be included in the tax refund, while excess amounts overpaid in premium credits must be repaid to the federal government. Specific limits apply for households with incomes below 400% FPL, indexed by inflation in future years. The ACA sets limits on premium credits based on prior year's income tax returns, with repayment limits varying by income band. Repayment is capped at $600 for families below 200% FPL. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects modest exchange enrollment in the first few years of the ACA, with a significant increase afterwards. By 2024, CBO estimates 29 million individuals will be enrolled in exchange coverage, with 19 million receiving premium credits. The ACA establishes subsidies for premium credits and cost-sharing expenses in individual exchanges. CBO projects $726 billion in federal outlays for premium credits from FY2015 through FY2024. Cost-sharing assistance is available for individuals enrolled in a silver plan through an exchange, based on income. ACA sets annual cost-sharing limits for each metal tier plan. The ACA establishes cost-sharing assistance for individuals enrolled in a silver plan through an exchange, with annual limits set for self-only and family coverage. Cost-sharing assistance targets those with income between 100% and 250% FPL, reducing annual limits for high healthcare users. Another form of assistance also applies to individuals in this income range. Cost-sharing assistance for individuals with income between 100% and 250% FPL reduces cost-sharing requirements in their enrolled plans, increasing the actuarial value of the plan. Eligibility requires enrollment in a silver plan with an AV of 70%, benefiting both minimal and high healthcare users. The ACA requires insurance companies to offer variations of their silver plans with higher actuarial values (73%, 87%, and 94%) for individuals eligible for cost-sharing subsidies based on income. This ensures automatic cost-sharing assistance for those enrolled in exchange coverage. The HHS Secretary will fully reimburse exchange plans for providing cost-sharing subsidies, totaling $175 billion from FY2015 through FY2024."
