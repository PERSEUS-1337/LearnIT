    "content": "The American Farmland Stewardship Act of 2001 establishes a Farmland Stewardship Program and an Advisory Council. The Act includes sections on the short title, findings, definitions, and the purpose of the Program. The Program focuses on using stewardship agreements, a partnership approach, and involving owners and operators of eligible agricultural lands. An advisory council is created to provide guidance on the Program. Congress acknowledges that American agricultural producers play a crucial role in maintaining and protecting natural resources on their lands. They face challenges in balancing environmental conservation with food production. Increased access to conservation programs, especially for producers with unique environmental needs, is essential for national agricultural conservation policy. Incentive initiatives can encourage responsible care and stewardship of natural resources by agricultural producers. Initiatives are needed to assist producers in meeting environmental program requirements, protecting endangered habitat, improving water quality, and addressing other environmental challenges. Greater local involvement and cooperation between agricultural producers and officials is necessary. A voluntary incentives program could encourage protection of natural resources by providing economic assistance to agricultural producers. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" In this Act, \"farmland stewardship agreement\" and \"agreement\" refer to stewardship contracts authorized by title I. The term \"contracting agency\" includes local conservation districts, resource conservation & development districts, and other government agencies designated by the Secretary to enter into farmland stewardship agreements. \"Eligible agricultural lands\" are private lands primarily in native or natural condition, or classified as cropland, pastureland, grazing lands, or timberlands by the Secretary, containing wildlife habitat. The Farmland Stewardship Program aims to protect lands with wildlife habitat, wetlands, and natural ecosystems, providing ecological services like water filtration, aquifer recharge, and habitat improvement for wildlife. The Farmland Stewardship Program, established by the Department of Agriculture, aims to protect lands with wildlife habitat, wetlands, and natural ecosystems. The Secretary of Agriculture oversees this conservation program. The Farmland Stewardship Program, established by the Department of Agriculture, aims to protect lands with wildlife habitat, wetlands, and natural ecosystems through a conservation program overseen by the Secretary of Agriculture. The Farmland Stewardship Program, established by the Secretary of Agriculture, tailors conservation programs to specific needs of eligible agricultural lands. It may incorporate features of other conservation programs from various agencies and government entities, with consent, and is funded through various sources. The Farmland Stewardship Program is funded by the Secretary using funding authorities of conservation programs and appropriated funds. The majority of funds must come from existing conservation programs or matching contributions from various sources. The Farmland Stewardship Program may use federal funds for personnel costs to support staff positions at national and state offices. Additionally, a minimum of twenty percent of funds must be reserved for technical assistance under the Program. SEC. 102. USE OF FARMLAND STEWARDSHIP AGREEMENTS. The Farmland Stewardship Program authorizes the Secretary to enter into stewardship agreements with owners or operators of eligible agricultural lands to maintain natural, environmental, and agricultural resources. These agreements operate as service contracts, allowing the Secretary to hire landowners for specific services in exchange for a fee. Any Federal agency involved in the program can participate in funding these agreements. The Farmland Stewardship Program allows the Secretary to enter agreements with owners of agricultural lands to protect and improve natural resources. These agreements involve negotiating guidelines for services in exchange for annual payments, implementing conservation programs, and expanding conservation practices on the land. The Farmland Stewardship Program allows the Secretary to enter agreements with owners of agricultural lands to protect and improve natural resources. If most requirements of a conservation program are met for a parcel of eligible agricultural lands, the Secretary may waive any remaining limitations to facilitate the agreement. State and Local Conservation Priorities must be addressed in agreements for eligible agricultural lands, aligning with the priorities set by the State and locality. The partnership approach to the program is outlined in Section 103. The Secretary works in partnership with other agencies for the Farmland Stewardship Program. Local agencies can be authorized to administer agreements on behalf of the Secretary. Eligible districts or offices must meet certain conditions to be designated as contracting agencies. Eligible districts or offices must meet specific conditions to be designated as contracting agencies for the Farmland Stewardship Program. This includes submitting a written request, affirming willingness to follow guidelines, demonstrating established working relationships with landowners, and assuming responsibility for agreement preparation and monitoring compliance. The contracting agency must demonstrate the necessary resources and expertise to fulfill its responsibilities under the Farmland Stewardship Program agreement. SEC. 104. PARTICIPATION OF OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF ELIGIBLE AGRICULTURAL LANDS. To participate in the Farmland Stewardship Program, owners or operators of eligible agricultural lands must submit an application to the Secretary indicating interest, describing their property and its values, providing a list of services or a management plan, and entering into an agreement if accepted. A designated contracting agency may also submit the application on behalf of an owner or operator. The contracting agency can submit the application on behalf of an owner or operator with their consent. The agreement must include a map, property description, list of resources, services to be rendered, conservation practices to be implemented, and a schedule for implementation. During the term of the agreement, the owner or operator of the eligible agricultural lands must adhere to the specified services, payment schedules, bonus criteria, compliance monitoring guarantees, penalties for nonperformance, assignment provisions, encumbrance provisions, and any other terms required by the Secretary. During the agreement term, the owner must implement specified conservation practices, maintain records, and refrain from activities that undermine the agreement. The Secretary is responsible for ensuring timely payments. Authorized services include removing invasive species and ongoing land management. The conservation practices required during the agreement term include removal of invasive species, installation of best management practices, use of property for water retention, installation of waste treatment facilities, and dedication of buffer strips. The conservation practices required during the agreement term include dedication of buffer strips, retention of open space, wetland restoration, reduction of greenhouse emissions, enhancement of soil health, improvement of water and air quality, on-farm conservation, provision of research access, and other services as prescribed by the Secretary. All necessary funds for an agreement must be provided by involved agencies and entities upon execution. Title II establishes an Advisory Council for the program. The Secretary appoints a 12-member advisory council to assist in carrying out the Farmland Stewardship Program by drafting regulations, developing documents for agreements, facilitating partnerships, designing application criteria, providing assistance and training, and supporting project partners and contracting agencies. The advisory council assists in combining conservation programs into agreements, tailoring agreements to individual properties, monitoring progress, and recommending improvements to the program."
