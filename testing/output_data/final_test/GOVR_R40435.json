    "content": "Deficits can be a powerful tool in fiscal policy, determining if the budget is in surplus or deficit. Annual deficits or surpluses impact federal debt and interest payments. Deficit spending can help smooth out economic shocks, but persistent deficits can lead to higher debt, interest payments, and potential tax increases or spending cuts. Economic conditions can affect spending and revenues, influencing the budget outlook. Economic growth can stimulate employment and individual income, reducing certain types of spending and increasing revenue levels. During a recession, reductions in consumption and increased reliance on government programs have the opposite effect. Changes in spending or revenue levels by the federal government can affect the size of the deficit. Automatic stabilizers refer to these economic changes. The budget deficit is often measured as a percentage of GDP to provide a more accurate picture of the government's fiscal condition. The CBO baseline estimates federal spending and receipts, serving as a benchmark for comparing proposed budget policy changes. Congress has specific rules for calculating different types of spending baselines. The baseline calculation is crucial for evaluating budget policies, but it comes with uncertainties, especially in the out-years. It serves as a neutral foundation for assessing policy options and should be used as a rule-of-thumb estimate for budgetary impacts. The FY2008 deficit was $455 billion, 3.2% of GDP. In FY2008, the deficit was $455 billion, 3.2% of GDP, significantly higher than FY2007. CBO projected a deficit of $1.4 trillion in FY2009, largely due to the effects of the economy and federal interventions. The CBO projects that the recession, likely the longest and deepest since WWII, will extend into 2009, leading to increases in outlays for mandatory programs and a decrease in revenue collection. The projected deficit for FY2009 is high relative to historic standards, with the deficit reaching its peak in 1943 at 30.3% of GDP. If the deficit in FY2009 reaches the projected level, it will likely be significant. The federal deficit in FY2009 is projected to reach 6.0% of GDP, the highest since FY1946. Various financial interventions were enacted in 2008 and early 2009 to address the credit crisis and economic effects of the recession, including economic stimulus, TARP, unemployment benefit extensions, and the ARRA. The long-term impact of these programs on the budget deficit remains uncertain. The budget deficit is uncertain due to federal responses to financial turmoil. Costs depend on economic recovery, firms' resilience, and asset returns. Estimating costs is challenging. Stimulus acts in 2008 increased deficit by $152 billion in FY2008 and $16 billion in FY2009. HERA provided new authority for addressing issues. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA, P.L. 110-289) provided new authority to address issues in the mortgage markets, allowing banks to write down existing loan balances for refinancing and foreclosure prevention. It also included provisions for community property acquisition, created a new regulator for GSEs, and gave Treasury temporary authority to purchase GSE securities. The provisions increased the deficit by $1.4 billion in FY2008 and are expected to increase by $36.7 billion in FY2009 and $3.6 billion in FY2010. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 added $238 billion to the deficit in FY2009 by placing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under federal control. This amount represents the net present value of their outstanding obligations. The budget impact is projected to decrease in subsequent years, with a subsidy cost of $66 billion between FY2010 and FY2019. Excluding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the FY2009 deficit would still reach a post-WWII high. On October 3, 2008, Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) authorizing the Treasury Secretary to use $700 billion to intervene in financial markets. TARP funds were used to recapitalize banks and institutions, as well as fund the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) for loans like education and auto. Additionally, TARP funds were loaned to automakers and used to purchase equity and guarantee assets. The Treasury Secretary disbursed $350 billion in TARP funds to automakers, financial institutions, and equity purchases. The remaining $350 billion was released in January. CBO estimates a deficit increase of $180 billion in FY2009 and $5 billion in FY2010 due to TARP outlays, accounting for asset purchases on a net present value basis. President Bush signed the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2008 into law, extending unemployment benefits for up to 20 weeks and creating a second tier of benefits for workers in high unemployment states. The CBO estimates a lower budgetary impact than the purchase price, but the Treasury Department still needs to raise money through debt to make the purchases. President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which included $501 billion in new outlays and $286 billion in net tax cuts to stimulate the economy. Provisions included Medicaid funding assistance, infrastructure projects, tax incentives for small businesses, and expanded tax credits. The CBO estimated the legislation would increase the deficit by $185 billion in FY2009, $399 billion in FY2010, $134 billion in FY2011, and $787 billion over the FY2009 through FY2019 period. The Federal Reserve also played a role in limiting systemic risk through various programs. The Federal Reserve has provided $1 trillion in direct financial assistance to borrowers. Its activities do not impact the federal budget directly, but its profits are remitted to the Treasury as revenues. The Fed's primary liability is currency, and its assets include Treasury securities, loans, and private assets. Its loans and asset purchases are financed by increasing its liabilities, which do not impose costs on the Treasury. Repaid loans increase the Fed's profits and remittances to the Treasury. The Treasury Department has increased the national debt by $296 billion in 2008 through the Treasury Supplementary Financing Program to offset potential inflationary effects of the Fed's actions. Eventually, the additional debt is expected to be paid off in 2009. The FDIC has taken actions to support the housing and financial markets, including increasing deposit insurance, creating a Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, and seeking buyers for distressed banks. The additional debt incurred in 2008 is expected to be paid off in 2009, contingent on the Fed withdrawing emergency assistance to the financial sector. The FDIC has increased guarantees to individuals and banks, leading to pressure on its deposit insurance fund. If financial distress occurs, additional funds may be needed from the Treasury, increasing the budget deficit. Legislative actions, such as TARP and ARRA, are expected to significantly impact the deficit in FY2009 and beyond. The ARRA will add $185 billion to the deficit in FY2009 and $603 billion between FY2010 and FY2018. Legislative, economic, and technical changes will continue to contribute to deficit increases. The stimulus legislation will further impact the deficit, especially in FY2010 and FY2011. The Appendix explains how legislative policy and other factors shifted projections from surpluses to deficits between 2001 and 2009. Technical changes account for differences between projected and actual results due to assumptions unrelated to the economy. Technical changes in the budget are mainly on the revenue side, influenced by economic conditions leading to downward revisions in revenue projections. These revisions are due to lower projections of nominal GDP and taxable income components. Some declines are offset by lower interest payments on the federal debt. Some declines in revenue projections are offset by lower interest payments on the federal debt. Deficit estimates may change based on economic recovery pace and potential legislation affecting outlays or revenues. CBO baseline projects falling deficits over the next decade, but certain tax or spending provisions not included in the baseline could lead to further deficit increases. President Obama's budget proposal includes extending some tax cuts, which could impact spending and revenues. The baseline assumes the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts, leading to increased revenues. The budget accounts for various costs that could affect the deficit over the next ten years. The budget proposal includes extending tax cuts and financing overseas operations, leading to a projected deficit of $10.7 trillion over the next ten years. President Obama's plan outlines new agendas for energy, health care, and education, with a placeholder for additional financial market stabilization efforts. The President's budget proposal projects significant deficits in the short term, with a deficit of $1.8 trillion in FY2009. Long-term projections show deficits decreasing but still unsustainable, requiring spending cuts, tax increases, or economic growth. Entitlement spending, especially on healthcare, is expected to rise rapidly, posing a challenge to the federal budget's sustainability. The Government Accountability Office, Office of Management and Budget, and CBO projections all indicate that maintaining federal outlays at 20% of GDP would require drastic cuts in spending other than Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. By 2030, spending on these programs is projected to reach 15% of GDP, necessitating significant budget cuts to keep overall spending levels stable. The President's FY2009 budget also expressed concerns about long-term budget outlook. In each fiscal year since 2001, federal spending has accounted for about a fifth of the economy, while federal revenues have ranged between just under a sixth and just over a fifth of GDP, leading to budget deficits. The differences between the 2001 baseline CBO projections and actual budget balances are attributed to legislative, economic, and technical factors. Changing economic conditions can impact spending and revenue levels through automatic stabilizers and tax base size adjustments. The remaining difference between the original projection and actual results is classified as a technical change, which can be caused by legislative changes or other technical assumptions. For example, CBO projected an FY2008 budget surplus of $635 billion, but the actual budget deficit was $455 billion, resulting in a difference of more than $1 trillion. The FY2008 budget deficit was $455 billion, a significant difference from the projected surplus of $635 billion. Legislative changes, including tax cuts and increased military spending, accounted for most of the shift from surplus to deficit over the past eight years. Between 2001 and 2008, legislative changes, tax cuts, and increased military spending were the main factors contributing to the budget deficit. Even without economic downturn, legislative changes alone would have caused deficits from 2003 to 2008. In 2008, legislative changes were responsible for 92% of the deficit increase. Legislative changes in the early 2000s led to fluctuations in federal revenues and spending as a share of GDP. Revenues peaked in 2000 and hit a low in 2004 before rising above the 50-year average in 2007. Meanwhile, spending rose from its lowest level in 2000 to match the 50-year average by 2004 and remained steady through 2007. In 2008, revenues dropped to their lowest since 2005, while spending reached its highest level since 1994, contributing to future deficit increases. Discretionary spending is determined annually and not bound by previous year law. CBO's definition of current policy for discretionary spending is criticized for being too low. If a higher spending growth rate was assumed, future surpluses in 2001 would have been smaller. Economic conditions also affected deficits through automatic stabilizers, inflation, and interest rates. The economic recession of 2001 caused deficits in 2002 and 2003, while economic conditions had little effect on deficits from 2004 onwards. Economic and technical changes accounted for about 4% and one-fifth of the shift to deficit, respectively. Budget projections are uncertain due to significant economic and technical changes. The 2001 surplus was $72 billion smaller than projected, with $37 billion due to economic changes and $35 billion due to technical changes. There is uncertainty in budget projections, as seen in the discussion of the 2007 deficit and tax cuts. The 2001 projection for the economy in 2007 was close to the actual state. The actual performance of the economy after the tax cuts closely matched the projected state without tax cuts. CBO expected 3.1% economic growth between 2003 and 2008, but actual growth was 3.0%. Tax revenue was lower than expected each year, indicating that tax cuts may have cost more than originally anticipated."
