    "content": "Commemorative coins are special souvenirs produced by the U.S. Mint to honor events, people, and institutions. They are not meant for general circulation but are designed to be collected and sold at a premium to raise money for designated groups. Legislation for these coins is often proposed by Members of Congress, with the first commemorative coin authorized in 1892 for the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Since 1892, commemorative coins have been used to honor various events, people, and institutions. Congress has authorized 152 new coins, with most celebrating state anniversaries and expositions. Issues for congressional consideration include the disbursement of surcharges, the number of coins minted per year, and requirements for legislative approval. Since 1892, commemorative coins have been authorized by Congress to honor events, people, and institutions. Coins were sold to organizations for fundraising purposes. New commemorative coins were discontinued in 1939, except for three issued until 1954. Between 1954 and 1981, no new coins were authorized due to waning public interest and concerns about design multiplicity on US coins. In 1954, President Eisenhower vetoed a bill for a 50-cent piece for New York City's tercentennial, citing diminishing public interest in commemorative coins. He mentioned that unsold coins were often returned to the mints for melting. In 1982, Congress resumed issuing commemorative coins with a half-dollar for George Washington's 250th birthday. The issuance of new commemorative coins expanded the range of subjects to include women, historical events, buildings, and landscapes. Surcharges were introduced to direct money to designated groups, which sparked controversy among collectors. The Commemorative Coin Reform Act of 1996 limited commemorative coins minted between 1982 and 1997, and those minted since 1998. The Commemorative Coin Reform Act (CCRA) enacted in 1996 limited the number of commemorative coins minted per year and clarified Mint expenses. Between 1982 and 1997, Congress authorized 47 commemorative coins, including multiple coins for events like the 1984 and 1996 Summer Olympics. The CCRA restricted the U.S. Mint to issuing two coins per year starting in 1998. The Commemorative Coin Reform Act of 1996 limited the number of commemorative coins minted per year in response to the proliferation of coins authorized since 1982. Between 1998 and 2018, a total of 41 commemorative coins were struck by the U.S. Mint, with an average of three years between authorization and minting. The U.S. Mint has minted commemorative coins with varying time periods between authorization and minting, ranging from the longest in 2002 to the shortest in 2006. Congress has authorized coins for 2019 and 2020, with no authorization for 2021 and beyond. Several proposals for new commemorative coins are introduced each Congress, with legislation passed for coins minted between 2017 and 2022. Legislation for commemorative coins typically includes features such as historical findings, specifications for denominations and design requirements. Examples of these features are provided in the legislation, which honors people, places, events, and institutions. The legislation for commemorative coins specifies details such as the type and number of coins authorized, legal tender status, numismatic value, and design requirements. For example, the legislation for the National Baseball Hall of Fame coin includes specifications for $5 gold, $1 silver, and half-dollar clad coins, with a design featuring a convex baseball on the reverse side and a concave obverse. The legislation for commemorative coins specifies details such as the type and number of coins authorized, legal tender status, numismatic value, and design requirements. It also includes language on words or dates to appear on the coin, instructions on how the design is chosen, time period for sale, mint location, quality of coins, sale price, bulk sales, prepaid orders, surcharges, and distribution of surcharges to recipient organizations. The legislation for commemorative coins specifies details such as the type and number of coins authorized, legal tender status, design requirements, and distribution of surcharges to recipient organizations. The Mint is required to recover its expenses before disbursing potential surcharges to designated organizations. All commemorative coin programs have operated at no cost to the taxpayer since 1997. The House and Senate Committees on Financial Services and Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs have jurisdiction over commemorative coin legislation. Senate rules require a minimum of 67 cosponsors for committee consideration of a commemorative coin bill. House rules for the 116th Congress do not specifically address committee consideration of commemorative coin legislation. The 116th Congress does not have specific rules for committee consideration of commemorative coin legislation. After authorization, the U.S. Treasury consults with the CCAC and CFA for coin design recommendations. The CCAC advises on themes, designs, and mintage levels for commemorative coins. The committee consists of 11 members appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The CCAC, consisting of 11 members appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury, meets several times a year to consider design suggestions for coins and medals. They provide advice on thematic, technical, and design issues related to coin production, with recommendations published on their website. Design aspects considered include those shown in Figure 1, with examples of U.S. Commemorative coins in Figure 2. The U.S. Mint presents design options to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) for approval. The CFA advises on the selection of artists and designs for commemorative coins, providing recommendations to the Mint. For example, in March 2016, the CFA recommended designs for the Boys Town Centennial Commemorative Coin program. The U.S. Mint works with the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) to finalize designs for commemorative coins. The CFA provides recommendations on designs and artists, with the Secretary of the Treasury making the final decision. Design competitions are sometimes held, like for the 2018 World War I Veterans and Breast Cancer Awareness coins. The process from authorization to coin launch takes around 56 to 60 weeks. The process from authorization to coin launch for commemorative coins can take longer than 56 to 60 weeks, especially if programs are authorized years in advance. The process involves setting surcharge amounts per coin, designating recipient organizations, and specifying how surcharges will be divided. The U.S. Marshals Service commemorative coin program designated four groups to receive distribution: U.S. Marshals Museum, National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association Foundation, and National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. The first $5 million was for the U.S. Marshals Museum, with additional surcharges divided equally among the other organizations. The CCRA sets standards for surcharge payments to be distributed to recipient organizations. The surcharge payments from the U.S. Marshals Service commemorative coin program are distributed to designated recipient organizations. Recipient organizations must raise funds from private sources equal to or greater than the surcharge proceeds, for specified purposes. The U.S. Mint recovers all operation costs, and recipient organizations must submit audited financial statements to show proper expenditure of surcharge proceeds. Further details on requirements are outlined in the U.S. Mint's guidance document. The U.S. Mint's commemorative coin program requires designated recipient groups to meet specific requirements before receiving surcharge payments. These include documenting funds raised from private sources and submitting a \"Schedule of Funds Raised From Private Sources.\" Once expenses are recouped, surcharges are disbursed to the recipient organization. Since 1982, over $506 million has been raised through surcharges. Production costs vary based on design, administrative costs, and metals used. The U.S. Mint calculates surcharges for commemorative coins based on design, administrative costs, and metals used. Issues for Congress to consider include choices for honoring people, places, events, or institutions, surcharge payments, and design elements for proposed coins. Institutional issues involve committee rules and limits on the number of commemorative coins minted per year. Since the restart of the commemorative coin program in 1982, popular programs have sold around 1 million coins on average. The 1986 U.S. Statue of Liberty coins were the best-selling with 15,491,169 coins, while the 1997 Franklin Delano Roosevelt gold $5 coin sold the fewest at 41,368. Commemorative coin legislation aims to honor individuals or events and provide surcharge funds to designated groups. Congress must prioritize which groups to honor each year, considering sales potential and funding for recipients. The commemorative coin legislation allows for the sale of coins to provide surcharges to designated recipient groups, even if the coins are less popular and may not sell out. Congress can choose to honor a person, place, event, or institution with a commemorative coin regardless of potential sales. The legislation also designates groups to receive surcharges from coin sales, with Members deciding whether to direct surcharges to a single group or multiple entities. The legislation allows for surcharges from coin sales to be directed to designated recipient groups, which must raise matching funds from private sources and undergo annual audits. Groups failing to raise sufficient funds may not receive full surcharge payments. The legislation specifies how surcharges can be used, with purposes often being broad. For example, the 1993 Thomas Jefferson Commemorative coin directed surcharges to the Jefferson Endowment Fund and the Corporation for. The legislation allows surcharges from coin sales to be directed to designated recipient groups like the Jefferson Endowment Fund and the Corporation for Jefferson's Poplar Forest. These funds are used for the restoration and maintenance of historic sites. Recipient groups must raise matching funds and undergo annual audits to ensure proper use of surcharge payments. The legislation allows surcharges from coin sales to be directed to designated recipient groups for restoration and maintenance of historic sites. Audits are required to ensure proper use of payments, with potential sanctions for misuse. Some commemorative coin authorizations require specific design elements as outlined in the authorizing legislation. The authorizing legislation for a commemorative coin may need to include specific design elements to ensure the Member's vision is incorporated, potentially limiting design choices and affecting costs. Senate rules do not have restrictions on considering commemorative coin legislation, but the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs has a rule requiring at least 67 Senators to cosponsor such legislation. The House Financial Services Committee does not have specific rules for considering commemorative coin legislation, but it has required a minimum number of cosponsors in the past. Committee rules can change from Congress to Congress, and if the House wants to impose requirements, the Committee could reinstate its previous rule. This could encourage bill sponsors to gather support among Representatives for a commemorative coin bill. The House Financial Services Committee does not have specific rules for considering commemorative coin legislation, but it has required a minimum number of cosponsors in the past. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs has a rule that imposes a formal qualification on the potential consideration of commemorative coin legislation. The possible path forward for a bill can be different within each chamber, and steps could be taken to formally codify the commemorative coin consideration process to make it easier for coin bills to meet minimum requirements for consideration. In 1996, Congress limited the U.S. Mint to issuing two coins per year starting in 1998 to address the proliferation of commemorative coins. Congress can amend the law to change the maximum number of coins minted annually. Reducing the number of coins would limit the groups or events commemorated and recipients aided by coin surcharges. This could potentially increase sales of authorized coins. Commemorative coins are popular for honoring people, places, and events. Congress can increase sales by limiting the number of coins issued annually, which would reduce competition among coin programs. However, authorizing more coins could lead to market saturation and decreased surcharge opportunities for designated recipient groups. In the modern era, commemorative coins are limited to two per year, with a wider range of subjects including women, historical events, and buildings. Surcharges are now used to direct funds to designated groups instead of selling coins to raise money. Congress is considering authorizing new coins to support specific recipient groups, aiming to maximize sales and support group activities. To maximize sales of commemorative coins and support recipient organizations, Congress should consider the broad appeal of the people, places, events, or institutions being commemorated. Design elements can be specified to make the coins more appealing to the general public. For example, the 1986 Statue of Liberty coin sold over 15 million units, while others sold as few as 40,000. The U.S. Mint's production costs must be recouped before payments can be made for commemorative coins. Congress has provided specific design requirements for coins, such as the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame coin being curved like a baseball. Unique design features may attract both coin collectors and noncollectors. The National Baseball Hall of Fame coin was popular due to its unique curved design and baseball theme, appealing to both collectors and noncollectors. Commemorative coins aim to honor individuals or events while generating funds for designated groups. Congress should consider innovative designs to attract a broad audience and raise significant funds. The coin program aims to create innovative designs to raise funds for designated groups. Congress should consider which subjects would be best for commemorative coins to ensure maximum sales and surcharge payments. Between 1892 and 1954, 60 commemorative coins were authorized by Congress. Between 1982 and 1997, 47 modern commemorative coins were authorized by Congress, listed by year of minting, subject, and authorization statute in Table B-1. Coin denominations are not specified as legislation allows for multiple denominations per series."
