It also outlines definitions, findings, powers of the Commission, reporting requirements, termination, and authorization of appropriations. The \"Guadalupe-Hidalgo Treaty Land Claims Act of 1997\" defines key terms such as Commission, Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, and eligible descendant. It specifies criteria for eligible descendants related to Mexican citizenship, community land grants, and becoming a US citizen within ten years of the treaty. The \"Guadalupe-Hidalgo Treaty Land Claims Act of 1997\" defines terms like community land grant as a village or town with land held in common by ten or more families under a grant from Spain or Mexico before specific dates. \"Reconstituted\" refers to restoring a valid community land grant to full municipality status. Congress recognizes New Mexico's unique history with Spanish and Mexican land grants, which have not been fully implemented according to the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. This has raised questions about land ownership in the state. Certain public lands in the State of New Mexico still exist, and Congress has used land claim commissions in the past to examine disputed land possession questions successfully. The Guadalupe-Hidalgo Treaty Land Claims Commission is established with three members appointed by the President. Members serve for the life of the Commission and receive compensation at the level V of the Executive Schedule. The Commission is tasked with examining land claims.

The Commission holds hearings where interested parties can participate, and it has the power to issue subpoenas for witness testimony. The Guadalupe-Hidalgo Treaty Land Claims Commission can issue subpoenas to compel witnesses to testify and produce evidence related to petitions. Failure to comply with a subpoena may result in a court order for testimony or evidence.
