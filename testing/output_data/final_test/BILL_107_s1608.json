    "content": "SECTION 1. WATER SECURITY GRANTS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator,\" \"eligible entity,\" and \"eligible project or activity,\" which includes addressing physical security needs like security staffing, intruder detection, and fencing. The Act outlines security measures for eligible entities, including fencing, gating, lighting, CCTV monitoring, rekeying doors, site maintenance for visibility, educational resources, and technical assistance programs. The Administrator will establish a program to allocate funds to States for granting to eligible entities. Funds will be allocated based on a formula described in the Safe Drinking Water Act. Large-scale projects with capital improvements or vulnerability assessments are excluded from eligibility. The Safe Drinking Water Act authorizes the allocation of funds to States for eligible entities to address immediate physical security needs. Eligible entities must submit an application to the State and agree to spend all grant funds by September 30 of the fiscal year. The Safe Drinking Water Act authorizes funds for States to address security needs. Grants must be used by eligible entities for projects. States must ensure funds are available for disadvantaged, small, and rural entities. In subsection (a)(3)(B)(vii), States must coordinate with rural water associations for training programs. $50,000,000 is authorized for this section for the fiscal year of enactment. The Senate passed S. 1608 on December 20, 2001, establishing a grant program for drinking water and wastewater facilities to address immediate security needs."
