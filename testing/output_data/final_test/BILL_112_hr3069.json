    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act\". It includes findings related to the protection of endangered salmon and fisheries. The Congress acknowledges the importance of restoring healthy salmon and steelhead runs in the lower Columbia River, which are vital to the region's culture and economy. The Columbia River treaty tribes have significant rights regarding these species, and efforts have been made by governments to assist in their recovery. One of the challenges facing salmonid populations is increased predation by marine mammals like California sea lions. The population of California sea lions has increased 6-fold over the last 3 decades, with more than 1,000 sea lions foraging in the lower Columbia River. The percentage of spring salmonid run eaten by sea lions at Bonneville Dam has increased 7-fold since 2002, with sea lions entering fish ladders. The increased population of California sea lions in the lower Columbia River has led to a significant impact on the spring salmonid run at Bonneville Dam. Efforts to deter sea lion behavior have been ineffective, prompting the need for urgent measures to protect threatened and endangered salmonids in the area. On December 21, 2010, the Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force recommended removing more California sea lions in 2011. In August 2011, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho requested lethal removal of sea lions impacting salmon recovery. The National Marine Fisheries Service accepted the application for sea lion removal on September 12, 2011. The Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force will consider States' application for permits under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to address concerns about pinniped predation impacting fish stocks other than salmonids. Testimony from State and tribal witnesses highlighted the need for timely action due to low levels of fish abundance. The Act restricted control of predatory pinnipeds' impact to endangered salmonids only. SEC. 3. Taking of sea lions on the Columbia River and its tributaries to protect endangered and threatened species of salmon and other nonlisted fish species. Section 120 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act is amended to allow the Secretary to issue permits for the lethal removal of sea lions in the Columbia River and its tributaries to protect endangered and threatened salmon species. An eligible entity can apply for a permit from the Secretary to lethally remove sea lions in the Columbia River to protect endangered salmon. The permit must be approved or denied within 30 days and is valid for up to one year, with a limit of 10 sea lions that can be taken. The permit allows for the removal of sea lions in the Columbia River to protect endangered salmon, with a limit of one percent of the annual potential biological removal level. Delegation of permit authority is permitted, and NEPA requirements are waived for permits issued within a 5-year period. Permitting authority can be suspended. The permit allows for the removal of sea lions in the Columbia River to protect endangered salmon. The Secretary may suspend permitting authority if lethal removal is no longer necessary. Eligible entities include various states and tribes. The Congress emphasizes the importance of preventing sea lion predation, recovering salmon stocks, and avoiding future fish stock listings in the Columbia River. Permit holders authorized for lethal removal should receive wildlife management training. The Federal Government should continue funding both lethal and nonlethal measures to prevent predation. Additionally, the Act does not impact any treaty or rights of federally recognized Indian tribes."
