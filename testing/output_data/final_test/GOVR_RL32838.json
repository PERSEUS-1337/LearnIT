    "content": "The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, has a 1.5 million acre Coastal Plain seen as a potential oil and gas prospect. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated a 95% chance of economically recovering 5.0 billion bbl or more of oil, with a mean estimate of 7.3 billion bbl. The federal land in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) could potentially hold as much economically recoverable oil as the Prudhoe Bay field. The area is home to a diverse range of plants and animals, including caribou, polar bears, grizzly bears, wolves, migratory birds, and whales. Some have referred to the region as \"America's Serengeti.\" The Refuge and neighboring parks in Canada have been proposed for an international park, with several species protected by international treaties. Congressional actions on the issue have been discussed, particularly in recent years. The history of congressional actions on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) since the 108th Congress is discussed, focusing on the dilemma of opening the area for oil and gas development or protecting its ecosystem. Factors determining the area's fate, potential damages, special management legislation, and federal agency involvement are considered. If Congress takes no action, the Refuge remains closed to energy development as per Section 1003 of P.L. 96-487. Basic information on the Refuge can be found on the FWS website. The controversy surrounding the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) includes arguments for and against development, with various organizations supporting or opposing it. The energy and biological resources of northern Alaska have been a source of debate for decades, with issues ranging from oil spills to efforts to use ANWR resources to address energy needs or balance the federal budget. Maps showing existing oil development areas can be found online. In 1957, DOI announced plans to create the Arctic National Wildlife Range in northeastern Alaska. The area was officially reserved in 1960, and in 1971, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act resolved Native aboriginal land claims. Village Corporations received the surface estate to approximately 22 million acres of lands in Alaska. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) granted Village Corporations the right to choose the surface estate in a certain amount of lands within the National Wildlife Refuge System. Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation (KIC) received rights to three townships along the coast of the Refuge. ANCSA also created Regional Corporations with the ability to select subsurface rights to some lands and full title to others. In 1980, Congress enacted the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) to further regulate land use in the area. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA, P.L. 96-487 , 94 Stat. 2371) renamed the Arctic Range to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, expanding it by 9.2 million acres. Section 702(3) designated much of the original range as a wilderness area, excluding the coastal plain. ANILCA directed a study of the Coastal Plain (referred to as the 1002 area) to be completed within five years and nine months. Section 1003 prohibited oil and gas development in the area. In the 1990s, there were attempts to authorize opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to energy development, but they were vetoed. Bills were introduced in the 106th Congress to designate the 1002 area of the Refuge as wilderness or open it to energy development. Revenue assumptions about ANWR were included in the FY2001 budget resolution reported by the Senate Budget Committee. The budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 101) reported by the Senate Budget Committee on March 31, 2000 included language to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to development. Despite attempts to remove this language, it was rejected by conferees. Subsequent bills and motions in Congress related to ANWR development were introduced, but only three recorded votes occurred from the 101st through 106th Congresses, all in the Senate. In the 107th Congress, H.R. 4, an energy bill with ANWR development provisions, passed the House on August 2, 2001. The bill included a provision to open ANWR to exploration and development, with an amendment limiting surface development to 2,000 acres passing the previous day. In the 107th Congress, H.R. 4, an energy bill with ANWR development provisions, passed the House on August 2, 2001. The House appointed conferees on June 12, 2002. In the Senate, a cloture motion was filed on an amendment including ANWR development title in H.R. 4, but failed to invoke cloture on December 3, 2001. Instead, cloture was invoked on the underlying amendment. In the 107th Congress, H.R. 4, an energy bill with ANWR development provisions, passed the House on August 2, 2001. The Senate's presiding officer sustained a point of order against the Lott amendment, deeming it not germane to the underlying amendment on pension reform. The next Senate consideration was S. 517, an energy technology development bill. Senator Daschle offered an omnibus energy bill amendment, while Senators Murkowski and Stevens proposed amendments to develop the Refuge on April 16. Key differences included a requirement for a presidential determination. In the 107th Congress, H.R. 4, an energy bill with ANWR development provisions, passed the House on August 2, 2001. The Senate essentially voted to prevent drilling for oil and gas in the Refuge on April 18, with a cloture motion to block a threatened filibuster on Senator Murkowski's amendment to S. 517. The Senate then passed S. 517 on April 25, 2002, after substituting it for the House-passed H.R. 4. Conferees attempted to iron out the differences between the two versions. In the 107th Congress, H.R. 4, an energy bill with ANWR development provisions, passed the House on August 2, 2001. The Senate voted against drilling in the Refuge on April 18, with a cloture motion to block a filibuster on Senator Murkowski's amendment to S. 517. Conferees tried to resolve differences between the two versions, but no agreement was reached, and H.R. 4 died at the end of the 107th Congress. Work on FY2003 Appropriations for Interior and Related Agencies began in the 107th Congress but was completed in the 108th Congress. The FY2003 funding bill did not include funds for potential energy development in ANWR. ANILCA prohibited oil and gas production without Congressional authorization. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not have the same prohibition as the House. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution did not agree with the House proposal on funding for BLM energy and minerals program, potentially allowing funds for preliminary work in ANWR. During the 108th Congress, proponents of ANWR development sought to advance legislation through the FY2004 budget reconciliation process to avoid a Senate filibuster. The House passed the FY2004 budget resolution with reconciliation instructions for reductions, without specifying the source of savings. ANWR development language could have been considered as part of a reconciliation measure to achieve savings. The Senate Budget Committee directed the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to report a reconciliation bill by May 1, 2003, to decrease outlays by $2.15 billion for fiscal years 2004 through 2013. Senator Boxer's amendment to remove a provision related to opening ANWR passed, leading to the acceptance of the amended Senate version by both House and Senate. This prevented legislation authorizing the opening of ANWR from being eligible for consideration. The House passed H.R. 6, a comprehensive energy bill, on April 11, 2003, which included Division C, Title IV opening the 1002 area to energy development. The House also passed the Wilson (NM) amendment to limit certain development features to 2,000 acres. An amendment to strike the title was defeated. H.R. 4514, identical to the House version of H.R. 6 except for one provision on revenue disposition, was defeated in a vote. Several bills were introduced regarding the 1002 area, including one to open it for development and two to designate it as wilderness. The Senate initially had no provision to open the Refuge, but eventually substituted the language of a previous bill for that of the House-passed H.R. 6. The unusual procedure of passing H.R. 6 led to differences between the House and Senate versions, particularly regarding ANWR development language. The conference committee ultimately removed ANWR development features from the final bill, which was approved by the House but failed a cloture vote in the Senate. In the second session of the 109th Congress, the Senate focused on a more narrowly focused energy bill (S. 2095) that did not include ANWR development provisions. The President's proposed FY2005 budget assumed legislation would open the Refuge for development to generate revenues. The Refuge debate took two legislative routes in the Congress: budget resolutions and reconciliation bills. In the second session of the 109th Congress, the Senate focused on energy bills, including S. 2095 without ANWR development provisions. The budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 18) included instructions to reduce outlays and assumed legislation to open ANWR for development. In the second session of the 109th Congress, the Senate focused on energy bills, including S. 2095 without ANWR development provisions. The budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 18) included instructions to reduce outlays and assumed legislation to open ANWR for development. Senator Cantwell offered an amendment to remove instructions for ANWR development, but it was defeated. The House and Senate approved a conference agreement containing reductions in spending targets that relied on ANWR development legislation for achievement. The Senate included ANWR development legislation in a reconciliation bill to meet budget targets. Procedural questions arose regarding the inclusion of ANWR in the bill. The House also included ANWR legislation in their budget proposal. The House Budget Committee incorporated measures into an omnibus reconciliation bill (H.R. 4241) to meet budget targets. Opposition to the ANWR provision led to its removal before the bill passed the House. The final conference report (H.Rept. 109-362) did not include ANWR development provisions, and the President signed the measure into law on February 8, 2006 (P.L. 109-171). The Senate passed the FY2007 budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 83) on March 16, 2006. The Senate passed the FY2007 budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 83) on March 16, 2006, with a reconciliation instruction to reduce budget authority related to ANWR development. The House did not include this instruction in its budget resolution. Senator Stevens later added an ANWR development title to the FY2006 Defense appropriations bill (H.R. 2863) as Congress moved towards the December recess. Senator Stevens added an ANWR development title to the \"must-pass\" FY2006 Defense appropriations bill (H.R. 2863) during conference. Senators opposing Refuge development faced a choice between filibuster or acquiescing to opening the Refuge. A cloture motion failed, and relevant Divisions C and D were removed through House and Senate passage of S.Con.Res. 74. The House Resources Committee approved provisions, including an ANWR development title, which were incorporated into the House version of H.R. 6. The House passed H.R. 6 on April 21, and the Senate passed its version on June 28, 2005. The final measure (P.L. 109-58) omitted the ANWR title. In May 2006, the House passed H.R. 5429 to open ANWR to development, but the Senate did not take up the bill. The President's FY2008 budget proposed legislation to open the Coastal Plain to oil and gas exploration, with the first lease sale proposed for FY2009. The proposal for the first lease sale in ANWR in FY2009 aimed to generate $7.0 billion in revenues over five years, split between the U.S. Treasury and Alaska. Efforts to assume ANWR revenues in the budget resolution were rejected in the House and Senate in 2008. Interest in opening ANWR for energy development increased due to rising gasoline prices. In the 112th Congress, efforts to open the Coastal Plain of ANWR to development were introduced, but interest waned due to falling energy prices. House consideration of ANWR legislation was complex, with a special rule specifying the process for considering oil drilling proposals. In the 112th Congress, efforts to open the Coastal Plain of ANWR to development were introduced, but interest waned due to falling energy prices. House consideration of ANWR legislation was complex, with a special rule specifying the process for considering oil drilling proposals. The House passed H.R. 3408, which included provisions on ANWR development, but did not transmit it to the Senate for action. H.Res. 547 outlined the House's consideration of H.R. 3813 and H.R. 7, with potential incorporation of provisions into H.R. 7 for Senate transmission. However, the House did not take up H.R. 3813 or H.R. 7 as specified. The House did not take up H.R. 3813 or H.R. 7 under H.Res. 547. H.R. 3408, including ANWR development provisions, did not progress. The Senate rejected S.Amdt. 1826 for Coastal Plain drilling. Obama Administration issued a CCP for the Refuge, focusing on designating the Coastal Plain as wilderness, requiring Congressional legislation and Presidential approval. Legislative efforts were made to prevent the implementation of the Comprehensive Conservation Plan (CCP) for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The House approved amendments to prohibit the use of funds for the CCP in both H.R. 2822 and H.R. 5538. Additionally, a failed amendment was proposed to designate the Coastal Plain as wilderness during consideration of H.R. 2406. The House rejected H.Amdt. 961 to designate the Coastal Plain as wilderness during the 114th Congress. On-site research on oil resources in the 1002 area has not been conducted since the mid-1980s due to development restrictions. Some new interpretations have been made from older data and exploration results from nearby tracts. Relevant CRS reports include Budget Reconciliation Legislation, The Budget Reconciliation Process, and Budget Resolution Enforcement. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports related to oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), including budget resolution enforcement, energy efficiency, legal issues, legislative maps, infrastructure, leasing limits, congressional budget process, presidential authority for national monument designation, and more.
