    "content": "The Act titled \"Promoting Life-Saving New Therapies for Neonates Act of 2015\" encourages the development of safe and effective therapies for neonates by providing exclusivity to incentivize their development. The Act \"Promoting Life-Saving New Therapies for Neonates Act of 2015\" defines neonatal drugs as those for treating neonatal diseases, with specific criteria for neonatal drug applications. The Act \"Promoting Life-Saving New Therapies for Neonates Act of 2015\" outlines criteria for neonatal drug applications, including eligibility for a neonatal drug exclusivity voucher based on clinical data from neonatal studies. The \"Promoting Life-Saving New Therapies for Neonates Act of 2015\" defines a neonatal drug exclusivity voucher as granting a one-year extension of patents and marketing exclusivities for a single human drug or biologic product. The \"Promoting Life-Saving New Therapies for Neonates Act of 2015\" awards a neonatal drug exclusivity voucher to the sponsor of a neonatal drug application upon approval by the Secretary. This voucher can be transferred to a sponsor of a human drug application under certain conditions. The neonatal exclusivity voucher, awarded under the \"Promoting Life-Saving New Therapies for Neonates Act of 2015,\" can be transferred under specific conditions, but not to a drug with expired patents or exclusivities. The new owner must notify the Secretary within 30 days of the transfer, and no additional fees can be applied for using the voucher. The Secretary can revoke a neonatal exclusivity voucher if the drug is not marketed in the US within 365 days of approval. No voucher can be awarded for a previously approved application. The Secretary can revoke a neonatal exclusivity voucher if the drug is not marketed in the US within 365 days of approval. Vouchers cannot be awarded for previously approved applications. Neonatal exclusivity vouchers are limited to drugs not required to complete neonatal studies under section 505B. Sponsors cannot combine vouchers for products they intend to use other vouchers on. Sponsors must notify their intent to use a voucher awarded or transferred under this section. The Secretary must be notified 15 months before the loss of patent and exclusivities on the drug for which the voucher will be redeemed. Within 30 days of notification, the Secretary will confirm the sponsor's eligibility to redeem the voucher for the intended drug. The Secretary, in consultation with various stakeholders, will establish a Priority List of Critical Needs for Neonates within one year of the enactment of the Promoting Life-Saving legislation. The Secretary will develop a Priority List of Critical Needs for Neonates within one year of the legislation's enactment. This list will focus on research priorities for diseases common in neonates, issue guidance for the neonatal drug exclusivity voucher program, and support neonatal drug applications. Public input will be sought before finalizing the list. The Secretary may update the Priority List of Critical Needs for Neonates every 3 years or as needed. No disease can be removed from the list until a study and report are completed. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the effectiveness of the program for developing drugs to treat and prevent diseases in neonates. The study will examine the number of neonatal drug vouchers awarded and the indications for each drug approved under the Public Health Service Act. The study will assess the effectiveness of the program for developing drugs for neonates under the Public Health Service Act, including the approval of drugs with indications for neonates and the use of neonatal exclusivity vouchers. The Comptroller General will submit a report to the Senate and House committees on the effectiveness of the program for developing drugs for neonates, including the use of neonatal exclusivity vouchers."
