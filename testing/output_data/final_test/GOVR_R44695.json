    "content": "The defense acquisition workforce at the Department of Defense manages the planning, design, development, testing, contracting, production, logistics support, and disposal of military systems and equipment. They ensure that DOD's contract dollars are properly spent and that acquisition programs stay within cost and delivery schedules. In FY2015, DOD obligated $438 billion on federal contracts, comprising 62% of government-wide obligations. Adequate acquisition professionals are necessary to fulfill these duties. The defense acquisition workforce at the Department of Defense manages the planning, design, development, testing, contracting, production, logistics support, and disposal of military systems and equipment. In FY2015, DOD obligated $438 billion on federal contracts. To support these duties, the acquisition workforce must have an adequate number of professionals with technical skills. Concerns exist regarding the workforce's size and skills, with calls for improved recruiting, training, and incentives for comprehensive acquisition reform. As of March 31, 2016, the defense acquisition workforce consisted of 158,212 employees, with a significant growth between FY2008 and FY2015. The Department of Defense's acquisition workforce saw a significant increase in employees between FY2008 and FY2015, with a growth initiative launched in FY2009 to address workforce imbalances. Hiring flexibilities were utilized to rebuild the workforce's size and capability, offering tools to simplify and expedite the federal hiring process. Hiring flexibilities in the Department of Defense's acquisition workforce vary in structure and function to meet evolving recruitment needs. Flexibilities include hiring exemptions, agency control in the hiring process, and differences in scope, coverage, length, authorization, and service. There are 38 hiring flexibilities applicable, with 6 frequently used according to DOD. The Department of Defense's acquisition workforce utilizes various hiring flexibilities to meet recruitment needs. Six hiring flexibilities were frequently used between FY2008 and FY2014, including Direct-hire authority, Expedited hiring authority, Pathways programs, and Delegated examining authority. These flexibilities allow agencies to appoint individuals directly to positions without certain competitive hiring requirements. The Department of Defense's acquisition workforce utilizes Direct-hire authority to accelerate job offers by waiving competitive hiring requirements for positions with severe candidate shortages or critical hiring needs. DHAs can be established independently by OPM or upon agency request, with OPM determining the application and duration of the authority. DHAs authorized by statute operate similarly to OPM direct-hire but differ in three primary ways: 1. Agencies do not need OPM approval and do not have to demonstrate a severe shortage of candidates. 2. The authorities exempt agencies from a broader set of competitive hiring requirements. 3. The authorities often apply to a specific department or agency and rarely apply government-wide. For example, the NDAA for FY2016 authorized a DHA for military departments to appoint individuals with scientific and engineering degrees without competitive hiring requirements. The Enhanced Hiring Authority (EHA) for defense acquisition positions was first authorized by the NDAA for FY2009. It allows DOD to use OPM-direct hire to fill positions with critical hiring needs identified by the Secretary of Defense. The EHA has been expanded over time to include all qualified individuals and positions with critical hiring needs. In 2015, Congress made the EHA a permanent authority. The Pathways Recent Graduates and Internship programs aim to recruit high-performing individuals into the federal government. The Pathways programs aim to recruit high-performing individuals into the federal government by temporarily appointing them to agency positions and providing job-related training. Participants can be noncompetitively converted to permanent federal positions upon program completion. The programs were based on the Federal Career Intern Program, which was terminated in 2011 due to violations of veterans' preference and public notice laws. Positions under the Pathways programs are filled using an excepted service hiring authority. The Pathways programs recruit high-performing individuals into the federal government through excepted service hiring authority, providing flexibility for DOD in hiring for acquisition positions. This allows DOD to restrict eligibility, evaluate qualifications based on education, and use streamlined recruitment procedures. Delegated examining authority is the standard for competitive federal hiring, while Pathways programs offer a more flexible approach. Delegated examining authority is a flexibility that allows agencies to administer federal hiring for competitive service positions. It is available to any agency that enters into an agreement with OPM, but OPM can terminate the agreement at any time. DOD utilized six hiring flexibilities for civilian acquisition hires between FY2008 and FY2014. Between FY2008 and FY2014, DOD utilized six hiring flexibilities for civilian acquisition hires, with approximately 66% of external hires made under these flexibilities. The remaining 34% were made through other competitive and noncompetitive procedures. The EHA flexibility was the most frequently used, accounting for 17,699 external civilian acquisition hires over six years. In FY2010, it accounted for the largest number of hires in a single year among the six flexibilities. The FCIP was the second most used, with 13,574 hires over the same period. Despite being eliminated in 2011, the FCIP was the second most used flexibility. During a six-year period, DHAs and the two Pathways programs were the least utilized flexibilities for external civilian hiring. DHAs only accounted for 1,429 hires, while the Pathways programs had 878 hires between FY2012 and FY2014. Delegated examining authority had the highest number of external civilian acquisition hires at 3,040, surpassing DHAs and Pathways combined during the same time frame. During FY2008 to FY2014, external civilian hires under six flexibilities increased from 4,607 to 10,928 in FY2010, then declined to 3,391 in FY2013 before rising slightly to 3,848 in FY2014. Factors influencing this trend include the acquisition workforce growth initiative, where DOD exceeded its goal of adding 20,000 personnel by FY2010, and sequestration budget cuts. The flexibility hiring trend declined from FY2010 to FY2013, possibly due to sequestration budget cuts and civilian hiring freezes. However, there was a slight uptick in flexibility hiring in FY2014 as sequestration effects waned and certain hiring freezes were lifted. The overall civilian defense acquisition workforce decreased between FY2012 and FY2014, with workforce losses outpacing growth in FY2013 and FY2014. The uptick in flexibility hiring from FY2013 to FY2014 reflects DOD's efforts to address staffing shortfalls in certain acquisition career fields. A 2015 GAO report found that DOD did not meet growth targets for six acquisition career fields critical to reshaping the workforce. Notable patterns in individual flexibility use during the six-year period were observed, including a surge in external civilian acquisition hires between FY2009 and FY2010. The use of flexibilities in civilian acquisition hires varied between FY2009 and FY2014. The Expanded Hiring Authority (EHA) saw a decrease in use due to its expansion in FY2009. The Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP) experienced a significant decrease in hires from 3,875 to 1,104 between FY2010 and FY2011, leading to its termination. Direct Hiring Authorities (DHAs) saw an increase in use, with the largest jump occurring between FY2013 and FY2014. These trends reflect DOD's efforts to address staffing shortages in critical acquisition career fields. The use of flexibilities in civilian acquisition hires varied between FY2009 and FY2014, with increases in Direct Hiring Authorities (DHAs) reflecting a rising number of available positions. Congress authorized two new DHAs for DOD Science and Technology Reinvention Laboratories in 2013. Data from DOD on average time to hire between FY2008 and FY2014 for hiring flexibilities shows no discernible trends in time to hire. The use of flexibilities in civilian acquisition hires varied between FY2009 and FY2014, with no discernible time to hire trends across different flexibilities. Delegated examining authority did not meet the 80-day hiring timeline, while the EHA met it in FY2009 but slowed down in subsequent years. The Pathways Internship program consistently met the 80-day timeline, while the Pathways Recent Graduates program consistently missed it. The Pathways Recent Graduates program consistently missed the 80-day timeline between FY2013-FY2014. DOD began implementing these programs in 2012, with hires under the Internship program in FY2012. DHAs did not meet the timeline but were within five days of it for three consecutive years\u2014FY2009 to FY2011. Factors contributing to hiring fluctuations are discussed below, including the impact of hiring exemptions on faster hiring. According to a 2001 MSPB report, agency supervisors estimated that rating and ranking took an average of 21 days to complete under merit promotion\u2014the second most time consuming hiring procedure identified in the report. Hiring was faster under the Pathways Internship program compared to the EHA and DHA between FY2012 and FY2014 due to exemptions such as simplified job announcements and agency-developed qualification standards. The Pathways programs were first implemented in FY2012, potentially affecting time to hire. Hiring flexibilities like delegated examining authority aim for fair competition but can still speed up hiring. Agencies found delegated examining led to faster hiring than OPM's centralized system. Time to hire varies by DOD component based on their interpretation of governing laws, providing discretion for implementation procedures and hiring exemptions. DOD components have varying internal hiring procedures that impact time to hire, with different interpretations of governing laws. This discretion allows for unique policies and procedures, such as varying interview processes and candidate selection methods. Congressional reforms to the defense acquisition system raise policy questions. The policy questions regarding hiring flexibilities for the civilian defense acquisition workforce include whether these flexibilities are improving the workforce, if the DOD has the right number and type of flexibilities, and what factors impact their effective use. It is crucial to determine if these flexibilities are effectively recruiting high-quality professionals with the right skills in a timely manner, and accurate data on their use is essential for assessing their effectiveness. The limitations of DOD's usage data on civilian acquisition hires are due to counting discrepancies and lack of hiring codes for individual flexibilities. Some argue that the current number and structure of flexibilities are sufficient, as DOD has exceeded its workforce growth goal and should focus on retention of talent through other tools. Flexibilities have been expanded over time to cover a broad range of acquisition positions. The EHA has been expanded to cover more acquisition positions, but some flexibilities are underutilized. DOD officials acknowledge that IPA and HQE authorities are not fully utilized. A 2016 GAO report found that a small number of hiring flexibilities accounted for the majority of new hires government-wide. Staffing shortfalls in critical acquisition career fields may indicate the need for additional flexibilities. The acquisition workforce faces challenges in hiring qualified personnel, particularly in critical fields like contracting, engineering, and business. Difficulty in recruiting talent from certain populations, such as students and recent graduates, has been reported. The lack of direct hire authority for these groups creates hiring challenges at campus recruiting events. Proposed legislation aims to create a direct hire authority for post-secondary students and recent college graduates to address these issues. The defense acquisition workforce faces challenges in hiring qualified personnel, with factors like flexibility structure and budgetary constraints affecting their effectiveness. Flexibilities for defense acquisition positions may have narrow eligibility criteria, impacting their use. Budget cuts and workforce reductions by DOD also influence flexibility utilization. The defense acquisition workforce has faced challenges in hiring qualified personnel due to budget constraints and the need to meet workforce reduction goals. Flexibilities in hiring practices have evolved over time to meet the changing needs of the Department of Defense, with some flexibilities becoming less necessary as new ones are established. For example, the elimination of 33 HQEs in 2011 was part of a cost-saving initiative, and the use of individual flexibilities has fluctuated to meet acquisition workforce growth goals. The EHA and Pathways programs have largely superseded previous flexibilities in the defense acquisition workforce. Limited knowledge and unclear implementation guidance on flexibilities have led to challenges in hiring practices within the Department of Defense. Some DOD acquisition officials face challenges in using flexibilities due to unclear guidance on veterans' preference application. Balancing hiring speed with equity is important, as traditional competitive hiring ensures fair consideration of all qualified candidates. Congress may consider expanding, consolidating, or restructuring hiring flexibilities to improve the civilian acquisition workforce. Comprehensive data on the use of flexibilities is crucial for assessing their effectiveness, but currently not publicly available. Congress could direct DOD to report on the total number of civilian acquisition hires made under all available flexibilities. DOD could develop an internal system to track the use of hiring flexibilities for civilian acquisition positions. Congress may also require reporting on additional metrics to assess the effectiveness of flexibilities in improving the acquisition workforce, such as recruitment power and quality of personnel hired. This could help determine if flexibilities speed up the hiring process for candidates. Tracking the time from vacancy announcement to job offer can determine if flexibilities speed up the hiring process for candidates, focusing on procedures that affect waiting time. Currently, DOD measures time to hire from the agency's perspective, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of flexibilities in expediting job offers from the candidate's view. Tracking the number of first choice candidates who accept job offers may provide insight into the impact of flexibilities on hiring. Accepting a job offer for an acquisition position can determine the effectiveness of flexibilities in minimizing talent loss. For example, higher acceptance rates under certain hiring exemptions may indicate their impact on candidate decisions. DOD components are not required to routinely report on job acceptances under flexibilities. DOD has certifications for defense acquisition workforce positions. The effectiveness of flexibilities in recruiting high-quality acquisition personnel can be assessed by tracking metrics related to DAWIA certifications. These metrics include the number of employees hired under flexibilities eligible for DAWIA certification, the number who earn certification within 24 months, and the time taken to earn certification. Retention and career progression rates under flexibilities can also indicate if they attract professionals who stay longer and gain expertise faster. The effectiveness of flexibilities in recruiting high-quality acquisition personnel can be assessed by tracking metrics related to DAWIA certifications. Congress might consider directing a study on the overall effectiveness of flexibilities in improving the civilian acquisition workforce. Results from the study could help determine whether flexibilities should be expanded, consolidated, or removed. A 2015 GAO report identified six acquisition career fields that are below planned growth levels, including contracting, business, and engineering. Congress could direct DOD to clarify and align guidance for hiring flexibilities to improve workforce effectiveness. The DOD could improve workforce effectiveness by providing mandatory training, conducting periodic reviews, and offering technical assistance for proper interpretation of department-level implementing guidance for flexibilities. DOD has taken steps to improve recruitment through hiring flexibilities for the civilian defense acquisition workforce, including updating department-level guidance in 2015. Congress may also want to consider other workforce improvement efforts, such as retention strategies. Congress may want to consider retention strategies for acquisition personnel, as high attrition rates have led to shortages in certain career fields. Pay flexibilities and AcqDemo are efforts by Congress and DOD to increase retention, providing additional compensation and targeted incentives for high-attrition fields. The Department of Defense (DOD) officials highlighted the need to expand retention incentives to employees likely to leave the current organization. Congress authorized pay flexibilities for the defense acquisition workforce, allowing certain personnel to be paid up to 150% above the basic pay rate. AcqDemo, an alternative personnel system, features consolidated pay bands and a contribution-based performance management system to improve retention rates. The 2014 RAND report found higher retention rates among AcqDemo employees compared to those under the GS system. Congress and DOD have expanded AcqDemo, increasing participation to 120,000 employees and extending operation to December 31, 2020. The NDAA for FY2017 proposed changing AcqDemo to a permanent, DOD-controlled system. Hiring flexibilities are available for the civilian defense acquisition workforce."
