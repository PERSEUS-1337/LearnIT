    "content": "The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the 1985 Supplementary Treaty to the 1972 extradition treaty between Great Britain and the United States, which limits the political offense bar to extradition and allows for judicial inquiry into extradition requests. A new extradition treaty was signed in 2003 by Attorney General John Ashcroft and UK Home Secretary David Blunkett, with the Senate giving its advice and consent in 2006. The 2003 Treaty allows federal courts to reject extradition requests that do not meet its requirements, does not force the US to violate the Constitution, and excludes prosecution for offenses covered by the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. It also advises the Secretary of State to carefully consider extradition requests for previously acquitted individuals and mandates annual reports on extradition requests under the Treaty. Extradition is the formal process of one country surrendering a person to another for criminal prosecution. Extradition is the formal process of one country surrendering a person to another country for criminal prosecution. The United States has extradition treaties with most countries, including Great Britain. The 2003 Treaty addressed difficulties with the political offense exception in the 1977 Treaty, allowing for extradition in certain circumstances. The 1985 Supplementary Treaty between the United States and Great Britain limited the political offense exception in extradition cases, extended provisional arrest duration, and made changes retroactively applicable. The most contentious issue was the exemptions to the political offense exception for crimes of violence. Critics argued that the 1985 Supplementary Treaty between the United States and Great Britain, which limited the political offense exception in extradition cases, did not threaten civil liberties. They suggested addressing adjustments in the political offense exception uniformly in statute rather than on a treaty-by-treaty basis. Opponents also protested the elimination of the statute of limitations defense to any British request and retroactive alterations made by the treaty. The Administration and the British Government reached a compromise on the 1985 Supplementary Treaty, limiting the political offense exception in extradition cases. The treaty also allows a defense to extradition for terrorists based on race, religion, nationality, or political opinions, with appellate review. Federal courts can deny extradition without probable cause. The 1985 Supplementary Treaty limits the political offense exception in extradition cases and allows a defense for terrorists based on certain criteria. Federal courts can deny extradition without probable cause. Some individuals involved in extradition cases returned to Ireland, were extradited, or deported. Commentary on the treaty and related cases varies depending on the focus, such as terrorism or foreign judicial systems. Conditions in Northern Ireland related to the extradition controversy have somewhat improved under the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. The extradition controversy has improved under the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, with released detainees and revised extradition treaties with other nations. These treaties generally allow extradition for violent crimes against a head of state or crimes covered by extradition treaties. Some treaties have exemptions to the political offense bar similar to the Supplementary Treaty. The Extradition Treaty with various countries includes provisions allowing refusal of extradition if the request is deemed politically motivated. Critics of the 2003 Treaty argue that it eliminates the political offense exception for crimes involving violence or weapons. The 2003 Extradition Treaty eliminates key protections, such as allowing extradition even without violating U.S. federal law, removing the need for evidence of guilt, enabling provisional arrest, asset seizure, and retroactive application. The 2003 Extradition Treaty eliminates key protections, allowing extradition without violating U.S. federal law, removing the need for evidence of guilt, enabling provisional arrest, asset seizure, and retroactive application. The Senate's approval of the treaty reflects concerns over objections related to violence or weapons offenses, including solicitation, conspiracy, or attempt to commit such crimes. The political offense exception is grounded on the belief in individuals' right to resort to political activism for political change. The political offense exception allows individuals, especially unsuccessful rebels, to avoid unfair trials and punishments in their home countries due to their political beliefs. It also upholds the principle of non-intervention in other nations' internal political conflicts. The challenge lies in defining the scope of the exception, particularly regarding protection for fleeing insurgents involved in acts of violence against the government they oppose. United States courts have interpreted the exception to cover crimes committed in furtherance of rebellion or political disturbance. The political offense exception allows individuals to avoid unfair trials in their home countries due to political beliefs. The 2003 Treaty expands exemptions from the political offense exception, stating extradition shall not be granted for political offenses. The 2003 Treaty expands exemptions from the political offense exception for extradition, including offenses such as murder, kidnapping, possession of explosive devices, and conspiracy to commit crimes. The 2003 Treaty includes exemptions from the political offense exception for extradition, covering offenses like murder, kidnapping, possession of explosives, and conspiracy. The new head of state exemption may have a wider reach depending on interpretations of \"family\" and accessory definitions. It could apply to those who assist in political offenses like harboring or aiding assassins, expanding the scope of the treaty. The 2003 Treaty expands the scope of extradition by including exemptions for offenses like murder, kidnapping, possession of explosives, and conspiracy. The new head of state exemption could apply to those who assist in political offenses, broadening the treaty's reach. The Senate's response to the treaty amendments includes concerns about the removal of judicial oversight and the potential expansion of offenses covered under the extradition process. The 2003 Treaty expands extradition scope by including exemptions for serious offenses like murder, kidnapping, and possession of explosives. It transfers the responsibility of determining politically-motivated requests from courts to the executive, which may raise concerns about fairness. The treaty removes judicial oversight and broadens the offenses covered, sparking Senate concerns. The Supplementary Treaty includes provisions to prevent extradition based on trumped-up charges or improperly motivated requests. It allows courts to deny extradition if there is evidence of unfair treatment or prejudice towards the individual sought for extradition. The Supplementary Treaty includes provisions to prevent extradition based on unfair treatment or prejudice towards the individual sought for extradition. Article 3(a) allows individuals to challenge the fairness of the judicial system they would be returned to based on race, religion, nationality, or political opinion. Senator Kerry raised a question during a business meeting regarding this article. The Supplementary Treaty includes provisions to prevent extradition based on unfair treatment or prejudice towards the individual sought for extradition. Article 3(b) limits the scope of Article 3(a) in U.S. extradition proceedings to offenses listed in the treaty and allows either party to appeal a finding under Article 3(a). The 2003 Treaty removes the improper motivation clause, leaving only political motives suspect and expressly removing the issue from the courts. The 2003 Treaty's repeal of judicial authority in extradition requests aligns with diplomatic and judicial treatment of the issue. The Senate's emphasis on initial judicial determination for extradition requests and disclaiming any intent to reopen the Good Friday Agreement. The Supplementary Treaty's probable cause article reinforces the benefits of the treaty. The Senate Executive Report highlights changes made to the Supplementary Treaty, including a restatement of certain provisions. The amended treaty reaffirms the procedures for extradition requests in U.S. courts, ensuring a fair hearing and evaluation of evidence. The 2003 Treaty removes language on contesting probable cause and evidence weight but requires thorough documentation for extradition requests. The 2003 Treaty requires thorough documentation for extradition requests, including information to establish a reasonable basis for the offense. Extradition is limited to misconduct outlawed in both countries, with exceptions for extraterritorial cases. The 2003 Treaty requires thorough documentation for extradition requests, limited to misconduct outlawed in both countries, with exceptions for extraterritorial cases. Extradition is granted based on comparable laws between the two countries. The 2003 Treaty allows extradition for offenses committed outside the territory in similar circumstances, even if lawful in the Requested State. It eliminates any statute of limitations for extradition requests. The 2003 Treaty allows extradition for offenses committed outside the territory, even if lawful in the Requested State, and eliminates any statute of limitations for extradition requests. Extradition treaties typically include a statute of limitations bar to prevent unfairness in requiring individuals to defend against stale charges. The 2003 Treaty eliminates the statute of limitations for extradition requests, allowing extradition for offenses committed outside the territory. It also allows for provisional arrest and detention for 60 days upon request by the United Kingdom. The 2003 Treaty allows for provisional arrest and detention for 60 days upon request by the United Kingdom, with more precise requirements for documentation compared to the existing treaty. It also provides flexibility in recipients of requests and documentation, and discretionary release if necessary documentation is not received. Additionally, it allows for seizure of assets by the United Kingdom under certain circumstances. The 2003 Treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States allows for the transfer of evidence and assets, broadening the scope of forfeitable property and omitting reference to claimants' rights. It permits the seizure and surrender of all items and assets connected to the offense, even if extradition is not possible. The 2003 Treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States expands the scope of forfeitable property to include items connected with the offense, not just proceeds. Federal law now allows confiscation of property related to various crimes, such as terrorism, organized crime, and drug trafficking. It also permits the confiscation of proceeds from crimes like drug trafficking, violence, fraud, and smuggling in violation of other countries' laws. Additionally, federal law allows for freezing property subject to confiscation under foreign forfeiture laws. The 2003 Treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States allows for the confiscation of property connected to offenses, not just proceeds, and permits sharing proceedings from federal confiscations with foreign countries. It also addresses extradition and prosecution for unrelated offenses, while maintaining the rule of specialty. The rule of specialty ensures that individuals extradited are only tried or punished for the crimes they were extradited for. Recent treaties allow the requested country to consent to trial or punishment for other offenses. Federal courts have differing opinions on whether the rule can be raised on behalf of the country of refuge. The 2003 Treaty with Great Britain preserves the rule of specialty but includes a consent exception for extradition cases. This exception allows the executive authority of the Requested State to waive the rule and consent to the person's detention, trial, or prosecution in the Requesting State. The Supplementary Treaty further clarifies that the rule applies to earlier offenses only if they were illegal in both countries at the time of commission. The 2003 Treaty clause does not have a reservation like the 1977 Treaty, potentially allowing extradition for earlier misconduct not prohibited by the country of refuge's laws. Other clauses in the 2003 Treaty differ from previous benefits and obligations, such as the specialty ban on prosecution of additional crimes and re-extradition to a third country. Some extradition treaties bar re-extradition to international tribunals without consent, possibly related to the International Criminal Court. The 2003 Treaty clause on \"onward extradition\" may prevent extradition for offenses committed prior to extradition unless the Requested State consents. The meaning of \"onward extradition\" is unclear, but the Treaty maintains standards for dealing with multiple extradition requests from third countries. The 2003 Treaty outlines factors for the Requested State to consider when receiving multiple extradition requests for the same person. The existing treaty mentions nationality as a factor, while the 2003 Treaty includes nationality among other relevant factors. The 2003 Treaty may consider nationality as a relevant factor in extradition, but the Parties have denied the right to refuse extradition based on nationality. Extradition cannot be based on conduct for which the individual has already been tried, as outlined in various extradition treaties. The 2003 Treaty allows extradition unless the individual has been tried in the requesting country or a third country. Double jeopardy in the United States only applies to trial by the same sovereign. The Treaty prohibits extradition if the individual has been tried in the country of refuge, and allows the country of refuge to deny extradition if the individual has been tried in a third country. The Senate proviso addresses extradition following acquittal in the requesting country. The Senate urges the Secretary of State to carefully review claims involving extradition requests that implicate UK domestic law allowing retrial. Some nations reserve the right to decline extraditing their own citizens, a view opposed by the United States. The United States opposes extraditing American citizens solely based on nationality, as stated in the 2003 Treaty. The treaty includes a waiver clause allowing individuals to agree to extradition. The 2003 Treaty allows for expedited surrender of individuals who waive extradition. English-speaking countries do not typically have translation clauses in extradition agreements. The 2003 Treaty requires documentation in English, with translation costs borne by the requesting country. The treaty with Great Britain defers extradition for individuals being tried or serving a sentence for another offense. The 2003 Treaty provides greater flexibility for the requested country to defer extradition, trial, or sentence. The 2003 Treaty between the United States and Great Britain allows for expedited surrender of individuals who waive extradition. It grants discretionary authority to approve transfers through their respective countries, with special provisions for capital cases. The 2003 Treaty between the United States and Great Britain allows for expedited surrender of individuals who waive extradition, with special provisions for capital cases. The treaty states that when the offense for which extradition is sought is punishable by death in the Requesting State but not in the Requested State, extradition may be refused unless assurances are provided regarding the death penalty. The 2003 Treaty between the United States and Great Britain allows for expedited surrender of individuals who waive extradition, with special provisions for capital cases. The treaty clarifies the role of the executive branch in extradition proceedings. The 2003 Treaty between the United States and Great Britain allows for expedited surrender of individuals who waive extradition, with special provisions for capital cases. The treaty clarifies the role of the executive branch in extradition proceedings, specifically Article 4, without altering the role of the United States judiciary in making certifications of extraditability or determinations of the application of the political offense exception. The advice and consent of the Senate is subject to declarations and provisos ensuring compliance with the Constitution and relevant federal law. The Senate acknowledges concerns about the Treaty's purpose regarding extradition for offenses related to the conflict in Northern Ireland before the Belfast Agreement. However, the Treaty aims to enhance law enforcement cooperation between the US and UK for serious offenses without reopening issues from the Belfast Agreement. The UK has stated it will not seek extradition for individuals eligible for early release under the Agreement. The Treaty aims to enhance law enforcement cooperation between the US and UK for serious offenses without reopening issues from the Belfast Agreement. The UK has confirmed it will not seek extradition for individuals eligible for early release under the Agreement. The Treaty does not address situations where a fugitive is sought for trial on an offense for which they were previously acquitted in the Requesting State. The United Kingdom domestic law allows for retrial in certain circumstances of an individual previously acquitted. The Senate urges the Secretary of State to carefully consider claims involving extradition requests implicating this provision. The Secretary of State must submit annual reports on the Treaty's implementation to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The report provides information on arrests in the US under the Treaty, extradition requests granted and denied, claims of political motivation or unjustifiable delay, and instances of Secretary of State granting requests under Article 18(1)(c). The UK Government clarified its position on extraditing individuals wanted or convicted of terrorist offenses associated with the Troubles in Northern Ireland. They decided in 2000 not to seek extradition for offenses committed before April 10, 1998, and this stance remains unchanged despite a new treaty. They aim to address the situation of those suspected but not yet convicted of terrorism-related offenses before that date. The UK Government remains committed to addressing the extradition of individuals wanted or convicted of terrorist offenses related to the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Despite a lack of cross-party support, legislation to resolve anomalies in early release applications had to be withdrawn. The British Government assures that there was no intention to make it easier to target these individuals during the negotiation of a new treaty. The UK Government decided in September 2000 to no longer seek extradition of individuals convicted of terrorist offences before April 10th, 1998, who qualify for early release under the Good Friday Agreement. This decision was reiterated by the former Home Secretary, and the UK Government remains committed to addressing the situation of those suspected but not yet convicted of terrorism-related offences. The UK Government acknowledged the anomaly of individuals suspected but not yet convicted of terrorism-related offenses before the Belfast Agreement. Legislation to address this issue was introduced but later withdrawn due to lack of support. The government remains committed to resolving this situation and ensuring these individuals are not unfairly targeted. The UK Government is focused on ratifying the extradition treaty with the United States for improved extradition processes, not specifically related to Northern Ireland. The political and security situation in Northern Ireland has significantly improved since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. The Home Secretary and Senator Lugar are in agreement with the contents of the letter. Since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, significant progress has been made in Northern Ireland, including the Provisional IRA's declaration in 2005 that their armed campaign was over. The focus now is on restoring devolved Government and building a peaceful society. As part of the agreement, over 400 prisoners convicted of terrorist-related offenses before 1998 were released early on license, with the condition that they do not engage in terrorism or serious crime. This was a challenging aspect of the agreement but demonstrated the UK Government's commitment to peace. The Good Friday Agreement demonstrated the UK Government's commitment to peace by implementing the Early Release Scheme for individuals convicted of pre-1998 offences. This scheme allows individuals to apply for early release, including those extradited to the UK. Additionally, individuals suspected of pre-GFA offences, known as \"on the runs,\" still present a challenge in the peace process. The British Government acknowledged the anomaly of individuals suspected of past offences who had fled before trial. Proposals were made in 2003 to allow suspects \"on the run\" to be tried in their absence and return to Northern Ireland without arrest. Legislation to implement this was introduced in 2005 but was withdrawn in 2006 due to lack of agreement. The government is currently considering next steps. The British Government is committed to addressing cases of individuals suspected of past offences who had fled before trial. Decisions on extradition of suspects \"on the run\" for pre-1998 offences are made by prosecuting authorities. There is no political agenda to pursue extradition and trial, and convicted individuals could apply for early release under the Good Friday Agreement. The UK law enforcement authorities will not release individuals convicted of non-terrorism-related offences or offences committed after the Good Friday Agreement under the Early Release Scheme. There are currently no outstanding warrants for the extradition of individuals from the US to Northern Ireland. All remaining prisoners eligible for early release under the Good Friday Agreement have been released. The government is facing pressure to clarify its position on extradition requests for individuals who escaped imprisonment before the Good Friday Agreement. Pursuing extradition for those eligible for early release under the Agreement may not be proportionate due to the time elapsed and remaining sentence to serve. The government is not pursuing extradition for individuals who escaped imprisonment before the Good Friday Agreement. Those eligible for early release can apply to the Sentence Review Commissioners in Northern Ireland. This decision does not affect prosecution for other offenses. It is not an amnesty, and normal licence conditions will apply. The decision may cause hurt to victims, emphasizing the need for a permanent peace under the Good Friday Agreement. The letter from the Department of Justice in response to the UK's extradition treaty reconfirms the position not to seek extradition for individuals convicted of terrorist offenses before April 10, 1998, who qualify for early release under the Good Friday Agreement. The Department of Justice acknowledges the UK's official position on extradition of individuals suspected of terrorist offenses in Northern Ireland before April 10, 1998. The 2003 Treaty is seen as crucial for mutual security against global terrorism and transnational crime. Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales will seek Senate approval for ratification of the Treaty."
