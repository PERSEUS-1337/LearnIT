    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 3.6 is added to the Government Code, requiring agencies to review regulations for consistency with law and consider impacts on the state's economy and businesses, including small businesses. The act does not mandate agencies to identify overlapping, inconsistent, duplicative, or out-of-date regulations. In a time of economic recovery in California, unemployment remains a concern for all, particularly older and younger workers with college degrees. State agencies must identify and eliminate unnecessary regulations to improve efficiency and reduce outdated rules. Definitions for \"state agency\" and \"regulation\" are provided in this chapter. State agencies in California are required to review and eliminate duplicative, overlapping, inconsistent, or out-of-date regulations by January 1, 2019. They must adopt, amend, or repeal regulations to reconcile these issues and hold public hearings for input on proposed revisions. State agencies in California must notify legislative committees of proposed regulation revisions 30 days before initiating the process. They are also required to report to the Governor and Legislature on compliance with eliminating duplicative, overlapping, inconsistent, or out-of-date regulations. State agencies in California must notify a department within the agency of any regulations that may be duplicative, overlapping, or inconsistent with regulations from another department by January 1, 2019, as per Section 9795 of the Government Code. State agencies in California are required to notify the relevant department within the agency of any proposed regulation revisions at least 90 days before a public hearing or adoption. Additionally, agencies must inform state agencies of any existing regulations that may duplicate, overlap, or be inconsistent with their own regulations. Chapter 11366.45 ensures that existing human health, public, worker rights, and environmental protections are not weakened. It emphasizes the need for state agencies to focus efficiently on their duties to implement laws while maximizing economic and public benefits. Chapter 11366.5 will be repealed on January 1, 2020, unless a later statute extends this date. The Legislature finds that California has a significant homeless population, including over 40,000 chronically homeless individuals and 15,000 homeless veterans, due to a lack of affordable housing. This act is urgently needed to allow state agencies to review regulations by the 2019 deadline. HUD reported over 15,000 homeless veterans in California. Studies show providing permanent, supportive housing through \"rapid rehousing\" and \"housing first\" initiatives is cost-effective. A new Rapid Rehousing Enhancement Program is added to the Government Code. The \"Enhancement program\" distributes funds to counties and private nonprofit organizations for rapid rehousing programs. The program is established by the department upon appropriation of funds in the annual Budget Act. The department will develop guidelines to select four counties or private nonprofit organizations for the enhancement program, prioritizing those with existing rapid rehousing programs that are effective in assisting individuals and veterans experiencing homelessness. Eligible entities must have a high funding need and be eligible for funds from the federal Emergency Solutions Grants Program. Counties and private nonprofit organizations selected for funds must comply with reporting requirements. The department will distribute funds equally each year, deducting administrative costs. Up to 5% of funds may be used for administration. This chapter will be in effect until July 1, 2018, and then repealed."
