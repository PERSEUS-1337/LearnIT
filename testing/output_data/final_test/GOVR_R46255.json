    "content": "The U.S. government administers international food assistance programs to alleviate hunger and improve food security in other countries. These programs provide emergency and nonemergency assistance, originating in 1954 with the Food for Peace Act. In-kind aid is the primary method of providing assistance, funded by Congress through the Agriculture appropriations bill. The Agriculture appropriations bill funds the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) except for the Forest Service. Market-based assistance, such as cash transfers and local procurement, supplements in-kind aid in emergency and nonemergency situations. Congress funds market-based assistance through the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations bill. For FY2020, approximately $4.091 billion was provided for U.S. international food assistance. The Agriculture appropriations bill provided $1.945 billion for international food assistance programs, including $1.725 billion for the Food for Peace Title II program and $220 million for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. The SFOPS appropriations bill provided an estimated $2.146 billion for international food assistance programs, including $2.066 billion for the Emergency Food Security Program and $80 million for the Community Development Fund. This report summarizes the Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request for international food assistance. The report summarizes the Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request for international food assistance and details the provisions in the FY2020 enacted Agriculture and SFOPS appropriations bills. Congress funds U.S. international food assistance programs through the Agriculture and SFOPS appropriations bills, with each account funding specific programs. Table 1 and Figure 1 provide a breakdown of the international food assistance accounts, funded programs, delivery methods, and implementing agencies. The Food for Peace Act is the primary legislation for international food assistance programs funded through agriculture appropriations. Congress authorizes discretionary and mandatory funding levels for these programs in periodic farm bills. Programs with mandatory funding do not require a separate appropriation. Congress provides funding for these programs through annual appropriations. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 farm bill; P.L. 115-334) provides discretionary funding for international food assistance programs through various accounts in the Agriculture appropriations bill. This includes the Food for Peace Title I Direct Credit and Food for Progress Program account, the Food for Peace Title II Grants account, and the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program Grants account. Additional discretionary funding for international food assistance is also provided in the General Provisions title of the Agriculture appropriations bill. The Food for Peace Title I Direct Credit and Food for Progress Program account covers administrative expenses for these programs. Food for Progress donates U.S. agricultural commodities to governments or organizations to be sold on local markets in recipient countries for economic development projects. Congress authorizes funding for Food for Progress, primarily through mandatory funding. The Food for Peace Title II Grants account funds the donation of U.S. agricultural commodities to recipients in foreign countries for both emergency and nonemergency purposes. FFP Title II, administered by USAID, receives funds from Congress through USDA for international food assistance. Majority of funds support emergency aid, with some funding for nonemergency assistance from the Community Development Fund. McGovern-Dole program under FFP Title II donates U.S. agricultural commodities to school feeding programs and pregnant/nursing mothers in qualifying countries. Congress has allocated a portion of McGovern-Dole funds for LRP since FY2016. Since FY2016, Congress has allocated a portion of McGovern-Dole funds for the Farmer-to-Farmer Program (FFP Title V), which provides technical assistance to farmers in developing countries through short-term placements for U.S. volunteers. The program is administered by USAID and has minimum and maximum funding levels set by statute. Food for Progress, another U.S. international food aid program, primarily relies on mandatory funding from USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. In FY2019, Congress provided discretionary funding for Food for Progress through the Agriculture Appropriations Act. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT) is a reserve of funds held by the CCC to supplement FFP Title II activities for emergency international food needs. No funds were released from BEHT in FY2019, and Congress did not appropriate any BEHT reimbursement funds to the CCC in FY2020. Congress funds international food assistance programs through two funding accounts in the SFOPS appropriation. Between FY2015 and FY2019, Congress provided funding for food assistance programs through two accounts in the SFOPS appropriation. The International Disaster Assistance (IDA) funding account supports the Emergency Food Security Program (EFSP), which USAID began using in FY2010. Congress does not specify the exact funding level for EFSP, leaving it to USAID to allocate funds based on humanitarian need. EFSP typically represents 47% of the whole IDA appropriation. Additionally, Congress designates funding within the Development Assistance (DA) account for the Commodity Development Fund (CDF) to complement nonemergency programs. USAID started using CDF in FY2010 to reduce reliance on monetization. The Commodity Development Fund (CDF) offers USAID flexibility to implement market-based interventions using proceeds from selling U.S. commodities. CDF complements nonemergency programs and is no longer needed to offset monetization. Congress designates CDF funding levels in annual appropriations reports. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget proposed eliminating McGovern-Dole and FFP Title II for the third year in a row. The President's FY2020 budget proposed consolidating international food assistance funding into a new International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA) account within the SFOPS appropriations bill. This would include merging four humanitarian assistance accounts and eliminating Food for Progress. Congress did not adopt the Administration's proposals to eliminate FFP Title II. The Administration's FY2020 budget did not include proposals to eliminate FFP Title II, McGovern-Dole, or Food for Progress. They requested $135,000 for the FFP Title I account, which was $14,000 less than FY2019. The workload for FFP Title I was stated to be less than previously estimated, with funds redirected to higher priorities. The FY2020 budget request did not include proposals to eliminate FFP Title II, McGovern-Dole, or Food for Progress. The Administration stated that funds would be redirected to higher priorities, with a focus on more efficient International Humanitarian Assistance for emergency food needs. The rationale for eliminating these programs included high costs, inefficiency, and oversight challenges. The FY2020 budget proposes to eliminate mandatory funding for Food for Progress, aiming to save $1.7 billion over 10 years. A combined IHA account was suggested to consolidate humanitarian assistance accounts, supporting various aspects of humanitarian aid. The account would be managed by a new Humanitarian Assistance Bureau at USAID under the policy authority of the Secretary of State. The Administration proposed a $5.97 billion budget for the IHA account, a 37% decrease from FY2019 appropriations for various assistance programs. The FY2020 budget also included a $5.23 billion ESDF account, a 32% decrease from FY2019 appropriations. Moving funding from FFP Title II to IHA could change how food assistance is delivered. The Administration proposed shifting international food assistance funding from FFP Title II to IHA, which would eliminate the requirement for in-kind aid. This could increase market-based assistance and shift implementation from USDA to USAID. Previous administrations also proposed increasing market-based food assistance. Some argue that increasing market-based assistance could improve program efficiency, but opponents fear Trump Administration's funding cuts may reduce aid recipients. In-kind aid ensures high-quality food, and some stakeholders oppose changes due to implications for U.S. commodity purchases. Members of Congress are interested in issues like in-kind vs. market-based assistance and cargo preference requirements. The FY2020 Agriculture Appropriations Act provided funding for U.S. international food assistance programs, including FFP Title II and McGovern-Dole. Congress did not allocate discretionary funding for the Food for Progress program in FY2020. The FY2020 SFOPS Appropriations Act funded international food assistance programs in Bilateral Assistance. Funding trends for international food assistance programs are shown in Figure 2. The FY2020 Agriculture Appropriations Act provided funding for international food assistance programs, including FFP Title II and McGovern-Dole. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 allocated $1.945 billion for international food assistance programs, maintaining a similar level to FY2019. Congress did not approve the Administration's proposal to eliminate certain programs. In FY2020, Congress allocated $1.725 billion for FFP Title II, a 0.5% increase from FY2019. Funding for McGovern-Dole saw a 5% increase to $220 million. Congress directed a minimum of $20 million for LRP from the McGovern-Dole funding. Additionally, $142,000 was provided for FFP Title I and Food for Progress administrative expenses. In FY2020, Congress did not provide discretionary appropriations for Food for Progress, which is typically funded through mandatory funding. The 2018 farm bill authorized new pilot agreements within the program to directly fund economic development projects. However, funding for pilot agreements was not appropriated in FY2019 or FY2020. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 provided funds for international food assistance programs, with the enacted IDA appropriation level increasing slightly from $4.385 billion in FY2019 to $4.395 billion in FY2020. In FY2020, the IDA appropriation level increased by 0.2% to $4.395 billion. Congress typically appropriates funds for international disaster relief in a lump sum without specifying countries or crises. The final FY2020 act included $80 million for CDF under DA. Agriculture and SFOPS appropriations bills may include policy provisions directing fund usage. These provisions have the force of law for the fiscal year. The FY2019 and FY2020 Agriculture Appropriations Acts compare policy-related provisions for U.S. international food aid programs. Explanatory statements and committee reports express congressional intent but do not have the force of law. Table 4 and Table 5 compare selected policy-related provisions for U.S. international food aid programs from the FY2019 and FY2020 House and Senate committee reports and explanatory statements for the Agriculture Appropriations Act and SFOPS appropriation."
