    "content": "The \"Carbon Capture Act\" is cited as the short title. Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to extend the credit for carbon dioxide sequestration. The Carbon Capture Act amends Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code to extend the credit for carbon dioxide sequestration. The credit amount is $20 per metric ton for captured and disposed carbon dioxide, and $10 per metric ton for captured carbon dioxide. The Carbon Capture Act extends the credit for carbon dioxide sequestration by providing a dollar amount per metric ton of qualified carbon dioxide captured and disposed of in secure geological storage or utilized in a qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project. The credit is $20 per metric ton for disposed carbon dioxide and $10 per metric ton for captured carbon dioxide. The Carbon Capture Act provides a credit for qualified carbon dioxide captured and disposed of in secure geological storage or used in enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects. The credit is $20 per metric ton for disposed carbon dioxide and $10 per metric ton for captured carbon dioxide. The taxpayer capturing qualified carbon dioxide must ensure disposal, use, or utilization through contractual arrangements with another party. The applicable dollar amount for the credit is determined based on taxable years. The applicable dollar amount for the carbon capture credit is determined based on taxable years, with specific amounts set for different periods. The amount is adjusted annually and rounded to the nearest cent. Installation of additional carbon capture equipment is also eligible for the credit. The Carbon Capture Storage Act allows for the installation of additional carbon capture equipment on existing qualified facilities. The taxpayer can claim a credit for the amount of qualified carbon dioxide captured, based on the total amount captured at the facility for the taxable year. The Carbon Capture Act allows taxpayers to claim a credit for the amount of qualified carbon dioxide captured at a facility, based on the equipment's capacity and excess amounts. Taxpayers can elect to use different dollar amounts for the credit calculation. The Carbon Capture Act allows taxpayers to claim a credit for qualified carbon dioxide captured at a facility, whether from industrial sources or directly from the air, and measured at the capture source and verified at disposal. The Carbon Capture Act defines qualified carbon dioxide as captured CO2 verified at disposal, injection, or utilization. It includes initial deposit for tertiary injectant but not recaptured and re-injected CO2. A qualified facility is an industrial or direct air capture facility with construction starting before January 1, 2024, and includes carbon capture equipment installation in the original planning or design. The Carbon Capture Act requires the construction of carbon capture equipment at qualified facilities before January 1, 2024. These facilities must capture a specific amount of qualified carbon dioxide for utilization. The Carbon Capture Act mandates the installation of carbon capture equipment at eligible facilities in the United States or its territories. Regulations for secure geological storage of captured carbon dioxide will be established by the Secretary in consultation with relevant agencies. The Carbon Capture Act requires the installation of carbon capture equipment at eligible facilities to prevent the escape of qualified carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The term 'tertiary injectant' and 'qualified enhanced oil or natural gas recovery project' are defined within the Act. The credit attributable to the taxpayer is also outlined. The Carbon Capture Act mandates the use of carbon capture equipment at eligible facilities to prevent the release of qualified carbon dioxide. The credit under this section is attributed to the entity capturing and ensuring the disposal or utilization of the captured carbon dioxide. The Carbon Capture Act requires the use of carbon capture equipment at eligible facilities to prevent the release of qualified carbon dioxide. The credit under this section is given to the entity that owns and ensures the capture and disposal, utilization, or use of the captured carbon dioxide. If the entity makes an election as prescribed by the Secretary, the credit is applicable. The Carbon Capture Act requires the use of carbon capture equipment at eligible facilities to prevent the release of qualified carbon dioxide. The credit under this section is given to the person disposing of, utilizing, or using the qualified carbon dioxide, with recapture provisions for non-compliance. The Carbon Capture Act requires the utilization of qualified carbon dioxide for storage or commercial purposes, excluding tertiary injectant use in oil or gas projects, as determined by the Secretary. The amount of qualified carbon dioxide utilized is measured for credit purposes. The Carbon Capture Act defines the amount of qualified carbon dioxide utilized by the taxpayer, based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions analysis. A direct air capture facility uses carbon capture equipment to capture carbon. The Carbon Capture Act defines the amount of qualified carbon dioxide utilized by the taxpayer, based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions analysis. A facility uses carbon capture equipment to capture carbon from the ambient air. This term excludes facilities capturing carbon dioxide deliberately released from naturally-occurring subsurface springs. The inflation adjustment for taxable years after 2009 is determined by multiplying the dollar amount by the inflation adjustment factor. The application of the section for certain carbon capture equipment is outlined, with exceptions noted. The Carbon Capture Act outlines the requirements for the credit under this section for carbon capture equipment. The credit applies to qualified carbon dioxide captured before a specified date, with a special rule for facilities not claiming prior credit. The Carbon Capture Act allows taxpayers to elect to treat qualified facilities capturing at least 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide after December 31, 2015, as placed in service on the date of enactment. The Secretary may issue regulations to ensure proper allocation for the credit. The Carbon Capture Act allows taxpayers to allocate qualified carbon dioxide captured by a facility and determine if it meets requirements. The amendments apply to property placed in service after the Act's enactment date."
