    "content": "The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, S. 385 / H.R. 1443, aims to introduce energy-efficiency policy reforms to strengthen the economy and reduce pollution. The bill focuses on energy-efficiency policies for buildings, industry, and federal agencies, targeting sectors that collectively consume 72% of all U.S. primary energy. Increased adoption of energy-efficiency technologies in these sectors could lead to significant energy savings and emissions reduction. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that building energy use could be reduced by over 20% through cost-effective technologies. The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, S. 385 / H.R. 1443, proposes a national strategy to increase energy efficiency in various sectors by implementing cost-effective technologies. This includes reducing energy consumption by 14%-22% in the industrial sector. Challenges to energy efficiency include market forces, lack of information, and policy approaches that discourage investment in energy efficiency. The bill aims to reduce barriers to private-sector investment, increase adoption of existing technologies, improve economic competitiveness, and reduce environmental impacts. The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, S. 385 / H.R. 1443, aims to increase energy efficiency in various sectors by implementing cost-effective technologies. Senator Portman introduced S. 385 on February 15, 2017, and Representative McKinley introduced an identical bill, H.R. 1443, on March 9, 2017. Both bills build upon previous congressional actions. In the 113th Congress, the bill was reintroduced as S. 2262 with additional provisions. These provisions were split into two Senate bills in the 114th Congress, S. 535/H.R. 1802 and S. 720. S. 535 became law (P.L. 114-11) and addressed energy efficiency in buildings, Tenant Star Program, grid-enabled water heaters, and energy information for commercial buildings. The provisions of S. 2262, related to energy-efficient school buildings and federal-building energy-efficiency requirements, were included in S. 720 and later in a broader energy and natural resources bill, S. 2012. However, an agreement could not be reached on S. 2012. S. 385 and H.R. 1443 closely align with the provisions in S. 720. S. 385/H.R. 1443 is divided into five titles focusing on building energy efficiency, industrial efficiency, federal agencies, and regulatory provisions for the Energy Star program. Title IV of the bill has regulatory provisions for the Energy Star program and federal buildings, while Title V addresses budgetary effects and advance appropriations. Title I includes subsections on building energy codes, workforce training, and school buildings. Section 101 directs the Department of Energy to support the model-code development process and establish targets for aggregate energy savings. Subtitle C of the bill directs the Department of Energy to coordinate federal programs for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and retrofit projects for schools. It includes provisions for manufacturing energy efficiency, a \"Supply Star\" program, rebates for energy-efficient products, and transformers. Subtitle C of the bill focuses on addressing barriers to industrial energy efficiency identified by DOE in a 2015 report to Congress. Provisions for Supply Star and rebate programs target economic and financial barriers, while the subsection on manufacturing energy efficiency provides technical expertise to address informational barriers. Title III addresses energy efficiency for federal agencies, including improvements for information technologies and data centers, and directs HUD to establish a demonstration program for energy and water conservation in multifamily residential units. Title IV also includes provisions for federal agencies and energy efficiency. Title IV of the bill focuses on federal agencies and energy efficiency, with provisions related to the Energy Star program, federal green buildings, and the energy performance of federal buildings. The current version includes language supporting sustainably sourced materials for certifying high performance buildings. The bill supports sustainably sourced materials for certifying high performance federal buildings, emphasizing criteria based on technical data and performance standards. The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, S. 385, was introduced on February 15, 2017, and approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on March 30, 2017. Senator Collins introduced a related bill, S. 383, Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act, on the same day. The House passed a similar bill, H.R. 627, on June 12, 2017. On June 28, 2017, Senators Murkowski and Cantwell introduced S. 1460, the Energy and Natural Resources Act of 2017, which includes divisions on energy and natural resources. The bill addresses energy efficiency, with similarities to S. 385/H.R. 1443 but not identical provisions. Differences between the bills are discussed in \"Possible Issues for Congress.\" H.R. 1443, the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, was introduced in March 2017 and referred to multiple House committees. On the other hand, H.R. 627, the Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2017, was introduced in January 2017 and referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee. H.R. 627, the Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2017, amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act for energy retrofitting assistance for schools. It establishes a clearinghouse of information and was passed by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce without amendment. H.R. 2361, presented to the Subcommittee on Energy, aims to promote energy savings in buildings and industry with key differences from H.R. 1443. It limits energy savings estimation to a 10-year timeframe, eliminates certification requirements for states or tribes not updating building codes, and proposes voluntary energy savings targets. The Congressional Budget Office estimated costs for S. 385, focusing on federal impacts only. According to CBO, S. 385 would increase direct spending by $17 million for 2017-2027 and cost $198 million over five years to implement. The bill directs federal agencies to consider energy-efficiency improvements when evaluating mortgage borrowers, with a minimal impact on the total volume of insured mortgages. The proposed federal energy-efficiency goals align with existing statutes and policies, not significantly adding to federal spending. Additionally, spending on renewable energy certificates would decrease. S. 385 would impose an intergovernmental mandate on states and tribal governments to update building codes for energy efficiency. The cost of this mandate is estimated to be below the threshold established in UMRA for 2017. The bill also authorizes funding and technical assistance for implementation. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) analyzed energy-efficiency legislation benefits in S. 1392 of the 113th Congress. They found that the bill and selected amendments would create jobs, save consumers money, reduce energy use, and avoid greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of potential energy savings in the bill could come from building energy codes. Comparing the energy or cost savings estimates from S. 1392 with current bills would overestimate benefits within a 2020 or 2030 timeframe. The analysis in 2015 included benefits of provisions in P.L. 114-11. Support and opposition to S. 385 / H.R. 1443 are likely to mirror those for S. 720 (114th Congress) and its predecessor, S. 2262 (113th Congress). Several companies and organizations support the bill for promoting energy-efficient technologies, job creation in the energy-efficiency sector, saving energy in buildings, industry, and government, and providing financing for home energy-efficiency improvements. ACEEE and ACC endorse the bill for its positive impact on consumers, workers, businesses, states, the economy, and the environment. The energy underwriting provisions in S. 385 / H.R. 1443 aim to recognize the benefits of energy-efficient technologies, reduce mortgage expenses, and utility bills for consumers. However, groups like the Heritage Foundation oppose the bill, arguing that it burdens taxpayers and consumers and hinders market efficiency. They prefer voluntary programs over efficiency standards and incentives. The Heritage Foundation supports federal energy efficiency improvements through performance contracts with oversight and transparency. The bill S. 385 / H.R. 1443 addresses energy efficiency issues, but it is uncertain if the provisions will gain support. The American Institute of Architects supports consensus-based building energy codes but opposes the repeal of fossil fuel phase-out requirements for federal buildings. Title I of the bill includes provisions for energy savings targets in code development, which has faced opposition for lacking transparency in DOE's technical support. Greater transparency is needed in DOE's technical support of code development to avoid concerns of an \"inappropriate advocacy role.\" DOE's role should be as a \"technical advisor\" and not push for specific goals, products, or technologies. DOE plays a role in certifying energy-efficiency codes, with states required to compare new building energy code standards to their current code. Some prefer a simple payback approach limited to 10 years for cost-effectiveness, as proposed in H.R. 2361. Supporters of H.R. 2361 advocate for a simple payback approach limited to 10 years to communicate consumer benefits effectively. However, opponents argue that this approach overlooks long-term benefits, such as those beyond the initial investor and mortgage financing, which are crucial for accurately measuring overall profitability. Building components often have lifetimes exceeding 10 years, with the average residential building lifetime in the United States being 61 years. The warranty period for building components like windows can exceed 10 years, with some lasting throughout the building's lifetime with maintenance. Shorter-lived products like water heaters are not typically considered in building energy code cost-effectiveness evaluations. S. 1460 is a comprehensive energy and natural resources bill that includes provisions on energy efficiency, aligning with other related bills. S. 1460 emphasizes voluntary building energy codes, stating they are not binding on states or local governments as a matter of Federal law. S. 1460 and S. 385 / H.R. 1443 expand certification requirements for states and Indian tribes on building energy codes, emphasizing consensus-based energy-savings targets. States must compare new model codes with existing ones within two years of DOE determination. Both bills set consistent requirements for residential and commercial building energy code reviews and updates. Both S. 1460 and S. 385 / H.R. 1443 require states and tribes to certify compliance with building energy codes. S. 1460 does not mandate repeat certifications for partial compliance. Federal support is available for non-compliant states in both bills, with S. 385 / H.R. 1443 focusing on code adoption and enforcement activities, while S. 1460 emphasizes technical assistance. Incentive funding is provided in both bills, with S. 385 / H.R. 1443 allowing funds for compliance improvement and training of code officials. S. 1460 simplifies grant sharing with local governments and focuses on compliance improvement and training for building code officials. It does not include energy-efficiency provisions present in S. 385 / H.R. 1443, such as establishing stretch codes and advanced standards. S. 1460 focuses on simplifying grant sharing with local governments and improving compliance and training for building code officials. It emphasizes energy-efficiency measures that are technologically feasible and economically justified, with a consideration for potential costs and savings for consumers and building owners. The DOE will determine if the benefits of building energy codes outweigh the burdens, considering various factors. Different approaches in S. 385 / H.R. 1443, H.R. 2361, and S. 1460 address the costs and benefits of energy-efficiency improvements in building energy codes. S. 385 / H.R. 1443 focuses on building energy savings over a building's lifetime, while H.R. 2361 considers initial affordability for building owners. Congress may need to review the term \"economically justified\" in energy-efficiency provisions. The term \"economically justified\" in energy-efficiency provisions of S. 1460 aims to balance lifetime energy savings and initial affordability of buildings. State building energy codes adoption status is tracked by DOE, as shown in Figure B-1 and Figure B-2."
