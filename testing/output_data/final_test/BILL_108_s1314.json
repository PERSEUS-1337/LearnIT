    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Collaborative Forest Health Act\" and includes definitions for key terms. The Act defines an \"at-risk community\" as an urban wildland interface or intermix community with basic infrastructure and services, where conditions are conducive to large-scale fire events posing a significant risk to human life and property. The Act defines a \"community protection zone\" as an area within one-half mile of an at-risk community. The term \"Secretaries\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System lands and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. The term \"1890 Institution\" includes colleges eligible for funds under the Act of August 30, 1890. \"Federal lands\" encompass public lands and the National Forest System. The curr_chunk refers to the system defined in section 11(a) of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act. The curr_chunk outlines an expedited planning and implementation process. The Secretaries may approve hazardous fuels reduction projects removing up to 250,000 board feet of wood products without requiring an environmental assessment. A public meeting must be held before project implementation, and collaboration is encouraged. The Secretaries shall collaborate on projects to reduce hazardous fuels, ensuring consistency with forest plans. Local collaboration must include Tribal representatives. The Secretaries will collaborate with Tribal representatives, Federal and State agencies, local governments, landowners, stakeholders, and community-based groups. Incentives or performance measures will be established to ensure Federal employees are committed to collaboration. Projects will be implemented on a total area of 20 million acres of Federal lands, in addition to the existing hazardous fuels reduction program on 2.5 million acres annually. Projects under this section will not be subject to appeal requirements or review by the Department of the Interior. The Secretaries will collaborate with various stakeholders to implement hazardous fuels reduction projects on Federal lands. Within designated zones, the decision to categorically exclude proposed projects from judicial review is conclusive, unless extraordinary circumstances exist. The National Environmental Policy Act does not apply to Federal lands in wilderness study areas or where logging is prohibited by law. Extraordinary circumstances will be considered for projects under this section, following agency procedures. Projects aim to reduce fire risk and improve forest health. To prevent intense wildfires and enhance forest health, Secretaries must avoid building new roads in roadless areas, preserve mature and old growth stands, focus on thinning from below, use pest management to prevent fuel buildup from insects, implement slash treatment plans for thinning projects in areas with insect mortality, and limit timber salvage to heavily affected areas. The Secretaries must ensure that projects in municipal watersheds protect water quality or quantity and not use goods-for-service contracting. For hazardous fuels reduction projects, funding must be committed before project start and a long-term treatment plan must be in place. The Secretaries must ensure that hazardous fuels reduction projects focus on high-priority areas for human safety and property protection. At least seventy percent of funds should be spent on projects within the community protection zone or municipal watersheds. The Secretaries must allocate thirty percent of hazardous fuels operations funds to benefit small businesses in economically disadvantaged communities. Local preference and best value contracting criteria must be used for projects, focusing on ecological goals, minimizing soil impacts, and benefiting local communities. The Secretaries will establish a commission to assess the impacts and effectiveness of projects under this section, with equal representation from various interests. The commission will report to Congress within 36 months, detailing contracts awarded to small enterprises and local entities. The Secretaries will establish a multiparty monitoring process to evaluate projects qualifying for the Historically Underutilized Business Zone Program. Monitoring data will be easily accessible to the public, collected through agreements with small enterprises or conservation corps. Funds for implementation will come from hazardous fuels operations funds. The provisions of this section regarding hazardous fuels operations funds will expire five years after the enactment of the Act, but ongoing projects can continue under this Act if a decision notice has been issued before the expiration. SEC. 4. INSECT INFESTATIONS. During fiscal years 2004 and 2008, the Secretaries will allocate $25,000,000 each year for a program to study insect types damaging forest ecosystems. The program will involve collaboration with scientists from universities, forestry schools, state agencies, and landowners to conduct research on forest management techniques. The program aims to study insect types damaging forest ecosystems, establish early detection programs, and develop new technologies for value-added products using insect byproducts. The program focuses on studying insect types damaging forest ecosystems and developing new technologies for value-added products using insect byproducts or hazardous fuels reduction treatments. SEC. 5. FIREFIGHTER SAFETY AND TRAINING. The Secretaries will track funds for firefighter safety and training in future budget requests. SEC. 6. BORROWING AUTHORITY FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION. The Secretary of Agriculture can request up to $250 million from the Treasury for fire suppression costs exceeding Forest Service funding. SEC. 7. PROHIBITION ON THE COMPETITIVE SOURCING INITIATIVE. SEC. 7. PROHIBITION ON THE COMPETITIVE SOURCING INITIATIVE. The Competitive Sourcing Initiative and Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76 do not apply to the Forest Service. During fiscal years 2004 through 2008, $100,000,000 each year will be made available without further appropriation to reduce wildfire risk and restore burned areas on tribal, private, and state lands. Cost-share grants may be provided to various entities to remove hazardous fuels and prevent structural damage from wildfires. Priority for funds will be given to areas where local governments have enacted ordinances for wildland areas, requiring brush clearance and fire-retardant building materials. Non-Federal contributions can be in cash or in-kind, and unobligated funds from one fiscal year remain available for use in subsequent years."
