Approximately 206 million gallons of oil were discharged into U.S. waters, testing response capabilities and legal frameworks. Cleanup, natural resource damage assessment, and compensation processes are ongoing. Selected issues include oil spill response, fate of the oil, Gulf Coast restoration, economic claims, civil and criminal settlements, regulatory developments, and dispersant regulations. The Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010 was a significant challenge for various agencies and parties. The uncontrolled discharge lasted 87 days until responders gained control on July 15, 2010. The response involved multiple agencies working under the Unified Command. At the peak of operations, 47,000 response personnel were involved. In the summer of 2010, response personnel levels reached 47,000, with almost 7,000 response vessels. The maximum extent of shoreline oiling was nearly 1,100 miles. Response activities specific to the 2010 incident have decreased significantly, with different states transitioning to pre-spill reporting systems. The Coast Guard emphasized that the response is ongoing, with clean-up operations continuing. The Incident Management Team transitioned to a Phase IV Documentation Team, with Coast Guard field unit commanders responding to oil spills in their areas. Sampling may be done to identify the source of the oil. As of April 2015, 30 response personnel are working on Deepwater Horizon-related activities. Satellite data showed decreasing oil quantities on the ocean's surface after the Macondo well containment. A study estimated that 50% of the oil had evaporated. The study concluded that around 50% of the oil from the Gulf spill had evaporated, dissolved, or been removed through human activities. Over 100 million gallons of oil remained in some form in the Gulf. Subsequent research suggested that microbial organisms consumed some oil in the water column, while evidence indicated that a significant amount settled on the sea floor. Natural resource trustees conduct NRDA to assess harm from spills, with damages intended to be compensatory. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) oversees the NRDA process for natural resource damages caused by events like the Deepwater Horizon spill. The process involves three steps: pre-assessment, restoration planning, and restoration implementation. BP agreed to provide $1 billion for early restoration projects in the Gulf of Mexico. These projects can be developed before the completion of the injury assessment, which may take months or years. The distribution of early restoration funds has been divided into three phases, with the first two phases completed in 2012. The early restoration projects for natural resource damages caused by the Deepwater Horizon spill were divided into three phases. The first two phases, completed in 2012, cost $71 million for 10 projects. An additional 44 projects were proposed in a third phase, totaling $627 million. By March 2015, a total of $698 million was allocated for 54 projects. This funding will be credited against BP's liability for damages. The incident also sparked interest in long-term Gulf of Mexico restoration planning. In 2010, the Administration committed to developing a long-term Gulf of Mexico restoration plan for post-spill recovery needs. The President established the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task Force in October 2010 to develop a restoration strategy, released in December 2011. The RESTORE Act was signed in July 2012, creating the Gulf Coast Restoration Fund in the General Treasury. The RESTORE Act allocates 80% of CWA Section 311 penalties from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to a trust fund for Gulf Coast restoration. Funds are distributed to Gulf states and ecosystem restoration projects based on specific criteria. The CWA civil settlement with Transocean will deposit $800 million into a trust fund for Gulf Coast restoration. Potential civil penalties against BP could be significant, with penalties of up to $37,500 per day of violation or $1,100 per barrel discharged. The penalty for gross negligence or willful misconduct in oil spills can range from $140,000 to $4,300 per barrel discharged. A federal judge in Louisiana ruled that BP was grossly negligent in the Deepwater Horizon incident, with 3.19 million barrels of oil spilled. Both BP and the Department of Justice are appealing the judge's decisions. Based on court decisions, BP could face a maximum CWA civil penalty of $13.7 billion for the Deepwater Horizon incident. However, if the discharge was not due to gross negligence or willful misconduct, the penalty ceiling would likely be $3.5 billion. Other factors, such as culpability and mitigation efforts, will also be considered in determining the final penalty amount. The judicial civil penalty for the Deepwater Horizon incident involving BP could be less than $3.5 billion, even if gross negligence or willful misconduct is determined. BP is liable for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and economic damages. Cleanup operations have cost BP over $14 billion, with ongoing payments to various parties. Multiple lawsuits were consolidated in 2010, leading to a settlement agreement in 2012. The settlement agreement reached in 2012 between BP and plaintiffs established a court-supervised program to evaluate and award economic claims. The program has awarded over $5 billion as of March 31, 2015. BP tried to suspend payments from the program, but the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling allowing claims to be paid. BP's request for the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision was declined in December 2014. BP requested the U.S. Supreme Court to review a decision, but the Court declined in December 2014. Other components of the litigation are still pending, including claims against BP, Transocean, and Haliburton. The DOJ announced settlements totaling almost $6 billion with various parties involved in the 2010 oil spill. BP agreed to a criminal penalty settlement of approximately $4 billion in November 2012. BP agreed to plead guilty to 11 felony counts related to the 2010 oil spill disaster, as well as misdemeanor and felony charges. A $4 billion settlement was reached, with funds allocated to various organizations for restoration efforts and research. Additionally, a civil securities fraud settlement was approved by the U.S. District Court in 2012. The court approved a $525 million settlement by BP in December 2012 for charges related to the 2010 oil spill. The SEC planned to use the payment to compensate harmed investors. In January 2013, Transocean settled civil and criminal penalties with the DOJ, agreeing to pay $1 billion in the civil settlement and $400 million in the criminal plea agreement. Transocean agreed to pay $400 million in charges related to the 2010 oil spill. The amount is to be distributed to various organizations, including $150 million to the NFWF and $100 million to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. MOEX Offshore 2007 LLC also settled with a $70 million civil penalty and $20 million for environmental projects. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill raised concerns about offshore drilling safety. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has regulatory authority for offshore oil and gas development, focusing on safety and environmental concerns. Following the 2010 oil spill, DOI addressed management issues in the former Minerals Management Service (MMS) and reorganized it into the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) in 2010. In 2011, BOEMRE was divided into three agencies. The Department of the Interior (DOI) reorganized the former Minerals Management Service (MMS) into the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) in 2010. In 2011, BOEMRE was divided into three separate entities: the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue. DOI agencies have implemented regulatory and policy changes to improve safety and reduce accidents in offshore drilling activities. In 2010, operators on the outer continental shelf were required to implement a Safety and Environmental Management Systems program. Subsequent rules in 2012, 2013, and 2014 amended and added new requirements to existing regulations. Proposed rules in 2015 aimed to revise regulations for drilling in the Arctic region and alter blowout preventer requirements. Additionally, the EPA proposed a rule to amend dispersant regulations. During the Deepwater Horizon oil spill response in 2010, 1.8 million gallons of dispersants were used to break up oil on the surface and at the uncontrolled well site 5,000 feet below. Concerns were raised about the environmental impacts of dispersed oil and chemical dispersants. EPA is required to prepare a schedule of dispersants and other spill-mitigating substances under CWA Section 311(d). The EPA's product schedule for oil spill response includes dispersants and other products authorized under the National Contingency Plan. Companies must submit specific data for EPA to add products to the schedule, with testing requirements for effectiveness and toxicity. The proposed rule in January 2015 aims to revise testing requirements, establish toxicity criteria, clarify pre-authorization processes, and require environmental monitoring. The legislative activity related to oil spills from the 111th to the 114th Congress decreased over time. Initially, there was significant interest and activity, with over 150 legislative proposals introduced and three enacted into law. Senate and House committees held more than 60 hearings on various oil spill issues during the immediate aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident. The 111th Congress enacted three oil spill-related proposals into law, with the Coast Guard Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011 (P.L. 111-281) making substantial changes. The House passed bills like the CLEAR Act, but the Senate did not vote on them. Interest in oil spill policy continued in the 112th Congress, although it decreased compared to the 111th Congress. In the 112th Congress, members proposed over 50 bills with oil-spill-related provisions. Two statutes were enacted, including the RESTORE Act and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011. The latter increases civil penalties for safety violations and mandates automatic shutoff valves on new pipelines. In the 112th Congress, several bills were proposed with oil-spill-related provisions, leading to the enactment of two statutes. The RESTORE Act and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 were passed, increasing penalties for safety violations and requiring automatic shutoff valves on new pipelines. In the 113th Congress, less focus was placed on oil-spill-related legislation, with only one bill enacted to encourage oil and gas development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The 113th Congress enacted one bill, P.L. 113-281, encouraging Arctic nations to coordinate oil spill prevention and response capabilities. The House passed two bills related to oil spills, including the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act (H.R. 2231) and the American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act (H.R. 2). Several investigations and commissions were initiated to examine issues surrounding the Deepwater Horizon incident. Prominent studies, investigations, and inquiries have been completed or are underway, including reports by Thad Allen, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. Several investigations and commissions were conducted to examine the Deepwater Horizon incident, including reports by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement. These reports analyzed the circumstances surrounding the explosion, fire, sinking, and loss of crew members aboard the Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit Deepwater Horizon, as well as the causes of the Macondo Well blowout. Other studies by the National Academy of Engineering, National Research Council, Government Accountability Office, and Oil Spill Commission Action also provided insights and recommendations for improving offshore drilling safety. Several reports and investigations were conducted to examine the Deepwater Horizon incident, including those by the U.S. Coast Guard, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and Oil Spill Commission Action. These reports provided insights and recommendations for improving offshore drilling safety. The fate of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was examined in various reports, including those on natural resource damage assessment, potential Stafford Act declarations, oil spill governance, emergency response framework, liability of responsible parties, fishery disaster assistance, offshore oil and gas development legal framework, and disaster unemployment assistance. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was examined in various reports, including disaster unemployment assistance."
