    "content": "This report discusses appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2016, focusing on the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), the Office of Health Affairs (OHA), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). It provides an overview of the Administration's FY2016 request and Congress's appropriations for \"Protection, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery.\" The report includes information on provisions throughout the proposed bill that directly affect these functions. The suite of CRS reports on homeland security appropriations tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to DHS appropriations, with particular attention paid to discretionary funding amounts. The reports do not provide in-depth analysis of specific issues related to mandatory funding, nor do they systematically follow other legislation related to the authorization or amending of DHS programs, activities, or fee revenues. The Appendix to CRS Report R44053, Department of Homeland Security Appropriations: FY2016, explains budgetary concepts such as budget authority, obligations, outlays, discretionary and mandatory spending, offsetting collections, allocations, and adjustments to the discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act. The appropriations process under the Budget Control Act (P.L. 112-25) is discussed in CRS Report R42388 and the Government Accountability Office's A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process. Amounts in CRS reports on homeland security appropriations represent budget authority and are rounded to the nearest million, with calculations based on unrounded data for precision. Data for FY2015 amounts are from the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 114-4) and the explanatory statement accompanying H.R. 240 in the Congressional Record of January 13, 2015. The FY2016 budget request and funding levels for the Department of Homeland Security are detailed in various congressional documents, including S. 1619, S.Rept. 114-68, H.R. 3128, H.Rept. 114-215, and P.L. 114-113. The appropriations process is guided by the Budget Control Act, with data for FY2015 from P.L. 114-4. The homeland security appropriations bill for DHS allocates resources to departmental components, with discretionary appropriations providing the majority of funding. The budget includes fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. Appropriations measures for DHS are typically organized into five thematic groupings, with a fifth title containing general provisions impacting the entire department. The pie chart compares the share of annual appropriations requested for components funded in the first four titles of the DHS appropriations bill. Protection, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery would receive 27% of the discretionary budget authority for FY2016, with half designated for disaster relief. Title III is the second-largest title, funding NPPD, OHA, and FEMA. Some provisions in Title V may affect funding for these components. The Administration requested $6,222. The Administration requested $6,222 million in FY2016 net discretionary budget authority for components included in this title, totaling $19,020 million. The request was $267 million (4.5%) more than FY2015. An additional $6,713 billion was requested for FEMA in disaster relief funding. Senate-reported S. 1619 proposed $6,291 million in net discretionary budget authority for these components. The Administration requested $6,222 million in FY2016 for components under Protection, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery, which was $267 million more than FY2015. The enacted funding level for FY2016 was $6,353 million, including disaster relief funding. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was formed in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It includes various offices managing infrastructure protection and information security programs. The Administration requested $1,659 million for FY2016. The Administration requested $1,659 million for NPPD in FY2016, with the omnibus providing $1,636 million, $24 million below the request but $133 million above FY2015. The report separately addresses appropriations for Infrastructure Protection and Information Security, the Federal Protective Service, and the Office of Biometric Identity Management within NPPD. The Administration requested $1,312 million for the Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program (IPIS) for FY2016, $123 million above FY2015 enacted levels. The request includes increases for Infrastructure Protection, Cybersecurity, and Communications activities, reflecting adjustments to base funding and programmatic changes. The FY2016 budget request for IPIS included significant programmatic increases for Network Security Deployment and Continuous Diagnostics and Monitoring. The comparison between FY2015 and FY2016 requests was based on budget justifications as the FY2015 appropriations had not been finalized at the time. The FY2016 budget request for IPIS included increases for Network Security Deployment, Continuous Diagnostics and Monitoring, and Next Generation Priority Telecommunication Services. There were also adjustments to the base level of spending, including pay adjustments related to cybersecurity pay reform. The FY2016 budget request for IPIS included increases for certain Continuous Diagnostics and Monitoring activities, with a drop in the overall Federal Network Security budget due to non-recurring costs. There were also reductions in support for the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center and the Chemical Security Assessment Tool. The Senate Appropriation Committee recommended $1,297 million for IPIS, $15 million below the Administration's request. The Senate Committee recommended reducing personnel-related funds by $7 million and Infrastructure Security Compliance PPA by $5 million. They disagreed with the Administration on budget requests for Infrastructure Analysis and Planning PPA, recommending $17 million for the National Infrastructure and Analysis Center (NIAC). They also suggested maintaining funds for vulnerability assessments at last year's level. The House Appropriations Committee recommended keeping funds for vulnerability assessments at last year's level and adding $2 million for a strategic plan for the Regional Resiliency Analysis Program. They disagreed with the Administration's proposed reduction in cyber education activities and allocated not less than $16 million for those activities. Additionally, they recommended $1,245 million for IPIS, $67 million below the Administration's request, and reduced the budget request by $45 million due to concerns about hiring objectives not being met. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for various programs within the IPIS program. They did not approve $10 million for assessing risks to critical infrastructure related to climate change and recommended delaying the appropriation of $16 million for implementing regulations on ammonium nitrate until the next fiscal year. They also suggested continuing support for the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center at FY2015 levels. The omnibus provided $273 million for Infrastructure Protection, $22 million less than requested, and did not allocate the requested $16 million for the ammonium nitrate regulations. The omnibus bill included a $16 million increase for implementing ammonium nitrate regulations, with a $4 million allocation for DHS to secure explosive precursors. However, it did not approve a $10 million increase for assessing climate change impacts on critical infrastructure. Additionally, there was a $4 million reduction in funding for Regional Field Operations without explanation. $2 million was allocated for a strategic plan for vulnerability assessments and the Regional Resiliency Assessment program, along with an extra $4 million for a new critical infrastructure database. The omnibus bill allocated $819 million for cybersecurity programs, maintaining funding for DHS's cybersecurity education efforts at FY2015 levels. It also provided funding for the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center and communication security programs, including the Next Generations Network PPA. The omnibus bill fully funded the Next Generations Network PPA and supported NPPD's hiring projections. The House proposed a greater reduction in personnel expenses compared to the Senate, potentially limiting the Directorate's flexibility in redirecting funds. Congress's decision will impact the Directorate's flexibility in the next fiscal year. The omnibus bill also supported DHS's hiring projections, while the Senate recommended $10 million less for PPAs with funds for climate change-related risk assessments. The Senate recommended $10 million less for PPAs with funds for climate change-related risk assessments, impacting the Directorate's flexibility in redirecting funds. The House and omnibus bill did not provide extra funding for these assessments or fully support the Administration's request for additional funds to implement ammonium nitrate rules. The Senate reduced funding for Infrastructure Security Compliance PPA by $5 million but directed $13 million towards the Ammonium Nitrate Security Program. The omnibus bill provided $5 million for DHS to enhance security for ammonium nitrate and other explosive precursors. Additionally, the bill maintained funding for cybersecurity education activities at FY2015 levels. The Cybersecurity Act of 2015, included in the omnibus, aimed to improve information sharing between the government and private sector. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for protecting federal property and personnel. Their operations focus on security measures to reduce vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats, including risk assessments, countermeasures, law enforcement response, and safety education programs. They also assist other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Secret Service, at National Special Security Events. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is the lead agency for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, employing 1,386 FTEs and 13,000 contract security guards. Unlike other DHS components, FPS is funded by fees rather than appropriations, totaling $1,443 million for FY2016, a $101 million increase from FY2015. The FY2016 budget for the Federal Protective Service (FPS) increased by $101 million from FY2015. Both Senate and House bills authorized the use of collected fees for FPS operations, with the Senate bill requiring a human capital resource plan submission. H.Rept. 114-215 mandated OMB certification for full funding by fees, with an expenditure plan needed if revenues fell short. P.L. 114-113 also authorized fee use and a human capital plan submission. OBIM oversees fee collection. The Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM) is responsible for collecting, maintaining, and sharing biometric data with law enforcement and intelligence communities. The Administration requested almost $284 million for OBIM, with an increase of $31 million for the replacement of IDENT system. Senate-reported S. 1619 included $283 million for OBIM, slightly below the requested funding level. The Senate Appropriations Committee expected full funding for IDENT replacement and requested semiannual briefings on OBIM's progress. The House-reported H.R. 3128 included $283 million for OBIM, slightly less than requested but $31 million more than in FY2015. The funding supported the first increment of IDENT replacement and directed OBIM to continue coordinating biometric systems. Division F of P.L. 114-113 allocated $282 million for OBIM, with $66 million for the successor system to IDENT. The explanatory statement outlined funding for future increments and directed OBIM to provide semiannual briefings on its progress. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) coordinates DHS programs with a public health or medical component, including FEMA operations and ICE detention facility medical care. OHA manages programs like BioWatch and NBIC, with a proposed budget of $124 million for FY2016. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $123 million for OHA for FY2016, slightly below the requested amount. The proposed allocation includes $83 million for the BioWatch program, $8 million for NBIC, $1 million for the Chemical Defense Program, $5 million for Planning and Coordination, and $26 million for Salaries and Expenses. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $125 million for OHA for FY2016, slightly above the requested amount. The committee proposed $82 million for the BioWatch Program, $11 million for NBIC, almost $1 million for the Chemical Defense Program, $5 million for Planning and Coordination, and $27 million for Salaries and Expenses. The FY2015 level for NBIC was sustained to continue work on pilot programs. Division F of P.L. 114-113 included $125 million for OHA for FY2016, slightly more than the House Appropriations Committee's recommendation, with a slight increase in Salaries and Expenses. The BioWatch Program, which accounts for most of OHA's budget, aims to detect bioterrorism pathogens in 30 U.S. cities. Despite efforts to deploy more advanced sensors, procurement activities were terminated in 2014. The Senate Committee recommended funding for FY2016 to address gaps in timeliness and agent detection. The House Committee recommended $1 million less than the requested amount for BioWatch, citing sufficient funding for equipment replacement costs in FY2015. They also supported efforts to improve detection timeliness and recommended collaboration with DOD. $1 million was specified for equipment replacement and OHA was directed to address GAO findings on BioWatch capabilities. FEMA's primary mission is to protect life and property from all hazards. FEMA's mission is to protect life and property from all hazards by leading and supporting the nation's preparedness for disasters. It provides assistance to state and local governments for incident response, recovery, and mitigation through various grant programs. The Administration requested $4,462 million in net discretionary budget authority for FEMA, including funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act. The Senate-reported bill included $4,554 million in net discretionary budget authority for FEMA for FY2016, $92 million more than requested and $207 million more than was provided in FY2015. The House-reported bill included $4,437 million in net discretionary budget authority for FEMA for FY2016, $26 million less than requested and $89 million more than was provided in FY2015. Division F of P.L. 114-113 included $4,616 million in net discretionary budget authority for FEMA for FY2016, $154 million more than requested and $269 million more than was provided in FY2015. State and local governments may reduce resources allocated to public safety and homeland security preparedness due to tight budgetary constraints. This could have a significant impact on national preparedness levels. Prior to 9/11, federal grant programs were available to address homeland security at the state and local levels. Several homeland security grant programs were added to amplify state and local preparedness, including MMRS, SHSGP, CCP, UASI, REAL ID, Stonegarden, RCPG, Transit Security Grants, Port Security Grants, Over-the-Road, BZPP, IECGP, and EOC. Some programs still receive explicit mention in appropriations reports, while others have become allowable uses for funding provided. The Administration requested $1,211 million for state and local grant programs and training in FY2016, $289 million less than previous years. Proposed structural changes included a single block grant for preparedness grants, but Senate and House reports recommended maintaining current grant program structure. P.L. 114-113 included $1,500 million for state and local grants. The FY2016 budget included $1,500 million for state and local grant programs and training. Legislative language in the appropriation for FEMA's grant programs established timelines, limited administrative costs, and allowed for communication tower installation. FEMA was encouraged to prioritize applications enhancing physical security and early warning systems. FEMA was directed to coordinate with the Department of Justice to address emergent challenges at state and local levels. The explanatory statement provides specific direction for the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), limiting funding to urban areas representing up to 85% of national terrorism risk. The Administration has proposed the National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP) multiple times, with adjustments made in response to concerns. The committee-reported bills and Division F of P.L. 114-113 addressed concerns by barring the establishment of the National Preparedness Grant Program without congressional authorization. The Administration's FY2016 budget proposed $670 million for firefighter assistance, with $335 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. Funding for these grants' management would come from a separate FEMA account. Firefighter Assistance Grants would fall under First Responder Assistance Programs within FEMA's State and Local Programs appropriation. The Administration requested previous SAFER waivers for FY2016. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill for FY2016 provided $680 million in firefighter assistance, with $340 million allocated for AFG and $340 million for SAFER grants, matching the FY2015 level. The committee retained funding for firefighter assistance under its own account and granted FEMA waiver authority from certain SAFER requirements. Stakeholders were directed to work with FEMA to assess the feasibility of removing these waivers in future appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee bill for FY2016 provided $680 million in firefighter assistance, with $340 million for AFG and $340 million for SAFER grants, matching the FY2015 level. The committee directed FEMA to maintain funding for rural fire departments and did not include SAFER waiver authority in the House bill for FY2016. FEMA has permanent authority to grant SAFER waivers only in cases of demonstrated economic hardship. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2016 provided $690 million for firefighter assistance in FY2016, split equally between AFG and SAFER grants. The omnibus bill did not include a SAFER waiver provision. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is the main account for emergency and disaster assistance, with unused funds carried over to the next fiscal year. The Administration requests DRF funding based on past catastrophic events and a 10-year average for non-catastrophic events. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is funded based on past catastrophic events, a 10-year average for non-catastrophic events, and a reserve to prevent shortfalls. Funding for the DRF is divided into two categories: base funding for activities not directly tied to major disasters under the Stafford Act, and disaster relief costs for major disasters under the Stafford Act. The Budget Control Act allows for disaster relief costs to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to discretionary spending caps. The Administration's FY2016 budget proposed $7,375 million for the DRF. The Administration's FY2016 budget proposed $7,375 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), with $662 million for the base and $6,713 million for disaster costs. A $24 million transfer to the DHS Office of Inspector General was requested for oversight. Additionally, a $250 million rescission from prior-year DRF appropriations was proposed. The House and Senate bills included the requested amounts for the DRF. The Administration's FY2016 budget proposed $7,375 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), with $662 million for the base and $6,713 million for disaster costs. Both Senate- and House-reported bills included deeper rescissions than requested, with the Senate-reported bill rescinding $1,025 million and the House-reported bill rescinding $1,266 million from the DRF. Division F of P.L. 114-113 provided $7,374 for the DRF, including a $24 million transfer to the DHS OIG. A general provision in the omnibus rescinded almost $1,022 million in unobligated balances from the DRF, resulting in a final amount of $6,713 million for the DRF. Since FY2011, annual appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) have increased significantly, potentially reducing the need for supplemental funding. Prior to the Budget Control Act (BCA), the DRF often ran low on funds, requiring Congress to provide additional funding through supplemental appropriations. The BCA may have helped stabilize DRF funding levels, as shown in Table 5. Only one disaster relief supplemental appropriations bill has been passed since FY2011. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) has maintained a larger balance since the FY2012 appropriations cycle, reducing the need for supplemental funding. Efforts by FEMA to recover unused relief funds and deobligate excess funds have contributed to the existing balances in the DRF. This has allowed for more time to assess the need for federal assistance and target it effectively. FEMA recovers an average of $67 million a month and deobligates excess funds back to the DRF. As of June 2015, there were $7,936 million in unobligated funds in the DRF, with projections of $3,267 million remaining unobligated by the end of the year. This balance is seen as beneficial compared to pre-BCA years when a large disaster could quickly deplete funds, requiring supplemental appropriations. The DRF balance has large unobligated funds, with projections for remaining unobligated funds by the end of the year. Rescissions were made from the DRF in previous years to offset costs, with the Administration requesting rescissions for FY2015 and FY2016. In FY2015 and FY2016, Congress made rescissions totaling $375 million and almost $1,022 billion from the unobligated balances in the DRF. The budget request for the PDM program in FY2016 was $200 million, with the Senate-reported bill including $100 million and the House-reported bill including $25 million. The Administration's request marked a significant increase for the program after it had been zeroed out in previous budget cycles. The FY2015 budget request did not allocate funds for the program but considered using the PDM Fund for potential funding under the \"Opportunity, Growth and Security Initiative,\" which was not realized. The Administration requested $400 million for a separate pre-disaster mitigation initiative, indicating a shift in funding focus. Previous years saw a base level of $25-30 million for the PDM program, justified by a backlog of projects and the HMGP. The $200 million request for FY2016 suggests a reduced backlog and renewed recognition of the program's importance. P.L. 114-113 included $100 million for PDM, while the President's FY2016 budget requested $100 million for the EFS. The President's budget for FY2016 requests $100 million for the EFS program, a reduction of $20 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee concurred with the Administration's funding request while the House Appropriations Committee recommended funding the EFS program at the FY2015 level of $120 million. The EFS program was established in 1985 and placed at FEMA, but there is a proposal to shift it to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The Senate Appropriations Committee approved transferring the EFS program to HUD in their FY2015 appropriations legislation, marking the first approval in Congress. Although the transfer was not included in the final DHS appropriation for that year, future budget requests are expected to include a comprehensive outreach strategy and transition plan. The FY2016 Senate Appropriations Committee bill mandated the transfer, but the House Appropriations Committee noted the lack of provided outreach strategy and transition plan, delaying the funding and administrative transfer. The Committee does not recommend transferring funding and administrative authority as directed by legislative language in P.L. 114-113. FEMA and HUD are required to provide a transition plan within 90 days of the FY2017 budget submission, including outreach to stakeholders and maintaining the program's original purposes."
