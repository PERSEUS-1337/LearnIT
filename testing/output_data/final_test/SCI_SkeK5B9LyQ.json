    "content": "Deep learning (DL) has been widely used in natural language processing (NLP) due to its superior performance. A new architecture called Tensor Product Generation Network (TPGN) is proposed to integrate DL with explicit language structures and rules using tensor product representations (TPR). TPGN focuses on unsupervised learning of role-unbinding vectors of words and integrates TPR with typical DL architectures like LSTM models for image captioning. The approach is novel in its ability to generate sentences. The approach utilizes role-unbinding vectors in an unsupervised manner to generate sentences and extract partial grammatical structure effectively. The paper introduces a Tensor Product Generation Network (TPGN) architecture for deep-learning-based NLP applications, specifically focusing on image captioning. The TPGN model generates natural language descriptions by encoding grammatical roles for the words being generated. This approach integrates deep learning with explicit rules, such as logical and grammar rules, through tensor product representation. The architecture introduced is based on Tensor Product Representation (TPR) for neural computation of symbolic functions, including natural language generation. It utilizes Gradient Symbolic Computation (GSC) for this purpose, with implications beyond the specific tasks discussed. The paper also includes sections on related work and the organization of the content. The paper discusses the use of Tensor Product Representation (TPR) for neural computation in natural language generation. It focuses on recent deep-learning-based literature for image captioning, utilizing end-to-end deep learning with a CNN image-analysis front end. The proposed architecture is detailed in Section 4, with experimental results presented in Section 6. The network in the study is designed to support learning distributed representations that incorporate structure internal to the representations themselves. The learned representations are not constrained, but the global structure of the network is designed to display the abstract property of being TPR-capable. The network architecture is TPR-capable, using TPR for sequential output. TPR is a framework for embedding symbol structures into a vector space, enabling symbolic computation in neural networks. This approach is extended to image captioning, with TPRs allowing for conceptual interpretation. TPR is a framework for embedding symbol structures into a vector space, enabling symbolic computation in neural networks. It uses filler/role decomposition to encode complex symbol structures, assigning vectors to fillers and roles in a symbol space. The TPR framework embeds symbol structures into a vector space using filler/role decomposition. Unbinding is a key operation that undoes binding in TPRs, allowing for exact unbinding by using binding and unbinding vectors. The TPR framework involves embedding symbol structures into a vector space using filler/role decomposition. Unbinding is a crucial operation that reverses binding in TPRs, enabling exact unbinding through the use of binding and unbinding vectors. The proposed TPR-capable method introduces a network architecture designed to incorporate TPRs for tasks such as generating captions sequentially. Unlike previous approaches, this method allows for the use of TPRs within the architecture for improved performance. Our proposed system, denoted by N, uses end-to-end deep learning to generate captions effectively from image feature vectors extracted by a pre-trained CNN. The system includes a sentence-encoding subnetwork S that drives the caption-generation process by containing all the image-specific information needed. The system N utilizes a sentence-encoding subnetwork S to generate captions by unbinding words from S in iterations, updating itself as each word is generated, and decoding symbols into words using subnetworks U and L. The Tensor-Product Generation Network (TPGN) architecture utilizes a sentence-encoding subnetwork S to generate captions by unbinding words in iterations. The key operation is unbinding within S to generate the caption. The unbinding vectors provide insight into the process by which the learned matrix S gives rise to the generated caption. The Tensor-Product Generation Network (TPGN) architecture uses a sentence-encoding subnetwork S to generate captions by unbinding words in iterations. The network learns hybrid role decomposition, encoding information like filler/role binding matrices. The model computes S by binding filler vector f a to role vector r POS1 in the first iteration of generation. The Tensor-Product Generation Network (TPGN) uses a sentence-encoding subnetwork S to generate captions by unbinding words in iterations. The model computes S by binding filler vector f a to role vector r POS1 in the first iteration. The unbinding subnetwork U determines the next word based on syntactic/semantic roles, such as verbs and prepositions, and includes corresponding bindings in S for each word in the caption. The unbinding subnetwork U and sentence-encoding network S in the Tensor-Product Generation Network are implemented as LSTMs. The lexical subnetwork L is implemented as a linear transformation followed by a softmax operation. LSTM variables in S are indexed by 1, while those in U are indexed by 2. The state updating equations for S involve forget-, input-, and output-gates, and the initial state \u015c 0 is initialized accordingly. The sentence-encoding subnet S and unbinding subnet U in the Tensor-Product Generation Network are interconnected LSTMs. The visual input is encoded by vector v while the output caption words are encoded by x t. The initial states and updating equations for U are also defined. The Tensor-Product Generation Network includes interconnected LSTMs for the sentence-encoding subnet S and unbinding subnet U. The architecture also involves a lexical subnetwork L for producing decoded words. The performance evaluation is conducted using the COCO dataset. The proposed architecture uses the COCO dataset with 123,287 images annotated with 5 captions each. The dataset is split into 113,287 images for training, 5,000 for validation, and 5,000 for testing. The vocabulary consists of 8,791 words, and ResNet-152 is used for the CNN. The model is implemented in TensorFlow with default settings. The evaluation results are based on the MS COCO dataset. The evaluation results on the MS COCO dataset are reported in TAB0, including BLEU, METEOR, and CIDEr metrics. The proposed TPGN outperforms the CNN-LSTM baseline in all metrics, showing significant improvement in generating longer subsequences. In this paper, a new Tensor Product Generation Network (TPGN) is proposed for natural language generation tasks. The model, based on Tensor Product Representations, shows significant improvements in captioning on the MS COCO dataset compared to LSTM-based models. The TPGN architecture enhances the generation of longer subsequences and contains important grammatical information. Future work will explore extending Tensor Product Representations to other NLP tasks."
