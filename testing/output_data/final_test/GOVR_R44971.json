    "content": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are responsible for reviewing proposed mergers to ensure they comply with federal antitrust laws. This report discusses the statutes governing pre-merger review and the guidelines for assessing mergers. The Clayton Act and the FTC Act specifically address proposed mergers, with Section 7 of the Clayton Act applying to mergers that may lessen competition or create a monopoly. The Clayton Act and the FTC Act prohibit mergers that may reduce competition or create a monopoly, unless exempt. The FTC enforces standards similar to the DOJ's under Section 5 of the FTC Act. These laws aim to preserve market competition and prevent anticompetitive harm, focusing on the likelihood of future harm rather than certainty. The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (HSR Act) requires businesses to report proposed mergers and transactions above certain thresholds to the DOJ and FTC to assess compliance with antitrust laws. The agencies can block mergers if they are likely to substantially lessen competition. Under the HSR Act, transacting parties must provide non-public information to agencies, including details about themselves, the proposed transaction, and their markets. Information submitted is confidential and can only be disclosed in legal proceedings. The DOJ or FTC reviews pre-merger notifications and seeks clearance from the other agency to investigate. The agency with expertise in relevant markets conducts the investigation, reviewing information provided by the parties. The reviewing agency assesses proposed mergers by reviewing information from transacting parties and other market participants. They may issue a second request for more information or allow the transaction to complete. If parties withdraw and refile, the waiting period restarts. Additional information may be required during the waiting period to ensure compliance with antitrust laws. The agency may gather evidence from entities not involved in the transaction. The reviewing agency may interview customers and market participants, issue a Second Request for information, and have a waiting period for compliance. If parties fail to comply, the agency can request a court order for compliance. Time between the Second Request and a final decision can be lengthy. The FTC and DOJ use shared guidelines for assessing mergers. The FTC and DOJ use shared guidelines, including the Horizontal Merger Guidelines, to assess mergers between competitors under the Clayton and FTC Acts. Horizontal and vertical mergers raise different competitive concerns and are evaluated separately. The Horizontal Merger Guidelines help agencies evaluate competitive concerns in mergers by assessing market power and potential harm to consumers. Agencies define product and geographic markets to gauge the impact on market power, focusing on whether the merger would lessen competition. The Horizontal Merger Guidelines assist agencies in evaluating competitive concerns in mergers by defining product markets using the \"Hypothetical Monopolist Test.\" The DOJ's 2016 suit blocking Deere's acquisition of Precision Planting illustrates how agencies determine relevant product markets. The DOJ defines product markets using the \"Hypothetical Monopolist Test.\" In a recent case, the DOJ argued that high-speed precision planting systems are a distinct market, making other planting systems ineffective substitutes. Another case involved blocking a merger between Aetna and Humana, focusing on the market for Medicare Advantage policies. Traditional Medicare was not considered part of the relevant market. The DOJ defines product markets using the \"Hypothetical Monopolist Test.\" In a recent case, the DOJ argued that high-speed precision planting systems are a distinct market, making other planting systems ineffective substitutes. Another case involved blocking a merger between Aetna and Humana, focusing on the market for Medicare Advantage policies. The district court agreed that Medicare Advantage policies, but not traditional Medicare, constituted the relevant market. The Supreme Court emphasized a pragmatic, factual approach to defining the relevant geographic market, which could be the entire United States or a smaller region depending on the products and services at issue. When reviewing mergers, the DOJ defines relevant markets and assesses market concentration using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). This index calculates market concentration by summing the squares of individual firms' market shares. U.S. courts also use HHI calculations to determine if a merger would create market power. The DOJ and FTC use HHI calculations to evaluate market power in mergers. Transactions increasing HHI by 200+ points and resulting in HHI above 2500 are deemed to lessen competition. The presumption can be rebutted with evidence. Mergers reducing market participants may lead to anti-competitive behavior like price increases. The merged entity's behavior concerns reviewing agencies if consumers see their products as substitutes. The DOJ and FTC use HHI calculations to assess market power in mergers, with a focus on transactions that increase HHI by 200+ points and result in HHI above 2500. Mergers reducing market participants can lead to anti-competitive behavior such as price increases. Concerns arise about the merged entity's potential to raise prices unilaterally and reduce production capacity to elevate prices in markets with homogenous products. The merger may lead to increased market prices by reducing output and increasing the benefits of a price hike. The merged entity could potentially shut down high-cost plants to drive up prices, harming customers despite shifting some output. The merger may harm customers by reducing output and increasing prices, despite shifting production to lower-cost plants. Regulatory agencies also consider the impact on innovation, as seen in the review of Dow Chemical's merger with DuPont, where competition between the companies drove research and development of new products. The DOJ opposed AT&T's acquisition of T-Mobile due to potential negative impacts on innovation and competition. Regulatory agencies also assess the risk of coordinated interaction in mergers to prevent market manipulation. The FTC and DOJ consider the risk of coordinated interaction in mergers, believing that fewer participants in a market are more likely to engage in parallel actions post-merger. For instance, the DOJ opposed AT&T's acquisition of T-Mobile, citing concerns that reducing the number of competitive wireless providers could lead to coordinated price increases. The FTC also expressed worries about market manipulation in mergers involving companies like H.J. Heinz. The FTC and DOJ assess the anticompetitive effects of proposed mergers, considering factors like market entry barriers. Easy entry indicates less impact on competition, while significant barriers suggest reduced competition. Mergers can benefit the economy by generating higher prices for wireless services and potential coordination among major baby food producers. The FTC and DOJ assess potential mergers for their impact on competition, considering market entry barriers. Mergers can lead to efficiencies that enhance competition, but these efficiencies must be verifiable and not result from anticompetitive practices. Additionally, the reviewing agency may consider if one party is failing in the market. The DOJ and FTC analyze mergers for their impact on competition, including potential market exit of a failing party. They also consider vertical mergers where one entity controls multiple production stages. Vertical mergers are seen as less anticompetitive than horizontal mergers due to potential efficiency gains. The 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines do not address vertical mergers directly. The DOJ and FTC have taken enforcement action against some vertical mergers that were seen as reducing competition, typically through consent agreements. They consider if the merged entity would have incentives to limit competition in the market. The DOJ and FTC consider factors like limiting competition in markets when evaluating vertical mergers. An example is Comcast's joint venture with NBC and GE, where conditions were imposed to prevent anticompetitive behavior. The reviewing agency decides whether to permit a merger, block it, or negotiate conditions to alleviate anticompetitive concerns. If the agency seeks to block the merger, legal action may be taken. The DOJ pursues potential violations of the Clayton Act in federal court, seeking to prevent and restrain violations of Section 7. They may seek a preliminary injunction to halt a merger, and may consolidate it with a motion for a permanent injunction to expedite litigation. To obtain a permanent injunction, the DOJ must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the merger would violate antitrust laws. In antitrust cases, the reviewing court is not bound by the DOJ's administrative review determination. If the DOJ obtains a permanent injunction, the merger may not proceed unless a consent agreement is reached. Such agreements may require divestment of assets or other actions to address anticompetitive concerns. The DOJ will file a motion for an injunction and a proposed consent agreement for court approval in these cases. The Tunney Act requires the DOJ to file consent agreements in federal court and publish them for public comment before the court can approve them. The parties must adhere to a Hold Separate Order, which outlines assets to be kept separate or divested to address anticompetitive concerns before the merger can proceed. The DOJ must file written comments related to proposals with the court and publish them in the Federal Register. After the comment period, a response to the comments is filed and published. The reviewing court may approve the consent order if it is in the public interest. The FTC has a different process for challenging mergers, using enforcement tools under the FTC Act and Clayton Act. The FTC has various avenues to prevent antitrust violations in mergers. The FTC has administrative and judicial avenues to prevent mergers violating antitrust laws, including challenging proposed mergers under the Clayton Act and FTC Act. Section 13(b) of the FTC Act allows the FTC to request court injunctions against activities violating antitrust statutes. If the FTC challenges a merger without a consent agreement, it files a motion for a preliminary injunction in federal court. The FTC can request court injunctions against antitrust violations under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act. If granted, the parties cannot complete the transaction during administrative proceedings. The FTC can request court injunctions against antitrust violations under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act. If granted, the parties cannot complete the transaction during administrative proceedings. If the court denies the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction, administrative proceedings are automatically stayed while the FTC determines whether to continue. The Federal Trade Commissioners review ALJ initial decisions and may hear oral arguments before issuing a final decision. If the Commission decides a transaction would lessen competition, parties can appeal to a federal appellate court. In practice, the FTC may use judicial and administrative processes to challenge proposed transactions. The FTC typically uses administrative processes for consent agreements, which are subject to public comment for 30 days. Consent agreements involving mergers may require divestitures and Hold Separate Orders to keep certain assets separate. The FTC may issue a Hold Separate Order along with a complaint when publishing a proposed consent agreement for comment. After the public comment period and any adjustments, the final decision and consent agreement may be submitted to the Commission for approval. If approved, the FTC issues a Final Decision and Order, ending the proceedings related to mergers and acquisitions that may lessen competition. The DOJ and FTC use specific laws to assess the impact of proposed transactions on competition in relevant markets. They may allow the transaction, negotiate with parties to address antitrust concerns, or block the transaction."
