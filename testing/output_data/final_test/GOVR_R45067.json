Eligible hospitals must be free-standing children's hospitals with a Medicare Provider Agreement and excluded from the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS). The CHGME program supports children's hospitals for training pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists. Eligible hospitals must be free-standing, have a Medicare Provider Agreement, and be excluded from the Medicare IPPS. The 2013 program expansion made additional hospitals eligible if they had an inpatient population under 18 years old and an approved medical residency program not qualified for Medicare GME payments. The CHGME program supports children's hospitals for pediatric residency training. It was created in 1999 to provide federal support as Medicare funding is based on patient volume, which is low for children's hospitals. New programs include one psychiatric hospital and three previously non-participating hospitals. Advocates argue that the lack of federal support for GME in children's hospitals hinders pediatric workforce development. Children's hospitals have the patient volume needed to train pediatric subspecialists. Despite increases in the pediatric subspecialty workforce, some children still lack access to care. Children's hospitals face physician vacancies and hiring challenges in certain subspecialties. HRSA's CHGME program plays a significant role in training pediatric physicians, providing financial support to over 7,100 medical residents and fellows in the 2015-2016 academic year. 41% were pediatric residents, 33% were pediatric subspecialty residents or fellows, and 26% were residents training in other primary disciplines. The program was created in the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999 to support medical residents in children's hospitals. The CHGME program was initially authorized in 1999 to support medical resident training in children's hospitals. It has been reauthorized multiple times, with changes to payment methodology and eligibility criteria. The most recent reauthorization in 2013 expanded eligibility to include children's psychiatric hospitals and hospitals facing technical barriers. The CHGME program was reauthorized in 2018 through the Dr. Benjy Frances Brooks Children's Hospital GME Support Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-241), extending funding and authorization until FY2023. Despite lapses in authorization in previous years, the program has consistently received funding since its inception in 1999. The Hospital GME Support Reauthorization Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-241) reauthorized the CHGME program appropriations through FY2023, increasing the authorized amount to $325 million. The funding is allocated with $105 million for Direct Graduate Medical Education Payments (DGME) and $220 million for Indirect Graduate Medical Education Payments (IME). The President's budget for FY2019 proposed to eliminate funding for the CHGME program and redistribute funds to hospitals based on the number of residents trained and the proportion of Medicare or Medicaid patients. The new program, jointly managed by HRSA and CMS, would adjust hospital payments based on resident training in priority specialties. It would be funded from the Treasury's general fund and require new legislation to amend existing programs. CHGME payments mirror Medicare GME payments, covering direct and indirect costs of residency training. The CHGME program provides funding to hospitals for residency training, similar to Medicare GME payments. However, CHGME funds are discretionary and require annual appropriations from Congress, while Medicare GME funds are mandatory and drawn from the Medicare trust funds. There are also differences in reporting requirements between the two programs. The CHGME program requires annual appropriations from Congress, while Medicare GME funds are drawn from the Medicare trust funds. CHGME funding is limited by annual appropriations, which can result in reduced funds for existing hospitals if new hospitals are added. In contrast, Medicare GME funds are based on residency training programs, Medicare-recognized residents, and inpatient volume, with no impact on funds for other hospitals. CHGME hospitals must report resident training numbers to HRSA, with potential penalties for non-compliance. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) does not require reporting data on trainees supported with Medicare funds, unlike HRSA which aggregates data on residency training programs and requires reporting on various aspects such as specialty types, number of residents supported, training programs for diverse children, curriculum changes, and graduates practicing in service areas. CMS lacks similar reporting requirements for Medicare GME and does not collect detailed component data. The 2013 CHGME reauthorization included authorization for a quality bonus system for hospitals meeting standards, with programs submitting resident involvement data in quality initiatives for baseline in FY2019. No similar system exists for Medicare GME payments, but expert groups recommend awarding based on program performance. The CHGME program provides GME funds to children's hospitals, starting in FY2000. The CHGME program supports training at 58 free-standing children's hospitals in 29 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. More than half of states have an eligible hospital receiving CHGME payments, with residents in other states benefiting by traveling to these hospitals or receiving care from trained pediatric specialists. The 10 states receiving the highest CHGME payments in FY2017 are not specified. In FY2017, the 10 states with the highest CHGME payments had large children's hospitals receiving over $5 million annually. The number of residents receiving CHGME support has increased over time, but funding and hospital participation have varied. CHGME funds support medical residency training at children's hospitals, with some years seeing fewer hospitals receiving funds but training more residents. The 2013 reauthorization added new hospitals to the program while reserving funds to mitigate payment decreases for existing participants. Other sources of funding for residency training include patient care revenue, Medicaid, state funds, and private donations, but CHGME payments are the only quantifiable source. Some argue that the availability of other funding sources lessens the need for the CHGME program. The assessment of the CHGME program highlighted that children's hospitals have higher profit margins, potentially providing more revenue for training programs. It recommended closer tracking of hospital accountability and assessing the program's continuation. Recent data show children's hospitals still have higher profit margins and some provide little charity care despite their tax-exempt status. The use of hospital revenue to support GME is not systematically tracked. No systematic data exist on hospital revenue supporting GME, making it unclear if hospitals use their revenue for this purpose. The impact of the CHGME program on pediatric residency training is evident, but it's uncertain if the pediatric workforce growth is solely due to this program. Medicaid reimbursements also contribute to GME funding for children's hospitals, but data on their utilization are limited. States may use Medicaid funds to support Graduate Medical Education (GME), but not all choose to do so. Data on states' use of Medicaid funds for GME are limited. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and CMS-64 data provide information on Medicaid GME payments, with AAMC reporting that 42 states and the District of Columbia made payments for GME in 2015. The number of states providing support has declined since 2005, but remained consistent between 2013 and 2015, with an estimated total of $4.26 million. The total amount awarded to children's hospitals from Medicaid GME payments was estimated at $4.26 billion in 2015, an increase from previous years. CMS administers the Medicaid program and reported lower expenditure data compared to AAMC, with $1.9 billion in payments made through the fee-for-service delivery system in FY2016. This difference in data may be due to various reasons, such as the exclusion of payments made through state-managed care in CMS-64 data. The CHGME program collects data on residents trained, which differs from other federally supported GME programs like Medicare. This data may be useful for Congress to examine for determining program effectiveness and potential policy changes. The CHGME program collects data on residents trained, which could be valuable for Congress to assess program effectiveness. It is also implementing a unique quality bonus system for programs meeting set targets, aligning with expert recommendations. This system's potential application to other GME programs may warrant future congressional oversight.
