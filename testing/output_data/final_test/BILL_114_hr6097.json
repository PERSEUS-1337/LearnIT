    "content": "The \"Immigration Courts Bail Reform Act\" may be cited as the short title. Conditions on detention of aliens are outlined in the Act. Section 236 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include provisions for bond conditions set by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the review of initial custody determinations by an immigration judge. Procedures for custody hearings are outlined for aliens taken into custody under the Act, excluding children under the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. The Secretary of Homeland Security must file the Notice to Appear within 72 hours of an alien being taken into custody and serve it on the alien. The Secretary must also decide on custody within 72 hours and serve the decision on the alien, specifying reasons for continued custody and any bond amount. The Secretary may detain the alien only if clear and convincing evidence shows that no conditions will assure their appearance and the safety of others. The alien has the right to appear before an immigration judge promptly for a custody redetermination hearing, which can be postponed for up to 72 hours with good cause. The hearing must occur within 6 days of the alien being taken into custody. The immigration judge advises the alien of the right to postpone the custody redetermination hearing for up to 14 days. The judge reviews the custody determination de novo and can only continue to detain the alien if clear and convincing evidence is provided by the Secretary. In custody determinations, the Secretary or immigration judge must release the alien on personal recognizance or an unsecured appearance bond unless it is determined that release would not assure appearance or would endanger safety. If release under these conditions is not sufficient, the alien may be released with the least restrictive further condition. In determining whether to impose a bond as a condition of release, the Secretary or immigration judge considers the alien's financial ability to pay a bond and alternative conditions of supervision to ensure appearance and safety. The Secretary or immigration judge cannot require a financial condition leading to the detention of the alien. The immigration judge can review custody decisions for certain aliens and consider non-detention alternatives if the alien is not a danger to the community. The Attorney General must hold custody redetermination hearings every 90 days for aliens remaining in custody, with the option for a hearing at any time for good cause. The Secretary must inform detained aliens of their rights, including the option to request a bond redetermination if unable to post bond despite good faith efforts."
