    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5) was passed in response to the economic downturn in 2009. It aimed to create jobs, promote economic recovery, and invest in infrastructure projects. The legislation included funding for water infrastructure programs and projects, which were available for obligation until September 30, 2010. The legislation aimed to create jobs and promote economic recovery by funding infrastructure projects, including traditional (e.g., highways, airports, schools) and less traditional (e.g., broadband, electric power transmission grid) categories. Proponents argued that increased government spending on public works could quickly create jobs and stimulate economic growth. The legislation aimed to create jobs and promote economic recovery through infrastructure funding, particularly in the construction sector. Both supporters and critics favored more infrastructure spending, with some urging changes to increase short-term stimulative provisions. Only one specific proposal to increase infrastructure funds was adopted during the debates. The enacted legislation included additional funds for high-speed rail projects and general provisions for all water infrastructure projects funded by the legislation. The legislation aimed to create jobs and promote economic recovery through infrastructure funding, particularly in the construction sector. Two general provisions focused on delivering federal funds quickly, with a goal for at least 50% of funds to be initiated within 120 days of enactment. Another provision required all funds to be obligated by September 30, 2010. Additionally, local entities receiving financial assistance were required to use American-made iron, steel, and manufactured goods in their projects. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act aimed to create jobs and promote economic recovery through infrastructure funding, with provisions for quick fund delivery and requirements for the use of American-made goods in projects. Section 1606 of the act directed projects funded by ARRA to comply with prevailing wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act, which critics argue increases construction costs and hampers competition while supporters believe it stabilizes the local construction industry. The federal Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act regulate wastewater treatment and drinking water quality in the United States to prevent harmful waste discharge. These laws also provide financial assistance for communities to build treatment facilities in compliance with the regulations. The federal government provides financial assistance to communities for water infrastructure projects through State Revolving Funds (SRFs), with Congress appropriating federal capitalization grants as seed money. States match 20% of the federal grant and provide loans to communities, aiming for sustainability through loan repayments. SRF grants are allocated by the EPA's State and Tribal Assistance Grants account, historically playing a significant role in assisting communities with wastewater funding needs. The federal government provides financial assistance to communities through State Revolving Funds (SRFs) for water infrastructure projects. Congress has appropriated over $85 billion since 1973 for wastewater funding and more than $14 billion since 1997 for drinking water treatment. Despite high funding needs of $203 billion for wastewater and $277 billion for drinking water, appropriations for EPA assistance have decreased. The Recovery Act provided an additional $4.0 billion for clean water SRFs and $2.0 billion for drinking water SRFs in FY2009. The legislation waived the 20% match requirement for federal capitalization grants as requested by many states. The Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act allow states to provide low-interest or no-interest loans from the State Revolving Funds (SRF) with a 20% match requirement for federal capitalization grants. The Recovery Act also allowed states to offer additional subsidization like negative interest loans, grants, or principal forgiveness without project-specific limits. States were required to use 50% of the capitalization grant for additional subsidization and at least 20% for \"green infrastructure\" projects. Allocation of funds to states is based on existing formulas, with the Clean Water SRF governed by the CWA and drinking water SRF by separate regulations.

The Recovery Act also allowed states to offer additional subsidization like negative interest loans, grants, or principal forgiveness without project-specific limits. States were required to use 50% of the capitalization grant for additional subsidization and at least 20% for \"green infrastructure\" projects. Allocation of funds to states is based on existing formulas, with the Clean Water SRF governed by the CWA and drinking water SRF by separate regulations. Funding levels in the bill determine the amounts that states were eligible to receive, with a percentage reserved for EPA to provide assistance to Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Village water systems. Program oversight funds are also reserved for EPA's use. States awarded ARRA SRF assistance to projects on their Intended Use Plans. EPA was directed to submit a report on the allocation of funds. The EPA was directed to submit reports to Congress on the expenditure of funds provided by the legislation, including a general plan and detailed project information. Recipients of ARRA funds must report quarterly on fund expenditure and job creation estimates. The legislation required ARRA funds to be obligated by September 30, 2010, with special deadline provisions for the SRF monies. States made decisions on wastewater and drinking water projects to be funded, not the EPA. The legislation included special deadline provisions for State Revolving Fund (SRF) monies, prioritizing projects that could start construction within 12 months. Funds not under contract or construction by February 17, 2010, would be redistributed. Rural and non-rural communities competed for funding, with rural areas eligible for grants and loans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for projects in communities of 10,000 or less. The Recovery Act provided $1.38 billion in additional funding for water and wastewater projects in rural areas, addressing a $2.4 billion backlog of requests. A provision in the legislation allocated at least 10% of the funding for assistance in persistent poverty counties. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocated $150 million for Economic Development Administration (EDA) grants to support economic development in distressed areas. This funding was in addition to the $1.38 billion provided for water and wastewater projects in rural areas. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocated $150 million for EDA grants, with additional funding for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program and EPA's Recovery Act funds for wastewater and drinking water projects. CDBG funds are used by state and local governments for economic development priorities, affordable housing, and public facility improvements, with a requirement that at least 70% of funds benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Regular FY2009 funding for CDBG was $3.6 billion, and FY2010 funding was $3.99 billion. EPA's Recovery Act funds were disbursed to states for water projects. EPA quickly issued guidance to states on awarding funds for wastewater and drinking water projects under the ARRA. States had to allocate at least 20% of funds for green infrastructure projects and provide detailed plans for fund usage, including principal forgiveness. Most states funded projects from existing priority lists to meet construction deadlines, while some created new lists. EPA awarded $6.0 billion in clean water and drinking water SRF grants to states, DC, Puerto Rico, and one Territory by December 2009. Funds were obligated by September 30, 2010, with construction started on 99% of projects. States provided subsidization through principal forgiveness, negative interest loans, grants, or a combination, with at least 50% of ARRA funds required for this purpose. States were required to use at least 50% of ARRA funds as subsidization for clean water and drinking water SRF assistance. The concept of principal forgiveness or negative interest loans reduces repayment burden for communities. There is a tension in how states will use this authority, as cities' budgets are also under pressure. Recipients prefer grants or partial grants over loans that must be fully repaid. Generous subsidization benefits few communities greatly, while more restrictive subsidization could assist more communities. Many states are concerned about providing financial assistance to communities with subsidies, as it may result in less than 100% repayment to the SRF, impacting its long-term ability to support future investments. OMB and EPA issued guidance on implementing the Buy American provision for ARRA funds, including waivers for SRF assistance recipients to apply for exemptions. EPA has granted nationwide and project-specific waivers to support public interest provisions. The Buy American provision in the ARRA for water infrastructure projects led to controversy due to high waiver thresholds based on cost increases and limited availability of U.S.-made products. Critics raised concerns about potential monopolies, increased project costs, and discriminatory effects on trade with Canada. Many policymakers supported the Buy American provision in the ARRA law to create domestic jobs, despite concerns about its discriminatory effects on trade with Canada. States and localities had to meet the law's mandate of using at least 20% of SRF monies for \"green\" projects, with EPA reporting that all states met this requirement and are investing 28% of ARRA funds in energy efficiency projects. The use of ARRA funds for water projects includes various types of efficiency projects like solar panels and wind turbines, water efficiency projects, environmentally innovative projects, and green infrastructure projects. Congress extended the 20% GPR requirement to regular FY2010 appropriations for clean water and drinking water SRF programs. Other federal agencies also received ARRA funds for wastewater and drinking water projects. As of September 30, 2010, USDA had obligated $1.38 billion in grant and loan funds for rural water projects in over 800 communities. EDA awarded $150 million in ARRA funds to 68 grants in 37 states, including $27 million for \"green\" jobs. HUD allocated $1.0 billion in ARRA CDBG funds to 1,200 state and local governments for project selection. During the 111th Congress, committees oversaw the implementation of the Recovery Act, including water infrastructure funding provisions. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee requested certifications from governors for ARRA-funded projects. Other committees involved in oversight were the House Natural Resources Committee, House and Senate Appropriations Committees, and the House Science and Technology Committee. EPA, EDA, and the Army Corps of Engineers provided testimony on fund disbursement and project assistance. The Technology Committee investigated government agencies' transparency and accountability for Recovery Act spending. The EPA Inspector General warned of challenges in timely spending, risk of fraud, waste, and abuse, and concerns about meeting project deadlines. EPA officials were working to assist states in avoiding reallocation of funds. The EPA Inspector General received $20 million in ARRA funds to audit EPA's use of funds. Reports highlighted challenges with Buy American and \"green infrastructure\" requirements, workload issues, and the need for guidance on \"green reserve\" projects. The federal government has a history of involvement in water resource projects. The federal government has a long history of involvement in water resource development projects, including dams, levees, coastal protection, and navigation works. Recently, Congress has funded projects for aquatic ecosystem restoration, water recycling, and rural water supply. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers focuses on navigation, flood control, and aquatic restoration, while the Bureau of Reclamation manages projects in the western states for irrigation, water supply, flood control, power production, and recreation. The federal government funds water resource development projects for various purposes in the 17 western states through annual Energy and Water Development appropriations bills. The economic recovery legislation provided additional funding for water resources activities at various agencies. P.L. 111-5 allocated $4.6 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with funds directed towards civil works activities. The economic recovery legislation allocated $4.6 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with funds directed towards civil works activities. Some funds were also directed to activities other than federal water resources projects, including the Corps regulatory program and the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. Additionally, $200 million was reserved for water-related environmental infrastructure projects. The legislation specified that the funds should be used for projects, programs, or activities that could be completed with the stimulus funds and should not create future budgetary obligations. The economic recovery legislation allocated $4.6 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for civil works activities, with funds directed towards various projects. Additionally, $200 million was reserved for water-related environmental infrastructure projects. P.L. 111-5 authorized unlimited reprogramming authority for Corps and Reclamation funds provided under the legislation, with quarterly reports required on fund allocation and expenditure. ARRA provided $1.0 billion for Reclamation projects and programs, with $126 million specifically designated for water reclamation and reuse projects. The Recovery Act allocated funds for various water-related projects, including $126 million for water reclamation and reuse projects. It also authorized Reclamation to extend repayment timeframes for water supply customers for maintenance and replacement of facilities. Under the House and Senate versions of the bill, Reclamation could extend repayment up to 25 years without interest for small watershed programs that provide technical advisory services and financial assistance for erosion prevention, flood damage reduction, and conservation of land and water resources through various structural and nonstructural measures. Agricultural watershed programs allocate funding based on factors like risk to life, water conservation, and erosion control. P.L. 111-5 provided ARRA funding for three agricultural watershed programs: Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations for flood prevention and water quality improvement, $145 million for purchasing and restoring floodplain easements, and $50 million for Watershed Rehabilitation to rehabilitate dam projects. The ARRA funding under P.L. 111-5 allocated $50 million for NRCS activities, which was 4.8 times the FY2010 appropriations. The funds were to be used for projects that could be promptly completed, with further direction provided in the conference report. Additionally, $220 million was designated for the International Boundary and Water Commission for water quantity programs, focusing on flood damage reduction infrastructure upgrades. The ARRA funding allocated $50 million for NRCS activities, significantly more than FY2010 appropriations. The distribution of water resources funds under P.L. 111-5 was initially unclear, with broad prioritization criteria outlined in the conference report. Congress typically distributes funds across individual projects or programs, but P.L. 111-5 specified categories for allocation. The Administration later notified Congress on how the funds would be distributed. When ARRA was enacted, questions arose about the ability of federal water resources agencies to use the funds within the deadlines due to project complexity and existing workloads. P.L. 111-5 allocated $4.6 billion among six Corps accounts, with $2 billion for Operation and Maintenance and Construction each, and $375 million for the Mississippi River. The Administration allocated $4.4 billion for 1,182 water projects in 49 states and nine FUSRAP sites under the ARRA. Criteria from P.L. 111-5, conference report, and executive branch policy were used to select projects. $200 million was reserved for project cost contingencies. The Corps of Engineers was authorized to conduct beach nourishment projects to reduce property damage from coastal storms, but these projects were not funded in recent budget requests, leading to criticism. Concerns were raised about the exclusion of beach nourishment projects and \"new starts\" from the ARRA project list. The Corps reported obligating 97% of its funds by late 2010, following oversight hearings by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee during the 111th Congress. The Corps of Engineers reported obligating 97% of its funds by late 2010. Some ARRA funds were reallocated for additional projects due to lower than expected bids. Recipients estimate that the funds helped create or maintain 8,500 jobs. Reclamation outlined projects funded under ARRA in April 2009, allocating $945 million for various program areas. The House Natural Resources Water and Power Subcommittee held oversight hearings on Reclamation ARRA funding, including grants and emergency drought relief totaling $40 million. An additional $50 million was allocated for the Central Utah Project Completion Act, with $5 million for management. Concerns were raised about the lack of emergency drought funding and funding for aging infrastructure. $135 million of the $451 million for water supply needs is estimated to go towards 27 projects authorized under Reclamation's water reuse authority. $200 million will go towards 27 projects authorized under Reclamation's water reuse authority, with most projects in California. An additional $200 million will be used for rural water supply projects. Reclamation has funded various projects, with regional funding ranging from $28.3 million to $260 million. By the end of FY2010, Reclamation had obligated 95% of its stimulus funding. NRCS had obligated over $339 million of the $340 million available through ARRA by December 2010. NRCS has obligated $339 million of the $340 million available through ARRA. The majority of projects are expected to be under construction or complete by September 2011. Updates are provided to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Approximately $49.9 million has been allocated to rehabilitate 20 flood control structures, with construction underway on ten projects and three projects already complete. Some projects have been withdrawn due to challenges like engineering issues and sponsor cost-share requirements. The enacted legislation provided $290 million for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations and purchasing floodplain easements. NRCS has obligated over $144.2 million for 88 projects in 27 states, with 48 projects under construction and 34 complete. Additionally, NRCS has obligated over $144.5 million for floodplain easements, closing and purchasing 224 easements with plans for restoration on 238 easements. NRCS expects most restoration work to be complete by the end of FY2011, totaling 273 easements and over 41,400 floodplain acres purchased through ARRA funding. The NRCS purchased floodplain acres through ARRA funding. The IBWC awarded contracts for levee projects, with construction anticipated to be completed by September 2011. Funding infrastructure is a long-term investment that should lead to durable and financially productive outcomes. Water infrastructure projects involve complicated planning and construction efforts spanning multiple years. The debate over infrastructure spending for economic recovery focuses on the stimulative impact of long-term investments. Critics argue that rushing to fund \"ready to go\" projects may lead to spending on low-value projects. Assessing the economic and environmental benefits of ARRA projects will take time due to their multi-year nature. Oversight measures in ARRA aim to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in contracts. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2009 and FY2010 for existing federal programs. Federal agencies face challenges in managing recipients' activities to achieve ARRA's goals while ensuring quick expenditures. The law was unique in that FY2009 supplemental funds were enacted before regular FY2009 appropriations for most agencies. The omnibus appropriations bill signed in March 2009 (P.L. 111-8) provided similar funding for water infrastructure programs as in FY2008. Recovery Act funds for water infrastructure saw a significant increase, prompting calls for sustained high levels in regular appropriations to avoid project disruptions. Stakeholders emphasized the need for consistent funding over multiple years to ensure project planning and implementation continuity. The FY2010 appropriations for water infrastructure programs were slightly higher than regular FY2009 appropriations, but not as large as the ARRA supplemental amounts. Sustaining high spending levels in future years is uncertain due to fiscal challenges and potential changes in Congress after the 2010 election. The 112th Congress is expected to focus on reducing federal spending, which may impact infrastructure programs. It is unclear if water infrastructure will be equally affected or if investments in infrastructure will be seen as supporting economic activity and protected from major reductions."
