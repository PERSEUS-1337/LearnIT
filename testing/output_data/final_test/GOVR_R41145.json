    "content": "The shape of U.S. trade policy will be influenced by political factors and economic conditions, with public opinion playing a significant role. Recent surveys show ambivalence or opposition among Americans towards trade liberalization, with a majority believing free trade agreements harm the United States. Recent surveys show that Americans have mixed feelings about free trade agreements, with a majority believing they are harmful. However, there is support for increasing trade with major partners like Canada, Japan, and the EU. The U.S. business community generally supports trade agreements, while the agriculture sector is mostly in favor but some groups, like sugar producers, oppose them. U.S. labor is typically skeptical of trade deals, and some NGOs are against trade liberalization while others see it as a path to economic growth. Congress reflects public ambivalence on trade policy, with support for trade liberalization declining over the years. The House approved \"fast-track trade authority\" in 1974 by a vote of 272-140, but in 2001, the House passed the most recent version by a thinner margin of 215-214. Votes on specific trade agreements show greater congressional ambivalence on trade liberalization. On November 8, 2007, the House passed implementing legislation for the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement by a vote of 285-132, and the U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central American (DR-CAFTA) by a narrower margin of 217-215. Senate votes on fast-track and trade agreements were not as close. Presidents have favored trade liberalization for economic and foreign policy reasons, despite acknowledging its adverse effects on some segments of the economy. The Tokyo Round Agreements were completed and enacted under President Carter, while NAFTA and the Uruguay Round Agreements were enacted under President Clinton. President Obama has shown support for pending free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea, as well as the completion of the Doha Development Agenda negotiations. Congress holds authority over foreign trade according to the U.S. Constitution. Congress historically set tariff rates for foreign trade policy, with tariffs being a major revenue source. Northern manufacturing regions favored protectionist tariffs, while southern raw material exporting regions pushed for lower tariffs. Over time, Congress delegated trade authority to the President, such as with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. This Act allowed the President to negotiate agreements reducing tariffs within approved levels on a most-favored-nation basis. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 allowed the President to negotiate tariffs on a most-favored-nation basis. The RTAA was the first time Congress delegated major trade authority to the President, aiming to reduce pressure to protect specific industries from import competition and assure trading partners that agreements would not be changed by Congress. Congress expanded presidential trade authority over the years, culminating in fast-track authority under the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Act of 1974 granted fast-track authority to the President for implementing certain trade agreements, subject to expedited legislative procedures. Additional trade policy authority has been delegated to the executive branch, allowing for the implementation of trade remedies such as anti-dumping and countervailing duty programs. These programs aim to offset price advantages from dumping and foreign government subsidies on imports. Congress has delegated trade policy authority to the President and the USITC to implement trade remedies like the escape clause (section 201) to address surges in fairly traded imports. Congress maintains control by setting procedures and criteria for relevant agencies to follow in implementing statutes. Trade promotion authority is subject to renewal and requires the President to adhere to deadlines, negotiating objectives, and consultation with Congress for expedited legislative procedures. Congress has tightened the reins on trade policy over the past two decades, shifting power away from the executive branch and back to itself. This includes expanding negotiating objectives and consultation requirements for trade agreements, as well as reducing executive discretion in trade remedy programs to benefit domestic industries. The executive-legislative relationship on trade policy involves inherent institutional tension, even when controlled by the same party. The President represents the country's interests in trade policy, while Congress reflects individual constituent groups. Bipartisan cooperation is needed when individual and national interests conflict. U.S. trade has grown significantly, with exports and imports now equaling 25% of GDP. World trade has also expanded rapidly. The role of trade in the world economy has increased significantly, with world trade in goods and services growing from $3.7 trillion in 1989 to $15.2 trillion in 2009. The United States accounts for 25% of the world's GDP but only 5% of the population, indicating a large potential consumer base outside its borders. The global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn have had a significant impact on trade policy, with U.S. exports and imports fluctuating in response to slumping world demand. The impact of the global financial crisis on world trade led to a 12% decline in 2009, the largest drop since World War II. The U.S. trade policy may be influenced by the high unemployment rate of 9.8%, despite economic growth resuming. Historical examples like the Smoot-Hawley tariffs in 1930 show that protectionist measures can worsen recessions. The inclusion of a \"Buy American\" provision in the economic stimulus bill could have implications for trade. The economic stimulus bill included a \"Buy American\" provision, which raised concerns from major trading partners about protectionist measures. The WTO reported an increase in trade-limiting measures in response to the global financial crisis in 2009. Questions arose about state-funded programs targeting specific industries, potentially violating WTO rules. Developing countries also became a focus in trade discussions. The growth of developing countries, like Brazil, China, and India, as major trading powers is impacting U.S. trade policy. In 1985, these countries accounted for 32.8% of U.S. exports and 34.5% of imports, increasing to 51.6% of exports and 59.8% of imports by 2009. This presents both opportunities and challenges for the United States, with imports providing consumers with more choices at lower prices and helping to lower production costs for U.S. firms. The growth of developing countries like Brazil, China, and India has made them robust markets for U.S. exports, but also increased competition for U.S. workers from lower-wage labor. This competition has led U.S. firms to reduce costs through technology, offshoring production, or shutting down operations. Even high-end service workers face pressure from developing countries. Trade with developing countries raises issues like labor rights, environmental protection, and intellectual property rights on the U.S. trade agenda. Developing countries challenge U.S. policies on trade remedies, high tariffs, and pricing of medicines. Developing countries like China have raised concerns in the WTO about high tariffs on import-sensitive products and pricing of medicines. The U.S. trade policy must consider the growing importance of these countries, with China being a key trading partner. Globalization, driven by technological advancements, has further integrated the U.S. economy with the rest of the world. Global production networks have been facilitated by technology advancements and efficient transportation, allowing firms to divide production processes across borders to reduce costs and avoid trade barriers. The internationalization of production through global production networks has led to an increase in trade in intermediate goods within multi-national corporations. This trend has implications for trade policy as goods traded may not be final products but components shipped within the production process. The surge in free trade agreements and customs unions has changed the international trading system, affecting U.S. companies importing parts or products. Tariffs and antidumping duties can increase production costs and lower profits for U.S. companies involved in global supply chains. The surge in free trade agreements and customs unions has changed the international trading system. The United States participates in 11 FTAs with 17 countries, promoting global trade liberalization. These agreements aim to reduce tariffs and trade barriers, benefiting economic efficiency and welfare. However, they may violate WTO principles by discriminating against nonparticipants. Critics argue that the surge in free trade agreements and customs unions may undermine trade liberalization due to the varying structures and rules among the 285 agreements. The FTAs, like those involving the United States, are comprehensive, covering trade in goods, services, investment, intellectual property, labor, and environment. In contrast, agreements like Japan's EPAs are more limited and may exclude certain sectors like agriculture. Additionally, differing rules of origin and overlapping memberships further complicate the international trading landscape. The surge in free trade agreements and customs unions may undermine trade liberalization due to varying structures and rules among agreements. Critics argue that asymmetries in FTAs impede the free flow of trade and hinder the development of a strong multilateral trading system. U.S. policymakers face limitations in developing trade policy within mutually accepted rules of international agreements like the WTO. Trade policymakers must consider the demands of various economic stakeholders, including manufacturers, services providers, labor, and agriculture producers. Conflicting trade interests often arise, such as between manufacturers and organized labor. Stakeholders may also have conflicting interests within their own groups, such as exporters favoring trade liberalization while import-sensitive manufacturers prefer trade-restricting policies. Policymakers are limited by international agreements like the WTO and may opt out of agreements, risking benefits and obligations. Trade policymakers are constrained by the limited effectiveness of trade policies, as mainstream economists argue that they do not impact trade balances significantly. They believe that macroeconomic factors like domestic savings, investment balances, and exchange rates play a larger role in trade deficits. While trade policy can influence the composition of trade, it has minimal impact on aggregate unemployment levels. Another factor shaping U.S. trade policy is the growing importance of \"behind the border\" measures in trade negotiations, such as safety regulations and intellectual property rights enforcement. In trade negotiations, issues such as internal taxes, environmental regulations, intellectual property rights, investment regimes, and labor rights protection can impact foreign commerce. For example, concerns arose in the U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement regarding discriminatory excise taxes on cars and restrictions on imported U.S. beef due to mad cow disease. The United States has faced challenges in trade negotiations with countries like Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, who imposed bans on U.S. beef due to safety concerns. China's indigenous innovation policy has raised concerns about unfair advantages for Chinese firms. The U.S. has seen a steady increase in trade deficits since 1976, peaking at $828.0 billion in 2006. In 2009, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit decreased to $500.9 billion due to lower demand for imports during the recession. The current account deficit was $378.4 billion, attributed to imbalances in U.S. savings and investment. Some view trade deficits as a measure of U.S. trade policy effectiveness. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit with China was $226.8 billion in 2009, the largest bilateral trade deficit. The deficit with Mexico was $47.5 billion. The 112th Congress faces various trade issues, including pending agreements from the previous Congress and disagreements over free trade agreements negotiated by the Bush Administration. The 110th Congress faced a stalemate over Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), with objections to the U.S.-Colombia FTA due to safety concerns for trade union leaders. The U.S.-Panama FTA was hindered by concerns over lax tax laws, while objections were raised against the U.S.-South Korean FTA for not addressing barriers to U.S. trade. The U.S. had concerns over the U.S.-South Korean Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) not addressing barriers to U.S. trade, particularly in autos. Modifications were made in December 2010 to address these concerns, gaining full support from the U.S. auto industry. The Administration has not set a timeline for introducing draft legislation for the agreement but indicated readiness to move forward in 2011. Additionally, negotiations are ongoing with TPP participants to strengthen U.S. trade ties in the region. The Doha Development Agenda (DDA) round of trade negotiations, launched in 2001 by the World Trade Organization (WTO), has faced challenges due to disagreements between developing and developed countries over issues such as agricultural subsidies and tariffs on manufactured goods. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows for expedited consideration of trade agreements with limited debate and no amendments. It was first granted in 1975 and renewed in 2002 under the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act. The latest version expired in 2007. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) was in effect from August 6, 2002, to July 1, 2007. Trade negotiations have become more complex, leading to tighter oversight and consultation requirements by Congress. The expiration of TPA could impact pending and future trade negotiations, as without it, the United States may not negotiate credibly due to the possibility of congressional amendments. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) expired in 2007, leading to concerns about the impact on trade negotiations. Renewal of TPA is debated in Congress, with a focus on whether it should cover the Doha Round and potential future FTAs like the TPP. The United States provides duty-free treatment to imports from developing countries to promote economic growth. To be eligible for preferential treatment, developing countries must meet political and economic criteria, including rules of origin, protection of workers' rights, and intellectual property rights. Certain import-sensitive products are prohibited from receiving preferential treatment. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) excludes countries with a high per capita GDP and limits imports from these countries. Preference programs require congressional reauthorization, with the GSP being the most comprehensive program covering many developing countries. Some members of Congress question the effectiveness of the GSP. Some members of Congress have questioned the effectiveness of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, suggesting lowering the per capita income threshold for eligibility. Other trade preference programs like the Andean Trade Preferences Act (ATPA) and the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) provide special treatment to specific regions and products. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) offers tariff preferences and economic benefits to eligible countries. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) provides tariff preferences and economic benefits to sub-Saharan African countries meeting specific criteria. The Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006 (HOPE I) and the Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008 (HOPE II) authorize preferential access to U.S. imports of Haitian apparel, with HOPE II expanding coverage and simplifying rules. U.S. trade laws allow remedies against unfairly imported goods causing injury, such as dumped goods sold below fair value. The curr_chunk discusses the enforcement of trade laws in the United States, including measures against imports sold below fair value or benefiting from foreign subsidies. It also addresses concerns about China's undervalued currency and calls for stronger enforcement against WTO members. Critics argue that previous administrations have not effectively enforced these laws. States should enforce WTO obligations on trading partners like China by using the Dispute Settlement Mechanism more aggressively. Some U.S. trading partners claim the U.S. has not complied with WTO decisions on antidumping duties and subsidies. Mexico has imposed tariffs under NAFTA in retaliation for U.S. noncompliance with allowing Mexican trucks on U.S. highways. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is also discussed. Foreign direct investment (FDI) involves investments in real assets where the foreign investor has control. It plays a role in trade policy as U.S. FDI abroad and foreign FDI in the U.S. contribute to trade. Multinational companies seek FDI opportunities abroad to access markets, lower costs, and avoid trade barriers. Developing countries may present challenges for foreign investment. The United States launched its bilateral investment treaty (BIT) program in 1981 to provide assurances to U.S. investors in developing countries, ensuring non-discriminatory treatment and fair legal procedures in disputes with host governments. BITs are seen as indicators of safe business environments for U.S. investors, with approval required by a two-thirds Senate vote. The U.S. has BITs with 40 countries, mostly developing ones, and BIT-like provisions in its FTAs. The Obama Administration is reviewing the U.S. BIT \"model\" which may spark debate. Supporters want to maintain nondiscriminatory treatment for investments, while critics argue BITs encourage offshoring of production and jobs. Proponents claim BIT provisions align with U.S. legal principles. The U.S. is at a trade policy crossroads with the National Export Initiative (NEI) aiming to boost exports. The Obama Administration has implemented the National Export Initiative (NEI) to promote U.S. exports, including imposing high duties on Chinese tire imports. However, there are unresolved trade policy issues facing the Administration and Congress, sparking debate on the future direction of trade policy and its impact on U.S. residents' standard of living. The debate on trade in the U.S. is influenced by three groups: trade liberalizers, fair traders, and trade skeptics. Trade liberalizers believe the benefits of trade liberalization outweigh the costs and advocate for reducing trade barriers. Fair traders support trade agreements with provisions that level the playing field for U.S. firms and workers. Trade skeptics argue that current U.S. trade policy undermines economic interests and impinges on U.S. sovereignty. Policymakers' views on trade could impact future trade policy decisions. Trade policy positions of policymakers and experts vary, with some adhering to a strict interpretation of comparative advantage and free markets in economic theory. This group includes mainstream economists and representatives of competitive industries. They believe nations should export goods and services they can produce efficiently and import others they cannot, advocating for the removal of tariffs. Nations should remove trade barriers to trade based on comparative advantage, increasing economic welfare. While some sectors may suffer from enhanced competition, competitive firms and industries would benefit from increased exports. Trade liberalizers advocate for the elimination of trade barriers to promote countries' comparative advantages and support a strong multilateral trading system. They also push for the renewal of trade promotion authority and tariff preferences for developing-country imports to encourage economic development. Additionally, they promote the liberalization of foreign investment to enhance global commerce efficiency. Some trade policy experts debate the impact of bilateral and regional free trade agreements on trade liberalization. Jagdish Bhagwati and others argue against these agreements, citing discrimination, trade distortion, and inefficiency. Bhagwati criticizes the inconsistency in rules of origin and tariff phase-out schedules across FTAs, leading to a \"spaghetti-bowl\" phenomenon. Economist Robert Z. Lawrence argues that FTAs are a stumbling block to multilateralism and free trade, but they can be a \"second best\" solution when WTO negotiations are slow. He points out that recent FTAs, like NAFTA, have led to economic integration beyond tariff elimination, including barriers on services trade and foreign investment. Lawrence also highlights Mexico's commitment to economic reform under NAFTA, making its economy more efficient. The CATO Institute study by economist Edward L. Hudgins argues that FTAs can be more efficient in addressing trade barriers than the WTO, and can provide momentum for new trade rounds. Proponents believe that FTAs are necessary for the United States to approve and negotiate, as trading partners are doing so. The United States must approve pending FTAs and negotiate new ones to avoid being at a disadvantage in key markets. Some suggest removing trade barriers unilaterally to lower import costs and improve living standards. Economic experts believe that trade policy alone cannot address challenges faced by U.S. companies and workers in a globalized economy. The trend of higher productivity not translating into higher wages for U.S. workers creates anxiety about maintaining living standards. Advancements in communication technology have increased vulnerability to foreign competition in tradable services. Experts advocate for trade liberalization policies but stress the need to address those displaced by trade and prepare workers for global competition. Policy changes, such as a more progressive tax structure and deductions for tuition, are seen as necessary to improve living standards and support for foreign trade. Trade experts recommend policy changes to make the tax structure more progressive and provide deductions for education and career adjustments. They also suggest unifying worker assistance programs and revising business tax structures. To better prepare U.S. workers for the global economy, experts emphasize the need to improve education at all levels. Some argue against using trade policy to restrict globalization, as it is counterproductive and inevitable. Trade experts argue that globalization has rendered current trade policy obsolete, as it is based on outdated assumptions about production and competition. They suggest removing barriers to facilitate smooth operation of vertical production processes across borders. Fair traders acknowledge the benefits of trade liberalization but highlight the challenges faced by some U.S. workers and firms. Some argue that trade liberalization benefits the United States but puts U.S. workers and firms at a disadvantage due to lower wages and different labor and environmental standards in developing countries. This makes them more vulnerable to competition from imports, leading to demands for trade agreements to address these issues. Unions and others have pushed for U.S. trade agreements to include labor and environmental standards. These requirements have been part of the U.S. GSP program and included in FTAs due to congressional demands. The debate over these provisions intensified with Democratic leadership in the 110th Congress. Negotiations led to the \"New Trade Policy for America\" in 2007, incorporating important changes. The 2007 agreement led to changes in pending FTAs with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea, incorporating labor rights, environmental commitments, and pharmaceutical intellectual property provisions. Policymakers are emphasizing the need to level the playing field in U.S. trade agreements. Some policymakers are pushing for the United States to ensure trading partners fulfill their obligations under trade agreements. They want the Administration to improve trade enforcement and may impose restrictions on imports. Critics argue that current trade policy favors multinational corporations over small businesses and erodes government's ability to protect citizens. Trade skeptics oppose new trade agreements and advocate for reevaluating existing ones to protect workers and the environment. Critics argue that current trade policy benefits multinational corporations at the expense of U.S. workers. Policymakers are pushing for better enforcement of trade agreements to ensure obligations are met. Trade agreements, such as CAFTA and NAFTA, are criticized for benefiting corporations over U.S. workers by encouraging outsourcing. Critics argue that these agreements do not adequately protect foreign workers' rights and restrict governments' ability to regulate commercial activity. Calls for restructuring trade agreements to benefit all are supported by groups like the AFL-CIO and Public Citizen. Some NGOs and organizations criticize trade liberalization under current rules, claiming it favors rich countries like the United States at the expense of poorer nations. They argue that international trade rules and FTAs benefit the wealthy while disadvantaging those in need. For instance, the WTO's IPR rules are said to protect pharmaceutical companies' profits, leaving poorer countries unable to afford higher-priced products. Oxfam criticizes trade agreements between rich and poor countries, stating that they heavily favor the rich nations. They argue that these agreements force poorer countries to eliminate tariffs on food products, driving down prices and harming local farmers. Oxfam also highlights how richer countries maintain high tariffs on goods that developing countries are trying to export. They call for a shift in trade rules to make them more favorable to developing nations. The organization Oxfam criticizes trade agreements for favoring rich nations over developing countries. They call for a shift in trade rules to benefit developing nations. In response, members of Congress have introduced the TRADE Act of 2009 to evaluate U.S. free trade agreements and their impact on various aspects like employment and exports. The TRADE Act of 2009 aims to evaluate the impact of U.S. free trade agreements on employment, wage levels, exports, competitiveness of industries, food production, exchange rates, and more. It mandates future agreements to include provisions protecting core labor standards, human rights, environment, and food safety. The bill aimed to protect the environment, ensure food health and safety standards, and restrict trade agreements in various areas. It required the President to submit a plan to renegotiate any trade agreement that did not meet the requirements. A Congressional Review Committee would review the GAO report and the renegotiation plan. The general consensus on trade liberalization has frayed, evidenced by closer congressional votes and ambiguous views on foreign trade. This trend is likely influenced by the recession and high unemployment levels, as well as the effects of globalization. The direction U.S. policymakers take on trade policy will have broad implications, whether towards greater trade liberalization, conditional trade liberalization, or a restrained trade policy. Greater trade liberalization, whether unilateral or via trade negotiations and agreements, would promote further U.S. integration with the world economy and a more efficient allocation of resources. It would also encourage adherence to internationally negotiated rules on trade to prevent protectionist measures. However, it may expose vulnerable firms and workers to increased competition, requiring costly adjustments. A \"fair trade\" policy direction would address inequities by requiring trade partners to adhere to core labor standards and environmental protections to level the playing field. Trade agreements aim to \"level the playing field\" and rebuild consensus on trade, but some trading partners resist U.S. efforts to impose values. Economists note that labor cost discrepancies will persist due to varying development stages. A \"skeptical\" policy direction calls for reevaluation of trade policies to protect U.S. interests, including employment. This approach prioritizes national sovereignty over health and safety concerns. Opponents argue against this path. In addressing trade issues, U.S. policymakers may follow different approaches depending on the issue and other factors. Trade enforcement issues, particularly with China, FTAs, and trade preference review and reform, could serve as bellwethers for future trade policy. Policymakers will also face the outlook of Doha Round negotiations and possible renewal of trade promotion authority. The future of trade policy will involve addressing key issues such as the multilateral trade system, trade policy's role in non-trade issues like climate change, and the impact of globalization on trade effectiveness."
