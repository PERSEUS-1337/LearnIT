    "content": "The House of Representatives passed H.Res. 676 on July 30, 2014, authorizing a civil lawsuit against the President and/or executive branch officials for not fulfilling their duties under the Constitution. Speaker Boehner aims to compel the President to follow his oath of office. The lawsuit focuses on the Obama Administration's delay in implementing the ACA's employer mandate. The House of Representatives passed a resolution authorizing a lawsuit against the President for delaying the implementation of new excise taxes on non-compliant employers under the ACA until 2015. Speaker Boehner aims to hold the President accountable for changing the health care law without Congressional approval, emphasizing the need to uphold the Constitution's separation of powers. In the past 41 years, a house of Congress or its committee has filed lawsuits against the executive branch at least four times to seek judicial enforcement of a congressional subpoena or challenge executive actions. These rare suits include cases like Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon and Department of Commerce v. U.S. House of Representatives. The rarity of disputes between Congress and the executive branch being litigated in federal courts suggests that conflicts are usually resolved outside the courts. Commentators debate whether federal courts should intervene in cases between the political branches to prevent imbalance in the separation of powers. Some argue for judicial involvement to check executive authority, while others emphasize the limited power of the judiciary and express concerns about expanding its role. The Constitution limits the judiciary's power, raising concerns about political power imbalance if disputes between political branches are resolved in court. H.Res. 676 allows the Speaker to sue the executive branch, but questions of justiciability may arise. The report discusses whether Congress has standing to sue the executive branch over law execution. The suit can seek relief for failures by the President, department heads, or other officials. The resolution H.Res. 676 allows the Speaker to sue the executive branch for failing to implement provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The litigation may focus on the decision to delay enforcement of the ACA's employer mandate. The resolution H.Res. 676 authorizes the House to sue executive branch officers for not implementing the Affordable Care Act. The House Office of General Counsel can hire outside counsel, like BakerHostetler, to represent them in civil suits. David B. Rivkin from BakerHostetler will lead the litigation. The contract with BakerHostetler ends when a final judgment is made in court or at the end of the 113th Congress. The lawsuit pursuant to H.Res. 676 has not yet been filed, so details such as defendants, alleged injury, and relief sought remain unclear. Standing is a procedural question based on legal right to a judicial determination. Article III limits federal judicial power to \"cases\" and \"controversies,\" with courts declining non-judicial powers. The Supreme Court imposes three required elements to satisfy constitutional standing requirements in Article III: alleging a personal injury-in-fact, injury traceable to defendant's conduct, and likelihood of redress by requested relief. Federal courts also follow prudential principles relevant to standing. Federal courts also adhere to prudential principles for standing, which are judicially created limits that can be changed by Congress. These principles require the plaintiff to assert their own legal rights, fall within the protected interests of the law, and not raise generalized grievances better addressed by the legislative branch. The doctrine of standing in congressional plaintiffs focuses on challenges to executive branch actions or acts of Congress. There are two categories of cases: individual Members filing suits and congressional institutions filing suits. The case law for individual Member suits is settled, but not for suits by congressional institutions. These rare cases typically involve accessing specific information from the executive branch, and it remains unclear if a congressional institutional plaintiff would have standing based on the type of injury. A congressional institutional plaintiff may have standing to sue based on an institutional injury unrelated to information access. Existing case law can guide how a court may approach this situation, examining Raines and similar cases for analysis. This report will explore areas where courts have provided definitive analysis on congressional standing, including cases involving individual Members and institutional plaintiffs seeking to enforce congressional subpoenas. The report will address unresolved questions relevant to determining whether the House has standing in a suit filed pursuant to H.Res. 676. In Raines v. Byrd, the Supreme Court considered if individual Members of Congress had standing to sue the executive branch for injuries to Congress's legislative power. This case and subsequent D.C. Circuit opinions provide a framework for analyzing standing in such suits, although they may not directly apply to a potential suit brought by the House as a whole. In Raines v. Byrd, the Supreme Court outlined two situations where an individual Member of Congress may have standing to sue the executive branch. The first is if the Member alleges a personal injury, and the second is if there is an institutional injury that amounts to vote nullification. The suit envisioned in H.Res. 676 may argue that the House has suffered an institutional injury, which is important in understanding the Court's treatment of disputes between the legislative and executive branches. The Court in Raines v. Byrd discussed institutional injuries in the context of disputes between the legislative and executive branches. It defined institutional injury as a claim based solely on being a Member of Congress and stated that certain institutional injuries could satisfy standing. The Court concluded that the alleged diminution of Congress's legislative power by the Line Item Veto Act constituted an institutional injury that affected all Members of Congress equally. The Raines Court held that institutional injuries must be specific and not abstract. In Coleman v. Miller, state legislators claimed an institutional injury when their votes were nullified by a tie-breaking vote. This case established that legislators can have standing for institutional injuries. The Raines Court determined that legislators have standing to sue if their votes are nullified, as established in Coleman v. Miller. Unlike Coleman, Raines plaintiffs did not claim their votes were nullified, but rather lost a vote on the Line Item Veto Act. The Raines plaintiffs' votes were not \"completely nullified\" as they simply lost a vote on the Line Item Veto Act. Subsequent D.C. Circuit opinions have grappled with determining if a vote has been \"completely nullified,\" as seen in Campbell v. Clinton where Member plaintiffs argued their votes defeating a War Powers Resolution were nullified. The court rejected the argument that legislators have standing whenever the government does something Congress voted against, stating that a vote is completely nullified only in rare situations where legislators have no legislative remedy. The Campbell plaintiffs could not successfully allege an institutional injury amounting to vote nullification. The Member plaintiffs had ample legislative power to stop the war, including passing laws to restrict funding or impeach the President for disregarding Congress' authority. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit discussed standing for state legislators in Kerr v. Hickenlooper, ruling that members of the Colorado General Assembly could challenge the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights. The plaintiffs challenged the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR) in Colorado, arguing that it denied the Colorado General Assembly the authority to legislate on tax and spending increases. The court found that TABOR rendered a legislative vote for a tax increase ineffective, thus nullifying the ability of legislators to vote on operative tax increases. This case aligned with previous rulings on state legislator standing and congressional standing, indicating agreement with the interpretation of relevant precedents. The court held that the legislator-plaintiffs cannot undo tax increases in Colorado's Taxpayer's Bill of Rights through normal legislative process, as amending the state constitution requires voter approval. This lack of a legislative remedy satisfied the injury prong of standing, similar to the Coleman case. State legislator standing cases like Kerr do not raise separation of powers concerns like Raines, making them of limited value in analyzing federal legislative standing. In cases challenging executive actions, Raines restricts but does not eliminate a Member's standing. Members may establish standing if they claim an executive action nullified their vote, as seen in Coleman. Congressional institutions have successfully established standing in cases involving access to information through enforcing congressional subpoenas on the executive branch. The cases discussed involve enforcing congressional subpoenas issued to executive branch officials, with a focus on standing for institutional plaintiffs. Recent cases show that congressional authorization is a key requirement for institutional plaintiffs to sue. Two cases, Committee on Judiciary, U.S. House of Representatives v. Miers and Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Holder, illustrate how courts analyze standing for institutional plaintiffs in subpoena enforcement suits. In Miers, the Department of Justice argued that Raines conflicted with D.C. Circuit's precedent on standing for enforcing congressional subpoenas through civil suits. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the House's standing to intervene in a case involving a congressional subpoena to AT&T. The district court in Miers upheld the Judiciary Committee's standing to sue based on the authorization by the House of Representatives, following the precedent set by AT&T. This reasoning was also adopted in the Holder case in 2013. The district court in Holder upheld the Judiciary Committee's standing to sue based on authorization by the House of Representatives, following the precedent set by AT&T. Raines and other individual Member suits did not mandate dismissal on standing grounds. The committee asserted a concrete injury to its investigatory power, satisfying the Article III standing requirement. Raines allowed for standing based on personal or institutional injury, but did not clarify how standing for an institutional plaintiff should be analyzed. The Court's analysis on standing for institutional plaintiffs remains unclear, especially in comparison to individual Member suits like Raines. The subpoena enforcement cases offer little guidance on this issue due to the long history of congressional institutions participating in such suits in the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit's history of institutional plaintiffs in subpoena suits does not directly address the Raines vote nullification limit. Courts may not discuss this limit even if it applies, as there is no clear enforcement mechanism for congressional subpoenas. Institutional plaintiffs could potentially establish standing without violating the vote nullification limit as interpreted by Raines. In United States v. Windsor, the Supreme Court considered a constitutional challenge to Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), where the House's Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) intervened to defend the constitutionality of Section 3. In United States v. Windsor, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA. The majority opinion, led by Justice Kennedy, did not determine if BLAG had standing to appeal. Justice Alito dissented, arguing that BLAG had standing due to suffering an injury. Justice Alito argued that BLAG had standing to appeal the case as it suffered an injury, contending that the appeals court decision impairing Congress' legislative power. He stated that in cases where an Act of Congress is struck down and the Executive does not defend it, Congress has standing to defend the statute. On the other hand, Justice Scalia, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, disagreed with this conclusion. Justice Scalia, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, disagreed with Justice Alito's argument, stating that the President's failure to execute the law could only be challenged in court by someone directly harmed. Scalia pointed out that Congress has other ways to compel executive action without resorting to a lawsuit. Based on dissenting Justices, there are alternative ways to compel executive action without a lawsuit. The Justices are divided on applying Raines to institutional plaintiffs and defining institutional injuries. The ability of the House to establish standing may depend on whether there is a legislative remedy to the injury. Raines and its progeny have not outlined all potential congressional actions that could serve as legislative remedies. The cases provide guidance on legislative remedies for institutional injuries, even if unlikely to pass in Congress. For example, in Kucinich v. Obama, a proposed bill rejected by Congress still served as a legislative remedy. The ability to pass a law as a legislative remedy can prevent plaintiffs from establishing standing under Raines. Congress always has the option to repeal a statute causing injury, as seen in the Raines case. Legislative remedies can combat institutional injuries caused by executive actions, as shown in the Campbell case regarding U.S. military involvement in NATO airstrikes. Potential legislative remedies to certain executive actions include passing laws to forbid the use of U.S. forces in conflicts, cutting off funds for American involvement, and the possibility of impeachment for disregarding Congress' authority. These actions could serve as remedies by repealing executive branch regulations, restricting fund use, or clarifying agency discretion. Determining legislative remedies for executive actions, such as those outlined in H.Res. 676, would require a case-by-case analysis. It is uncertain what specific claims could be brought in a suit at this time. Some suggest that the House may have standing to challenge executive actions if traditional plaintiffs cannot establish standing. In Raines, the Court found that Member plaintiffs lacked standing but did not prevent others from challenging the actions. The Court in Raines found that Member plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge executive actions, but did not prevent others from doing so. In Johnson v. Office of Personnel Management, Senator Ron Johnson challenged an OPM rule regarding federal contributions towards health insurance premiums for Members and congressional staff. The district court dismissed Senator Johnson's case challenging an OPM rule on health insurance premiums for lack of standing. Judge Griesbach rejected the argument that all wrongs must have remedies in federal court, citing limited judicial authority. Judge Griesbach concluded that the difficulty of pursuing the allegations in federal court does not establish standing for the plaintiffs. The presence of a private plaintiff able to litigate the case does not affect the congressional plaintiff's injury-in-fact for Article III standing. The impact on prudential standing elements remains uncertain, but courts have shown openness to the concept in certain situations. No federal court has established the circumstances required for an institutional congressional plaintiff to establish standing in a suit filed pursuant to H.Res. 676. The analysis in Raines, which requires an institutional injury amounting to vote nullification, may apply to an authorized institutional plaintiff. A legislative remedy to cure the alleged injury could hinder standing. A court will need to determine how to apply Raines to specific allegations in a suit filed under H.Res. 676 regarding the implementation of the ACA."
