    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Quality Cancer Care Demonstration Project Act of 2009\" and includes findings related to cancer care. Congress finds that Medicare should reinforce and expand evidence-based guidelines for quality cancer care delivery, as recommended by the Institute of Medicine report. Key components include an agreed-upon treatment plan, access to clinical trials, full disclosure of treatment options, and a mechanism to coordinate services. The Institute of Medicine recommends using quality measures to hold cancer care providers accountable for improving care. Patients completing primary cancer treatment should receive a comprehensive care summary and survivorship plan. Adherence to quality metrics and guidelines can help reduce costs. Quality metrics and evidence-based guidelines can help lower costs by reducing the use of physician services, hospitalizations, and expensive drugs. However, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' 2009 Physician Quality Reporting Initiative does not address overall treatment planning or follow-up care planning for cancer patients. The Medicare Quality Cancer Care Demonstration Project is introduced in Section 3. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a quality cancer care demonstration project (QCCD project) to improve Medicare payment incentives and quality metrics for treatment planning and follow-up cancer care for Medicare beneficiaries with cancer. This project aims to address gaps in current quality measures and refine performance measures related to active treatment planning and follow-up cancer care planning. The QCCD project aims to improve Medicare payment incentives and quality metrics for cancer care. It involves using quality assessment programs to report data and testing treatment planning quality measures through a pay-for-reporting program with oncologists. The QCCD project ensures accurate reporting of measures through HCPCS coding and tests processes of submitting treatment planning and follow-up cancer care planning measures. The Secretary provides separate payments for these codes under the project, totaling $300,000,000 each year. The QCCD project provides separate payments totaling $300,000,000 annually for treatment planning and follow-up cancer care planning. Physicians must satisfy baseline mandatory measures to receive baseline payment and all measures to receive additional payment. The physician must report that all treatment planning measures were satisfied, including documented pathology report, clinical staging, treatment education, and written care plan for patients in active treatment. The physician must ensure that all treatment planning measures are met, including documenting the conclusion of primary cancer care treatment. Follow-up cancer planning should include discussing clinical trials, coordinating with other physicians, and following nationally recognized guidelines. The physician must document the completion of primary cancer care treatment and provide recommendations for subsequent care to the patient. This includes furnishing a written document describing past treatment elements and symptom management, as well as giving guidance on future cancer care. The document should be provided in person as soon as possible after treatment completion. The Secretary must ensure that the plan is accessible to individuals with cultural and linguistic needs. The demonstration project will last for at least 2 years to refine metrics and reporting methodologies until a new payment system is implemented under the Medicare program. The Secretary will evaluate the QCCD project to assess oncologist participation, cost effectiveness, and potential cost savings to Medicare programs resulting from reduced physician services during a 2-year transition period from the current payment system to a new one. The Secretary will evaluate the QCCD project to assess oncologist participation, cost effectiveness, and potential cost savings to Medicare programs resulting from reduced physician services, hospitalizations, and drug costs. The evaluation will also compare outcomes of participating patients to non-participating patients, determine patient satisfaction, and address other relevant matters. A report with recommendations will be submitted to Congress 90 days after the second year of the project."
