    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protecting Workplace Advancement and Opportunity Act\". Congress finds that the proposed rule by the Department of Labor would significantly increase the minimum salary requirement for certain employees, leading to a 113 percent increase in the first year and setting the Federal minimum salary threshold 20 percent higher than any State law. The Secretary underestimated the compliance costs of the rule. The Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration criticized the Department's proposed rule for underestimating the financial and non-financial costs, failing to identify small entities affected, and not considering regional cost differences. They recommended a reanalysis of the rule's economic impact. The Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration criticized the Department's proposed rule for underestimating financial and non-financial costs, failing to identify small entities affected, and not considering regional cost differences. They recommended a reanalysis of the rule's economic impact to provide a more accurate estimate of small entities impacted, including industry sub-sectors, regional differences, and revenue sizes. Additionally, they suggested greater transparency in compliance cost data and utilizing comment process data to estimate human resources and financial management costs of the regulation. The Secretary did not analyze the potential impact of the July 6, 2015, proposed rule on workplace flexibility and companies operating in multiple States with different costs of living and salary scales. The rule automatically updates the salary threshold annually for defining exempt employees. The Secretary does not have the authority to increase the salary threshold annually without proper rulemaking procedures. Changes to the duties tests may also be included in the final rule without specific notice and comment. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Department\" refers to the Department of Labor.
