Declaring an intention to withdraw troops and close bases can help dampen the insurgency and pave the way for peaceful negotiations in the region. The cost of withdrawing US troops from Iraq could be as low as $10 billion according to the Congressional Budget Office. A shift in US policy towards cooperation will create new opportunities for addressing common concerns about Iraq. The United Nations is best suited to build a political consensus in Iraq and facilitate an orderly transition post-occupation. The UN has the capability and legitimacy to authorize peacekeeping troops for Iraq. The United Nations can play a key role in ending the occupation of Iraq and transitioning to international peacekeepers. Reconstruction in Iraq should be overseen by the Iraqi Government with international support. Selling Iraqi oil assets during the US occupation could hinder peaceful resolution, and fairness in oil resource distribution is crucial. Fair distribution of oil resources in Iraq is crucial for fairness. Reconciliation among Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds is essential through a national conference facilitated by the United Nations. The political process is the only way to achieve true reconciliation. Achieving peace in Iraq requires bringing together all factions and insurgents, excluding al-Qaeda, with the help of Saudis, Turks, Syrians, and Iranians. International truth and reconciliation between the United States and Iraqis, along with a reparations program, are essential for enabling reconciliation. The policy statement is outlined in Section 2. The United States policy calls for the immediate end of the occupation of Iraq, withdrawal of troops using existing funds, return of contractors to the Iraqi Government, and transition to an international peacekeeping force led by the United Nations. The United Nations should prepare an international security and peacekeeping force to replace US troops in Iraq. The US should fund this mission with 50% of troops from Muslim-majority nations. The force should stay until Iraq can handle its own security. The Iraqi Government, with UN assistance, should restart reconstruction efforts in Iraq. The Iraqi Government should prioritize job training for local Iraqis and avoid privatizing oil interests or national assets. They should also work towards stabilizing food and energy costs and strive for economic sovereignty without IMF or World Bank intervention. The United States should initiate a reparations program for the loss of Iraqi lives, injuries, and property damage, including rescuing Iraqi orphans from destitution. The US should also avoid covert operations and destabilizing the Iraqi Government. SEC. 3. DISENGAGEMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES FROM IRAQ. Withdrawal of all US Armed Forces from Iraq within 3 months of enactment. Prohibition on using funds to deploy or continue deployment in Iraq, except for safe withdrawal. The section defines the term \"Armed Forces\" as per the meaning in title 10, United States Code. It outlines the actions to ensure Iraq's security through consultations with the government, foreign governments, the United Nations, and funding the UN-led peacekeeping mission."
