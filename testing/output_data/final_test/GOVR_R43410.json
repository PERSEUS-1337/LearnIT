    "content": "Growing demands on the transportation system and constraints on public resources have led to calls for more private sector involvement in the provision of highway and transit infrastructure through public-private partnerships (P3s). These partnerships are contractual agreements between a public agency and a private sector entity, allowing for greater private sector participation in the delivery and financing of transportation projects. P3s involve state governments, local governments, or transit agencies, with the federal government influencing their prevalence and structure through transportation programs, funding, and regulatory oversight. P3s can inject additional resources into transportation systems while reducing costs. Public-private partnerships (P3s) in transportation aim to inject additional resources into highway and public transportation systems while reducing costs and project delivery time. However, some surface transportation projects may not be suitable for P3s due to size or limited profit opportunities. P3s can potentially skew transportation planning towards projects with private returns rather than greater social benefits. Different types of P3s exist, but the focus is on those generating the most debate, such as leasing by the public sector to the private sector. The debate around public-private partnerships in transportation focuses on two types: leasing existing infrastructure to the private sector (brownfield facilities) and building new infrastructure owned by private entities (greenfield facilities). Tolling is often used to generate revenue for these projects, with the privatization of transportation infrastructure expected to increase tolling and potentially raise toll rates. Interest in P3s stems from concerns about public-sector limitations. Interest in public-private partnerships arises from concerns about insufficient public-sector resources for maintaining the nation's transportation infrastructure. Reports indicate a significant increase in funding is necessary to address infrastructure deterioration, congestion, and future demand for passenger and freight movements. The federal fuels tax, a primary revenue source, is facing challenges. Reports suggest a substantial increase in highway and transit spending is needed to improve conditions and performance. The highway trust fund, funded by motor fuels taxes, is facing a revenue shortfall due to reduced auto travel and increased fuel efficiency. Without action, the fund is projected to reach zero balance in FY2015. This has led to interest in public-private partnerships to address the gap between fuel tax revenues and infrastructure needs. The Revenue Study Commission discussed the role of P3s in U.S. transportation policy. Majority view supports greater use of P3s to address underinvestment, while a minority viewpoint advocates for market-based reforms like tolls and private sector participation. Public-private partnerships (P3s) involve private-sector participation in transportation infrastructure development and operation, with revenue streams from tolls or government payments. DOT categorizes P3s into seven types, with five used for constructing new infrastructure, varying in private responsibility. Private Contract Fee Service involves the public sector contracting for program management services for major projects. An example is the Louisiana TIMED program, which included highway widening, bridge construction, and port improvements. Louisiana TIMED Managers was hired to manage program delivery, financing, public outreach, and construction. Design-Build (DB) and Design-Build-Operate-Maintain (DBOM) are types of partnership arrangements in the public sector where design and construction services are combined into one fixed-fee contract. The public sector retains control of planning, funding, and post-construction responsibilities. An example is the Tappan Zee Bridge in New York, where the New York State Thruway Authority paid Tappan Zee Constructors, LLC $3.1 billion for design and construction. DBOM partnerships add private-sector responsibility for operation and maintenance after a facility is completed. The public sector still handles funding and financing, and retains risks for operational costs and revenue. The Design-Build-Finance (DBF) model adds short-term financing to a design-build contract, with payments deferred during construction. An example is the I-75 expansion in Florida. The I-635 LBJ Managed Lanes project near Dallas, TX, is an example of a Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain (DBFOM) project where the concessionaire will operate and maintain the facility, including toll collection, until 2062. Financing for these types of Public-Private Partnerships (P3s) often involves debt leveraged with toll revenue and may include public-sector grants or in-kind contributions like right-of-way. In existing infrastructure, DOT identified two types of P3s: O&M Concession and Long-Term Lease Agreement. O&M Concession involves private sector responsibility for asset operation and maintenance, like the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel in Alaska. Long-Term Lease Agreement entails leasing an existing facility to a private company for a specified time, with the private partner paying an initial concession fee and collecting tolls for revenue. The Chicago Skyway, a 7.8-mile toll road, was leased for 99 years to the Skyway Concession Company in 2004 for $1.83 billion. The company, controlled by Cintra and Macquarie Infrastructure Group, operates and maintains the Skyway to certain standards. The Chicago Skyway was leased to the Skyway Concession Company for $1.83 billion in 2004. SCC must operate and maintain the Skyway to certain standards and can collect toll revenue. Tolls for cars were $4 in February 2014 and can increase annually based on CPI, GDP, or 2%. Critics argue the lease diverts resources from transportation, but Chicago placed much of the revenue in reserve funds. Chicago contests the view that leasing the Skyway diverts resources from transportation, as much of the revenue was placed in reserve funds generating interest. The city's credit rating improved when it reduced debt, and excess toll revenues were not always used for transportation. The Indiana Toll Road, a 157-mile segment linking with the Chicago Skyway and Ohio Turnpike, was operated by the Indiana DOT until a 75-year lease concession was awarded. In 2006, the Indiana Toll Road was leased to the Indiana Toll Road Concession Company (ITRCC) for $3.8 billion. Cintra and Macquarie invested $374 million each, with the remaining $3 billion provided by seven banks. Tolls are regulated by the concession agreement, with a maximum toll of $8.00 for a two-axle vehicle through June 2010. Toll increases are limited to 2%, CPI change, or GDP increase. In February 2014, the toll for a two-axle vehicle was $9.70. The Indiana Toll Road was leased to ITRCC for $3.8 billion in 2006. The contract included upgrades like electronic tolling and adding a third lane. Proceeds funded highway projects under the state's \"Major Moves\" initiative. Seven counties received payments for local projects. In 2007, VDOT signed a P3 agreement for new HOT lanes on the Capital Beltway. The private consortium of Fluor Corporation and Transurban financed most of the $2 billion HOT lanes project with $348 million in equity and $1.2 billion borrowed using federal credit assistance. This involved a TIFIA loan of $589 million and $589 million in tax-exempt private-activity bonds. The state committed $400 million in grant funding for additional highway improvements. The private consortium financed most of the $2 billion HOT lanes project with equity and borrowed funds. The state also committed $400 million for additional highway improvements, including the final phase of the Springfield Interchange, I-66 interchange improvements, bridge reconstruction on the Beltway, and participation in a regional congestion plan. Toll imposition on busy roads offers a clear source of returns on private investment. Public transportation systems often require significant public sector support due to higher operating costs compared to generated revenues. The Las Vegas Monorail project, a private venture owned by the Las Vegas Monorail Company, is an example of this challenge. The Las Vegas Monorail system, operated by a non-profit corporation, opened in 1995 between two major hotels. Expansion in 2004 was funded by hotels, resorts, tax-exempt bonds, and advertising revenues. A proposal to extend to the airport was approved in 2006 but lacked funding. Financial issues, worsened by the 2007-2009 recession, led to difficulties meeting expenses, with reports in 2008 of a $30 million annual shortfall. In January 2010, the Las Vegas Monorail Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to financial difficulties, emerging from bankruptcy in 2012 with debts reduced to $13 million. The monorail carried 4.2 million passengers in 2013, generating $18.4 million in revenue compared to its peak year in 2005. An example of a design-build P3 project is the replacement of 554 bridges in Missouri, completed by KTU Constructors in 2012 under a $487 million contract financed by GARVEE bonds. The Texas Department of Transportation entered into an agreement with a concessionaire to design, build, finance, operate, and maintain a 40-mile extension to the existing 50 miles of SH 130 toll road on the south-east side of Austin. The agreement specified a 50-year concession from the opening of the new segment. The 40-mile toll road extension in Austin, opened in 2012, was financed by the concessionaire with bank loans, private equity, and a TIFIA loan. Despite lower than forecasted traffic volumes and revenue, the state subsidized truck tolls in 2013. The project's debt was downgraded in 2013, with the concessionaire at risk of defaulting in 2014. The concessionaire for the I-595 project in Florida is at risk of defaulting in 2014, which could lead to the state taking over the road. The project involves major improvements to I-595, including the construction of three reversible toll lanes. Construction started in 2010 and is expected to be completed in 2014. The concessionaire, I-595 Express LLC, is responsible for designing, building, financing, operating, and maintaining the facility for 35 years. The project was mostly financed by the concessionaire with senior bank loans, a TIFIA loan, and equity. The concessionaire for the I-595 project in Florida did not accept revenue risk associated with toll payments. Private-sector financing is backed by \"availability payments\" from FDOT based on quality and performance. Toll rates on express lanes will be set by FDOT, with revenue retained by the state. Public-private partnerships gained interest due to federal funding decline in the 1980s for highway and transit projects. Public-private partnerships gained interest in the 1980s as federal funding for transportation declined. States sought new ways to fund infrastructure, leading to legislation allowing private investment in highway projects with toll collection. Projects like the Dulles Greenway and SR-91 opened in 1995. Currently, 33 states and Puerto Rico have P3 enabling legislation. In transit, revenue was generated through private facilities on agency land, known as joint development. In the late 1980s, Congress explored including Public-Private Partnerships (P3s) in federal surface transportation programs. This led to legislative changes, such as the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987, which established a pilot program for using federal funds in toll facility construction. Joint development projects, like the one at the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's Bethesda station, have generated revenue for transit agencies through private investment. The Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 established a pilot program for using federal funds in toll facility construction. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 expanded the program, allowing states to convert non-tolled roads to tolled facilities and raised the federal cost share to 50%. It also allowed for private ownership and operation of toll facilities. The Congestion Pricing Pilot Program was established to implement variable tolls on projects, including Interstate Highways. The Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 established pilot programs for toll facility construction and conversion of non-tolled roads. The Value Pricing Pilot Project and Interstate System Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Pilot Program were created under TEA-21. SAFETEA allowed for the conversion of HOV lanes to HOT lanes and established the Express Lane Demonstration program for new tolled facilities. The Interstate System Construction Toll Pilot program authorized tolling of three new Interstate Highways under SAFETEA. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) allows states to impose tolls on new federally aided bridges, tunnels, and highways, including Interstates. Tolls may also be imposed on new lanes of existing free highways, bridges, or tunnels, as long as the number of free lanes remains unchanged. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) allows states to impose tolls on new federally aided bridges, tunnels, and highways, including Interstates, as long as the number of free lanes is unchanged. Tolling agreements with FHWA on federal-aid highways are no longer required, leading to an increase in toll-based projects, with 235 initiated in 32 states and one U.S. territory. About 20% of these projects involve public-private partnerships. The survey involved a public-private partnership and changes in federal law have encouraged P3s through innovative financing methods. The Innovative Finance Test and Evaluation program was created in 1994 to implement new highway financing tools, leading to the State Infrastructure Bank pilot program in 1995. Congress promoted private participation in surface transportation projects. Congress advanced private participation in surface transportation projects through the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) in 1998. TIFIA provides federal credit assistance to leverage non-federal funding, including from the private sector. The program has been expanded over time to assist smaller projects and include freight rail and intermodal facilities. MAP-21 significantly expanded the TIFIA program, authorizing $750 million for FY2013 and $1 billion for FY2014, allowing the Department of Transportation to lend about $16 billion. Additionally, SAFETEA designated certain private transportation activities as eligible for federally tax-exempt state and local bond financing. Private activity bonds are issued to finance activities that are less public in nature and pay taxable interest, offering higher interest rates. Some private activities, such as airports, docks, highways, and rail facilities, are designated as \"qualified private activities\" allowing access to the tax-exempt bond market. Congress has set limits on the amount of qualified private activity bonds that can be issued in each state and for certain activities. For example, SAFETEA included a $15 billion limit on bond issuance for qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilities, exempt from state volume caps. The Secretary of Transportation decides how to allocate limited capacity among entities desiring to issue private activity bonds for transportation infrastructure. The $15 billion cap may be reached in FY2015, hindering public-private partnerships. FHWA has undertaken Special Experiment Projects to reduce costs, including design-build contracting. In 2005, Congress made changes to design-build contracting, eliminating the $50 million floor and allowing contracts with private firms before NEPA approval. They also set a 180-day limit for challenging federal approvals. MAP-21 included provisions to encourage P3s at the state and local level, such as compiling best practices and developing model contracts. The National Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1974 encouraged private financial participation in transit through joint development projects near transit stations. However, in the 1980s, federal subsidies were discouraged from taking contributions from private partners into account, leading to a policy revision by Congress to allow land acquired with federal funding to be used for such projects. Congress directed FTA to revise policy to allow federal funding-acquired land for joint development projects, with income used for transit operation. TEA-21 made joint development eligible for reimbursement in federal transit grant programs. SAFETEA modified law, adding intercity bus and rail terminals as permitted uses for joint development authority. ISTEA furthered P3s in transit with a demonstration program for DB/DBOM use in New Starts program, including projects like Los Angeles Union Station Intermodal Terminal and Baltimore Light Rail Transit System Extensions. The ISTEA legislation directed FTA to issue guidance on the use of DB/DBOM in the Federal New Starts program. SAFETEA authorized a pilot program called the Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program (Penta-P) to explore P3s in transit projects. Projects in Denver, Oakland, and Houston were selected for the program. The interest in promoting P3s in surface transportation raises important issues for Congress regarding financing and long-term concessions. P3s offer benefits for states in financing the transportation system. Public-Private Partnerships (P3s) in transportation offer benefits for states and localities but also present trade-offs and potential problems. The public interest in P3s is protected through concession agreements, but a more systematic approach to evaluating this interest is suggested. P3s are seen as a way to provide resources for transportation infrastructure beyond government funding. The federal government may need to identify and evaluate the national public interest in highway projects using P3s. Public-Private Partnerships (P3s) in transportation aim to attract private capital through revenue streams like tolls and building rents. P3s can efficiently build and operate transportation facilities, attracting additional capital and potentially luring pension funds and foreign investors. Equity financing allows investors to share in profits, making them less conservative than traditional bond investors. Private concessions in Public-Private Partnerships (P3s) for transportation projects can attract pension funds and foreign investors who are not subject to U.S. federal income tax. These concessions often have longer terms than traditional municipal bonds, allowing the concessionaire to raise capital from long-term investors. For example, the city of Chicago raised $1.83 billion for a 99-year concession of the Chicago Skyway, compared to only $800 million through selling municipal bonds backed by Skyway revenues. P3 agreements for toll facilities may include provisions for future toll increases, with investors having more confidence in private operators' ability to raise tolls compared to public operators. Private concessions in Public-Private Partnerships (P3s) for transportation projects can attract pension funds and foreign investors. Investors may prefer private operators for cost control and increased profits. The potential scale of private investment in surface transportation infrastructure remains uncertain, with only a small amount used for long-term financing through P3s in the United States. From 1989 to early 2011, there were 96 transportation P3s worth $54.3 billion, with 11 projects involving long-term private financing totaling $12.4 billion. Private concessions in Public-Private Partnerships (P3s) for transportation projects can attract pension funds and foreign investors. The potential scale of private investment in surface transportation infrastructure remains uncertain, with tolling accounting for about 5% of highway revenues. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) projects that highway tolling may generate between 7% and 9% of future national highway investment needs. However, the potential of P3s in transit financing is likely smaller due to operating costs not being covered by fares. Transit P3s may involve availability payments or development of stations for private investors, leaving the public sector to provide the bus or rail lines. This suggests that P3s are likely to generate less than the estimated 7% to 9% of total investment needs for roads and transit. The institution of tolls for transportation projects could suppress travel demand, potentially reducing highway investment needs by up to 30%. While widespread highway pricing may not be implemented soon, the ability to finance highway needs through tolls may have limitations. State and local governments have significant funding demands, and asset leases of transportation facilities could potentially fund various government services. The diversion of resources from transportation facilities for funding government services, known as \"revenue extraction,\" raises concerns about the substitution effect where private resources attracted to infrastructure may replace public resources without a net gain in funding. A study on federal highway funding increases from 1982 to 2002 showed a 40% rise in federal capital spending led to a 4% drop in state and local capital spending, indicating a substitution effect. Public-private partnerships (P3s) could enhance resource efficiency in infrastructure management and innovation, potentially generating new resources for transportation infrastructure. Public-private partnerships (P3s) offer the potential for more infrastructure at the same cost by allowing private companies to consider long-term costs. However, challenges such as lack of state capacity to manage P3 contracts and potential time-consuming procurement processes may hinder cost savings. P3s also shift financial risks to the private sector, but the effectiveness of this model depends on proper contract management. Building, maintaining, and operating infrastructure comes with various risks, such as cost overruns and lower-than-expected demand. Transferring these risks to the private sector can provide more certainty for the public sector, but not all risks can be shifted. For example, the private sector may struggle with delays and uncertainties in the environmental review process. Critics argue that risk transfer in a Public-Private Partnership (P3) may not always be beneficial if miscalculations lead to contract renegotiations. In some P3 projects, the public sector may face financial risks if miscalculations lead to contract renegotiations or project ownership assumptions. For example, low traffic volumes on the SH-130 extension near Austin, TX, resulted in the state subsidizing truck tolls. If the concessionaire defaults on financial commitments, a $430 million TIFIA loan repayment to the federal government could be at risk, leading to potential termination of the concession and full state responsibility for the road. Additionally, revenue risks may be retained by the public sector in P3 projects, potentially leading to double charges for road users on tolled highways. Trucking groups are concerned about proposals to fund highway construction through tolls, fearing that costs will shift from passenger vehicles to trucks. P3 contracts allow states to control tolls on privately operated highways, preventing monopoly power abuse. However, higher tolls could lead to traffic diversion, increased congestion, and reduced safety on other routes, especially for truck traffic. Tolling can lead to safety issues and infrastructure damage due to truck traffic diversion. Equity concerns arise as tolls burden lower-income households more than higher-income ones. Projects adding tolled lanes may disproportionately affect interstate commerce. Projects that add tolled lanes, like the I-495 HOT lanes in Northern Virginia, can benefit all road users by reducing congestion in free lanes. Public-private partnerships (P3s) influence transportation system decisions and funding distribution based on geographic equity. Private investors prioritize projects with high financial returns and are unlikely to fund facilities with low revenue potential. Public-private partnerships (P3s) reliant on tolls may not address transportation issues in rural areas or roads with low traffic. Concerns arise when states receive unsolicited P3 proposals, as they may not align with public planning priorities. Some argue against permitting unsolicited proposals, while proponents believe it stifles innovation. Some P3s argue that unsolicited proposals could hinder innovation, but they must still go through public review. Non-compete clauses in P3 contracts can limit government agency improvements near private facilities, hindering capacity and congestion management. Balancing private investment with public interest is crucial, as long concession agreements can complicate transportation planning. Contracts may be required to provide investors with sufficient returns, but contract provisions may restrict planners and policy makers in the future. Limiting concession terms to the facility's design life or including provisions for amendments and arbitration can address this issue. MAP-21 changes in federal law aim to promote P3s at state and local levels by increasing TIFIA loan funding and easing tolling restrictions on federal-aid highways. DOT now provides technical support to P3s, marking a shift from incremental changes to program incentives and regulations. The two broad policy options for expanding the use of P3s are to either encourage them with program incentives and tight regulatory controls, as seen in MAP-21, or to aggressively promote them through incentives and deregulation, especially in tolling and financing. These options are not mutually exclusive, as Congress could deregulate in one area while enhancing regulation in another. Proponents of the first option emphasize the need for regulations to protect the public interest from perceived problems with P3s. The debate over public oversight of P3 projects is ongoing, with concerns about risk transfer, government decision constraints, and protection of public interests. MAP-21 mandates best practices to safeguard the interests of the public and government in agreements with the private sector for transportation projects. The proposed STAA of 2009 aimed to subject P3s involving federal-aid highway funds to federal requirements, including cost-benefit analysis and public information provisions. The proposal included requirements for public information, public involvement, and a prohibition against non-compete clauses in P3 agreements. It would establish an Office of Public Benefit (OPB) within FHWA to oversee highway toll projects and public-private partnership agreements on Federal-aid highways. Advocates of P3s expressed concerns about the OPB's authority to review and approve compliance with transparency provisions, fearing it could deter project partners from investing time and money. The proposal aimed to provide program funding to encourage innovation and deregulate tolling and private sector involvement, allowing states more autonomy in decision-making. The federal government could provide guidance on best practices for tolling and public-private partnerships, with the possibility of setting up a federal P3 office to offer technical advice and consulting services. This approach aligns with past proposals linking deregulation of tolling and P3s with devolution of federal responsibilities to states, particularly for the Interstate Highway system. Many parts of the system have sufficient traffic levels to support toll-supported partnerships. The need for reconstructing Interstates is likely to accelerate in the years ahead as many reach their approximately 50-year design life, leading to expensive \"mega-projects\" costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Congress could allow states to impose tolls on Interstates after reconstruction to facilitate financing. The TIFIA program has been crucial in funding large P3s, with MAP-21 authorizing $16 billion in loan capacity for FY2013 and FY2014. Further enlarging TIFIA could encourage more P3s, but increased lending may raise the risk of projects being unable to repay loans. The federal government's TIFIA loans can be subordinate to other project debt, with a \"springing lien\" provision that may deter some P3 agreements. Increasing the cap on private activity bonds to $19 billion could support P3 development, but carries risks of project sponsors defaulting on debt. The provision to increase the cap on private activity bonds to $19 billion could support P3 development, but would reduce revenue by $515 million over the 2014 to 2023 budget window. A national infrastructure bank, or \"I-bank,\" could provide low-cost, long-term loans for P3 projects with more independence than TIFIA. Funding for an I-bank could come from appropriations or bond issuance. Three I-bank proposals introduced in the 113th Congress are the National Infrastructure Development Bank Act (H.R. 2553) by Representative DeLauro, the Partnership to Build America Act (H.R. 2084) by Representative Delaney, and the Building and Renewing Infrastructure for Development and Growth in Employment (BRIDGE) Act (S. 1716) by Senator Warner. State infrastructure banks (SIBs) exist in 32 states, created in response to a federal program enacted in 1995 (P.L. 104-59). An expansion of SIBs' role may make them more supportive of projects involving a private partner. MAP-21 did not extend authority for a state to use federal surface transportation funds to capitalize a SIB. Several bills have sought to encourage SIBs by allowing states to. Several bills have sought to encourage State Infrastructure Banks (SIBs) by allowing states to fund them from federal funds, creating a dedicated federal funding stream, or authorizing SIBs to issue bonds benefiting from tax credits."
