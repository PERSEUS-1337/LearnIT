    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"EPS Service Parts Act of 2014\" and exempts certain supplies. Section 325(u) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to exempt external power supplies manufactured between February 10, 2016, and February 10, 2020, from specific energy conservation standards. The amendment exempts external power supplies made between February 10, 2016, and February 10, 2020, if they meet specific efficiency standards. The Secretary may require manufacturers of products exempted between February 10, 2016, and February 10, 2020, to report annual total units shipped as service and spare parts that are not International Efficiency Level VI or higher. The Secretary may issue a rule to limit the exemption if it results in reduced energy savings from the final rule. The Secretary can exempt an external power supply from amended standards if manufactured within four years of the compliance date. The Secretary can exempt an external power supply from amended standards if it complies with marking requirements, meets previous standards, and is made available as a service or spare part for an end-use product. Manufacturers of exempted products may be required to report annual total units shipped as service and spare parts that do not meet the amended standard."
