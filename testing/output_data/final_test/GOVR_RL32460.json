    "content": "On December 18, 2007, the FCC relaxed the ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and a broadcast station in certain markets after a five-year review. This decision followed a 2002 Biennial Review that was challenged by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, leading to a reconsideration by the FCC. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to establish a pro-competitive, deregulatory national policy framework. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to create a pro-competitive, deregulatory national policy framework for advanced telecommunications and information technologies. It eliminated limits on national radio ownership, raised caps on audience reach, set new limits for local radio ownership, and directed the FCC to review broadcast ownership rules every two years. The FCC initiated its 2002 Biennial Review in September of 2002 to determine the necessity of these rules in the public interest. The FCC initiated its 2002 Biennial Review in September of 2002 to review four broadcast ownership rules. On June 2, 2003, the Commission adopted a Report and Order modifying its ownership rules, concluding that certain restrictions were no longer necessary in the public interest. The FCC modified its ownership rules in 2003, finding that certain restrictions were no longer necessary in the public interest. The changes included revising market definitions, local radio and television ownership rules, and raising the national audience reach limit to 45%. Several organizations filed petitions for review of the new rules, which were consolidated and heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit entered a stay on the proposed media ownership rules, keeping the prior rules in effect. The FCC approved new rules in 2003, citing the need for updated regulations due to new technologies. The court heard oral arguments and issued its opinion in June 2004, supporting the necessity of the new rules in the public interest. The FCC approved new media ownership rules in 2003, citing the need for updated regulations due to new technologies. The Commission determined that a 35% national TV ownership limit was not necessary and raised it to 45%. A single entity was prohibited from owning stations reaching more than 45% of the national audience. The \"UHF discount\" was retained, attributing UHF stations with only 50% of households in their DMA. The FCC updated media ownership rules in 2003, increasing the national TV ownership limit to 45% and retaining the \"UHF discount.\" The Commission repealed local ownership rules in the 2002 Biennial Review, including cross-ownership rules in the same community and ownership limits for television and radio combinations in a market. In large markets with more than eight television stations, cross-ownership was unrestricted. The FCC updated media ownership rules in 2003, increasing the national TV ownership limit to 45% and retaining the \"UHF discount.\" The Commission combined an earlier remand from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals with the 2002 Biennial Review and adopted a new rule allowing common ownership of two commercial TV stations in markets with seventeen or fewer stations, and three stations in markets with eighteen or more stations. The rule also includes restrictions on ownership of top four stations based on audience share and repealed the \"Failed Station Solicitation Rule.\" The FCC updated media ownership rules in 2003, increasing the national TV ownership limit to 45% and retaining the \"UHF discount.\" The Commission combined an earlier remand from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals with the 2002 Biennial Review and adopted a new rule allowing common ownership of two commercial TV stations in markets with seventeen or fewer stations, and three stations in markets with eighteen or more stations. The rule also includes restrictions on ownership of top four stations based on audience share and repealed the \"Failed Station Solicitation Rule.\" The Commission changed the method for determining the size of a local market, retaining numerical limits on station ownership. It abandoned the \"contour-overlap methodology\" in favor of the \"geography-based market definition used by Arbitron.\" The new rule allows a single entity to own up to eight radio stations in markets with 45 or more commercial stations and created a new system for the attribution of joint sales agreements (JSAs). The FCC updated media ownership rules in 2003, including changes to joint sales agreements (JSAs). JSAs are now attributable to the brokering entity for compliance with local ownership limits if the entity owns or has an interest in stations in the local market and joint advertising sales exceed 15% of the brokered station's advertising time per week. Multiple organizations filed petitions for review of the new rules. The FCC updated media ownership rules in 2003, including changes to joint sales agreements (JSAs). Multiple organizations filed petitions for review of the new rules, which were consolidated and heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia. The court issued a stay on the effective date of the proposed rules and later directed the FCC to modify the national television ownership cap to 39% in accordance with the 2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Challenges to the Commission's decision to raise the cap to 45% were deemed moot. The court deemed challenges to the UHF discount provisions in the rule moot as they were intrinsically linked to the 39% national audience reach cap. The 2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act specifically insulated the UHF discount from review. The retention of the dual network rule was not addressed in the Prometheus case. The court agreed with the Commission's decision to modify local ownership rules but found fault with numerical limits, stating that media outlets of the same type do not make equal contributions to diversity and competition. The court supported the repeal of the broadcast/newspaper cross-ownership ban and found retaining some limits on common ownership constitutional. The court found that the FCC failed to provide reasoned analysis for the specific limits on \"cross-media\" rules, deeming them irrational. The court rejected the use of a \"diversity index\" and remanded the cross-media limits, advising the Commission to seek public input on any new metric for measuring diversity and competition. The court upheld the restriction on common ownership of the market's top four broadcast outlets. The court in Prometheus upheld the restriction on common ownership of the market's top four broadcast television stations, but remanded the numerical limits for the Commission to address inconsistencies and better support its assumptions. The court found that the Commission lacked evidence to justify the market share assumptions for the numerical limits and remanded the repeal of the Failed Station Solicitation Rule for not considering the impact on minority television station ownership. The court upheld the Commission's restriction on common ownership of a market's top four broadcast television stations and its new definition of local markets for radio. However, the court found that the Commission failed to provide reasoned analysis for retaining numerical limits, which were deemed rational but unsupported. The court upheld the Commission's restriction on common ownership of a market's top four broadcast television stations and its new definition of local markets for radio. However, the court found that the Commission failed to provide reasoned analysis for retaining numerical limits, which were deemed rational but unsupported. The court remanded the numerical limits to the Commission to develop supported limits and affirmed the new rules on joint sales agreements. The Third Circuit granted a partial lifting of the stay on September 3, 2004. The stay was partially lifted to allow certain rules from the court's decision to go into effect, including the use of Arbitron metro markets, noncommercial stations in market size determination, attribution of stations under Joint Sales Agreements, and a transfer restriction. The stay remained for other aspects of the Biennial Review Order. The United States Solicitor General and FCC chose not to appeal the Third Circuit's decision, but media companies appealed to the Supreme Court, which denied certiorari in relevant appeals. The FCC issued a Further Order on July 24, 2006. The FCC issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPR) in the Broadcast Media Ownership proceedings on July 24, 2006, seeking comments on new ownership rules to comply with the Third Circuit's decision in Prometheus. The rules aimed to promote \"localism,\" increase ownership opportunities for minorities and women, revise numerical limits on cross ownership, and improve diversity in local media markets. Multiple studies on media ownership were commissioned for consideration in the rulemaking process. The FCC issued a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SFNPR) in August 2007 to review broadcast ownership rules, including initiatives to encourage minority and female ownership. FCC Chairman Martin proposed relaxing the ban on newspaper and broadcast cross-ownership in November 2007. The FCC adopted a revised version of Chairman Martin's proposal to ease the ban on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership on December 18, 2007. The new rule establishes the presumption that newspaper/radio broadcast station cross-ownership in the top 20 largest DMAs is in the public interest, and that newspaper/television broadcast station cross-ownership in the top 20 largest DMAs is in the public interest under certain conditions. The new rule establishes a presumption against newspaper/broadcast station cross-ownership, except in specific circumstances. Applicants must prove with clear evidence that the merger will increase diversity and competition in the market. The FCC has outlined four factors to evaluate these combinations. Two exceptions to the presumption are identified, including situations where either the broadcast station or newspaper is \"failed\" or \"failing.\" The FCC will presume a proposed combination is in the public interest if it involves a \"failed\" or \"failing\" entity. This presumption can be reversed if the combination leads to new local news programming. Other cross-ownership rules remain unchanged, and new rules aim to promote diversification of broadcast ownership. Eligible entities can access financing and spectrum more easily under the new rules. The FCC is considering allowing licensees facing revocation hearings to sell their stations to eligible entities before the hearing. They are revising equity/debt plus attribution standards to facilitate investment in eligible entities defined as small businesses. The relaxation of ownership rules from 2007 has not yet taken effect due to a stay by the Third Circuit. The FCC is seeking comments on expanding the definition of eligible entities. The Third Circuit's stay on the FCC's 2008 order regarding media ownership rules remains in place. The FCC argues that the stay should continue as they are conducting a new review of the rules, set to be completed in 2010. The Third Circuit has ordered the FCC to explain why the stay on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule changes should not be lifted, with a decision pending."
