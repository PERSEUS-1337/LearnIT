    "content": "The U.S. monetary system is based on paper money backed by the federal government, not gold or silver. Calls to return to a gold standard are occasionally made, citing past economic benefits. This report reviews the history of the gold standard in the U.S., including the dates it was used, the types of standards, and the statutory changes that eventually ended it. In a modern economy, money serves as a token representing value owed in a transaction. A gold standard uses gold as the basis for transactions, with coins certifying its purity and weight. In a monetary system, prices are expressed in terms of dollars, guineas, doubloons, etc. Paper notes can be part of a gold standard if they represent a claim to gold through convertibility. In a gold standard system, paper money is convertible into gold. Legal tender must be accepted for monetary obligations. Payment in legal tender cannot be refused, but contracts can still be made in other forms of currency. In the United States, the government can issue currency without making it legal tender. The monetary standard and legal tender can be different things, as seen in the bimetallic standard that initially defined the dollar. Gold and silver coins were used to define the monetary unit, with gold coins authorized in denominations of $10 and $2.50. The United States initially used a bimetallic standard for its currency, with gold and silver coins authorized in various denominations. The ratio of silver to gold was 15 to 1, and both metals were declared legal tender. However, due to fluctuations in the market price ratio of silver to gold, the country effectively operated on a silver standard for the first 40 years of its existence. In 1834, Congress took steps to address this issue. In 1834, Congress changed the gold-to-silver ratio from 15 to 1 to 16 to 1 by reducing the gold content in coins. The pure gold in an eagle was reduced to 232 grains, and the fineness was adjusted to exactly nine-tenths. Silver coins were also changed to nine-tenths fineness. The new coins remained legal tender for debts incurred before the gold content alteration, allowing debts to be paid off with effectively less money than borrowed. After the change in the gold-to-silver ratio in 1834, debts could be paid off with less money than borrowed. The new mint ratio made gold cheaper, leading to silver being exported and gold becoming the primary coin for commerce. Silver coins disappeared by 1850, prompting the need for fractional gold coins. An 1853 act authorized subsidiary silver coins with less silver than the official mint ratio. Throughout the period before the Civil War, various forms of paper money circulated in the United States, including private bank notes, Treasury notes, and bills of exchange. These paper claims were promises to pay gold or silver, serving as an integral part of the metallic monetary standard. Banks issued notes promising to pay the bearer an amount of gold or silver on demand, allowing them to conduct business with only a fraction of their total assets held as coin on hand. Throughout the period before the Civil War, various forms of paper money circulated in the United States, including private bank notes, Treasury notes, and bills of exchange. Banks issued notes promising to pay the bearer an amount of gold or silver on demand. These notes were not legal tender but circulated based on the promise to redeem, sometimes at a discount. The First and Second Bank of the United States issued notes nationally through branches, which tended to pass at face value. The Bank of the United States helped state bank notes remain at par by redeeming them. However, banks were not always able to fulfill their promise to redeem notes, even when solvent. During financial crises, banks struggled to meet the demand for gold and silver, leading to suspension of note convertibility. Treasury notes were introduced during the War of 1812, resembling other forms of Treasury debt but were used as money due to their transactional convenience and receivability for taxes. Treasury notes issued before the Civil War were valued for their receivability for taxes, making them equivalent to coin. Bills of exchange were commonly used in large commercial transactions, serving as directives for payment between merchants. The use of bills of exchange in large commercial transactions allowed for secure transactions without the need to transport gold or silver. Treasury notes issued during the Civil War were initially convertible into gold and silver, but the government and banks eventually suspended convertibility, leading to the issuance of non-convertible notes. During the Civil War, non-convertible Treasury notes known as \"greenbacks\" were issued as legal tender, except for customs duties which had to be paid in gold or silver. The government did not promise to convert these notes, abandoning the gold standard. Greenbacks caused inflation due to their large issuance, leading to the disappearance of fractional silver currency. Private issues of paper fractional currency were outlawed, and postage stamps were also issued. After the Civil War, Congress aimed to restore the metallic standard by gradually reducing the circulation of greenbacks. In 1875, the number of greenbacks was targeted to be reduced to $300 million, but in 1878 it was frozen at around $347 million. By 1879, parity between greenbacks and gold dollars was achieved, marking the return of the United States to a metallic standard. The government ensured it could pay debts in gold, accept greenbacks for customs, and redeem greenbacks for gold on demand. The government returned to a gold standard after the Civil War, ensuring it could pay debts in gold and redeem greenbacks for gold on demand. A minor law change in 1873 had significant implications, as it omitted the silver dollar, leading to a strict gold standard from 1879-1933. The 1873 legislation omitted the silver dollar, maintaining a strict gold standard from 1879-1933. This prevented the country from shifting to a de facto silver standard, leading to agitation for the restoration of silver as circulating currency. Legislation in 1878 called for the Treasury to purchase and mint silver into dollars each year. In 1890, the purchase provisions for silver coins changed, allowing redemption for gold. The value of silver dollars and certificates was lower than their mint value due to the fall in silver value. The government captured the difference as seignorage. Silver money's value was artificially high, coexisting with a gold standard due to limited issuance of silver coins and certificates. During the late 19th century, the government issued gold certificates as promises to pay gold on demand, making money easier to carry and transfer. Treasury notes were reintroduced in 1890, backed by silver and redeemable for silver based on market value. The national bank system was established during the Civil War, marking a significant change in U.S. history. The national bank system was created during the Civil War, allowing banks to issue notes backed by government bonds. These notes were not legal tender but were redeemable in gold or legal tender notes. State bank notes were phased out through a 10% tax, and national bank notes were uniform in design, providing a safe and uniform paper currency. The government's flirtation with silver raised concerns about restoring the bimetallic standard, causing market instability. In 1900, the government reaffirmed the gold standard, making the gold dollar the standard unit of account and establishing a gold reserve for government-issued paper notes. In the late 19th century, a gold reserve was established for government-issued paper notes, alongside the existing legal tender of greenbacks, silver certificates, and silver dollars. Treasury notes were discontinued, and checks became increasingly common as a form of money, allowing for transactions between customers of different banks and regions. Checks functioned similarly to bank notes, reducing the need for large amounts of coin and legal tender on hand. In the late 19th century, checks replaced the need for large amounts of coin and legal tender. However, a fraction of money in checking accounts had to be kept on hand or with clearing agents. Banks faced periodic runs by customers demanding cash, leading to bank failures and more withdrawals. The system was not elastic, causing money shortages and periodic banking panics. The Federal Reserve System (Fed) was created in 1913 to address money shortages, especially during harvest time. It provided a way for banks to borrow cash and could create Federal Reserve notes to meet demand. The Fed operated under the gold standard, maintaining a percentage of gold cover for its notes. Despite the creation of the Fed, the dollar was still defined in terms of gold, and gold dictated its value. The gold standard was ended for the United States in 1933, leading to bank failures from 1930-1933. The Federal Reserve failed to provide enough liquidity due to the gold standard, which limited its ability to create more money and lower interest rates without risking gold outflows. The United States ended the gold standard in 1933 to prevent the economy from collapsing. This decision led to the suspension of convertibility into gold, nationalization of private gold holdings, and a devaluation of approximately 40%. The new parity with gold was established for international transactions only. President Roosevelt closed banks to prevent bank runs and gold export, invoking the Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917. He prohibited gold payouts and foreign exchange, leading to the Emergency Banking Act's passage by Congress. Congress passed the Emergency Banking Act to include national emergencies, retroactively approved the President's actions, and granted him power to regulate gold payments. President Roosevelt prohibited gold transactions, hoarding of gold, and nationalized the country's gold at $20.67 per ounce. The resolution suspended the gold standard, abrogated gold clauses, and allowed the President to alter the dollar's gold content to 50% of its previous value. The Thomas Amendment reduced the value of the dollar by 50% and authorized the issuance of up to $3 billion in U.S. notes. It allowed the market price of gold to increase to $35 by January 1934 and gave the President power to set the new value of the dollar at not less than 60% of its previous value. The Gold Reserve Act nationalized gold, withdrew gold coin from circulation, and outlawed private holdings of gold. In June 1934, the Congress passed the Silver Purchase Act, requiring a portion of the US monetary stocks to be held in silver at its official value. Silver could be coined or issued as silver certificates, exchangeable for silver coin. The government's abrogation of gold clauses in contracts was upheld by the Supreme Court in February 1935, allowing the government to pay its debts in paper money. The outlawing of gold clauses in contracts reduced government debt payments in gold. The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 maintained the dollar's definition in terms of gold but limited gold transactions to official settlements. The Bretton Woods agreement in 1944 constrained the role of gold, with currencies pegged to the dollar and settlements made in dollars or other convertible currencies. Under the Bretton Woods agreement, countries used dollars for settlements instead of gold, with the International Monetary Fund assisting in the exchange process. Exchange restrictions were imposed by major trading partners to maintain official exchange rates and avoid depleting reserves. In the late 1950s, major trading countries began dropping exchange restrictions, moving towards an international gold standard. However, this led to currency crises as countries struggled to maintain their currency values. The United States faced challenges in controlling its monetary policy, resulting in an excess issuance of dollars. Under the Bretton Woods system, countries coordinated to maintain currencies at official levels, leading to an overvalued dollar. The US faced challenges with inflation and a limit on currency outstanding against its gold reserves. In 1963, Congress repealed the Silver Purchase Act and authorized the production of Federal Reserve notes in $1 and $2 denominations to replace silver certificates. The Kennedy Administration arranged for the gradual retirement of silver certificates to use the government's silver holdings for coins. In 1965, clad coins of copper and nickel replaced silver coins due to inflation. The requirement to hold gold reserves against Federal Reserve deposits was repealed in 1965, and in 1968. In 1968, the gold standard was essentially abandoned as the private market price of gold was allowed to deviate from the official settlements price. The collapse of the \"gold pool\" arrangements led to this new policy, where the United States avoided large official settlements in gold and made it clear that other countries could not redeem large quantities of dollars for gold. In August 1971, the Nixon Administration announced a temporary measure to not freely convert dollars at their official exchange rate, putting pressure on other countries to revalue their currencies. This led to the dollar floating by default until the \"Smithsonian Agreement\" in December 1972, where the dollar was devalued from $35 per ounce. In December 1972, an agreement was reached to devalue the dollar from $35 to $38 per troy ounce of gold, with other countries revaluing their currencies. The new value was officially set by Congress in March 1972. Despite efforts to maintain the dollar's value, it became impractical within a year, leading to a second devaluation to $42.22 per troy ounce of gold in February 1973. The dollar was devalued to $42.22 per troy ounce of gold in February 1973, leading to the abandonment of the fixed exchange rate. The official $42.22 par value was not maintained, and in October 1976, the dollar's definition in terms of gold was removed from statute, transitioning the monetary system to pure fiat money. This history challenges claims about a steady commitment to the gold standard in U.S. monetary history. The gold standard in the United States existed from 1879 to 1933, with variations like bimetallic standards and fiat money systems before and after. Even under the gold standard, paper money was used, issued by banks and not always legal tender. A metallic standard does not guarantee against currency devaluation, as the unit of account can be changed. The currency depreciation of 1834 showed that devaluation can occur without leaving the standard. Under a bimetallic standard, depreciation can result from changing metal availability. Legal-tender coins in the US were less than full-bodied, even under a metallic standard. The Federal Reserve operated under the gold standard for nearly 20 years, and central banks historically supported the gold standard. The classic gold standard ended in 1933, followed by a partial gold standard. A dollar defined as a specific amount of gold does not constitute a true gold standard. The transition from a genuine metallic standard to a fiat money system was not intentional but rather a result of the inability to maintain links to gold. The United States gradually stopped redeeming dollars for gold in international transactions in the late 1960s, leading to the eventual loss of fixed price redemption in 1971 and 1973. This marked the shift towards floating exchange rates by default."
