    "content": "A variety of statutes and regulations govern leasing and permitting for energy exploration and production on federal lands. Projects are divided into two categories: fossil fuel exploration and production, governed by the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920. The Bureau of Land Management administers the MLA, authorizing exploration and production activities for lessees upon request. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 governs renewable energy projects like solar and wind, while geothermal projects are leased under separate laws similar to oil and gas projects. In the past, private entities could easily explore and purchase federal lands with fossil fuels through the Mining Law of 1872, a process known as \"patenting.\" The Mining Law of 1872 allowed private acquisition of oil lands for a nominal amount, but the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 ended this by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to issue permits and lease federal lands for exploration of oil, coal, natural gas, and defense-related minerals. The federal government retains ownership while leasing to energy companies through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 authorizes the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to lease subsurface mineral rights on federal lands, including those managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Certain lands like national parks, monuments, and areas within the National Wilderness Preservation System are excluded from leasing. Valid property rights existing before 1984 are preserved. The Secretary of the Interior cannot issue leases for National Forest System lands reserved from the public domain if the Secretary of Agriculture objects. The Secretary of the Interior can withdraw federal lands to restrict certain land uses, including fossil fuel exploration and production. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers mineral leasing on federal lands, totaling 258 million surface acres. Congress can make withdrawals through legislation to limit activities like fossil fuel exploration and production on federal lands. The Secretary of the Interior cannot modify or revoke a congressional withdrawal. The Secretary of the Interior develops Resource Management Plans (RMPs) for BLM lands, applying \"multiple use\" and \"sustained yield\" principles. RMPs determine which lands may be leased and must be consistent with activities on BLM lands. \"Multiple use\" principles aim to manage lands for various resource values to meet present and future needs judiciously. The Secretary of the Interior develops Resource Management Plans (RMPs) for BLM lands, applying \"multiple use\" and \"sustained yield\" principles. RMPs aim to balance diverse resource uses while ensuring long-term sustainability for future generations. Public participation and environmental impact assessments are required in the development of RMPs. The Forest Service manages approximately 193 million acres under these principles. The Forest Service manages 193 million acres under \"multiple use\" and \"sustained yield\" policies, developing land management plans considering desired conditions, objectives, and suitability for various uses. Public participation is required in the planning process, and lands are classified into three categories for leasing: open to development with standard lease terms, open with constraints requiring stipulations, and closed to leasing based on management direction. The Forest Service must comply with NEPA when analyzing NFS lands for potential leasing. Once the analysis is complete, BLM is notified of decisions and may authorize leasing. The MLA allows for competitive and noncompetitive leasing processes for oil and gas exploration. BLM generates a list of lands available for competitive leasing, with private entities submitting nominations for auctioned parcels. Unit sizes for auctioned parcels are limited, except in Alaska. The maximum unit acreage for federal lands being auctioned is 2,560 acres, except in Alaska where it is 5,760 acres. The Secretary must provide 45 days notice before leasing, with a 30-day public comment period. Competitive bidding is held quarterly in each state with federal lands available for leasing. The minimum bid at auction is $2 per acre, and bids below this are rejected. Competitive bids are legally binding commitments. The MLA requires the Secretary to accept the highest bid from a responsible qualified bidder meeting the national minimum bid. The winning bidder must make payments on the day of sale, including the minimum bid, first year's rental, and processing fee. The lease is issued within 60 days, with a royalty payment of at least 12.5% on production. If no bids meet the minimum bid, the land will be offered again. Noncompetitive leasing is available for two years after a competitive bidding auction. The first qualified person to apply and pay the $75 fee can receive the lease without bidding. Noncompetitive offers can be withdrawn within 60 days if no lease is signed. A lottery determines the winner for simultaneous offers. Noncompetitive leases require a 12.5% royalty on oil or gas production. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) offers noncompetitive leasing for two years after a competitive auction. The lease can be obtained by the first qualified applicant who meets specific criteria. If no application is received, the land will go back to a competitive auction. Only U.S. citizens, associations, corporations, and municipalities can lease federal lands with oil and gas deposits. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) offers noncompetitive leasing for federal lands with oil and gas deposits. Entities are limited in owning or controlling leases, with a maximum acreage limit per state. Leases require a royalty payment of at least 12.5% of oil or gas production value. The Secretary can reduce royalty rates for noncompetitive leases under certain circumstances. The Department of the Interior requires royalty payments for oil and gas production on federal lands. The Secretary can sell royalty oil or gas unless it is needed for the United States. Leases also require annual rental fees, with rates starting at $1.50 per acre per year and increasing over time. A minimum royalty is due once oil or gas is discovered on the leased land, equal to the annual rental fee. Rental payments are not required on acreage where royalties or minimum royalties are being paid. Payments are not due on acreage for which royalties or minimum royalties are being paid, except on nonproducing leases when compensatory royalty has been assessed. Money received from royalties and rental fees is initially paid into the U.S. Treasury, with 50% allocated to the state where the land is located, 40% to the Reclamation Fund for water projects in arid Western states, and the rest to \"miscellaneous receipts.\" In Alaska, 90% of funds collected from federal leases are allocated to the state. The Secretary can waive, suspend, or reduce rental fees and royalties under certain conditions. Leases can be extended for exploration or production purposes. Criteria for extension include drilling operations, timely payment of fees, and ongoing oil or gas production. Production extensions do not terminate when production stops, as long as reworking or drilling operations commence within 60 days. The Mineral Leasing Act allows for lease extensions based on drilling operations, timely fee payments, and ongoing production. Leases can be extended if drilling begins within 60 days of production ceasing, and if a lease starts yielding oil or gas in paying quantities during a drilling extension, it can be extended again. Lessees can collectively operate under a cooperative exploration and production plan if deemed in the public interest. Failure to comply with the statute, lease provisions, or regulations can result in lease cancellation. The Mineral Leasing Act allows for lease extensions based on drilling operations, timely fee payments, and ongoing production. Leases can be extended if drilling begins within 60 days of production ceasing, and if a lease starts yielding oil or gas in paying quantities during a drilling extension, it can be extended again. Lessees can collectively operate under a cooperative exploration and production plan if deemed in the public interest. Failure to comply with the statute, lease provisions, or regulations can result in lease cancellation. Some circumstances require a judicial proceeding to cancel the lease, while MLA provides for automatic termination if rental payments are not made on time or if there is no producing well. Operators must submit an Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) for each oil or gas well, with the process starting at least 30 days before drilling operations. The APD must include a drilling plan, surface use plan, bond coverage evidence, BLM form, and any other required information. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requires an Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) to be submitted at least 30 days before drilling operations, including a drilling plan, surface use plan, bond coverage, and other necessary information. BLM must make this information available for public inspection for 30 days before taking action on the APD. An environmental review is also required, and BLM decides if an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is needed. After the public notice period, BLM can approve the application as submitted, with modifications, disapprove it, or delay action. A surface use plan of operations must be approved before drilling permits are granted on BLM or Forest Service lands. Before drilling permits are granted on Forest Service lands, a proposed surface use plan of operations must be submitted to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as part of the Application for a Permit to Drill (APD). The plan is then forwarded to the Forest Service for evaluation, ensuring consistency with the approved forest land management plan and compliance with NEPA and Forest Service regulations. The level of detail required in the plan depends on the type and intensity of the proposed operations and the sensitivity of the surface resources affected. The Forest Service evaluates proposed surface use plans of operations for drilling permits on its lands, ensuring compliance with regulations. The Forest Service can approve the plan, approve it with conditions, disapprove it, or delay the decision. Once a decision is made, it is forwarded to BLM for leasing of the land. BLM conducts competitive coal leasing, except in specific cases. The process for coal leasing on federal lands, governed by the MLA, requires a comprehensive land use analysis before leasing can commence. This analysis includes identifying coal-rich areas, evaluating land suitability, considering multiple use conflicts, and consulting with surface estate owners. The process for leasing federal lands for coal production involves regional coal leasing and leasing on application. Regional coal leasing involves selecting tracts based on regional requirements, establishing leasing levels, ranking tracts for leasing, and producing an environmental impact statement. BLM produces a regional coal leasing environmental impact statement (EIS) to consider site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts. After completing the EIS, BLM consults with federal agencies, governors, and Indian tribes before adopting a lease sale schedule. The lease sales determine fair market value (FMV) and maximum economic recovery for tracts offered. BLM only accepts bids meeting or exceeding FMV. The highest bid that meets all requirements is awarded the lease. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) conducts coal leasing through a process that involves submitting applications, determining fair market value (FMV), and consulting with relevant parties before lease sales. The highest bid meeting FMV is awarded the lease. The Bureau of Land Management conducts coal leasing through a process involving applications, determining fair market value, and lease sales. Coal tracts can only be leased to certain entities, with restrictions on acreage ownership. BLM-issued coal leases have initial terms of 20 years, with extensions based on coal production. Lessees must make rental payments and meet specific criteria for lease acquisition. The Bureau of Land Management requires lessees to pay rental fees and a royalty on coal recovered from leased land. The Secretary determines lease terms and conditions, including diligent development requirements and bonding. Interest in renewable energy projects on federal land has increased due to concerns over emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. BLM issues leases for renewable energy projects, with relevant statutes and regulations discussed in this section. Renewable energy projects on federal lands must adhere to relevant statutes and regulations, including those managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Geothermal energy, produced from heat stored underground, is a viable option for power generation on federal lands. BLM issues leases for renewable energy projects, aligning with the principles of \"multiple use\" and \"sustained yield\" during the Resource Management Plan (RMP) process. BLM manages geothermal energy leases on 247 million acres of lands in the Western United States and Alaska, with 530 leases currently in place. These projects operate under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, setting detailed provisions for leasing and administration. Geothermal energy projects on federal lands differ from other renewables as they are operated through leases rather than limited authorizations. The Geothermal Steam Act governs geothermal steam leasing on federal lands, similar to oil and gas leasing. It allows for competitive and noncompetitive leasing processes, with parcels nominated for auction. BLM must provide 45 days notice before offering federal lands for geothermal leasing, holding competitive bidding at least once every two years. The federal lands are offered for competitive leasing through an auction with specific bid requirements. Bidders must make a minimum bid per acre for different lease years. The winning bidder must pay a percentage of the bid amount and rental fees within a specified timeframe. Lands with no bids are available for noncompetitive leasing for a two-year period. After a lease sale, parcels are available for 30 days in their configured state before applications for any available lands are accepted. Mining claim holders on federal lands can apply for noncompetitive geothermal leases on their claimed lands. Direct use geothermal leases allow for the use of hot water directly for intended purposes without the need for electricity generation. Applicants can obtain direct use leases if the lands are open for geothermal leasing and deemed appropriate for direct use operations by the BLM. BLM allows for direct use leasing of geothermal lands if no competitive interest is shown within 90 days of notice. Geothermal leases have a 10-year initial term with extensions based on development activities and annual expenditures. Lessees must make annual rental payments to BLM. For geothermal leases acquired in competitive lease sales after August 8, 2005, the annual rent is $2 per acre for the 1st year and $3 per acre for the 2nd through the 10th year. Non-competitive leases have an annual rent of $1 per acre for the first 10 years, increasing to $5 per acre each year after. Royalty payments on electricity produced from geothermal steam on federal lands are required, with rates of 1.75% of gross sales for the first 10 years and 3.5% thereafter. If resources are sold to a third party for electricity production, the royalty rate is 10%. Direct use lessees pay a direct use fee unless they sell resources to a third party. Geothermal leases can be suspended or canceled by the Secretary of the Interior for conservation reasons or violations. The Secretary can adjust rental or royalty rates for conservation purposes. Lessees must submit a Notice of Intent for exploration operations, ensuring water protection during exploration. Geothermal exploration and drilling operations must protect natural resources, accommodate other land uses, minimize noise, and prevent property damage. Data collected during exploration must be shared with BLM, and drilling operations require a permit. Lessees must meet BLM's geothermal well abandonment requirements. BLM manages federal lands for various energy projects, including oil, gas, geothermal, wind, and solar. Wind potential exists in 11 Western states on 20.6 million acres of federal lands. BLM has amended 52 land use plans for wind energy projects. The Southwestern US has high solar radiation levels, making it suitable for solar energy development. BLM actively promotes wind and solar energy projects. BLM promotes wind and solar energy projects on managed lands, but certain areas like Wilderness Areas, National Monuments, and special management areas are not open for development. Title V of FLPMA allows rights-of-way for electric energy systems on federal lands. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) allows rights-of-way for electric energy systems on federal lands, but does not specifically address wind or solar energy projects. However, wind and solar projects on federal lands are conducted via rights-of-way, making many provisions of FLPMA and accompanying regulations relevant. The agencies have discretion to grant rights-of-way unless prohibited by specific statutes, regulations, or orders. Applicants for BLM rights-of-way for wind or solar energy projects must meet requirements set by the Secretary of the Interior. Rights-of-way applications on BLM lands must include disclosures on land use, business partners, and plans, along with a processing fee. BLM rights-of-way differ from leases as the United States retains substantial rights over the land, including access, common use, and resource ownership. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) grants rights-of-way for compatible uses while retaining ownership of land resources. The terms can be renewable, with the ability to change conditions for public health or safety. BLM may modify routes or facility locations in the public interest. Holders must follow periodic reviews and make rent payments as required. DOI is seeking public comment on establishing a competitive leasing system for wind and solar projects on federal lands. Rent for non-linear rights-of-way is determined through various methods, including appraisals and competitive bidding. Holders of BLM rights-of-way must make monthly rent payments as set by BLM regulations. The Forest Service is considering a leasing program for solar and wind energy projects on public lands. They do not currently authorize such projects but applicants can apply for special use authorization under applicable regulations. The Forest Service requires individuals or entities to submit a proposal for special use authorization before conducting energy projects on public lands. This authorization includes permits, leases, and easements for wind or solar generation facilities. Applicants must contact the Forest Service office responsible for the land early in advance. The authorized officer screens the application to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. The Forest Service requires a proposal for special use authorization for energy projects on public lands, including wind or solar facilities. The application is screened to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, followed by a formal submission and review process involving federal, state, and local agencies, as well as public input. If approved, a special use authorization may be issued with certain limitations. The Forest Service issues special use authorizations for energy projects on public lands, with specific terms and conditions including the right of physical entry, common land use, and payment of annual rental fees based on fair market value. The authorization can be revoked or terminated for various reasons outlined in regulations. The regulations for special use authorizations do not specify duration and renewability, stating that it will be determined by the authorized officer based on the project's purpose and circumstances. Renewal is granted if the project is still in use and maintained according to the authorization, or at the officer's discretion upon request."
