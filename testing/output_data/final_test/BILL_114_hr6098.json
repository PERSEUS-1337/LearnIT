    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Transparent Recognition of Unjustified Tax Hoarding in Government Act of 2016\" or as the \"TRUTH in Government Act of 2016\". Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1861 during the Civil War, imposing a tax on personal incomes with withholding at the source. After the war, the income tax was abolished in 1872, along with the Federal withholding mandate. The 16th amendment led to the creation of a Federal income tax, withheld before employee salaries were paid. Treasury Secretary McAdoo acknowledged taxpayer criticism of the withholding mandate. During World War II, Federal officials reinstated income tax withholding as a temporary wartime measure to ensure funding for the war effort. Taxes were due on March 15 and could be paid in one lump sum or quarterly installments in the 1920s and 1930s. The withholding of income tax at the source was initially implemented during the Civil War but was repealed in 1872 due to criticism. The Withholding Tax Act of 1943 was passed as a wartime measure to reinstitute income tax withholding. Despite public opposition, the Act incorporated suggestions by Beardsley Ruml to eliminate individuals' 1942 tax liabilities by counting amounts paid or withheld in 1943 as tax payments for that year. Congress has since refused to repeal the withholding mandate, leading to over $330 billion in overpayments refunded by the IRS in 2014, effectively denying interest payments owed to taxpayers. The Federal withholding mandate allows the government to disguise tax increases and hampers accountability and transparency. Taxpayers often confuse overpayments as rewards, leading to annual tax refunds. In 2010, 41% of tax returns had zero or negative income tax liability. Compliance with the mandate denies taxpayers interest on their withholdings. The Federal withholding mandate imposes burdens on employers without compensation. Economist James Buchanan highlighted the lack of real cost awareness due to withholding. CATO Institute's Charlotte Twight emphasized withholding as a key mechanism for Federal revenue collection. The National Taxpayers Union points out that withholding masks the true cost of Federal income taxes, making it easier for the government to collect funds for welfare programs. The Act aims to increase transparency in the tax system, decrease tax burden, and end deceptive practices. It includes provisions to allow for personal collection of interest on overpayments, eliminate income tax withholding for employers, and repeal the Federal income and social security tax withholding mandate. The Act repeals various tax withholding provisions, including social security and railroad retirement taxes, as well as income tax withholding. It also amends the requirement for estimated tax payments for employee social security taxes. Effective date for these changes is after one year from the enactment of the Act. Additionally, voluntary tax withholding continues under the Act. SEC. 5. CONTINUED VOLUNTARY TAX WITHHOLDING.\n\nThe IRS retains authority to accept voluntary tax payments from employers and employees can choose to participate in employer-sponsored withholding systems. Employees are not required to participate but can opt in with negotiable terms."
