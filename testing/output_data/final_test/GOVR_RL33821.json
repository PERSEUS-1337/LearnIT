    "content": "The September 2006 House International Relations Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific hearing focused on America's strategic and defense relationships in the Asia-Pacific region. The goal was to assess current and future strategic prospects in the region. Former Chairman Jim Leach highlighted the geopolitical challenges the United States will face in Asia in the coming years. The United States faces significant geopolitical challenges in Asia, where maintaining a robust military presence has been crucial for national security. Bilateral defense alliances with key Asian states were established in the 1950s to contain communist expansion and have provided support through the Cold War and Vietnam War. The geopolitical landscape of Asia has changed significantly since the Cold War and Vietnam War, with the fall of the Soviet Union, rise of China, and emergence of violent extremists. The United States is reassessing its strategic and defense relationships in Asia, including shifting forces from Okinawa to Guam, reducing forces in South Korea, and increasing naval and air forces on Guam. Regional states still value the positive role the United States plays in promoting regional security. Some regional states welcome the US role in promoting security, but others are hedging against perceived American disengagement. A study suggests that the US must actively re-engage to maintain influence in Asia. Power dynamics are shifting in the region, prompting Japan to enhance military capabilities and India to assert itself internationally. India, South Korea, and Indonesia are developing their military capabilities and asserting themselves in international affairs. These developments present challenges and opportunities for the United States in the Asia-Pacific region, including the rise of China, potential interstate conflict, the fight against Islamist militancy, and arms expenditures. China's rapid economic growth and emergence as a great power in Asia is a defining event in the current geopolitical landscape. The United States hopes for a peaceful and prosperous China, while also hedging against the possibility of a less benign rise. Tensions over Taiwan, China's military modernization, power projection capabilities, diplomatic relationships, economic presence, and resource drive are ongoing concerns. China's military power, particularly in relation to Taiwan, is a growing concern for the United States. The Pentagon's reports highlight China's potential to compete militarily with the U.S. and its efforts to develop power projection capabilities. Observers believe China aims to establish itself as the dominant power in East Asia, which conflicts with U.S. goals in the region. The U.S. goal of preventing Asian domination by a single power conflicts with the potential for interstate conflict in Asia, particularly between China and Taiwan, on the Korean Peninsula, and between India and Pakistan. Regional arms sales reflect this tension, with top recipients including India, China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Pakistan. Tensions also exist between Japan and China, and Korea and Japan, with Taiwan remaining a plausible scenario for U.S. involvement in great power conflict. President Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has taken a more independent stance for Taiwan. In 2001, President Bush pledged support for Taiwan's defense but later cautioned against destabilizing declarations of independence. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula escalated in 2006 due to North Korea's missile and nuclear tests, highlighting the region's potential for conflict. India and Pakistan also have a history of war, adding to the risk of interstate conflict. India and Pakistan have a history of war and ongoing tension, with potential for future conflict on the sub-continent. The two states have fought wars in the past, including border clashes and a near-war situation in 2001-2002. Tensions between Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India persist, with incidents like the 2006 train blasts in Bombay further escalating the situation. The terrorist attacks in Southeast Asia, including those in Bali and Jakarta, have been linked to radical Islamist groups like Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jemaah Islamiya. Despite successful counter-terror efforts, groups like JI and Abu Sayaff remain active in the region. A maritime security initiative aims to prevent further attacks on shipping and ports. The security initiative aims to prevent attacks on shipping and ports, especially in the Straits of Malacca. Insurrection in Southern Thailand continues, with potential ties to international terrorist groups. Terrorist groups in South Asia pose a threat to U.S. forces and could spark inter-state conflict. Al Qaeda and Taliban are active in Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions. Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad are suspected of attacks in India, raising tensions with Pakistan. Allegations of linkages between Pakistan's ISI and South Asian terrorist groups exist, facilitating cross-border infiltration. Some analysts warn that terrorist attacks in South Asia could escalate into wider conflict. The United States' relationship with Pakistan focuses on fighting militant Islamists, while its evolving partnership with India is seen as more strategic. China and India's increasing defense expenditures are drawing attention, with China prioritizing acquiring C4ISR capabilities. India's defense budget is rapidly expanding, projected to increase by 44% over the current five-year plan. This increase is based on an 8% economic growth rate and represents 2.56% of GDP. The Indian Ministry of Defense favors spending at a rate of 3% of GDP. India has a history of wars with Pakistan and China. Defense spending in East Asia and Australasia has increased, with expenditures rising from $179.6 billion in 2003 to $195.7 billion in 2004. The region's defense budget fluctuated between 1.45% and 1.57% of GDP between 1995 and 2004. The United States spends approximately 4% of its GDP on defense, and many top defense budgets in Asia belong to American allies. President Bush's national security strategy focuses on promoting freedom, justice, and human dignity. The American foreign policy tradition, known as the American project, aims to promote freedom, justice, and human dignity while building a peaceful world order of democratic states. The 2006 National Security Strategy Statement emphasizes the need for sustained U.S. engagement in East and Southeast Asia, supporting economic integration, democracy, and human rights. The NSSS emphasizes the strategic importance of South and Central Asia and the need for sound bilateral relations. The 2006 QDR highlights the need to shape the choices of countries at strategic crossroads and expresses concerns about China's military capabilities. It also asserts the need for the US to ensure regional and global security without foreign powers dictating terms. The NSSS emphasizes the importance of alliances in defeating global terrorism and preventing attacks. It highlights the need to improve partner states' capabilities and reduce vulnerabilities. The document outlines short-term objectives to prevent terrorist attacks, deny weapons of mass destruction to terrorist allies, and deny terrorists sanctuary. The QDR emphasizes the importance of the US and its allies working together to influence the global environment in defeating terrorist networks. The global environment is crucial in defeating terrorist networks, as highlighted by National Security Adviser Steve Hadley in 2006. He emphasized the importance of traditional allies and working with partners to address regional and global challenges, including terrorism. The US welcomes China as a responsible stakeholder but desires policy changes to reduce tensions, such as non-transparent military expansion. The United States has taken strategic initiatives to address rising regional security concerns, including the Trilateral Security Initiative with Australia and Japan, a strategic relationship with India, enhanced cooperation with ASEAN, and structural changes in the U.S. government. This is in response to challenges such as non-transparent military expansion and support for countries with poor records of democracy and human rights. The Joint Statement focused on the Asia Pacific region, emphasizing the need for strong security relationships among the three states. It discussed the emergence of democracies, cooperative frameworks, and China's engagement in the region. Cooperation with ASEAN, South Korea, and India was also highlighted. Secretary of State Rice emphasized the importance of creating conditions for China's rise to be a positive force in international politics. India and the United States expressed their desire to increase mutual security in a joint statement issued in March 2006. India and the United States expressed their desire to increase mutual security against common threats like terrorism and weapons of mass destruction in a joint statement in March 2006. There are differing perceptions of China in India, with some viewing the US efforts to support India as a counterweight to China. Concerns have been raised about the US fully appreciating India's desire to be a full partner in Asia's geo-strategic landscape. While strategic circles are concerned about China's growing power, India remains sensitive to being seen as subordinate to American policy towards China. U.S. policy towards Southeast Asia has focused on counter terrorism since 9/11, with efforts to broaden engagement with ASEAN through the U.S.-ASEAN Enhanced Partnership initiative launched in November 2005. Key components include political, security, economic, social, and educational cooperation. Initial projects include post-tsunami assistance, research scholarships, artistic and cultural cooperation, and trade agreements. The development of a science and technology agreement is emphasized, with a focus on operationalizing the partnership. There is potential to collaborate with the ASEAN Regional Forum on regional security issues. The defense establishment is reorganizing to adapt to the changing strategic environment in Asia, including the creation of a new Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asia and Pacific Security Affairs. American military forces in Asia are under the U.S. Pacific Command and U.S. Central Command. The United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) and U.S. Central Command are two of the nine Unified Combatant Commands and have responsibilities in the Asia-Pacific and parts of South and Central Asia. USPACOM covers approximately 50% of the earth's surface and 60% of its population, including countries like Indonesia. It has service components and subordinate unified commands like U.S. Forces Japan and U.S. Forces Korea. The USPACOM, established in 1947, is the oldest and largest of the United States' unified commands. It reports directly to the Secretary of Defense and the President. The CENTCOM, covering the Middle East and parts of East Africa and Central Asia, includes countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Kazakhstan. Efforts are underway to enhance the flexibility of U.S. forces in Asia and make them more deployable to conflict zones. Recent polls show strong support for retaining American military bases both at home and abroad, with 68% of Americans in favor of maintaining or increasing the number of bases. Additionally, 65% of Americans believe that the U.S. military presence in East Asia should be maintained or increased. In South Korea, 62% support having American bases, with 59% wanting increased U.S. military presence in East Asia. In Japan, 57% support American bases, showing a 5% increase since 2004. Afghanistan has 52% in favor of American bases. 66% of Indians view the U.S. positively in resolving Asian issues. The reconfiguration of American military forces in the Asia Pacific region is ongoing. The Global Posture Review (GPR) initiated in 2001 is reshaping the U.S. military presence worldwide. The Integrated Global Presence and Basing Study (IGPBS) is a key part of this reconfiguration. U.S. forces are reducing their forward deployments while increasing deployments from the United States. Plans to withdraw up to 70,000 troops from Europe and Asia were announced in 2004 as a result of the GPR. The U.S. military plans to withdraw up to 70,000 troops from Europe and Asia over the next decade. In 2004, it was projected that 20,000 troops would be withdrawn from Asia, challenging the conventional wisdom of maintaining 100,000 troops in the Asia-Pacific theater. The new basing structure focuses more on preemption and power projection, potentially impacting regional states' perceptions of American power and commitment to allies. The U.S. military is shifting its overseas military bases in Asia to increase flexibility for contingencies and adapt to changing relationships with key allies. This includes moving 8,000 Marines from Japan to Guam, as well as shifting submarines from the Atlantic to the Pacific theater. The new basing structure aims to enhance power projection and cooperation with regional allies. The U.S. military is increasing its presence in the Pacific theater by deploying submarines to Guam, Hawaii, San Diego, and Bremerton. The build-up aims to have 31 nuclear-powered attack submarines in the Pacific by 2010. Guam's political advantage as American territory allows forces based there to operate without restrictions from foreign governments. A follow-on study is being considered to focus on global issues and capabilities like logistics, mobility, and intelligence. The Kwajalin Missile Range on Kwajalin Island supports testing of various missiles and NASA operations. Concerns exist about America's regional security relationships and its perceived vulnerability in Asia due to the \"China threat\" and declining presence. Some Asian analysts predict that America's presence in Asia is declining, leading to uncertainty about its future role and potential isolationism. This perception undermines America's leadership in the region, with concerns about its exercise of power and focus causing unease among regional states and allies. Many regional allies are uneasy with the US administration's exercise of power in world affairs, leading to concerns about future Washington initiatives. The rationale for America's Pacific Alliances has evolved over time, originally formed to contain communism in the 1950s. Ongoing operations in the Middle East have diverted attention from key developments in Asia. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, America's focus on containing communism shifted due to the Vietnam War and the Guam Doctrine of 1969. This led to a redefinition of America's commitment to the region, encouraging regional allies to take more responsibility for their defense. Former Defense Minister Kim Beazley of Australia notes that alliance relationships have strengthened over time, with some countries like Australia and Japan growing closer. Despite challenges faced by some countries like Thailand, New Zealand, and the Philippines, the alliance system in post-war Asia has endured. The United States remains a key balancer of power in the region, as shown by its strong relationships with regional allies. However, there are signs that some states are hedging against a future where the US may not be the dominant power. Regional states in Asia are hedging against a future where the United States may not be the dominant power. Differences in perspective towards China and the US are influenced by trade and proximity. The creation of the East Asia Summit in 2006, with China as a key member, reflects regional states' desire to be part of influential regional organizations. Shifting perceptions of the US and China's roles present challenges to alliance relationships in the region. The United States' alliance relationships in Asia may need redefinition to align with changing strategic priorities and allied perspectives. China's diplomatic approach and economic influence have improved Asian states' views. The US remains engaged in military exercises with regional states, including Talisman Sabre with Australia and RIMPAC with multiple states. The United States, Australia, and New Zealand have a strong defense relationship dating back to World War I, formalized through the ANZUS Treaty in 1952. Military exercises involving multiple countries in the Asia-Pacific region demonstrate efforts to engage regional states across various scenarios. The ANZUS Treaty, signed in 1952, solidified the strong defense relationship between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Australia is considered a key ally in the Pacific and has actively supported the U.S. in various military operations, including after the 9/11 attacks. The annual AUSMIN process plays a central role in the alliance, with discussions on joint training centers like the one at Shoalwater Bay. The communiqu\u00e9 discussed the development of a Joint Combined Training Centre at Shoalwater Bay for exercise Talisman Sabre. It also mentioned opportunities for U.S. aircraft to train in Australia and highlighted counter-terrorism, regional cooperation, non-proliferation, and bilateral defense relations. Plans for military training bases at Bradshaw and Yampi Sound in Northwest Australia were reported, with details on their capacities and purposes. Additionally, the 2006 AUSMIN Communiqu\u00e9 aimed to explore trilateral defense cooperation with Japan, while the New Zealand leg of the alliance was suspended in the mid-1980s. The New Zealand leg of the trilateral alliance was suspended in the mid-1980s due to New Zealand's nuclear policies. Today, New Zealand and the United States are friends but no longer formal allies. There are signs of loosening restrictions on defense cooperation, with the United States issuing a waiver for New Zealand to participate in maritime interdiction exercises in 2006. Australia and New Zealand have promoted regional stability through peace operations in East Timor, Bougainville, and the Solomon Islands. The United States and Japan, once enemies in World War II, are now close allies, with treaties signed in 1951 and 1960. The Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, established in 1960, solidifies their defense ties and allows the US to use bases in Japan. Japan is a key ally in America's regional alliance, hosting 53,000 American military personnel. The alliance is focused on shared concerns about China's rise and North Korea's nuclear threat, as well as democratic values. Despite a period of drift after the Cold War, the alliance is now stronger than ever. Former Prime Minister Koizumi played a significant role in this alliance. Former Prime Minister Koizumi's successor, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, aims to revise Japan's constitution for a normal military force and closer military cooperation with the US. Despite being stronger, there are still constitutional constraints on Japan's ability to act as an alliance partner, particularly regarding Article 9 which limits the use of force. The extent of Japan's engagement in collective self-defense remains uncertain. The extent of Japan's engagement in collective self-defense is uncertain, with debates on amending the constitution to allow for a more active role in defense matters. Key events like China's rise and North Korea's actions have prompted discussions on closer military cooperation with the US. Japan's increasing concern with North Korea, highlighted by missile tests and a nuclear test in 2006, led to the strengthening of its missile defense program and alliance with the United States through key initiatives like the \"2+2\" meeting. The U.S. and Japan are working towards peaceful resolutions on issues related to North Korea and Taiwan, promoting transparency in China's military affairs, and enhancing global stability by reducing weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. The U.S. military presence on Okinawa has been a sensitive issue, with plans to reduce the Marine presence from 18,000 to 11,000 to improve the alliance's political sustainability. Despite efforts to address these issues, the potential for further incidents remains. The alliance between the United States and South Korea dates back to the 1953 U.S.-R.O.K. Mutual Security Agreement after the Korean War. American casualties in the war were significant. Currently, there are 25,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea. Differences between the two countries have emerged, particularly regarding North Korea. South Korea has favored engagement, while the Bush Administration has taken a more hardline approach. Younger South Koreans perceive the threat from North Korea differently. South Koreans have a different perception of the threat from North Korea, leading to questioning of American military presence in the R.O.K. Tensions also exist between the U.S. and R.O.K regarding Japan, with historical tensions and territorial disputes hindering closer relations. South Korea's refusal to participate in PSI exercises, aimed at preventing North Korean weapon proliferation, adds to the tensions. Additionally, South Koreans view China positively in resolving key issues in Asia. The government of Roh Moo-hyun in South Korea has called for the removal of South Korean forces from the American command structure. Some in the United States support transferring command early to focus more on the Middle East. Current U.S. plans aim to reduce forces in South Korea from 30,000 to 25,000 by 2008. Issues regarding the wartime command of U.S. and Korean forces have raised concerns about the alliance. The U.S. and South Korea agreed on repositioning bases, including the return of Yongsan Garrison in Seoul, to modernize and rationalize force structure. The U.S. and South Korea have repositioned and restructured their forces to modernize and rationalize their basing arrangements. This includes creating more mobile units for strategic flexibility. However, South Korea asserts its right to veto deployments to third countries from Korea. President Roh emphasizes South Korea's right to prohibit U.S. forces from participating in conflicts it does not support. The American Ambassador to the R.O.K. Alexander Vershbow highlighted the broadening of the alliance's mission to promote stability in Northeast Asia and cooperation against new security threats. This shift in focus, along with South Korea's desire to control its armed forces and veto the use of American forces, creates uncertainties. Additionally, the ongoing negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement could strengthen the bilateral relationship. The Philippines were occupied by the United States in 1898 after Admiral George Dewey's victory in Manila Bay during the Spanish American War. The 1898 Treaty of Paris ceded the Philippines and Guam to the United States. Independence was achieved in 1946 after Japanese occupation during World War II. In 1951, a Mutual Defense Treaty was signed, but in 1991, the Philippines Senate rejected a bases treaty allowing US military bases. Bilateral relations improved, leading to the signing of a Visiting Forces Agreement in 1998 for joint military exercises. The United States and the Philippines have a strong military relationship, conducting joint exercises to enhance combat readiness against terrorist threats. The U.S. supports the Philippines in countering radical Islamists like Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiya. The Philippines, a predominantly Catholic country, faces security challenges in Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago. U.S. troops have assisted in operations against Abu Sayyaf, with ongoing discussions on the extent of U.S. military involvement. The U.S. military has a direct support role to the Armed Forces of the Philippines in countering radical Islamists like Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiya. There are concerns over ties between ASG, JI, and elements of the MILF. China's shift to a more diplomatic posture is improving relations between the Philippines and China. Thailand and the United States have close military ties under the 1954 Manila Pact and the Thanat-Rusk Communiqu\u00e9 of 1962. Thailand and the United States have close military ties dating back to the 1962 Thanat-Rusk Communiqu\u00e9. Thailand is a Major Non-NATO ally and participates in military training programs with the U.S. They have collaborated on various military exercises, including Cobra Gold, and share concerns over Islamist ideology. Thailand also faces a Muslim separatist movement in its southern provinces. Thailand's Muslim separatist movement in the southern provinces has not been linked to regional Islamist terrorists, but there are concerns about potential exploitation. The country balances its military and economic ties with the U.S. and China, with strained relations after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Thailand aims for \"equidistance\" between the U.S. and China, despite increasing strategic competition between the two. The United States has key strategic relationships in Asia with Singapore, India, Taiwan, and Indonesia. Singapore and the US have a close defense relationship, India is emerging as a crucial partner, Taiwan is covered by the Taiwan Defense Act, and relations with Indonesia have improved since 2004. The Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) signed in July 2005 between the United States and Singapore enhances their defense relationship, addressing issues like counterterrorism and regional security. This agreement complements the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, strengthening both security and trade ties. Additionally, the United States aims to promote maritime security cooperation in the strategically important Straits of Malacca by collaborating with Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Singapore plays a key role in maritime surveillance of the Straits of Malacca, a crucial trade route for world trade and oil. The United States sees India as a strategic partner to counter rising Chinese influence, with growing cooperation in various areas. The Bush Administration developed a \"strategic partnership\" with India, focusing on civil nuclear, civil space, and high technology trade. The Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) was launched in 2004, with a defense framework agreement signed in 2005. President Bush and Prime Minister Singh formalized the strategic partnership in 2005, agreeing to collaborate on fighting terrorism, promoting democracy, expanding trade, improving health and the environment, and meeting energy demands through new technologies. Military exercises like Cope India in 2006 strengthened the partnership. The history of American and Congressional involvement with Taiwan, as well as Taiwan's democratic development, has led to a complex set of relationships between the United States and Taiwan. The Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and Taiwan was signed in 1954 but terminated in 1979. The Taiwan Relations Act now guides U.S-Taiwan defense relations. The Taiwan Relations Act of April 10, 1979 ensures U.S. support for Taiwan's defense against China, without a guaranteed commitment of U.S. forces. The act declares U.S. policy for peaceful determination of Taiwan's future and providing defense articles and services for Taiwan's self-defense capability. China opposes U.S. defense aid to Taiwan. U.S.-Indonesia bilateral defense relations have improved under President George Bush, following concerns about human rights abuses by the Indonesian military. The Indonesian electoral process in 2004 led to a democratic government focused on civil society and human rights. Military cooperation with a reform-oriented Indonesian military is aimed at combating radical violent Islamist extremists in Southeast Asia. The new approach to developing military ties includes reforming the military and discussing the future of Islam. Defense ties now encompass broader security relationships that are politically sustainable. U.S. policy options in Asia cover ideological, military, diplomatic, cultural, and economic aspects. The United States could potentially secure its interests in Asia and promote its system of government by developing relations with like-minded democratic nations in the region. This policy would differentiate the foreign policy approaches of the United States and China, positively impacting regional public perceptions of the U.S. However, it may also alienate foreign governments opposed to U.S. involvement in their internal affairs. Emphasizing alliances with democratic states like Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, and India, as well as supporting democracy in Muslim states like Indonesia, could be achieved through increased U.S.-funded development resources. Many suggest that promoting democracy in regional developing countries, particularly Muslim states like Indonesia, could help combat radical Islamist extremism. This approach involves not only attacking terrorists but also shrinking the political space in which they operate. By supporting moderate Muslim states and aid programs in Muslim majority areas, such as the southern Philippines and southern Thailand, marginalized populations could become more integrated. Additionally, policies that promote economic well-being in these states could be beneficial. Policies promoting economic well-being in Muslim states could help combat radicalization by addressing alienation and disaffection. Initiatives like educating future leaders and funding exchanges with academia, military, and cultural representatives can enhance understanding and inform American policy. It is in the U.S.'s interest to strengthen allies' capabilities in the region. Some argue for enhancing allies' capabilities to handle future threats, emphasizing combined arms interoperability. Concern exists over a technology gap with Asian partners, but asymmetrical warfare offers collaboration opportunities. Restructuring American forces in Asia aims to strengthen alliances and reduce tensions. Coordination among allies in conflict prevention is seen as beneficial. Greater coordination among allies in conflict prevention and developing economic ties can promote stability in the region. Non-allied regional states like Singapore are valuable partners. Military exchanges, joint training, and arms sales are key in building closer defense relationships. Initiatives such as anti-terror cooperation programs have strengthened defense cooperation. Exploring ways to improve and expand cooperation programs can further enhance defense relationships. Increased cooperation in defense relationships through new initiatives and policies addressing regional concerns could positively shift perceptions. Participation in regional multilateral fora, increased foreign aid, diplomatic representation, and educational exchange programs can send positive signals. Programs focusing on non-military issues like trade, health, disaster assistance, human trafficking, and poverty alleviation can demonstrate America's commitment to the region and improve public opinion. The United States could improve its position in Asia by emphasizing engagement with ASEAN, bilateral trade initiatives, and fair access to energy resources. This could help address negative public opinion and create a more favorable political atmosphere for closer defense and strategic cooperation in the region. Developing a cooperative regional approach to ensure fair access to energy resources is crucial for countries like India and China to sustain economic development and avoid potential rivalry over these strategically vital resources."
