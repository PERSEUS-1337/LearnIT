    "content": "Section 1 introduces a temporary exclusion for reservists called to active duty and Department of Defense civilian employees serving in a combat zone under a new section 139A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. For eligible individuals with excluded income under section 112 up to $40,000, their gross income will be reduced by a specified amount. If the exclusion is under $30,000, the reduction is the lesser of $30,000 or the taxpayer's gross income. If the exclusion is between $30,000 and $40,000, the reduction is calculated proportionally to gross income. The amount excluded from gross income by section 112 over $30,000 bears to $10,000 for eligible individuals serving in a combat zone. If the period of active duty is less than a full taxable year, the exclusion amount is adjusted proportionally. Eligible individuals are defined as members of a reserve component. Members of a reserve component ordered to active duty for more than 30 days or indefinitely, and civilian employees of the Department of Defense serving in a combat zone are considered eligible individuals for tax exclusion purposes. The term 'combat zone' is defined in section 112, and the term 'applicable taxable year' refers to any taxable year starting in 2003. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the tax code. Sec. 139A provides a temporary exclusion for reservists and Department of Defense civilian employees serving in combat zones. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 2002. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to exclude combat zone compensation for civilian employees of the Department of Defense serving in support of the Armed Forces of the United States. Gross income does not include compensation up to the maximum enlisted amount for active service for employees serving in a combat zone or hospitalized due to injuries from serving in a combat zone. This exclusion does not apply after 2 years from the termination of combat. The amendments made by this section exclude combat zone compensation for civilian employees of the Department of Defense serving in support of the Armed Forces of the United States. The amendments apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002."
