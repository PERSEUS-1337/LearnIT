It shows that certain classification problems require exponential network width beyond a certain depth, but can be fully represented by a neural network with linear depth and bounded width. Our proof demonstrates the importance of depth in deep neural networks, showing that functions can be efficiently represented by a depth m rectified MLP network with O(m) parameters. However, for any bounded depth rectified MLP network, representing certain functions will require an exponential number of parameters. This depth separation theorem highlights the benefit of depth in neural networks. Our proof emphasizes the simplicity of using basic algebra, geometry, and combinatorial arguments to show the importance of depth in deep neural networks. It focuses on functions represented by depth m rectified MLP networks with O(m) parameters in input space R2, rather than Rn, making it easier to understand and visualize. The proof highlights the trade-off between generality and simplicity, demonstrating that deep MLPs can efficiently represent complex functions. Deep MLP networks can represent functions that shallow networks cannot unless they have significantly more units. Network depth facilitates fast oscillations in the network response function. Telgarsky shows that exponential growth in the number of units is needed for oscillations enabled by linear growth in depth to be approximated well by a shallower network. Eldan & Shamir study approximation to the unit sphere in a wide family of activation functions, showing that a 3-layer MLP can compute the polynomial x^2 for each dimension and use the last layer to model the unit sphere indicator. The ReLU MLP decision space is analyzed by Pascanu et al. (2013), showing how input space is refined into separated convex polytopes. They establish a lower bound on the maximal number of response regions formed by ReLU and linear operations in the network. In our proof, we rely on the notion of response regions and present simplified versions of results from previous works. A 2d region is convex if all points on the line connecting any two points in the region are also within the region. A ReLU MLP with L layers is a multivariate function defined by parameterized affine transformations and the ReLU activation function. ReLU MLPs consist of hidden layers with the same width w and the last layer, h out, maps inputs to classes based on a weighted sum. The ReLU function creates piecewise linear functions dividing the input space into convex polytopes where linearity is maintained within each polytope. This concept is formally explained and visualized in Hanin & Rolnick (2019). The number of linear response regions in ReLU MLPs is studied in relation to MLP depth. The concept of folding transformation is introduced to map parts of the input space to coincide with each other, allowing subsequent operations to apply to both parts equally. The ReLU MLP uses folding transformations to map input space parts together, allowing subsequent operations to apply equally. The constructed deep network utilizes this mechanism for code reuse and unit-efficiency. The function f(x) = |x| is a simple example of this concept. The text discusses regular polygons approaching the unit circle and functions with decision boundaries based on polygon edges. The text discusses the proof of Theorem 1, showing that a network with 2^m response regions requires exponential growth in width to accommodate for the log factor. This proves part (a) of the theorem. The text then moves on to proving part (b) by discussing the depth required for a network with 2^m response regions. The construction of a network with bounded width and linear depth is based on folding transformations. By exploiting symmetry, a regular polygon decision boundary for polygon P m is manually constructed. This construction resembles paper-cutting, where folding and cutting reveal complex patterns with distinctive symmetries. Deep networks implement \"folds\" through layers, while shallow networks require more units to create the same pattern. The deep network operates by folding across both X and Y axes, mapping the input space into the first quadrant. It then rotates the space to make the decision boundary symmetric around the X axis and folds around the X axis, reducing the decision boundary until it becomes a single line. This process cuts the number of edges in the decision boundary by a factor of four and further halves the number of polygon edges with each rotate + fold sequence. The network operates by transforming input through folding, rotating, and activation layers. These transformations are achieved using linear matrix operations and ReLU activations. Folding across X and Y axes maps input to the first quadrant, followed by a clockwise rotation and folding across the X axis. The final activation layer reduces the decision boundary to a single line. The constructed network for problem f m involves folding and rotating operations, reducing the problem by half through symmetry axis folding. The network consists of matrix multiplications and ReLU activations, with m + 1 non-linear activations. The network for problem f m involves folding and rotating operations, reducing the problem by half through symmetry axis folding. It consists of matrix multiplications and ReLU activations, resulting in m + 1 layers. Modeling P m as a piecewise linear function requires at least 2 m response regions. The problem involves folding and rotating operations, reducing it by half through symmetry axis folding. It consists of matrix multiplications and ReLU activations, resulting in m + 1 layers. Modeling P m as a piecewise linear function requires at least 2 m response regions. By contradiction, points p i and p j must lay in different response regions, leading to a proof that Rectified MLP with input in R 2 has at most 2 2d log 2 w response regions. The proof involves showing the bound for 1 hidden-layer networks in R 2 and then extending it to d layers. The argument is similar to Raghu et al. (2017). By considering line arrangements in R 2, it is shown that the maximal number of regions created is r(n) \u2264 n 2. The proof involves showing the bound for 1 hidden-layer networks in R 2 and then extending it to d layers. By considering line arrangements in R 2, it is shown that the maximal number of regions created is r(n) \u2264 n 2. This is based on a classic result from computational geometry. Adding lines divides the space into more regions, with each line intersecting previous lines and adding more regions. The network structure involves a hidden-layer ReLU network with a matrix A projecting input x to w dimensions and a vector v combining them into a weighted sum. The output space is linear under this network. The ReLU activation function in a hidden-layer network splits the input space into regions where the neuron is active or rectified. Each ReLU neuron corresponds to a line that divides the input space into two regions. The network with a width w hidden layer has w such lines, creating a line arrangement that splits the space into multiple regions. The ReLU activation function in a hidden-layer network splits the input space into regions where the neuron is active. A width w hidden layer has w lines creating convex cells, each corresponding to a set of active neurons. Additional layers further split the linear regions, with each cell behaving linearly. Introducing lines iteratively increases the number of regions, with the 4th line intersecting its predecessors to split regions into two.ReLU activation then gives w lines. The ReLU activation in a network with hidden layers splits the input space into regions where neurons are active. Each hidden layer with width w creates convex cells, with the number of regions increasing exponentially with depth. The maximal number of regions in a depth d width w ReLU MLP network is r(w, d) = w^2d."
