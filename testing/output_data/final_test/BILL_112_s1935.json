    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"March of Dimes Commemorative Coin Act of 2011\". The Congress acknowledges President Franklin Roosevelt's creation of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (now March of Dimes) in 1938 to combat polio. The Foundation funded research for polio vaccines by Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin, leading to the end of the polio epidemic in the US. After achieving its original mission, the Foundation shifted focus to preventing birth defects and prematurity. The March of Dimes shifted its focus to preventing birth defects, prematurity, and infant mortality in 1958. They funded research into the causes of over 3,000 birth defects, leading to 13 Nobel Prize-winning scientists since 1954. Virginia Apgar, creator of the Apgar Score, joined the Foundation in 1959 to lead the birth defects division. In the 1960s, they established over 100 birth defects treatment centers and assisted in developing Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) with their support. Since 1998, the March of Dimes has supported legislation like the Birth Defects Prevention Act and the PREEMIE Act. In 2003, they launched a campaign to reduce preterm birth and infant mortality through awareness and research funding. They also advocate for newborn screening and maternal health programs. The March of Dimes supports legislation and campaigns to improve maternal and infant health through various programs such as therapy, maternal nutrition, smoking cessation, and folic acid consumption to prevent neural tube defects. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $1 silver coins to honor the March of Dimes, with specific specifications including weight, diameter, and silver content. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The design of the coins minted under this Act shall represent the mission and programs of the March of Dimes, with inscriptions including the coin's value, year, and words like \"Liberty\" and \"In God We Trust\". Designs should reflect the past, present, and future of the March of Dimes as a champion for babies. The design of coins minted under this Act should reflect the traditions and heritage of the March of Dimes, be selected by the Secretary in consultation with the March of Dimes and the Commission of Fine Arts, and reviewed by the Citizens Coin Advisory Committee. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at designated US Mint facilities. The Secretary of the Treasury can only issue these coins during a 1-year period starting on January 1, 2014. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price including the face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount. All coins minted under this Act will have a $10 surcharge per coin, with the surcharges going to the March of Dimes for health-related purposes. The March of Dimes will be audited for the amounts received, and there is a limitation on the number of commemorative coin programs issued each year. The Secretary may issue guidance for programs exceeding the annual commemorative coin program issuance limitation."
