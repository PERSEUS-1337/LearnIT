The \"Hurricane Education Assistance Act\" aims to provide financial aid to States and local educational agencies enrolling students displaced by Hurricane Katrina or Rita. Grants are authorized for eligible entities to support this purpose, with requirements for enrollment reporting and record-keeping. Eligible entities include State educational agencies of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, as well as local educational agencies in other states. Each grant under the \"Hurricane Education Assistance Act\" is for the 2005-2006 school year. Eligible entities must return any unused funds. Quarterly payments are made based on the number of displaced students enrolled. The \"Hurricane Education Assistance Act\" provides grants for the 2005-2006 school year. Quarterly payments are determined by multiplying the number of displaced students enrolled by 90% of the average per-pupil expenditure in the state (up to $7,500) and 25%. If funds are insufficient, payments will be reduced proportionally. State educational agencies handle within-state allocations. State educational agencies in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas distribute funds to eligible local educational agencies quarterly based on the local share of per-child education cost multiplied by the number of displaced students. Any remaining funds are used to assist local educational agencies in reopening schools closed due to Hurricane Katrina or Rita. Local educational agencies in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas receive funds to reopen schools quickly after Hurricane Katrina or Rita. This includes arranging temporary facilities, purchasing equipment, covering transportation costs, recruiting or retraining staff, and providing assistance to students and families. The funds must be used for educating children enrolled in the schools. The funds provided to local educational agencies in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas after Hurricane Katrina or Rita are used for educating children in schools, including teacher salaries, building maintenance, materials, student transportation, special services, after-school programs, supplemental educational services, and early childhood programs. State educational agencies must ensure accountability for the funds received. Authorization of Appropriations: $1,860,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2006 to ensure proper use and accounting of funds received under this section. SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE FOR THE ENROLLMENT OF EVACUATED STUDENTS IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS. Emergency grants will be provided to State educational agencies to reimburse parents of students displaced by Hurricane Katrina or Rita and attending accredited private schools.

The agencies must provide a detailed description of reimbursement procedures and ensure fiscal accountability for received funds. The amount of each grant will be based on the number of displaced students and available funds, with grants being reduced proportionally if funds are insufficient. Each State educational agency receiving an emergency grant must use the funds to reimburse parents of displaced students for tuition, fees, and transportation expenses at a private school of their choice. They can only use three percent of the grant for administrative expenses and may contract with a public or private nonprofit agency. The State educational agency may contract with a public or private nonprofit agency to administer the program. The maximum reimbursement for a displaced student is 90% of the State's per-pupil expenditure, up to $7,500, for tuition, fees, and transportation expenses at a private school. The State educational agency will only reimburse parents of displaced students enrolled in private schools with a refund policy equal to that of other students. The Secretary will set criteria, such as family income, to determine eligibility for assistance. If a State agency cannot comply, the Secretary may arrange assistance for displaced students in private schools. Section 308 of the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 applies to this section. The authority provided by this section will end on June 30, 2006, with an appropriation of $488,000,000 for fiscal year 2006. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
