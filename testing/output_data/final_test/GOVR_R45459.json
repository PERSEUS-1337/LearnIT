    "content": "The Federal Crop Insurance Program, authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act, is regulated by the USDA's Risk Management Agency and funded by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation. Originating during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl, the program initially focused on major crops like wheat. In 1980, the program expanded to cover more crops and regions, aiming to increase participation. The Federal Crop Insurance Program was enhanced by Congress in 1994 and 2000 to increase participation by raising subsidy levels and expanding geographic availability. Today, farmers can purchase subsidized policies that provide risk management tools for yield and price declines, with insurance companies' losses reinsured by USDA and operating costs subsidized by the federal government. The federal government subsidizes operating costs for crop insurance policies. Producers choose coverage levels and pay a portion of the premium, with the government covering the rest (63% on average in 2017). The program offers Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) and buy-up coverage. CAT coverage insures against losses exceeding 50% of normal yield, with a premium that is 100% subsidized. Buy-up coverage allows for additional protection beyond the catastrophic level. The federal government subsidizes crop insurance policies, offering Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) and buy-up coverage. Buy-up provides additional coverage up to 85% of production per acre and 100% of a specified market price. Premium subsidies range from 38% to 67%, with an administrative fee of $30 per crop per county. The availability of crop insurance is based on farmer demand and risk factors, with the option for farmers to request expansion to their county. Pilot programs are used to test new policies before wider implementation. The Federal Crop Insurance program offers pilot programs for new crops and geographical areas to inform decisions on permanent coverage extension. Efforts to expand coverage to specialty crops began in the 1990s with the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reauthorization Act of 1994. The Federal Crop Insurance program has been expanded to include specialty crop producers through amendments to the Federal Crop Insurance Act, requiring additional data collection and reporting for new crop insurance policies. The Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 further emphasized increasing risk management tools for crops without individual policy coverage. Previous farm bills have also enhanced the federal crop insurance program by expanding its scope and policy coverage. The federal crop insurance program has been expanded to include specialty crops, organic agriculture, and crops sold directly to local markets. The 2008 and 2014 farm bills broadened provisions for policy development and implementation, including new policy development under Section 508(h) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act. The 2014 farm bill also directed the development of the WFRP insurance policy to provide additional options. The WFRP insurance policy was developed to provide coverage for the revenue of the entire farm, including specialty crops, livestock, and aquaculture products. Producers eligible for whole farm policies include direct-to-consumer marketers. WFRP can be combined with other policies but does not offer CAT-level coverage. Coverage for specialty crops remains below that for traditional crops despite the expansion of the federal crop insurance program. Coverage for specialty crops in the crop insurance program lags behind traditional crops due to technical challenges in developing new policies and concerns about market effects. Producers worry that offering insurance could lead to overplanting and lower prices, particularly for vegetable crops. These challenges are discussed in detail in \"Challenges with Developing Specialty Crop Policies.\" Specialty crops include fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, and horticulture and nursery crops. Specialty crops, including fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, and nursery plants, are defined by the USDA and are not eligible for certain USDA farm revenue support programs. The federal government historically supports specialty crops through marketing and research assistance programs. The federal government supports specialty crops through various programs, including federal crop insurance and disaster assistance. Specialty crop insured liabilities have increased from $1 billion in 1989 to $18.5 billion in 2017, representing about 17% of the federal crop insurance portfolio by liability. Total liabilities for all federally insured crops and livestock was $106.7 billion in 2017. Specialty crops accounted for 17% of the federal crop insurance portfolio by liability in 2017. Premium subsidies for specialty crops totaled $701 million in 2017, representing 64% of the total specialty crop premium. Insurance policies covered 52 specialty crops in 1999, with plans to test on nine more, accounting for a majority of the overall value of specialty crops at that time. Coverage expansion for specialty crops continued over the subsequent decade, with insurance available for more than 80 specialty crops in major growing areas by 2011. The number of new crop insurance products introduced for specialty crops increased from 10 in 2000 to 52 in 2012. Specialty crop policies under the federal crop insurance program showed a general upward trend from 2000 to 2017, with a larger increase in total liability for specialty crops during the same period. Specialty crop insurance policies have shown an upward trend from 2000 to 2017, with a larger increase in liability than in the number of policies. This increase can be attributed to factors such as high-value crop policies, commodity price increases, farm consolidation, and inflation. In 2017, federal crop insurance covered 9 million acres of specialty crops, 800,000 bee colonies, 100,000 tons of raisins, and 60,000 fruit and coffee trees. Insurance policies were offered for 38 specialty crop categories in 2015, compared to 50 types in 1999. Some crops covered by federal crop insurance plans include almonds, apples, avocados, bananas, blueberries, and citrus fruits. Specialty crop insurance policies cover a wide range of crops including coffee, cranberries, cucumbers, figs, grapes, mint, onions, papaya, pecans, peppers, pumpkins, strawberries, and walnuts. However, some crops like artichokes, blackberries, and cantaloupes do not have federal crop insurance available. Bee colonies are also included in the coverage. In crop year 2015, nearly 300 million acres were covered by federal crop insurance policies, with about 8.1 million acres (3%) being specialty crops. The average participation rate in federal crop insurance for specialty crops was about 76% of eligible acres. Specialty crops include asparagus, blackberries, boysenberries, broccoli, cantaloupes, carrots, cauliflower, celery, dates, garlic, guavas, hazelnuts, honeydews, kiwi fruit, lettuce, spinach, squash, tart cherries, and watermelons. Other specialty crops not covered by federal crop insurance policies include cashews, chives, eggplants, leeks, melons, leafy greens, herbs, spices, tropical plants, and root crops. In crop year 2015, federal crop insurance covered nearly 300 million acres, with specialty crops accounting for 8.1 million acres. The participation rate for specialty crops was around 76% of eligible acres. Market penetration varies widely by crop, with insured acres ranging from less than 1% to over 80% for different fruit, tree nut, and vegetable categories. Acreage participation is high in major specialty crop states like California, Florida, and Washington, as well as for pulse crops in states like Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. In crop year 2017, specialty crops had the highest liabilities for crop insurance. The average premium subsidy for specialty crop policies and WFRP was 64%, higher than the average for the entire crop insurance portfolio. RMA offers a WFRP policy option for growers insuring 50% to 85% of revenue for all commodities on a farm under one insurance policy. In 2017, 2,700 policies received premium subsidies, up from 1,100 policies in 2015. In 2017, WFRP premium subsidies totaled about $102 million, with producer-paid premiums at $42 million. Total liability was estimated at $2.8 billion, up from $1.1 billion in 2015. The 2014 farm bill required RMA to provide a WFRP policy option with higher subsidy levels. WFRP insures 50% to 85% of revenue for all commodities on a farm under one policy, including specialty or organic commodities. The Whole-Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP) policy is available nationwide for farms with up to $10 million in insured revenue at 85% coverage and up to $17 million at 50% coverage. Premium subsidies range from 55% to 80%, with coverage levels from 50% to 85%. In 2017, WFRP accounted for 3% of all federal crop insurance liabilities and required producers to provide five years of Schedule F from their tax forms for historical revenue determination. The Whole-Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP) policy requires producers to provide tax data for historical revenue determination. Federal crop insurance policies for specialty crops can be yield-based or revenue-based, with two types of yield-based insurance policies: Actual Production History (APH) plans and dollar plans. APH policies account for about 70% of specialty crops policies. The APH policy for citrus fruit and nursery products provides coverage against yield losses due to natural causes like drought, excess precipitation, hail, frost, freeze, fire, and insects. Producers select the insured yield and price percentage, with indemnities paid if the harvested crop is less than the insured yield. When purchasing crop insurance, producers select a percentage of their normal yield and price to be insured. APH policies are based on actual production history and market conditions, while dollar plans guarantee a specific amount of coverage. Losses occur when the crop value is less than the insurance amount stated on the actuarial document. The maximum dollar amount of insurance is stated on the actuarial document. Insured may select a percentage of the maximum dollar amount equal to CAT or higher coverage levels. Dollar plan policies criticized for not insuring actual losses and covering fraudulent claims. USDA audit report outlined fraud concerns. Revenue insurance available for major crops, protects against low yields, prices, and quality losses. Specialty crops face challenges in designing revenue-based insurance products. Specialty crops like navel oranges and cherries face challenges in designing revenue-based insurance products due to the lack of centralized price discovery mechanisms. Actual revenue history (ARH) insurance plans have been piloted for these crops, insuring historical revenues using past prices. This approach assumes historical prices can predict future prices accurately, especially for perishable crops. However, it may be less reliable for storable crops affected by stock carryover. ARH insurance plans insure historical revenues for crops, offering 50%-85% coverage under WFRP policies. RMA also offers index-based policies like API for specialty crops, triggering claim payments based on predetermined indices. The Apiculture Pilot Insurance Program (API) covers honey production. The Federal Crop Insurance Act provides methods for developing new crop insurance programs, including internal and external products. Section 522 of the Act grants RMA authority to develop new crop insurance policies, which was reinstated in 2014 by the farm bill (P.L. 113-79). Before ARPA in 2000, products were typically developed internally. The 2014 farm bill repealed paragraph (e)(4) of Section 522, allowing private entities to participate in research and development of new insurance products. Congress authorized RMA to enter contracts or partnerships for innovative insurance products, with private entities able to submit proposals for approval. The board evaluates proposals based on producer interests, insurance principles, and actuarial appropriateness. Section 508(h) governs new crop insurance policy development. Section 508(h) governs the development of new crop insurance policies, including contracting, funding, policy ratings, and evolution from pilot to full-fledged policies. Private entities can submit crop insurance policies, policy provisions, or premium rates to the FCIC board as 508(h) submissions. Concept proposals can be submitted for approval before fully developing a 508(h) submission, with the board able to approve advance payments for research and development expenses. The FCIC board must approve all new insurance products, which can receive reimbursement for expenses related to research, development, and operating costs. Private submitters can recoup maintenance costs for up to three years after offering the products on the market. They have the option to turn the product over to RMA or retain ownership and update it for a user fee paid by Approved Insurance Providers. The approval process can take up to a year and depends on the quality of the submission package and submitter responsiveness. The FCIC board approves new insurance products, which undergo review by external experts for weaknesses and improvements. Approved products are tested as pilot programs for effectiveness, with the board deciding to convert to regular programs or terminate them. RMA cannot conduct pilot programs if private sector insurance is available without government support. Selected pilot programs are detailed in RMA's 2010 Report to Congress. The RMA's 2010 Report to Congress outlines pilot programs developed through internal procedures and authority, focusing on quarantine and revenue-based policies. Private sector initiatives cover various crops like pumpkins, apiculture, plantains, bananas, sugarcane, and fresh market beans. Challenges persist in introducing new insurance policies for specialty crops due to industry structure complexities, small acreages, multiple crop varieties, farming practice differences, and quality issues. Factors such as market complexity, cost, quality, price discovery, grower interest, and coverage limitations impact the marketability and feasibility of insurance policies for specialty crops. A small market reduces sales incentives and increases costs for product development, staff training, and other activities. Specialty crops targeting niche markets often command premium prices, leading to variable market prices and challenges in price discovery. Fresh specialty crops are primarily sold in higher-value markets, making them highly perishable. Specialty crops, unlike field crops, face challenges in price discovery due to the lack of reliable pricing data. The USDA relies on various sources for price discovery, but thin market conditions make it difficult to observe and forecast market prices. In 2015, the USDA cancelled a crop insurance endorsement due to insufficient market data. Setting price guarantees correctly is crucial for encouraging participation in the federal crop insurance program. Setting price guarantees correctly is crucial for encouraging participation in the federal crop insurance program. If the insurance is priced too high, it may lead to adverse selection, with only high-risk farmers purchasing insurance. On the other hand, pricing insurance too low can result in premiums not covering expected indemnities, inflating federal costs. Specialty crops face challenges due to the diversity of crop varieties and production practices, which can impact market dynamics and financial returns for producers. Specialty crops have diverse farming practices and marketing claims, adding complexity to policy development and insurance underwriting. Understanding how these factors affect yields is crucial for determining insurable practices and setting underwriting standards. Variation across crops and within crop types complicates the loss adjustment process. Some commodities may not have insurance policies due to concerns about adverse effects on producers. Some producers are concerned that offering insurance could impact the market by reducing producer risk and potentially driving down prices and total crop revenue. This is especially a concern for vegetable crop producers, leading to lower levels of insured acreage compared to other crops. Producer interest in new policies typically starts at the local level and requires established cultivars, farming practices, markets, known perils, and high-quality data for viability. From an insurance standpoint, data for crop insurance needs to be timely, relevant, audited to international reinsurance standards, and available over a long time horizon. USDA offers programs to assist farmers financially after natural disasters like droughts and floods, especially for noninsured and specialty crop producers. Additional disaster programs help with tree losses and bee colony losses. USDA also provides low-interest emergency loans and land rehabilitation assistance for farmers post-disaster. Congress may need to address the lack of crop-specific insurance policies for specialty crops like artichokes, asparagus, blackberries, and more. Private submitters proposing new policies must prove marketability to USDA. Consideration could be given to USDA facilitating market research to encourage competition among private submitters. Section 11120 of P.L. 115-334 modifies the definition of reasonable research and development costs for approved policies, limiting the FCIC board's review of user fees. WFRP policies are available nationwide, but there is limited participation. Congress may consider using RMA-developed policies as a benchmark for private sector reimbursement requests. Limited participation in WFRP policies is attributed to producers' reluctance to provide tax return data. WFRP offers premium subsidies ranging from 55% to 80% and coverage levels from 50% to 85%. In 2017, the average premium subsidy for WFRP was 70%, higher than the average for all crop insurance. Congress may consider incentivizing greater participation in WFRP to enhance risk pooling and fraud prevention benefits. The USDA faces challenges in determining market prices for commodities not traded on exchanges, impacting the federal crop insurance program. Price discovery for specialty crops relies on various data sources, hindering the ability to set accurate price guarantees. Improved farm-level price data could benefit producers in negotiating contracts and financial planning. Improved farm-level price data could benefit producers in negotiating contracts and financial planning, especially for specialty crops vulnerable to quality losses. Congress may need to assess the federal government's role in supporting data collection for commodities not traded on exchanges and consider expanding coverage for quality losses in federal crop insurance policies. The Congressional Budget Office finds it challenging to determine if the policy goal of reducing reliance on ad hoc disaster assistance payments in federal crop insurance has been achieved. Ad hoc payments and trade aid packages for specialty crops may impact the demand for federal crop insurance. Congress should consider the effects of repeated ad hoc payments on insurance participation levels. Adverse events may impact demand for federal crop insurance, especially for specialty crops."
