    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Care Infant Mortality Prevention Act of 2013\". Congress finds that child care is essential for the success of working families, with millions of children in child care settings daily. Safety, quality, and cost are top concerns for parents. Post-neonatal infant deaths during sleep due to incorrect practices are a significant issue. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 4,500 infants in the US die suddenly each year, with half of these deaths attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Child care settings are estimated to account for 20% of these deaths. Child Care Aware of America highlighted the importance of research and recommendations in their 2011 report on child care center licensing regulations. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC recommend simple safe sleep strategies to prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. These strategies are not widely required by the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act or state child care regulations. SEC. 3 of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act is amended to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of children in supported programs by implementing state standards. SEC. 4 amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act to include minimum health and safety training for providers, such as CPR, first aid, safe sleep practices, and sudden unexpected infant death prevention strategies. SEC. 5 amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act to include activities promoting child safety and improving the quality of child care, such as training in safe sleep practices, first aid, and CPR. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act is amended to include activities promoting child safety and improving child care quality, such as training in safe sleep practices, first aid, and CPR. Additionally, the Secretary will work with CDC and NIH to update and distribute information on sudden unexpected infant death prevention strategies."
