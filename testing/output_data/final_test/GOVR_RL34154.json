    "content": "The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-246) became law on June 18, 2008, after Congress overrode President Bush's veto of H.R. 6124. The new law suspended the provisions of permanent law that would have taken effect without it. Consequences of not enacting a new farm bill before the end of FY2007 and potential outcomes if a new bill was not passed in early 2008 were discussed. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171) included mandatory and discretionary program authorities. Mandatory programs include commodity support, export, conservation, and food stamps. Discretionary programs require annual funding approval from Congress and cover conservation, farm loans, rural development, research, and food aid. The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) suspended permanent law provisions and prevented program cessation. The farm bill supersedes permanent authorizing law for four to six years, changing program design. It sets policy parameters and funding limits for programs like commodity support and food stamps. Without an extension, programs in the 2002 farm bill would lack statutory authority for funding in subsequent years. In FY2007, Congress faced delays in passing a new farm bill and appropriations act, leading to multiple continuing resolutions (P.L. 110-92, P.L. 110-116, P.L. 110-137, P.L. 110-149) for stopgap funding. Temporary extensions were enacted to maintain authority for expiring farm bill programs until March 15, 2008 (P.L. 110-161, Division A, Sec. 751). The farm bill faced multiple extensions until May 16, 2008, when most of the bill was enacted. However, the trade provisions expired due to an omission in the enrolled version. To rectify this, both chambers repassed the farm bill with the trade title included as H.R. 6124, which was vetoed by the President but overridden by Congress. The 2008 farm bill was vetoed by the President on June 18, 2008, but Congress overrode the veto, making it law as P.L. 110-246. Temporary extensions funded conservation programs and included dairy and sugar programs, as well as price support loan programs for wool and mohair. However, direct, counter-cyclical, and marketing loan programs for other commodities were not extended for the 2008 crop year. The 2008 farm bill, P.L. 110-246, covers various commodities and programs such as peanut storage payments, agricultural management assistance, rural broadband, and renewable energy systems. Commodity support programs for 2007 crops are included in the bill, with past farm bills typically enacted late in the year. The 1990 farm bill was enacted in late November, while the 1995 farm bill was not enacted until April 4, 1996. The 2007 farm bill was expected to be enacted before the end of the year, but lack of new commodity support legislation caused uncertainty for farmers. This uncertainty could have affected farmers' ability to acquire production loans. Congress could have waited until June 2008 for a one or two-year extension for commodity support programs. The 2008 farm bill needed to be enacted before the 2008 harvest to prevent the outdated permanent laws from taking effect. These laws would have provided support for crops in a way that is no longer practical or cost-effective for the government. The 2008 farm bill needed to be enacted before the 2008 harvest to prevent outdated permanent laws from taking effect, which would have provided support for crops in a way that is no longer practical or cost-effective for the government. The only settlement options in permanent law are forfeiture of commodities used as loan collateral or full loan repayment. Nonrecourse loan rates could be as high as 90% of parity for corn, wheat, and rice, and 65% of parity for cotton. Milk support would be between 75% and 90% of parity, while support for soybeans, other oilseeds, and peanuts would not be mandatory. Other commodities not identified in permanent law include sugar beets, sugar cane, wool, mohair, small chickpeas, dry peas, and lentils. Wheat and cotton would have acreage allotments and marketing quotas implemented. The 2008 farm bill needed to be enacted before the harvest to prevent outdated permanent laws from providing support for crops. The Secretary is assumed to announce no marketing quotas, so only wheat acreage allotments are required. Some commodities would lose mandatory support under permanent law, but could still receive support at the Secretary's discretion. The Agriculture Act of 1949 and the CCC Charter Act provide discretionary authority for supporting commodities, but this authority is rarely used due to high market prices in 2008. Milk is currently supported through USDA purchases at prices higher than market prices, which could lead to government outbidding commercial buyers. The USDA purchases commodities at prices higher than market prices, potentially outbidding commercial buyers. The 2002 farm bill's permanent law was delayed by temporary extensions, affecting dairy price support and crop subsidy programs. Loan prices act as government purchase prices, with commercial markets needing to pay more to acquire certain crops. USDA conservation programs were not extended beyond the 2007 crop year. The USDA conservation programs, administered by the NRCS, focus on evaluating and addressing resource problems with technical and financial assistance. The cost of these programs is mainly for personnel, training, cost-sharing, and administrative overhead, averaging $5 billion annually. While most programs were authorized by the 2002 farm bill and would have expired in FY2007, older programs with $1 billion in total spending are permanently authorized. Appropriations committees provide necessary funds for these programs without constraints. The USDA conservation programs, administered by NRCS, receive funding based on budget requests from the executive agency. The programs, authorized by the Food Security Act of 1985 and subsequent amendments, account for almost $4 billion in USDA conservation spending. These programs are largely in the hands of appropriators for future funding, with the largest program, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency. The authorizing legislation for these programs has been extended and amended by periodic farm bills. The 2002 farm bill extended many USDA conservation programs, with most expiring in 2007. Temporary extensions allowed existing contracts to continue, with specific funding levels for programs like the Farmland Protection Program, Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, and Ground and Surface Water Conservation Program. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and Conservation Security Program (CSP) were also extended to FY2010 and FY2011, respectively. At the end of FY2007, authorities in domestic food assistance laws expired, but were extended through appropriations actions and temporary farm bill extensions. Without new legislation, some provisions would have terminated, including nutrition assistance grants to Puerto Rico and American Samoa totaling $1.6 billion for FY2008. Several authorities in domestic food assistance laws, including provisions for reducing states' federal matching payments for food stamp administrative costs by $200 million annually, would have terminated without a temporary extension. Other affected authorities include food stamp pilot projects for elderly or disabled recipients, grants for simplified application and community food projects, minimum administrative cost payments for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and provisions for cheese and nonfat dry milk distribution. The 2008 farm bill faced expiration, leading to a temporary lapse in trade programs like export credit guarantees and market promotion. International food aid programs were also at risk without a new bill in place. The expiration of authorities in P.L. 480, the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act, including minimum commodity assistance volumes, financing sales, and carrying out agricultural technical assistance, poses risks to food aid programs. The authority to replenish stocks of the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust also expired without extension. Rural development programs are funded annually through permanent law. Several mandatory rural development programs were newly authorized or extended by the 2002 farm bill, but expired on September 30, 2007. These programs include the Enhanced Rural Access to Broadband Technology Program, Value-Added Product Development Grants Program, and Renewable and Alternative Energy Systems Grant Program.
