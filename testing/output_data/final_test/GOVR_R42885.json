    "content": "The U.S. food supply is considered one of the safest in the world, but critics believe the system lacks the resources to combat foodborne illness effectively. The CDC reports that 48 million Americans get sick from contaminated food annually, with 128,000 cases requiring hospitalization and 3,000 resulting in death. The economic costs of foodborne illness are estimated at $36 billion per year. The USDA report estimates that 15 pathogens, including Salmonella, Toxoplasma, Listeria, Campylobacter, and norovirus, contribute to over $15 billion in annual costs from foodborne illnesses in the United States. Another study suggests a total economic burden of $77.7 billion from foodborne illness each year. Since 2007, food safety in the United States has been a major concern, with public and media scrutiny leading to increased congressional interest. Both the Obama and Bush Administrations took steps to address food safety issues, with President Bush releasing the Food Protection Plan of 2007 and President Obama establishing a Food Safety Working Group in 2009. The Food Safety Working Group (FSWG) was established to upgrade U.S. food safety laws and ensure enforcement. In 2010, progress was made in reducing food risks and implementing new safety standards. The HHS set reduction goals for food contaminants by 2020. FDA has been working on over 50 regulations under FSMA, but some provisions have been delayed. Some major provisions under FSMA have been substantially delayed, raising uncertainty about meeting expected deadlines due to funding availability. State health officials report data on foodborne outbreaks to CDC annually, with meat, dairy, fish/seafood, and egg products being the most common culprits. Raw foods of animal origin are often associated with foodborne illnesses. The CDC reports that raw foods of animal origin, such as meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood, can cause infections if undercooked or through cross-contamination. Other risky foods include unpasteurized milk, shellfish, and fresh produce. Multi-state foodborne outbreaks have increased in recent years, raising concerns about the safety of both domestically produced and imported foods. Examples include Salmonella outbreaks linked to peanut butter and cantaloupe, and E. coli infections from raw clover sprouts. The CDC reports on various foodborne outbreaks, including Salmonella outbreaks linked to peanut butter and cantaloupe, E. coli infections from raw clover sprouts, and recalls of contaminated sprouts, eggs, and spinach. Other outbreaks have been linked to Mexican produce and institutional peanut butter. Large recalls of meat and poultry products have also occurred due to contamination with E. coli, Listeria, and Salmonella. The CDC tracks national foodborne outbreaks, including recalls of meat and poultry products due to E. coli and Listeria. The Foodborne Outbreak Online Database provides access to outbreak data, estimating that nearly 48 million people get sick from contaminated food annually. This includes known foodborne pathogens and unspecified agents where data is insufficient for specific burden estimation. The CDC tracks national foodborne outbreaks, including recalls of meat and poultry products due to E. coli and Listeria. Nearly 48 million people get sick from contaminated food annually, with known pathogens accounting for one-fifth of total foodborne illnesses. Norovirus, Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter spp., and Staphylococcus aureus are the top pathogens causing foodborne illnesses. Salmonella, norovirus, Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and E. coli are the top pathogens leading to hospitalizations. In 2012, there were 831 foodborne disease outbreaks resulting in 14,972 illnesses, 794 hospitalizations, and 23 deaths. Norovirus and Salmonella were the most common pathogens, with beef, poultry, and finfish being the commodities associated with the largest number of outbreaks. Fish, vegetable row crops, and dairy were the most commonly implicated food categories in outbreaks. Some foodborne illnesses show improvement for certain pathogens, while infections caused by others have not declined. The CDC reports varying trends in foodborne illnesses, with some pathogens showing improvement while others have not declined or have increased. Federal, state, and local agencies share responsibilities for regulating food safety in the U.S., with GAO identifying 15 federal agencies administering at least 30 laws related to food safety. State and local authorities collaborate with federal agencies for inspection and regulation of retail food establishments. Trends in U.S. food markets, such as increasing imports and consumption of fresh foods, present challenges for food safety. The FDA and USDA have primary responsibility for ensuring food safety, with FDA overseeing most food products and USDA regulating meat, poultry, and some egg and fish products. The division of food safety responsibility between the two agencies dates back to early U.S. food regulation history. The Federal Food Safety System is primarily overseen by FSIS and FDA, with FSIS receiving a larger share of the food safety budget despite being responsible for 10-20% of the U.S. food supply. FSIS has a budget of about $1.0 billion in appropriated funds plus $160 million in industry-paid user fees annually, while FDA's budget has increased significantly in recent years. FSIS has around 9,400 full-time equivalents (FTEs) compared to FDA's 3,800 FTEs working on food-related activities. FSMA expanded FDA's authority to ensure food safety by implementing mandatory recalls, enhancing surveillance systems, establishing preventive controls, improving traceability, increasing inspection frequencies, and overseeing foreign food imports. It does not cover meat and poultry products regulated by the USDA. FSMA provides FDA with preventive controls, inspection and compliance measures, and response capabilities to ensure food safety. It includes mandatory preventive controls for food facilities, produce safety standards, and the authority to prevent intentional contamination. FDA can conduct oversight, establish inspection frequencies, access industry records, and mandate testing by accredited labs. The agency also has mandatory recall authority for all food products. FSMA grants FDA authority to ensure food safety through preventive controls, inspection, and response measures. This includes mandatory recall authority, administrative detention, facility registration suspension, enhanced product tracing, and increased recordkeeping for high-risk foods. It also addresses imported food safety by requiring importers to verify foreign suppliers' preventive controls, establishing third-party verification, and mandating certification for high-risk foods entering the US. FSMA grants FDA authority to ensure food safety through preventive controls, inspection, and response measures. This includes mandatory recall authority, administrative detention, facility registration suspension, enhanced product tracing, and increased recordkeeping for high-risk foods. It also addresses imported food safety by requiring importers to verify foreign suppliers' preventive controls, establishing third-party verification, and mandating certification for high-risk foods entering the US. Additionally, FSMA establishes a voluntary qualified importer program for expedited review and entry from participating importers, and gives FDA the right to refuse entry of food from a foreign facility if access is denied. FDA is also authorized to improve training of state, local, territorial, and tribal food safety officials and rely on inspections of other agencies to meet increased inspection mandates for domestic facilities. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) authorized additional appropriations and staff for future food safety activities, with an estimated increase in federal spending of $1.4 billion over five years. The 114th Congress will likely continue to oversee and scrutinize food safety changes under FSMA, as well as consider changes to other food safety laws and policies. This includes initiatives for meat, poultry, and seafood products, and legislation on the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics in animal feeds. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) addresses issues such as non-therapeutic use of antibiotics in animal feeds, banning certain plastic components in food containers, food labeling, and biotechnology. It expands FDA's food safety authorities, requiring preventive controls and safety plans at food processing facilities and farms. Congress oversees FSMA implementation, including risk-based inspections for high-risk facilities and foods. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) includes provisions for targeting food safety inspection resources, identifying high-risk facilities and foods, and exempting certain businesses from regulation to support small, organic, direct-to-market, and sustainable farming operations. Public health groups are monitoring the implementation of these exemptions, especially for growers and processors of perceived \"high-risk\" foods. Under FSMA, FDA is responsible for more than 50 regulations, guidelines, and studies, including rules for preventive controls in food facilities, food safety standards for produce growers, and requirements for food importers. Some agribusiness groups oppose exemptions for high-risk foods, concerned about consumer confidence and potential exemptions for small foreign producers. FDA oversight can be withdrawn in case of a foodborne illness. The implementation of regulations under FSMA, signed into law in January 2011, has been delayed due to various factors. Delays in publishing proposed rules were caused by reviews by the Office of Management and Budget, as well as extensions granted by the FDA for public comments on the complex regulations. The implementation of FSMA regulations has been delayed due to various factors, including requests from stakeholders for a comprehensive regulatory package, coordination with other federal agencies, re-proposing key provisions, resource constraints, and delays in the rulemaking process leading to legal action by the Center for Food Safety against FDA and OMB. The FDA faced legal action for delays in implementing FSMA regulations, with a court order setting deadlines for rules on preventative controls, imported food, produce safety, transportation practices, and intentional adulteration. The FDA has faced legal action for delays in implementing FSMA regulations, with deadlines set for various rules. Implementation of FSMA regulations has been pushed back beyond the original dates mandated by Congress. FDA has not yet issued final rules and guidance for many regulations required under FSMA. Food safety issues and FDA's implementation of FSMA remain ongoing concerns for House and Senate appropriators due to budget constraints. The annual Agriculture appropriations process faces challenges due to budget constraints, raising questions for Congress on how to fund policies for food safety. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) expands FDA's authority for increased food facility inspections, surveillance of foodborne illnesses, mandatory recalls, and enforcement of new requirements. FSMA aims to increase FDA staff to 5,000 by 2014, with estimated costs of $1.4 billion over five years. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) authorized appropriations but did not provide actual funding for FDA activities, leading to uncertainty in funding for federal activities. Funding decisions are made by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, with ongoing efforts to implement FSMA likely relying on state regulators for enforcement. The Administration's budget requests have projected a need for additional funds for FDA, anticipating a total need of about $1.1 billion. The FDA is in need of additional funds, with a total anticipated need of about $1.1 billion. This includes $0.9 billion in appropriations for the food program and over $0.2 billion in requested new user fees. The Administration's budget request includes various proposed fees to fund the FDA's food program, such as food import and inspection fees, to implement the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). Congressional appropriators have not approved the proposed new user fees, including a food establishment registration and inspection fee. The Obama Administration has proposed new user fees to support FDA's food safety mission, but the food industry opposes the establishment fee. FDA officials claim they need an additional $400-450 million per year to fully implement FSMA. Congressional appropriations proposals do not align with the Administration's request, raising questions about FDA's ability to implement food safety measures. The appropriations proposals for FDA's food safety reforms under FSMA have raised concerns about funding for preventive efforts. FDA must develop mandatory food safety requirements affecting farmers, packers, and processors of domestically produced and imported products, with a focus on produce growers. Congressional appropriators have noted budgetary concerns and made recommendations for FDA's implementation of FSMA. The FDA's proposed produce rule under FSMA focuses on mandatory food safety requirements for produce growers, covering activities like growing, harvesting, packing, and holding fruits and vegetables for human consumption. Certain foods are exempt from the rule, including those rarely consumed raw, going to commercial processing, or produced for personal consumption. Commercially processed produce like bagged salads and leafy greens would be covered by FDA's preventive controls rule. The FDA's proposed rule under FSMA focuses on mandatory food safety requirements for produce growers, covering activities like growing, harvesting, packing, and holding fruits and vegetables for human consumption. The rule addresses microbial contamination of produce and identifies five routes of potential contamination, including agricultural water, biological soil amendments, farm personnel hygiene, animal intrusions, and equipment sanitation. The FDA's proposed rule under FSMA focuses on mandatory food safety requirements for produce growers, covering activities like growing, harvesting, packing, and holding fruits and vegetables for human consumption. The rule addresses microbial contamination of produce and identifies five routes of potential contamination, including agricultural water, biological soil amendments, farm personnel hygiene, animal intrusions, and equipment sanitation. The proposed rule includes requirements for growing sprouts, training for farm personnel, and record-keeping to ensure standards are met. FDA estimates the annual costs of the rule to be around $460 million for domestic farms and $170 million for foreign farms. The FDA's proposed rule under FSMA exempts domestic farms from certain requirements, with flexibility in compliance timelines based on farm size. Alternative approaches and variances are allowed, with extended public comment periods and outreach efforts by the FDA. In March 2013, FDA corrected technical errors to the proposed rule and in August 2013, announced preparation of an environmental impact statement. In December 2013, FDA announced re-proposing key provisions of the produce rule and regulations regarding preventive controls affecting food facilities. Changes include water quality standards, raw manure and compost use standards, provisions for mixed-use facilities, and procedures for withdrawing exemptions for certain farms. FDA published the re-proposal in September 2014 and entered a cooperative agreement with NASDA. The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) has an agreement to assist in implementing FSMA's national produce safety rule with state regulatory agencies by the October 31, 2015 deadline. FSMA focuses on FDA-regulated foods, not USDA-regulated foods like meat and poultry. Congress may consider amending laws for USDA products after updating FDA's food safety laws. Bills have been introduced in Congress regarding the safety of USDA-regulated meat and poultry products. In the 111th and 112th Congress, bills were introduced and debated regarding the safety of meat and poultry products, some of which were reintroduced in the 113th Congress. USDA finalized a rule to modernize the poultry inspection system under the New Poultry Inspection System (NPIS). NPIS is voluntary, with plant personnel responsible for carcass sorting and federal inspectors focusing on pathogen reduction. Poultry plants must expand pathogen control and testing, and line speeds may increase. The final rule on poultry inspection left line speeds unchanged, potentially influencing some plants to stick with current systems. Debate in the 113th Congress includes opposition to USDA's changes for compromising food safety and support for modernization efforts. Food and Water Watch filed a lawsuit to halt USDA's implementation of NPIS, along with other concerns such as meat and poultry safety in school feeding programs, food recall protocols, traceability, budget constraints, humane slaughter, and state implementation issues. In May 2013, USDA's Office of the Inspector General criticized enforcement policies, including those under the HACCP-based Inspection Models Project (HIMP), the basis for NPIS. In August 2013, GAO recommended USDA to collect and analyze information on the young hog pilot project and disclose limitations in poultry slaughter inspections. In November 2014, FSIS found that HIMP plants are performing as well as non-HIMP establishments. Public health experts are concerned about antibiotic resistance and difficult infections. Antibiotic resistance is a concern due to overuse in medical and non-therapeutic purposes in food animals. Some advocate limiting non-medical antibiotic use in animals to prevent resistance, while others argue against it for commercial viability reasons. Bills have been introduced to restrict non-medical antibiotic use in animal feeds. In efforts to address antibiotic resistance, bills like the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act have been introduced to limit non-medical antibiotic use in animal feeds. The FDA has issued guidance for industry to promote judicious antibiotic use and increase veterinary oversight, favoring a voluntary approach over regulatory action. The FDA's voluntary approach to antibiotic use in food-producing animals has received support from the livestock and poultry industry. However, some stakeholders are skeptical. The Administration has created an Interagency Task Force for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, but concerns have been raised about FDA's authority to address antibiotic use. FSMA did not specifically address seafood and fisheries products, which were already regulated under a system known as HACCP. FSMA provisions for seafood safety include interagency agreements, guidance for post-harvest processing of raw oysters, inspections of foreign processing facilities, and ongoing debates in Congress on issues like federal coordination, seafood fraud prevention, third-party certification for imported seafood safety, and traceability systems. Food fraud, also known as economically motivated adulteration, involves defrauding buyers of food and ingredients for economic gain. Commonly affected foods include olive oil, fish, honey, dairy products, meat, grains, fruit juices, wine, organic foods, spices, coffee, and tea. While most cases do not pose a health risk, some have resulted in actual harm. efforts to address seafood fraud include using third parties to certify safety and developing traceability systems. Some food fraud incidents have posed public health risks, such as the addition of melamine to products. In 2007, adulterated pet food from China caused deaths in the US, and melamine-contaminated baby formula sickened Chinese children. Fish and seafood fraud involve mislabeling or substitution with inferior species, potentially leading to food poisoning. Some food fraud incidents pose public health risks, like the addition of melamine to products. Substitution of olive oil with other oils could have unintended consequences for those with food allergies. Fraud cases, like the Peanut Corporation of America's in 2009, involved intentional adulteration, leading to deaths and illnesses. FSMA does not directly address food fraud but some provisions may apply to intentional adulteration. FSMA Section 106 requires FDA to issue regulations to protect against intentional adulteration of food, with proposed regulations published in December 2013. The court-ordered deadline for final regulations is May 31, 2016. Other ongoing efforts are intended to address fish and seafood. The deadline for FSMA Section 106 regulations is May 31, 2016. Ongoing efforts are in place to combat fish and seafood fraud, including a task force initiated by the Obama Administration. Congress has introduced bills to address food fraud concerns, but no comprehensive legislation has been passed yet. Legislation has not comprehensively addressed food fraud, but existing laws provide authority for federal agencies to address fraud through various food safety, defense, and quality authorities. FDA and USDA are key agencies working to protect the food supply, along with border protection and enforcement activities by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Other agencies also play a role in addressing food fraud. Some food safety reforms enacted under FSMA included provisions for coordination with other federal agencies and implications for certain farm bill programs administered by USDA. FSMA required FDA to coordinate with USDA's NIFA for advising producers and small processors on food safety requirements. The 2014 farm bill contained provisions addressing food safety, including requirements for FDA. The 2014 farm bill included provisions for food safety, such as requiring FDA to publish scientific and economic analyses for new produce standards. It also mandated reports to congressional committees and established a training network for food safety within USDA. The 2014 farm bill established a Safety Training Network for food safety protection training, authorized $20 million annually for appropriations, directed a study on \"food safety insurance\" by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, and required USDA to finalize regulations for food safety. The 2014 farm bill required USDA to finalize regulations for food safety inspections of catfish within 60 days. FDA examines about 2% of food import lines annually, issuing import alerts on various imported foods. Concerns about food safety of imports have grown due to globalization and consumer demand for a wider variety of foods year-round. FSMA included provisions on food imports to enhance safety measures. FSMA included provisions on food imports, setting tighter controls, minimum entry requirements, certification of imported foods, and importer accountability. New programs and requirements were created, such as expedited entry and capacity building in foreign countries. FDA issued proposed regulations for FSMA's import provisions, including the Foreign Supplier Verification Program and certification systems involving third parties. The requirements will increase responsibility on U.S. trading partners and could impact global food safety efforts once implemented. The FDA issued final regulations in May 2013 regarding prior notice of imported food shipments and entered discussions with foreign countries to facilitate inspection of foreign facilities. Some FSMA provisions have been addressed, including developing a strategy for addressing smuggled foods and reporting on FDA foreign offices. However, other provisions like the \"Voluntary Qualified Importer Program\" and certification requirements for food imports have not been fully addressed yet. The court-ordered deadline for final regulations regarding imported food and foreign suppliers is pending. The court-ordered deadline for final regulations on imported food and foreign suppliers is October 31, 2015. FSMA regulations require food importers to address safety requirements for food facilities and produce growers. Changes to China's food safety laws in 2013 show ongoing efforts to enhance enforcement. The 114th Congress may monitor these changes due to U.S. concerns about imported foods from China. FSMA provisions apply to most foods, including dietary supplements, granting FDA authority to enforce FFDCA provisions. Prior to FSMA, FDA could only issue voluntary recalls or request the responsible party to cease distribution of the violative product. FSMA granted FDA the authority to issue mandatory recalls for adulterated or misbranded food/dietary supplements. FDA must notify DEA if a new dietary ingredient contains an anabolic steroid. DEA can take action on the ingredient as a controlled substance. FSMA's mandatory recall authority also covers dietary supplements. FDA is required to publish guidelines for manufacturers to provide necessary information when notifying the agency. The FDA published guidelines in July 2011 for manufacturers to provide information on new dietary ingredients in supplements, which has sparked controversy. Senators Hatch and Harkin requested the FDA to withdraw the guidance, but the request was denied. Concerns have also been raised about energy drinks, with Senators Durbin and Blumenthal asking the FDA to review health concerns and reports of deaths linked to these products. In December 2014, Senators Markey, Durbin, and Blumenthal released a report with recommendations on addressing adverse events associated with dietary supplements. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a report in January 2014 with recommendations on disclosing information about adverse events related to energy drinks, improving transparency in the marketplace, and protecting children from harmful advertising practices. The report does not reflect the consensus of the IOM and is not a comprehensive review. FSMA did not significantly change FDA laws on criminal penalties, but these provisions were considered during the food safety debate. The House-passed food safety bill (H.R. 2749, 111th Congress) aimed to amend penalties for certain prohibited acts related to misbranded or adulterated food. Similar provisions were proposed but not included in the Senate's version of the bill. Concerns about stricter criminal fines and penalties in the U.S. food safety system led to reintroduced legislation in the 112th Congress, which passed in the Senate (S. 216). Senator Leahy also proposed an amendment during the farm bill debate to increase criminal penalties. In the 112th Congress, Senator Leahy proposed an amendment to increase criminal penalties for violating food safety laws, but it was not included in the Senate-passed farm bill (S. 3240). The controversy over the safety of bisphenol A (BPA) in food containers continues, with the FDA authorized to regulate BPA in food packaging. Studies suggest BPA exposure may have developmental effects, but there is no definitive scientific consensus on the risk to humans, especially children, from BPA leaching into food. The FDA concluded that BPA is safe at current levels in food packaging, but certain uses of BPA in baby bottles and infant formula packaging were abandoned. FDA denied a petition to ban all uses of BPA in food. The FDA denied a petition in 2012 to ban all uses of BPA in food containers and packaging, citing insufficient data. Congress has introduced various proposals to reduce BPA use, but no changes were made to FDA regulations. Several states and countries have taken measures to restrict BPA use. EPA regulates pesticide. The EPA regulates pesticide use on food to ensure it does not pose unreasonable risks to human health or the environment. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 established maximum allowable levels of pesticide residues in food to prevent harm from aggregate exposure. EPA was directed to reassess all existing tolerances by 2006 to meet this standard. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 established maximum allowable levels of pesticide residues in food to prevent harm from aggregate exposure. EPA was directed to reassess all existing tolerances by 2006 to ensure they met this standard. FQPA also directed EPA to approve pesticides for use in food production only if tolerances were set beforehand by the agency. EPA continues to review tolerance decisions based on residue data collected. EPA is authorized to regulate pesticides to prevent adverse effects on the environment and human dietary risk from pesticide residue levels exceeding tolerances. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 established maximum allowable levels of pesticide residues in food to prevent harm from aggregate exposure. EPA reassesses existing tolerances periodically. Congress enacted the Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2012 to enhance EPA's pesticide registration activities through FY2017. Legislation has been introduced to improve scrutiny of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, often found in pesticides. Agricultural biotechnology's classification as a food safety issue is debated. Genetically engineered (GE) crop varieties, also known as genetically modified (GM), were first commercially available in the mid-1990s. Recent years have seen the introduction and proposed deregulation of new GE crops, leading to legal challenges. Concerns include herbicide-resistant weeds, cross-contamination with traditional crops, and the pending approval of genetically engineered salmon for human consumption by the FDA. Genetically engineered salmon, the first GE animal for human consumption, has sparked debates on product labeling. Proposed legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to require labeling of GE fish and establish a federal standard for foods with genetically modified ingredients. Congress may reintroduce these bills in the 114th Congress, alongside attempts to alter U.S. policies on bioengineered crops in the periodic farm bill. Efforts to alter U.S. policies on bioengineered crops in the periodic farm bill debate included proposed provisions to amend the Plant Protection Act. These provisions were not part of the enacted 2014 farm bill. Some in Congress may advocate for additional reforms to the nation's food safety system, including establishing a single federal food safety agency. Efforts to establish a single federal food safety agency have been ongoing since the 103rd Congress. The debate stems from the separation of FDA from USDA in 1940, highlighted by a 1969 White House Conference report. While some support consolidation for improved efficiency, others fear it may compromise daily food safety efforts. FSMA did not change this ongoing debate. Efforts to establish a single federal food safety agency have been ongoing since the 103rd Congress, with the debate stemming from the separation of FDA from USDA in 1940. The Safe Food Act of 2015 (H.R. 609/DeLauro; S. 287/Durbin) aims to create a single independent Food Safety Administration (FSA) by consolidating food safety authorities from FDA and USDA. FSA would regulate food safety, labeling, inspection, enforcement, and research for both domestically produced and imported foods. The Safe Food Act of 2015 aims to establish a single independent Food Safety Administration (FSA) by consolidating food safety authorities from FDA and USDA. The new FSA would provide a more integrated approach, eliminate duplication, and result in cost savings. The Obama Administration also proposed a single food agency in the FY2016 budget request, emphasizing centralized leadership and clear lines of responsibility for food safety standards. Consumer advocate groups support the Durbin/DeLauro legislation to create a new food safety agency within HHS, while some public health groups oppose it, citing concerns about HHS's expertise and resources compared to USDA. CFA is against the proposal due to worries about lower standards for meat and poultry inspection. The livestock industry opposes the Administration's proposal for a new food safety agency within HHS, citing concerns about potential weakening of FSIS standards. The National Cattleman's Beef Association and National Milk Producers Federation have expressed opposition to a single food safety agency."
