    "content": "Title I - Utrok Atoll Radiological Monitoring Support. Section 101 provides support for radiological monitoring at Utrok Atoll. The Secretary of Commerce may convey a decommissioned NOAA ship to Utrok Atoll local government for radiological monitoring and resettlement without cost. The US government will not be responsible for maintenance post-delivery. Utrok Atoll government must submit a plan for vessel use within 120 days. The House and Senate Committees overseeing resources, science, energy, and transportation are involved in the decision-making process. Title II involves the ratification of certain NOAA appointments, promotions, and actions. SEC. 201 of the Act ratifies and approves actions taken by de facto officers of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration without proper appointment or promotion, allowing the President to temporarily appoint or promote such officers for a period of up to 180 days. TITLE III--INTERNATIONAL FISHERIES REAUTHORIZATION\n\nThis title is known as the \"International Fisheries Reauthorization Act of 2004.\" It extends the reimbursement period under the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 to 2008 and reauthorizes the Yukon River Salmon Act of 2000 until 2008. Additionally, it repeals Section 105 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, related to rebuilding fish stocks. Foreign fishing under the Treaty between the US and Canada on Pacific Coast Albacore Tuna Vessels is allowed, with regulations enforced by the Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of State. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act will be enforced for foreign fishing vessels under the Treaty between the US and Canada on Pacific Coast Albacore Tuna Vessels, with regulations enforced as if they were provisions of that Act. SEC. 402 of the South Pacific Tuna Treaty Act is amended to allow fishing by vessels using the longline method in the high seas areas of the Treaty area."
