    "content": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used for learning generative models, but their learning dynamics are not well understood. This study aims to analyze the dynamics of GANs by proposing a model that exhibits common convergence issues for rigorous analysis. This study analyzes the dynamics of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by showing that using only a first-order approximation of the discriminator can lead to unstable GAN dynamics and mode collapse. The convergence result is the first rigorous analysis of a parametric GAN's dynamics, highlighting the challenges in GAN training. Generative modeling is crucial for complex tasks like image translation, speech synthesis, and robot trajectory prediction. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) address the challenge of training generative models by learning both the model and loss function simultaneously. GANs involve a game between a generator and discriminator to improve sample quality. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) involve a game between a generator and discriminator. The generator aims to produce realistic samples to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator is trained to distinguish between true data and generated samples. GANs have shown promise in various tasks, but training them reliably is challenging due to issues like vanishing gradients and mode collapse. The theoretical understanding of GAN dynamics is still limited, with no convergence proofs even in simple settings. This paper aims to address the frequent failures in GAN dynamics by taking a first step towards understanding the root causes. In this paper, the authors investigate the dynamics of GANs by introducing the GMM-GAN, a variant that learns a mixture of two univariate Gaussians. They find that standard gradient dynamics often fail to converge due to mode collapse or oscillatory behavior, even with techniques like unrolled GANs. However, GAN dynamics with an optimal discriminator do converge, as shown experimentally and theoretically. This analysis provides the first global convergence proof for the GMM-GAN. Theoretical analysis of GMM-GAN shows convergence with optimal discriminator, while simultaneous gradient GAN often fails to converge due to discriminator collapse. This challenges the belief that first order methods are always sufficient for deep learning applications. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) involve a two-player game between a generator and discriminator. The discriminator aims to differentiate between generator samples and the true distribution, while the generator tries to deceive the discriminator by producing similar samples. Different loss functions can be used, such as KL divergence and Wasserstein distance. The training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) faces challenges such as mode collapse and vanishing gradients. Mode collapse occurs when the generator only learns a subset of the true distribution, leading to limited output variety. Vanishing gradients result in small generator updates, hindering convergence to a satisfactory solution. Despite various proposed solutions, the vanishing gradient problem persists in GAN training. Despite efforts to address the vanishing gradient problem in GAN training, it still persists in practice. The gap between theory and practice of GANs remains significant, with existing theoretical studies focusing on global optima and stationary points rather than the actual dynamics of GANs during optimization. The current understanding of GAN dynamics for parametric models is limited, and it is unclear if first-order optimization methods lead to meaningful solutions. This highlights the need for further theoretical advancements in the field of GANs. In the context of GAN training, the focus has been on global optima and stationary points rather than the actual dynamics. Understanding the convergence behavior of GANs is challenging due to non-convexity and the use of first-order optimization methods. This paper aims to address these limitations and initiate a new approach. This paper aims to study GAN dynamics from an algorithmic perspective, specifically focusing on the impact of using first order approximation on convergence. It compares two GAN dynamics: a \"first order\" dynamics where both generator and discriminator use first order updates, and an \"optimal discriminator\" dynamics where only the generator uses first order updates. The latter has proven challenging to understand, with debates on whether using optimal discriminator updates is the right approach. Our study focuses on GAN dynamics, using a simple model to analyze real-world challenges. We aim to understand the convergence of GAN dynamics, starting with univariate Gaussian generators. This approach may not capture all phenomena like mode collapse, but it provides a foundation for further exploration. The study focuses on GAN dynamics using a simple model with univariate Gaussian generators. The model assumes true distribution and generator distributions are mixtures of two univariate Gaussians with unit variance and uniform mixing weights. This change affects the dynamics behavior, leading to pathologies in GAN training.GANs can be seen as a method for density estimation, not just a generative framework. Generative adversarial dynamics aim to learn an unknown generator G \u00b5 * \u2208 G for density estimation. The goal is to recover G \u00b5 * (x) in total variation distance, which can be challenging for arbitrary distributions but simpler for structurally simple ones like mixtures of Gaussians. In the context of generative adversarial dynamics aiming to learn an unknown generator G \u00b5 * \u2208 G for density estimation, the text discusses simplifying the set of discriminators by focusing on unions of two disjoint intervals in R. This approach is motivated by connections to VC theory and aims to find the best fit in total variation distance. The discriminators are defined as indicator functions of sets that can be expressed as a union of at most two disjoint intervals. The text discusses optimizing the total variation distance to find the best fit for an unknown generator G \u00b5 * \u2208 G by focusing on unions of two disjoint intervals in R. The optimal discriminator dynamics involve iteratively updating \u00b5 to minimize a smooth function of parameters through gradient descent. The text discusses first order dynamics for optimizing the total variation distance in a setting involving generators and discriminators. These dynamics involve simultaneous gradient iterations on the generator and discriminator, leading to various behaviors depending on the initialization. The text discusses the complexities of GAN dynamics, highlighting issues such as generator collapse and convergence problems due to vanishing gradients. It emphasizes the empirical justification for the model and the challenges in modeling real-world GAN behaviors. Different parametrizations of the total variation distance can result in varied dynamics, but the focus remains on the difficulties in convergence even with random initial conditions. The paper discusses induced dynamics in GANs, showing that optimal discriminator dynamics remain unchanged. The discriminator converges, then varies wildly due to non-differentiability at optimality. The main theoretical result is Theorem 4.1, which highlights the behavior of dynamics induced by the optimal discriminator. The main theoretical result, Theorem 4.1, states that optimal discriminator dynamics converge to the ground truth under certain conditions. Simulation results show that first order updates and other heuristics fail to consistently converge to the true distribution. Theorem 4.1 shows that optimal discriminator dynamics converge to the ground truth. However, first order updates often fail to converge, with a low probability of convergence even with random initializations. Discriminator collapse is a common barrier to convergence. The proof relies on quantifying progress towards the optimal solution in a non-convex, non-smooth objective function. The lemma presented is a key tool for understanding gradient descent on Lipschitz functions, even when non-convex and non-smooth. It states that as long as the change in derivative is smaller than the derivative value, progress is made. This condition is weaker than typical assumptions for gradient descent analysis. The main work involves a set of lemmas that establish bounds for the dynamics of the system, excluding cases like mode collapse. A strong lower bound on the gradient is shown when away from optimality, along with a weak bound on function smoothness. These lemmas support the conditions for gradient descent analysis on Lipschitz functions. The main work involves establishing bounds for system dynamics, excluding cases like mode collapse. A lower bound on the gradient value is shown, along with conditions for gradient descent analysis on Lipschitz functions. The gradient is never 0, implying no local optima. Lemmas bound function smoothness and ensure progress, but caution is needed for well-separated and bounded parameters to avoid mode collapse or divergence. The text discusses setting parameters appropriately to prove a theorem, conducting heatmap experiments to show first order dynamics often fail to converge, and running dynamics for 3000 iterations with a constant stepsize. The study conducted first order dynamics experiments for 3000 iterations with a stepsize of 0.3, repeating 120 times for each grid point. Results showed that all methods failed when initializing generator means to be the same, leading to mode collapse. The study found that first order dynamics and unrolled dynamics often fail to emulate optimal discriminator dynamics in GAN training. Mode collapse occurs when the generator starts with collapsed modes, making it impossible to fit the true distribution well. Despite some success with unrolled dynamics, first order methods struggle to converge to the ground truth. This highlights the challenges in GAN training and the importance of optimal discriminator dynamics. Our paper focuses on the dynamics of GAN training, proving global convergence and showing that an optimal discriminator leads to approximate equilibrium. The unrolled GAN method aims to improve convergence by incorporating multiple discriminator gradient steps in the generator loss function, but it still struggles to converge in some initial configurations. The authors of BID1 provide a theoretical view on GAN dynamics, highlighting the importance of absolute continuity and support overlap between distributions. They prove that GAN dynamics may fail to converge in certain settings if these conditions are not met. In contrast, our model demonstrates that even when these conditions are satisfied, first-order dynamics can still fail to converge. Additionally, the paper BID15 focuses on the stability of equilibria in GAN training, with a focus on local stability. The recent work BID10 examines GAN training from the perspective of online learning, providing results based on game-theoretic minimax formulation. Their algorithm differs from traditional GAN training by not relying on gradient descent and requiring an oracle for minimizing the non-convex generator loss. Our approach complements the perspective of online learning in GAN training, focusing on minimizing the non-convex generator loss. We establish results for learning the unknown distribution and analyze gradient descent for GAN training. Our work is the first to prove global convergence guarantees for a parametric GAN, showing that optimal discriminator steps lead to convergence while first-order steps often fail. This provides new insights into GAN training dynamics and suggests further exploration of algorithmic approaches. Our simple GAN dynamics capture undesired behaviors seen in more sophisticated GANs, including discriminator collapse. This occurs when the discriminator interval shrinks to 0 width due to the generator PDF dominating. This phenomenon is illustrated in FIG2. The true PDF minus the generators' PDF is compared in each plot, with the discriminator's shaded regions. The discriminator collapses to zero width in negative regions, not converging to the optimal discriminator. This collapse occurs even with many iterations of dynamics. The collapse of the discriminator in GANs occurs when it reaches zero width intervals, leading to a lack of convergence to the ground truth. This situation arises due to the local optimization landscape hindering the discriminator's ability to update effectively, resulting in a partial capture of the optimal discriminator's structure. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for further research in GAN dynamics. Theorem B.1 from Hummel and Gidas states that an analytic function with at most n zeros has at most n zeros when convolved with a Gaussian. Theorem B.2 shows that a linear combination of k Gaussians with the same variance has at most k-1 zeros if at least two Gaussians have different means. If all Gaussians have distinct means and non-zero coefficients, the function F(x) = D\u00b5(x) - D\u03bd(x) has at most 3 zeros. For sufficiently large minimum distance between Gaussian means, the contribution of other Gaussians to F can be made small. If Gaussians have different signs, the PDF of the first Gaussian is strictly decreasing on the interval between their means. The sum of two Gaussians is strictly decreasing on the interval between their means. There is exactly one zero in the interval [\u00b5, \u03bd], and no zeros of F outside the convex hull of their means. This holds true for Gaussians with different signs as well. In this section, the focus is on deriving the form of L, a smooth function of all parameters, induced by dynamics arising naturally from the total variation distance. Different definitions of total variation distance could lead to qualitatively different behavior of the first order dynamics. The text discusses an alternative dynamics induced by a different definition of total variation distance, leading to a loss function with absolute values. The optimal discriminator dynamics are shown to be identical to those analyzed in the paper, proving convergence. The optimal discriminator dynamics are well-defined even when not unique, as shown in the paper. The update to \u00b5 induced by certain intervals remains the same, proving convergence. The update to \u00b5 induced by certain intervals remains the same, proving convergence. The optimal discriminator dynamics are well-formed and unchanged from the ones described in the paper. Experimental results show higher success rates but still lack convergence. The text discusses the occurrence of discriminator collapse in first order dynamics, even with absolute values. Despite the change in the loss function's behavior, discriminator collapse still occurs in certain scenarios. The text discusses discriminator collapse in first order dynamics, even with absolute values. If the loss is negative on a discriminator interval, the discriminator is incentivized to reduce it to zero to increase the overall loss. Conversely, if the loss is positive on an interval, reducing it to zero also increases the loss. This leads to discriminator collapse and training failure to converge. The appendix provides a proof for Theorem 4.1, with Lemmas 4.3, 4.5, 4.6 derived from case analyses on discriminator intervals and mean estimates. The text discusses the evolution of the optimal discriminator and its impact on derivatives and update functions. By studying the behavior of the generator means in relation to the true means, the text shows that the zero crossings of F(\u00b5, x) can be approximated by a low degree polynomial with large coefficients. This control over the local behavior of zeros allows for the deduction of desired claims. Further details are deferred to Appendix D.

The gradient of the function f \u00b5 * ( \u00b5) is given by DISPLAYFORM0 and the intervals achieving the supremum in (4) are DISPLAYFORM1. The value is well-defined when the optimal discriminator intervals are unique as sets. Fact D.1 states that the Gaussian and its derivatives are Lipschitz functions. The text discusses the behavior of derivatives of Gaussian functions and their TV distance. It also proves that the function f \u00b5 * is Lipschitz and differentiable except on a set of measure zero. The proof of Theorem 4.1 is based on various lemmata described in the body. The proof of Theorem 4.1 shows that by making appropriate choices of constants, the total variation distance can be decreased additively by a certain amount in each step. The proof involves ensuring mode collapse does not occur, which is crucial for understanding the convergence of Generative Adversarial Models and Networks. Lemma 4.3 is proven, along with the fact that there is some x > \u00b5 2 so that F \u00b5 * ( \u00b5, x). Lemma 4.3 is proven by analyzing different cases of the arrangement of \u00b5 and \u00b5*. In Case 1, the optimal discriminators are to the left of \u00b52. In Case 2, the situation is symmetric. In Case 3, the optimal discriminator has one interval. The proof ensures mode collapse does not occur in Generative Adversarial Models and Networks. Lemma 4.4 is proven by obtaining lower bounds on derivatives of finite sums of functions. The proof involves analyzing different cases of the arrangement of \u00b5 and \u00b5*. In Case 4, the optimal discriminator intervals are determined by a symmetric argument to Case 3. This ensures that mode collapse does not occur in Generative Adversarial Models and Networks. Lemma D.7 provides lower bounds on derivatives of finite sums of Gaussians with the same variance. It involves analyzing the derivatives of F \u00b5*(\u00b5, x) and showing a lower bound on the smallest singular value of a matrix M. The text discusses leveraging orthonormal polynomials and Langrange interpolating polynomials to show a lower bound on the smallest singular value of a matrix M. This is done by defining a matrix V with specific properties and applying theorems related to Gaussian measures. The analysis involves considering the coefficients and degrees of Lagrange interpolating polynomials through given real numbers.

This is achieved by defining a matrix V with specific properties and applying theorems related to Gaussian measures. The analysis involves considering coefficients and degrees of Lagrange interpolating polynomials through given real numbers. The square of any polynomial has a degree at most 2(2k \u2212 1) and a maximum coefficient at most 2k. By Theorem D.8, it is shown that a certain condition implies the desired statement. Additionally, a lemma is slightly generalized to replace one condition with another, leading to further implications. The text discusses lower bounds on the smallest singular value of a matrix using orthonormal and Lagrange interpolating polynomials. It shows that functions with large derivatives on intervals must have mass on those intervals. The proof involves truncating intervals and using Taylor's theorem. The text discusses lower bounds on the smallest singular value of a matrix using orthonormal and Lagrange interpolating polynomials. It shows that functions with large derivatives on intervals must have mass on those intervals. The proof involves truncating intervals and using Taylor's theorem. By Taylor's theorem, a polynomial of degree t+1 with coefficients of magnitude at least B/t! is constructed. This leads to a nonnegative function G(y) on an interval, which allows for the derivation of bounds on the function. The lemma provides a lower bound on the mass F can put on moderately large intervals. It states that for any interval I of sufficient length where F is nonnegative, there exists a lower bound on the magnitude of derivatives of F with respect to x. The lemma establishes a lower bound on the mass F can place on moderately large intervals by bounding the derivatives of F with respect to x. The proof involves defining sets Z+ and Z- based on the signs of F (\u00b5, x) and F (\u00b5, x), showing that they are unions of a constant number of open intervals.

Sets Z+ and Z- are defined based on the signs of F (\u00b5, x) and F (\u00b5, x), showing they are unions of a constant number of open intervals. The sets Y, X, X, W, W are defined based on the nonnegative values of F (\u00b5, x) and F (\u00b5, x), with the optimal discriminators for \u00b5, \u00b5 being unions of closed intervals.

The number of closed intervals and specifically X, X each contain at most two intervals. Lemma 4.5 forbids mode collapse by considering different cases related to the values of \u00b5.

Sets Z+ and Z- are defined based on the signs of F (\u00b5, x) and F (\u00b5, x), showing they are unions of a constant number of open intervals. The discriminator intervals must be of the form (\u2212\u221e, r], [ , \u221e) for some r \u2264 \u00b5 1 \u2264 \u00b5 2 \u2264 . In Case 3, if \u00b5 * 1 \u2264 \u00b5 1 \u2264 \u00b5 * 2 \u2264 \u00b5 2, the discriminator must be an infinitely long interval (\u2212\u221e, m] for some m \u2264 \u00b5 1. The function F is strictly positive on the interval [\u00b5 * 1, \u03b1 \u2212 10\u03b4] and strictly decreasing in the interval [\u03b1 \u2212 10\u03b4, \u03b1 + 10\u03b4], where it has exactly one zero."
