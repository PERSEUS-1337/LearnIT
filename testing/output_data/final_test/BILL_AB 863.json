    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 27375 of the Vehicle Code is amended to require modified limousines to have at least two rear side doors and one or two rear windows that passengers can open from the inside in case of emergency. The limousine must also have at least two rear push-out windows accessible to all passengers. The Department of the California Highway Patrol will establish regulations for limousines to have operable window exits, including push-out windows on the roof if side installation is not possible. Modified limousines before July 1, 2015, must comply by January 1, 2017, with at least two accessible rear side doors for passengers. For modified limousines after July 1, 2015, one side door must be near the driver and another near the back. Rear side doors must meet federal safety standards. In emergencies, the driver must unlock doors for passengers to exit. Limousine owners must comply with regulations. An owner or operator of a limousine must instruct passengers on safety features, disclose if the vehicle meets safety requirements, and inform passengers if the vehicle does not meet certain safety standards for emergency escape options. The Vehicle Code exempts pre-1970 limousines with active TCP numbers from certain regulations, unless they were modified after August 15, 2013. The California Highway Patrol will conduct safety inspections of modified limousine terminals by July 1, 2017. The inspection program for modified limousines includes safe operation, safety equipment installation, maintenance logs, accident reports, driver discipline records, compliance with safety standards, preventative maintenance program examination, and transfer of safety and maintenance information. The department conducts inspections of carrier terminals at least once every 13 months. The department will adopt emergency regulations under this subdivision to prevent harm to public welfare. These regulations will be in effect for up to one year until final regulations are adopted. The department will establish an inspection fee for modified limousines operated by charter-party carriers or passenger stage corporations every 13 months. The fee will cover the costs of the inspection program and will not be used for other purposes. It will be in addition to any other required fees and will apply to modified limousines undergoing safety inspections. The department will consult with interested parties when developing the fee structure. The Public Utilities Commission will collect a fee for inspections of modified limousine terminals, with the funds deposited into the Motor Vehicle Account. Inspection data will be shared with the Commission, and regulations will align with the department's bus inspection program."
