    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Green River National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2002\". Congress finds that the Green River bottoms area in Kentucky was once a large bottomland hardwood forest, but has been mostly converted to agricultural use through draining of wetlands, altering of drainage systems, and clearing of forests. Currently, the area consists mainly of ridge and swale farmland with some remaining bottomland hardwood forest. Approximately 1,200 acres of bottomland hardwood forest remain, with various tree species present. Many interior drainage systems on the land are still intact. The Green River bottoms area in Kentucky offers opportunities to restore historical hydrology and wildlife habitats. Waterfowl, neotropical migratory birds, migratory shorebirds, wading birds, and raptors frequent the area. Several endangered or threatened species, including Indiana bat maternity colonies and various mussels, have been found in the bottoms area. The copperbelly water snake is also present in the wetland complex. Significant populations of resident game species like white-tailed deer, swamp rabbit, and coyote inhabit the bottoms area. The Ohio River and Green River support big river species such as paddlefish and catfish. Conservation efforts in the bottoms area align with habitat conservation goals of various wildlife management plans. The Green River bottoms area, with its diverse wildlife, is highly valued for recreational activities like hunting, fishing, and birdwatching. It is considered worthy of being included in the National Wildlife Refuge System. The Act establishes the Green River National Wildlife Refuge in Henderson County, Kentucky to provide habitat for waterfowl, land birds, fish, and wildlife diversity. It also aims to offer hunting, fishing, and wildlife-oriented recreation opportunities. The Secretary establishes the Green River National Wildlife Refuge, encompassing 23,000 acres of Federal land and water. Boundary revisions may be made as needed, and the map of the Refuge is available for inspection. The Green River National Wildlife Refuge will be established when sufficient property is acquired by the United States for efficient management as a national wildlife refuge. The Secretary may acquire up to 23,000 acres of land and water within the Refuge boundaries through purchase, donation, or exchange. Any acquired land or water will become part of the Refuge. The Secretary is responsible for conserving and enhancing the native aquatic and terrestrial communities of the Green River, restoring habitat for endangered species, and prioritizing hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, and environmental education on the Refuge. The Secretary is responsible for conserving and enhancing the native aquatic and terrestrial communities of the Green River, restoring habitat for endangered species, and prioritizing hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, and environmental education on the Refuge. Additionally, the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 encourages the use of volunteers and partnerships to promote public awareness and participation in conservation efforts. Authorization of appropriations for the acquisition, development, operation, and maintenance of land and water within the boundaries of the Refuge is granted."
