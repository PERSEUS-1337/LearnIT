    "content": "In 2008, North American natural gas markets experienced volatility, contrasting with the stability of 2007. Prices initially rose in early 2008 before decreasing later in the year. This report analyzes current trends in U.S. natural gas markets, including prices, consumption, production, imports, and infrastructure. Natural gas remains a significant energy source in the U.S., supplying 24% of total energy in 2008. Recent domestic supply increases and developments in Alaska may lead to a pipeline from the North Slope. The natural gas industry is attracting capital for new pipeline and storage infrastructure. LNG imports decreased in 2008, leading to low utilization factors at import facilities. FERC approved two major import terminals. Congressional attention may focus on new supply sources, price volatility, and access to public lands for exploration. Key factors affecting market outcomes include weather, the economy, and oil prices. During 2008, key developments in the natural gas market included increased domestic production to 20.5 trillion cubic feet, despite production disruptions from hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Prices saw an unusual pattern with citygate prices lower than Henry Hub spot prices. The spot price at Henry Hub peaked at $13.32 per million Btu in July 2008, dropping to under $6 by year-end. Wellhead prices rose over 30% during the 2007-2008 heating season. During 2008, natural gas prices saw fluctuations with wellhead prices increasing over 30% during the heating season. The power generation sector used the most natural gas, and storage levels dropped below five-year averages. LNG imports decreased by 54% from the previous year, and FERC approved 2 import facilities with increased capacity. Natural gas infrastructure development continued to progress. Natural gas infrastructure development advanced in 2007 and continued in 2008. Industrial gas use grew, and North America has an integrated market through a pipeline network. Prices are influenced by demand, supply, and capacity. The U.S. natural gas market is the major component of the North American market, accounting for about 81% of it. The Henry Hub in Louisiana is a key pricing and delivery point for the North American natural gas market, accounting for 81% of consumption and 70% of supply. Basis differentials fluctuate based on capacity availability, with tight capacity leading to higher differentials driven by the value of gas at the delivery point. The North American natural gas market prices incorporate costs for distributing gas from the wholesale marketplace to retail customers, determined by state regulators. The market is connected to a global gas marketplace through international LNG trade. Oil prices still impact U.S. natural gas prices. Key elements include prices, consumption, and supply, with price stability in 2006 and 2007 ending in 2008. In early 2008, natural gas prices increased significantly, with spot prices at Henry Hub peaking at $13.31 per MMBtu before dropping to $5.83 per MMBtu by the end of the year. The average wellhead price during the 2007-2008 heating season rose over 30% to $8.06 per MMBtu, with the highest monthly value reaching $10.52 per MMBtu in June. The average U.S. citygate price also increased to $9.15 per mcf in 2008, while LNG import prices decreased slightly from $7.19 per mcf to $7.07. In 2008, LNG import prices decreased to $7.07 per mcf. U.S. residential natural gas prices averaged $13.52 per MMBtu, with a high of $19.74 in July. Commercial prices were $11.76 per MMBtu, industrial prices were $9.61 per MMBtu, and electric power prices had increased by 25% by September 2008. The spot price of natural gas is a key indicator of market prices in the Gulf of Mexico region. The Henry Hub spot price exceeded the EIA citygate price in only eleven months from 1993 to 2008. In the first half of 2008, the spot price at Henry Hub increased quickly and exceeded the EIA estimated average citygate price. One possible explanation for this anomaly is the inclusion of multi-month contracted-for supplies in the citygate price. Total U.S. natural gas consumption increased by almost 1% from 2007 to 2008, with the power sector leading in end-use consumption. Domestic natural gas supplies saw a significant increase of over 7% between 2007 and 2008, with explanations including greater production from shale areas and storage gas withdrawals. In 2008, U.S. natural gas production exceeded 20.5 trillion cubic feet, the highest since 1974. Domestic supplies increased by over 7%, with most supply coming from domestic production. The natural gas rig count increased significantly from 2002 to 2008, reaching 1,606 in September 2008 before declining. Net imports decreased by over 20% in 2008, with a 54% decrease in LNG imports. In 2008, LNG imports to the United States decreased by 54% from the previous year. Despite new U.S. LNG infrastructure coming online, available supplies were sometimes sent to European terminals for higher prices. The U.S. may become a receiver-of-last-resort for LNG shipments due to interruptions in Russian supplies and lack of storage in Europe and Asia. EIA forecasts a slight increase in LNG supply for 2009 to 369 Bcf, with new export facilities in the Atlantic Basin nearing completion. A Canadian LNG import facility focused on exporting to the US is under construction and may start operations in 2009. Natural gas market trends include strong lower-48 production, reduced seasonal demand swings, increased gas-for-power use, evolving international LNG trade, and ongoing infrastructure development. Unconventional gas production led to a 7.7% increase in lower-48 production in 2008, despite losses from hurricanes. The U.S. natural gas reserve base has been increasing, with a shift in production from shallow Gulf of Mexico to deep Gulf of Mexico and unconventional sources. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike caused a loss of almost 350 billion cubic feet in OCS production. The Potential Gas Committee is expected to release an update on the nation's natural gas supplies in 2009, with experts from industry, academia, and government involved in the assessment. The Potential Gas Committee, established in 1964, consists of experts from industry, academia, and government, primarily geologists or engineers. Natural gas consumption in the United States is highly seasonal, with peaks in winter for residential and commercial use and in summer for electric power generation. The overall seasonal swing has decreased, leading to a secondary peak in summer due to gas-for-power use. Calls for more storage continue due to growing demand. The decrease in seasonal swing for natural gas consumption in the U.S. may reduce the need for additional storage despite calls for more due to higher consumption levels. The secondary peak in gas for power was lower in 2008 compared to previous years, attributed to a decrease in cooling degree days. In 2007, electric power became the largest end use sector for natural gas, with deliveries increasing by 615 Bcf. In 2008, gas-for-power use declined but remained the largest gas user. Industrial gas use increased by 2% in 2007 compared to 2006. Industrial gas consumption increased by 2% in 2007 compared to 2006. In 2008, LNG monthly imports varied from 35.4 Bcf in August to 22.8 Bcf in November. U.S. importers compete on the global LNG spot market for deliveries. European natural gas prices were in the $7.80-$9.50 per MMBtu range in December 2008. Existing LNG import facilities have excess physical capacity to handle about ten times the imports of 2008. The North American natural gas industry has added new infrastructure to the system in 2007 and 2008. In 2007 and 2008, new facilities were added to serve market needs, with forecasts indicating a 1% decrease in natural gas use for 2009 due to weak economic conditions. U.S. production is expected to increase by less than 1%, while LNG imports are forecasted to rise by 20% in 2009. Low summer demand in Europe may result in the U.S. receiving more LNG than anticipated. The United States is expected to receive more LNG than previously forecasted. The EIA predicts a 35% decrease in average Henry Hub prices in 2009 to $5.62 per MMBtu due to weak economic conditions, increased U.S. production, and lower demand. Weather plays a significant role in natural gas consumption, with EIA incorporating NOAA weather forecasts in their predictions. Heating and cooling loads impact natural gas demand, with actual degree days affecting prices during those periods. The correlation between natural gas prices and oil prices has changed over the years. Historically, the price of natural gas in the northeast market area would trigger a switch to alternative fuels when it reached a certain point, limiting the price. This would impact the demand for natural gas during specific periods, such as the cooling season. The correlation between natural gas prices and oil prices has changed over the years, impacting the demand for natural gas during specific periods. Natural gas prices have generally been lower than alternative fuels since 2007, with exceptions during extreme cold periods. Environmental restrictions may have limited fuel-switchable load, leading to price delinkage. Economic growth affects consumers' demand for natural gas, with EIA incorporating a less optimistic economic outlook in recent forecasts. This change is likely to affect industrial and power generation sectors more than residential and commercial consumption. The economic outlook is expected to impact industrial and power generation natural gas use directly. North American natural gas markets have functioned well compared to other energy markets, with consumers and producers managing price fluctuations in 2008. New pipelines and storage facilities have been built based on price differentials. Current investment in LNG import capacity may be excessive for the upcoming heating season. Retail customers may face higher prices due to risk management contracts signed during the 2008 price surge. Weather and the overall economy continue to be important factors for natural gas demand and price levels. The overall economy and weather are crucial factors affecting natural gas demand and prices, which remain uncertain and beyond human forecasting capability."
