    "content": "Homebuyers who missed the June 30, 2010 deadline for the first-time homebuyer tax credit have been given a three-month extension to complete their purchases. President Obama signed H.R. 5623 on July 2, 2010, extending the deadline. This law only applies to those who had a binding contract before May 1, 2010, to purchase a residence and were unable to close before July 1, 2010. The new law extends the deadline for first-time homebuyers who had contracts before May 1, 2010, to close their purchases by October 1, 2010. This modifies a provision of The Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009. The original credit was created in 2008 in response to the housing crisis. The first-time homebuyer tax credit, initially available for purchases between April 8, 2008, and July 1, 2009, was modified by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The changes included increasing the credit amount, extending eligible purchase dates to November 30, 2009, and eliminating the repayment provision for purchases after 2008. The Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 further expanded the definition of \"first-time homebuyer.\" The first-time homebuyer tax credit was modified to include an exception for \"long-time residents\" who have owned and used the same residence as their principal residence for five consecutive years. The credit is capped at $6,500 for these residents. The income limitation for qualifying purchases was raised, but new restrictions were imposed, such as disqualifying properties costing over $800,000. Eligible purchasers must be at least 18 years old and not claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's return. Taxpayers must attach a copy of their settlement statement to their tax returns for calendar year 2009 and later. Certain members of the military, foreign service, and intelligence communities received special consideration under P.L. 111-92 for the first-time homebuyer tax credit. Repayment requirement was eliminated for those who sold or ceased using their property due to official government orders. Those who served on qualified official extended duty outside the US may qualify for the credit if they purchase a residence before May 1, 2011. The recent three-month extension for closing does not apply if closing occurs after June 30, 2011. The \"First-time Homebuyer Credit\" is available for those who purchase property as their principal residence and meet the definition of a first-time homebuyer. Some who did not previously qualify may now be eligible for a lower credit amount. Purchasers must be at least 18 years old, not claimed as dependents, and the residence must not exceed $800,000 if purchased after November 6, 2009. The law's definition of a first-time homebuyer is not strictly limited to those who have never owned a principal residence before. A first-time homebuyer is defined as an individual who has had no present interest in property used as their principal residence in the three-year period before the purchase. If married, neither spouse can have had such an interest in that period. Unmarried co-owners are not affected by another co-owner's ownership history. Ownership of property not used as a principal residence within three years does not disqualify an individual for the tax credit. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers introduced an exception for \"long-time residents\" who have owned and used the same property as their principal residence for five consecutive years. These individuals will be treated as first-time homebuyers and eligible for the tax credit if they purchase a new property after November 6, 2009. Married taxpayers must both meet the ownership requirement. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers includes an exception for \"long-time residents\" who have owned and used the same property as their principal residence for five consecutive years. The marital status of the purchasers on the date of purchase determines whether they must each qualify for the credit claimed. Unmarried individuals on the date of purchase could each qualify using different prior residences. If one unmarried long-time resident purchases a new residence with another unmarried person who had not owned a home within the last three years, each person could qualify for the homebuyer credit. The credit could be divided between them as long as the long-time resident claimed no more than $6,500. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers includes an exception for \"long-time residents\" who have owned and used the same property as their principal residence for five consecutive years. The credit amount varies based on the individual's ownership history, with a maximum credit of $8,000 for those who have not owned a home in the last three years. The term \"principal residence\" is defined in reference to Internal Revenue Code section 121, which considers factors like property usage and residency. Treasury regulations further clarify that property must be used as a residence to qualify as a principal residence. The determination of a principal residence for tax purposes depends on various factors such as where the taxpayer works, family lives, banks, attends religious services, and more. A taxpayer can have multiple residences but only one principal residence, which is determined by facts and circumstances. Personal property that is not a fixture under local law is not considered a residence. When a taxpayer relocates due to employment, the new location may or may not be considered their principal residence. Factors such as family living arrangements and property ownership play a role in determining the principal residence for tax purposes. The first-time homebuyer's credit is not available if the rental property is still the taxpayer's principal residence. The law defines a purchase as any acquisition, excluding certain acquisitions like those from related parties. This exclusion applies even if fair market value is paid. For purchases before November 7, 2009, related parties include lineal ancestors, lineal descendants, and spouses of the taxpayer. The first-time homebuyer's credit is available for purchases of principal residences made after April 8, 2008, and before May 1, 2010. The definition of \"related party\" includes lineal ancestors or descendents of the taxpayer's spouse for purchases after November 6, 2009. The residence must be occupied by the taxpayer as the principal residence before May 1, 2010, to qualify for the credit. The first-time homebuyer's credit is available for purchases of principal residences made after April 8, 2008, and before May 1, 2010. Exceptions include those with binding purchase contracts before May 1, 2010, closing before July 1, 2010, and military personnel on extended duty outside the US. The first-time homebuyer's credit is available for purchases of principal residences made after April 8, 2008, and before May 1, 2010. An additional exception for \"long-time residents\" allows them to qualify for a $6,500 credit if they purchase the property after November 6, 2009. The credit is calculated as 10% of the residence's purchase price, limited to $7,500 for qualifying 2008 purchases and $8,000 for most purchases after December 31, 2008. The first-time homebuyer's credit is available for purchases of principal residences made after April 8, 2008, and before May 1, 2010. For long-time residents who qualify, the credit is limited to $6,500. The credit cannot exceed $7,500 for residences purchased in 2008. Married couples filing separately are limited to $3,750 each. Unmarried individuals purchasing property together can claim up to $7,500 total, allocated as the Secretary prescribes. In February 2009, the first-time homebuyer's credit was raised to $8,000 for purchases made after December 31, 2008. Long-time residents are limited to $6,500. Married couples filing separately can allocate half of the maximum credit amount. Unmarried individuals can allocate the entire amount using any reasonable method. The credit may be reduced for taxpayers with a high income. The MAGI thresholds for the first-time homebuyer's credit were raised to $225,000 for joint filers and $125,000 for all others after November 7, 2009. The credit amount is reduced based on a ratio of the taxpayer's MAGI to the threshold amount. If the MAGI exceeds the threshold by $20,000 or more, the credit is reduced to zero. In 2009, the first-time homebuyer's credit was limited to $8,000 if 10% of the purchase price exceeded that amount. For a couple with a MAGI of $154,000, the credit would be $6,400. If the property was purchased after November 15, 2009, with an income threshold of $225,000, the full $8,000 credit could be claimed. For a single taxpayer buying a $220,000 condominium on July 15, 2009, the credit would be eliminated if their MAGI was $95,000. If a property was purchased after November 15, 2009, with an income threshold of $225,000, the full $8,000 credit could be claimed. Taxpayers may choose to claim the credit on the tax return for the tax year prior to the tax year in which they actually make the purchase. Taxpayers who had already filed their prior year's tax return could file an amended return to claim the credit for their 2009 purchase on their 2008 tax return. This would allow them to claim up to $8,000 as their credit, even though the limit for 2008 purchases is $7,500. Long-term residents could also claim their credit (up to $6,500) on the tax return for the year prior to the year of their purchase. Claiming the credit on the prior year's tax return could result in a refund sooner and reduce or eliminate any balance due. The credit for a purchase after December 31, 2008 generally does not have to be repaid. Taxpayers can adjust their federal tax payments to receive the credit for their purchase before filing their return. They can do this by filing a new Form W-4 with their employer or adjusting quarterly estimated tax payments. It is advised to adjust payments equally to avoid penalties for underpayment. In mid-2009, the FHA introduced a program allowing homebuyers to \"sell\" their tax credits to use the money towards down payment and closing costs. State housing finance agencies offer short-term loans that can be repaid with the credit. Some loans have low interest or require monthly payments, while others are \"silent\" and only need a lump sum payment when the credit is received. Meeting the first-time homebuyer definition and purchasing property may not always qualify for the credit. The time frame required by the statute may affect eligibility for the credit based on the purchase date of the principal residence. Taxpayers who do not qualify for the credit include non-resident aliens, those with homes outside the US, those who inherited their residence, and those who bought from a related party. Purchases in 2008 may disqualify if financed with certain bonds or if they or their spouses claimed the credit in DC. However, those buying after 2008 can still qualify for the credit. Taxpayers purchasing their property after 2008 may still qualify for the credit even if their new residence was financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds. However, purchases after 2008 will not be eligible for the D.C. credit if they are eligible for the \u00a7 36 credit. Limitations were imposed regarding purchases after November 6, 2009, including disqualification for individuals who can be claimed as dependents on another taxpayer's return, those under 18 years old unless married, and those whose principal residence cost more than $800,000. Effective for tax returns after November 6, 2009, taxpayers must include a settlement statement with their return to claim the first-time homebuyer tax credit. The credit, established in 2008, requires repayment over 15 years, known as \"recapture.\" For purchases in 2008, the entire credit amount must be repaid. The first-time homebuyer credit established in 2008 requires repayment over 15 years, with the entire amount needing to be repaid if the taxpayer continues to live in the property for 30 years. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 modified the recapture requirement for credits based on property purchased in 2009, eliminating the need for recapture unless the property is no longer used as the taxpayer's principal residence within 36 months. Certain members of the military, foreign service, or intelligence community are exempt from repayment if they cease to use their property due to government orders for qualified official extended duty. The first-time homebuyer credit from 2008 requires repayment over 15 years, with recapture starting two years after purchase. Taxpayers must file a tax return each year for repayment, even if not required otherwise. Recapture may be accelerated if the property is sold or no longer used as the principal residence. The first-time homebuyer credit from 2008 requires repayment over 15 years, with recapture starting two years after purchase. Repayment may be waived in certain situations such as sale with no gain, taxpayer's death, or relocation due to government orders. Gain on property sale is calculated by subtracting adjusted basis and sales expenses. Taxpayers who claimed the first-time homebuyer tax credit may need to recapture the outstanding credit when selling the property. The outstanding credit is subtracted from the adjusted basis of the property to determine if it must be repaid. Keeping records of property improvements can increase the adjusted basis and potentially eliminate the need to repay the credit upon sale. Taxpayers who claimed the first-time homebuyer tax credit may need to recapture the outstanding credit when selling the property. The outstanding credit is subtracted from the adjusted basis of the property to determine if it must be repaid. In a scenario where a taxpayer buys a house for $250,000 and reports $7,500 as the first-time homebuyer credit on Form 1040, if they sell the property two years later for $265,000 with expenses of sale at $15,000, they would need to recapture the entire $7,500 credit on the tax return for that year. When selling a property after claiming the first-time homebuyer tax credit, the outstanding credit may need to be recaptured. In a scenario where a house is sold for $260,000 four years after purchase, $1,500 of the outstanding credit must be recaptured on the tax return, while the remaining $5,000 will not be recaptured. When selling a property after claiming the first-time homebuyer tax credit, the outstanding credit may need to be recaptured. In a scenario where a house is sold for $260,000 four years after purchase, $1,500 of the outstanding credit must be recaptured on the tax return, while the remaining $5,000 will never be recaptured. Repayment of the outstanding credit is waived if the taxpayer dies. The recapture of the first-time homebuyer tax credit is handled differently depending on the circumstances. For married couples who claimed the credit on a joint return, each spouse is responsible for half of the repayment amount. If one spouse dies, only that spouse's portion of the repayment is canceled. Unmarried individuals who purchased property together and allocated the credit between them have separate repayment obligations. Similarly, married couples filing separate returns have individual repayment obligations based on the credit claimed. If the taxpayer dies, repayment of the outstanding credit is waived. Government orders for qualified official extended duty service for the taxpayer or spouse leading to relocation may allow the property purchased for the homebuyer tax credit to be sold or converted. An exception from accelerated recapture and repayment provisions applies to members of the uniformed services, Foreign Service, intelligence community, and their spouses. Recapture of the credit is not accelerated if certain circumstances exist. An involuntary conversion of property, such as through eminent domain or threat of condemnation, can lead to recapture of the credit if the property is no longer used as a principal residence. However, recapture will not be accelerated if a new principal residence is acquired within two years. The recapture provisions of the first-time homebuyer tax credit allow for the substitution of a new principal residence if the qualifying residence was involuntarily converted. Transfers of property between spouses or former spouses incident to divorce do not accelerate recapture of the credit. The party who transferred the property is relieved of repayment obligations, and the party who received the property assumes responsibility. The first-time homebuyer tax credit allows for the substitution of a new principal residence in case of involuntary conversion. Transfers of property between spouses or former spouses in divorce do not accelerate credit recapture. Repayment obligations are assumed by the party receiving the property. Unmarried co-owners cannot transfer repayment obligations to another owner. Repayment is not accelerated for certain government personnel if the property is no longer used as a principal residence due to qualified official extended duty service. The first-time homebuyer tax credit allows for the substitution of a new principal residence in case of involuntary conversion. Repayment obligations are assumed by the party receiving the property. Unmarried co-owners cannot transfer repayment obligations to another owner. Certain government personnel are exempt from accelerated credit recapture if the property is no longer used as a principal residence due to qualified official extended duty service. Taxpayers who qualify for the first-time homebuyer credit based on a 2008 purchase are exempt from accelerated recapture and further repayment if they receive qualified official extended duty service orders. This exception applies even if the property is sold or converted to a different use. Similar to the first-time homebuyer credit, the IRC also includes special provisions for death, involuntary conversions, divorce, and job transfers or health changes. Section 121 of the IRC allows taxpayers to exclude gain from the sale of a principal residence if certain conditions are met, including ownership for at least two years and use as a principal residence for at least two years. Taxpayers who do not meet the time requirements may still exclude some or all of the gain in cases of job transfers or health changes. Taxpayers can exclude gain from the sale of a principal residence under Section 121 of the IRC if ownership and use requirements are met. In cases of job transfers or health changes, proration of the exclusion limit allows for the entire gain to be excluded. No relief is provided for taxpayers who purchased a principal residence qualifying for the first-time homebuyer tax credit and experience job transfers or health changes. Taxpayers who purchased a principal residence after 2008 must use it as their principal residence for at least 36 months to avoid repaying the credit. If the property is no longer used as the principal residence, the entire credit must be repaid. Exceptions to this repayment requirement are discussed in detail for 2008 purchases, including scenarios like a sale with no taxable gain, the taxpayer's death, or involuntary conversion. Taxpayers who receive the first-time homebuyer tax credit are not required to reduce the basis of their residence by the amount of the credit. This differs from most tax credits, which generally have required taxpayers to reduce the basis of assets on which a credit was based by the amount of the credit. However, there is no general section of the Internal Revenue Code that requires this basis reduction when claiming a credit. Generally, the sections specific to the credit have a subsection requiring basis reduction. There is nothing in \u00a7 36 that would require an adjustment to basis. The lack of basis adjustment for taxpayers receiving the first-time homebuyer tax credit is in line with other tax laws. While some argue that the actual investment is less than the property's full purchase price due to the credit received, \u00a7 36 does not mandate a basis reduction for these purchases, leaving it unclear if this omission was intentional or accidental."
