TITLE II--NUTRITION SERVICES FOR ALL OLDER INDIVIDUALS. SEC. 2. PURPOSES. The Act aims to provide nutrition services and transportation assistance for older individuals, specifically Holocaust survivors. It includes designating a responsible individual within the Administration on Aging and creating a grant program for transportation services. During the Holocaust, 6,000,000 Jews and millions from other groups were murdered. Approximately 127,000 Holocaust survivors remain in the US, with many aging and needing support. Providers face high demand without additional funding. Most survivors are over 75, with many in their 80s and 90s. Holocaust survivors who emigrated to the US from the former Soviet Union after 1965 are vulnerable due to poverty. They continue to suffer from mental and physical scars of the Holocaust. Institutionalized settings can retraumatize survivors by reintroducing past traumas. Approximately 2/3 of Holocaust survivors live alone, which is a risk factor for institutionalization. Low-income survivors rely heavily on social service programs for personal care, meals, transportation, counseling, and mental health support. TITLE I--RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS.
