    "content": "The Act titled \"Tax Incentives for Family-Friendly Workplaces Act of 1996\" introduces the Small Business Family and Medical Leave Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Small Business Family and Medical Leave Credit allows eligible small business employers to claim a credit equal to 50% of qualified family and medical leave costs, with a limit of $2,000 per employee. Eligible employers must comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. The Small Business Family and Medical Leave Credit allows eligible small business employers to claim a credit equal to 50% of qualified family and medical leave costs, with a limit of $2,000 per employee. Employers with fewer than 50 employees are not required to comply with the Act. No deduction is allowed for the portion of qualified family and medical leave costs equal to the credit determined for the taxable year. The Small Business Family and Medical Leave Credit allows eligible small business employers to claim a credit for qualified family and medical leave costs. The amendment includes adding a new paragraph for small business employers defined in section 45C(c) to claim the credit. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The Small Business Family and Medical Leave Credit, under section 45C, applies to expenses paid or incurred after 6 months from the enactment of the Act. Section 3 introduces a credit for wages paid to employees who can adjust their hours or work from home to reduce child care needs, under section 45D. The child care-related wage credit under section 38 allows for a credit equal to 1/3 of wages paid to qualified employees who can work from home to reduce dependent care services outside the household. The child care-related wage credit under section 38 provides a credit for a reduction in dependent care services outside the household due to work performed outside normal business hours. To qualify, the employee must be a qualified employee for the entire year, and only $6,000 of wages per year can be taken into account. The child care-related wage credit under section 38 allows for a credit of up to $6,000 per year for dependent care services. Rules similar to section 52 and subsections of section 51 apply. Additionally, a conforming amendment adds the child care-related wage credit as paragraph (13) to section 38. The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by adding a new item under section 45D(a). The amendments made by section 45D apply to wages paid after 6 months from the enactment date. No reduction in employer practices before the effective date will be considered for the first taxable year."
