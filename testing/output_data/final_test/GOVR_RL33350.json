    "content": "The Court Improvement Program (CIP) provides grants to state courts to improve handling of child welfare cases. Grants are used for assessing cases, training personnel, and improving decision timeliness. Funding for these grants was authorized in 1993 and continued through the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The Court Improvement Program (CIP) grants were made available in FY1995 as a set-aside from Title IV-B appropriations. The funding is set to expire in FY2006, and the 109th Congress may consider extending it. The grants aim to improve court performance in child welfare cases, including foster care placement and termination of parental rights. The Court Improvement Program (CIP) grants were established in FY1995 to improve court performance in child welfare cases. Funding was provided through a set-aside from Title IV-B, Subpart 2, totaling $5 million for FY1995 and $10 million for each of FY1996-FY1998. Eligible state highest courts could receive grants, with funding continuing at $10 million annually through FY2001 under the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA, P.L. 105-89). The Promoting Safe and Stable Families Amendments of 2001 (P.L. 107-133) extended CIP through FY2006, allowing funds to be used for necessary improvements. The Court Improvement Program (CIP) grants, established in FY1995 to enhance court performance in child welfare cases, received funding through a set-aside from Title IV-B. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families Amendments of 2001 extended CIP through FY2006, authorizing up to $16.6 million in annual set-aside funding. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 expanded the CIP and provided independently appropriated funds for the program. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 expanded the Court Improvement Program (CIP) by providing new, independently appropriated funds totaling $100 million over five years for two new types of grants. These grants aim to meet the safety, permanence, and well-being needs of children and provide training for legal personnel in child welfare cases. State highest courts can apply for these grants, demonstrating collaboration between the courts and the state child welfare agency. The Court Improvement Program (CIP) grants require meaningful collaboration between courts, state child welfare agencies, and Indian tribes. State highest courts must plan for data sharing and cross-training initiatives with child welfare agencies to receive funds. The state highest court must provide additional information for grant applications. Each approved application is entitled to a minimum grant of $85,000 and a portion of remaining funds based on the state's population under 21 years of age. This formula applies to all new grant programs. The Court Improvement Program grant funding is based on the state's population under 21 years of age. Tables show funds authorized and appropriated for the program from FY1995 to FY2010. Funding authority may expire in FY2006 if not extended. Congress separately appropriated funds in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. In 2005, Congress allocated $100 million for the Court Improvement Program over five fiscal years. The Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care made recommendations for improving court oversight of child welfare proceedings, which were incorporated into legislation introduced in the 109th Congress. The Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care recommended that states adopt performance measures to track children's progress in court proceedings and allocate $10 million for capacity building. They also urged for effective collaboration between child welfare agencies and courts to ensure children's well-being. The Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care recommended states adopt performance measures to track children's progress in court proceedings and allocate $10 million for capacity building. They also urged effective collaboration between child welfare agencies and courts. Congress was asked to appropriate $10 million to train court personnel and establish state commissions on children in foster care led by child welfare agency directors and state chief justices. The Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care recommended states adopt performance measures to track children's progress in court proceedings and allocate $10 million for capacity building. State highest courts may apply for funds to improve training of court personnel and collaborate with child welfare agencies for timely decision-making on behalf of children. The Deficit Reduction Act requires state child welfare agencies to involve courts in information gathering and program improvement efforts. The Pew Commission recommended measures to ensure children's best interests in dependency court proceedings, including additional funding for the CASA program, standards for attorneys, and loan forgiveness programs to attract and retain dependency court attorneys. Law schools, bar associations, and law firms were urged to help build a pool of qualified attorneys for dependency courts. Congress is considering proposals for a student loan forgiveness program for child welfare attorneys. Congress is considering funding a student loan forgiveness program for child welfare attorneys, but no action has been taken on proposed bills. The CASA program was reauthorized without an increase in funding. The National Association for Counsel of Children has developed a certification for child welfare lawyers, approved by the American Bar Association. A certification exam for child welfare lawyers was piloted in 2005, allowing attorneys in select states to apply. S. 1679 introduced in July 2005 aims to establish practice standards for attorneys representing child welfare agencies. Recommendations are also made for chief justices to advocate for children in court systems. State laws play a crucial role in achieving federal goals of child safety and permanency. Federal child welfare policy impacts state laws and requires active court involvement. Federal funding is mainly directed towards state child welfare agencies, holding them accountable for adhering to court-related procedures and outcomes. Courts have been involved in federal child welfare policy since at least 1961. Since 1961, courts have played a significant role in federal child welfare policy, with federal funding to state agencies conditioned on court findings regarding child welfare. The Adoption and Child Welfare Assistance Act of 1980 expanded the role of courts in federal child welfare policies, requiring \"reasonable efforts\" to preserve families and reunite children. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997 revised federal child welfare policy to prioritize timeliness of court actions in child welfare proceedings and emphasize safety for children in foster care. ASFA changed the name of the \"dispositional hearing\" to a \"permanency hearing,\" requiring it to be held within 12 months of a child entering foster care. The court must decide on the child's permanent placement, prioritizing safety. \"Reasonable efforts\" to preserve or reunite a family are not required in certain cases, such as abandonment or aggravated circumstances. ASFA required court proceedings to terminate parental rights for abandoned children in certain cases, such as when a parent has committed egregious crimes. State agencies were also mandated to initiate termination of parental rights for children in foster care for 15 out of 22 months. These requirements were tied to federal funding for child welfare agencies. The Court Improvement Program, funded by the Deficit Reduction Act, is a significant source of funding for court performance in child welfare cases. The Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 mandated expanded technical assistance and training for judicial personnel due to an increase in abuse cases and new requirements from the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980. The Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 mandated expanded technical assistance and training for judicial personnel to improve handling of child abuse and neglect cases, with funding provided to the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges for model programs. The National Council received over $2 million to develop its Model Courts Initiative, providing training and resources to improve handling of child welfare cases. There are 31 Model Courts in 23 states and the District of Columbia. The Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act authorized grant programs to enhance court efficiency in handling child abuse and neglect cases. The Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act authorized $10 million for grants to state and local courts to reduce backlogs in handling child abuse and neglect cases, and $10 million for grants to develop computer data collection systems. Funding for SANCA has expired, but grants were awarded to courts in six states to enhance their case tracking programs."
