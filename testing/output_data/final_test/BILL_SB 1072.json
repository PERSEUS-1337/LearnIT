    "title": "SB 1072",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Paul Lee School Bus Safety Law requires schools to prepare a transportation safety plan for the safe transport of pupils, including procedures for boarding and exiting the school bus. The Paul Lee School Bus Safety Law mandates schools to have a transportation safety plan that includes procedures for boarding and exiting school buses, ensuring pupils are not left unattended, and designating adult chaperones on school pupil activity buses. The plan must be retained by each school and made available to the California Highway Patrol upon request. The new Section 39843 of the Education Code requires school officials and transportation providers to notify the Department of Motor Vehicles within five days of certain actions related to school transportation services. Section 39860 of the Education Code is amended to allow disciplinary action against a driver of a school bus who leaves the immediate vicinity of the vehicle with an unsupervised pupil onboard, if found to have acted with gross negligence. Gross negligence is defined as a want of even scant care or an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of conduct. Section 39860 of the Education Code allows school districts to contract for pupil transportation to various activities within the state, with funds available for this purpose. Contracts must ensure pupils are not left unattended on buses. Section 40085 is also amended. Applicants renewing a schoolbus or school pupil activity bus driver certificate must complete 10 hours of training annually. In-service training can be credited for attending driver workshops, safety meetings, and conferences. The final year of validity requires classroom instruction on laws, defensive driving, emergency procedures, and passenger safety. Bus drivers renewing their certificate must complete annual training on driving, accident prevention, emergency procedures, passenger loading/unloading, and inspection. Failure to complete training may result in certificate cancellation by the DMV. Training required by Section 40089 can be accepted in place of this requirement. The Department of Motor Vehicles can refuse to issue or revoke a driver certificate for certain vehicles if the applicant or holder has a sex offense conviction, a recent drug offense conviction, fails to meet training or testing requirements. The Department of Motor Vehicles may refuse to issue or revoke a driver certificate for specific vehicles if the applicant or holder has failed testing requirements, or has been convicted of a violent or serious felony. The Department of Motor Vehicles may refuse to issue or revoke a driver certificate for specific vehicles if the applicant or holder has committed acts involving moral turpitude, been convicted of certain offenses within seven years, been dismissed as a driver for pupil transportation safety reasons, convicted of drug-related offenses within seven years, or reported for leaving a pupil unattended on a school bus. Reapplication following refusal or revocation may be made after a one-year period. Reapplication for a certificate can be made after a 45-day period following the third testing failure. An applicant can reapply if a felony or misdemeanor conviction is reversed or dismissed. A former applicant whose certificate was revoked can reapply if the revocation is reversed or dismissed by the department. Article 18, Child Safety Alert System, is added to the Vehicle Code. The department must adopt regulations for child safety alert systems by January 1, 2018. By the start of the 2018-19 school year, certain vehicles must have operational child safety alert systems, except for non-exclusive school pupil activity buses. The school pupil activity bus must have an adult chaperone, safety procedures reviewed before departure, and a list of all passengers. Before departure, the adult chaperone must verify the number of pupils with the driver and sign a form confirming all pupils are present. After pupils exit the bus, the driver must check all areas to ensure it is vacant and sign a form verifying procedures. Records of these actions must be kept for at least two years. A child safety alert system in a child care motor vehicle prompts the driver to inspect the interior before exiting. Definitions for child care motor vehicle and child care provider apply. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes penalties, within the meaning of the Government Code."
