These speeches provide a rare opportunity for non-legislative debate and are not governed by time restrictions. The report examines current practices for reserving special order speeches and discusses differences between inserted and delivered special orders, various uses of special orders, and current reform proposals. Special order speeches in the House of Representatives are not governed by specific rules but have evolved as a unanimous consent practice. Members must follow House rules, precedents, and Speaker's policies during the special order period. A Representative's special order speech cannot exceed 60 minutes due to House Rule XVII, clause 2. Once the time expires, they cannot request additional time but can speak again if yielded time under another Representative's special order. House precedents and Speaker's policies govern special order speeches in the House of Representatives. Precedents are published in parliamentary reference publications and limit Members to one special order per legislative day. Speaker's policies, announced at the start of each Congress, dictate recognition for special orders and their television broadcast. Special order speeches cannot exceed 60 minutes and Members can speak again if yielded time by another Representative. The Speaker's power of recognition in the House of Representatives allows for special order speeches to be scheduled after legislative business. The Speaker can prioritize unanimous-consent requests and permissible motions before special orders. Special order speeches can be rescheduled or interrupted for other business, and the Speaker may recognize Representatives earlier in the day for major legislation considerations. The Speaker pro tempore usually presides during special orders, following the Speaker's announced policies. The Speaker's policies for special order speeches include recognizing Representatives for five-minute and longer speeches, alternating between majority and minority, following a specified order, and limiting longer speeches to four hours after five-minute speeches on non-Tuesday days. No special orders are allowed after midnight, except on Tuesdays when they can continue until midnight. The Speaker's policies allow for special order speeches of up to four hours, divided equally between majority and minority parties. Each party can reserve the first hour for leadership or a designee. Designees may lead thematic special orders and yield time to other party Members. The Speaker's policies allow for special order speeches of up to four hours, divided equally between majority and minority parties. Members reserve five-minute and longer special orders through their party leadership. Reservations cannot be made more than one week in advance. The Speaker's policies require party leadership to provide a daily list for allocating special order speeches among Members. For longer special orders, the list determines the order of recognition. Five-minute special orders are reserved through a daily list given to a party Member who requests unanimous consent for each Member to speak for five minutes on a specific date. Permission is typically granted, and notices are published in the Congressional Record and House Calendar. House Rule V places the broadcasting of House proceedings under the Speaker's exclusive direction, with policies prohibiting cameras from panning the chamber during special orders. Instead, a caption appears on the screen indicating the House is proceeding with special orders. Members may insert their special order speeches in the House pages of the Congressional Record or the \"Extensions of Remarks\" section. This decision is made when reserving the special order through their party's leadership. Representatives can also insert remarks in the House section for another Member's reserved special order. These inserted remarks appear in a distinctive typeface during the special order. When the House grants unanimous consent to special order requests, Representatives can insert their speeches in the Extensions of Remarks section alongside other materials. All materials in this section appear in a distinctive typeface. Special orders can be inserted or delivered in the House, with inserted orders available in the Congressional Record and online, while delivered orders reach a larger audience through C-SPAN. Delivered orders are more costly due to expenses like keeping the House in session. Members use special orders to address various topics unrelated to current legislation. Special orders in the House are used to debate specific legislation and policy issues outside of regular time restrictions. Parties may reserve 60-minute special orders to present their views on a bill or policy issue, and Members can coordinate special orders to debate legislation together. In the 104th Congress, both parties held consecutive 60-minute special orders to debate a proposed constitutional amendment on tax increases. Special orders in the House provide a forum for Members to practice debate skills before considering joint resolutions. New Members are advised to participate in special orders to gain experience in the legislative process. Freshmen majority Members also have the opportunity to preside as Speaker pro tempore during special orders. The Speaker's current policies on special orders, building upon earlier policies from February 23, 1994, imposed new restrictions like a four-hour limit on longer special orders and no reservations more than one week in advance. Before 1994, special orders could be reserved months ahead with over 10 hours for a single day. Special order speeches could happen after midnight, and all-night special orders occurred occasionally. Recognition for special order speeches alternated between majority and minority Members before 1994. Before February 23, 1994, special order speeches were delivered under less restrictive policies. The House Rules Committee's Subcommittee on Rules and Organization of the House discussed rising incivility in the House during special orders and one-minute speeches. The report highlighted that unparliamentary language was more tolerated during special orders. The report highlighted that unparliamentary language was more likely to be tolerated during special orders due to the low number of Members present, making it difficult to enforce rules. It recommended changing the rules to require that appealed rulings of the chair be voted on the next legislative day to address this issue. The 1999 report provided data on the 105th Congress and the December 1998 impeachment debate, with no specific recommendations included. The House Rules Committee held hearings on the report in April 1999. The House Rules Committee held hearings on the 1999 report in April 1999, discussing daily special orders and the costs involved. Representative Lynn Rivers introduced a resolution to amend House rules regarding expenses for special-order speeches. The resolution was referred to the House Committee on Rules but did not receive committee action in the 106th Congress. Rivers introduced identical resolutions in the 105th Congress. Representative Rivers introduced resolutions (H.Res. 97 in the 105th Congress and H.Res. 263 in the 104th Congress) but no action was taken on either measure."
