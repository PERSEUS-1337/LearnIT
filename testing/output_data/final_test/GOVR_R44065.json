    "content": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates the establishment of health insurance exchanges in every state. These virtual marketplaces allow consumers and small businesses to shop for private health insurance coverage and connect to public programs like Medicaid. Exchanges simplify the process of obtaining health insurance by providing additional coverage options without supplanting the private market. This report outlines the functions and structure of exchanges, eligibility and enrollment processes for individuals and small businesses, enrollment estimates, and financial assistance details. The report discusses enrollment estimates, financial assistance, and consumer assistance options for health insurance exchanges established under the ACA in all states and DC. It outlines the role of exchanges in certifying plans, the types of plans offered, and funding. Most states have individual and small business exchanges. Individual and small business health insurance exchanges allow eligible consumers to compare and purchase insurance plans for themselves and their families. They can also apply for premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions. Small businesses can compare and purchase small-group insurance and apply for small business health insurance tax credits. Exchanges also certify, recertify, and monitor the plans available in the marketplaces. For the 2018 plan year, states can operate their own state-based exchanges (SBE), or the federal government can establish and administer a federally facilitated exchange (FFE) if a state chooses not to. Some states have a state-based exchange using a federal platform (SBE-FP). In total, 34 states have FFEs, 12 states have SBEs, and 5 states have SBE-FPs. State involvement in FFEs varies, with some states wholly operated by HHS and others partnering with HHS for certain functions. The SHOP exchanges, like individual exchanges, can be federally facilitated, state-based, or state-based using the federal IT platform. Most states' individual and SHOP exchanges are administered similarly, but some states have different approaches. The exchanges allow consumers and small businesses to compare and purchase health plan options. Consumers can buy health insurance plans for themselves or their families through their state's individual exchange. Consumers can enroll in health insurance plans through their state's individual exchange if they meet residency requirements and are U.S. citizens or lawfully present residents. Undocumented individuals are not allowed to purchase coverage through the exchanges. Consumers can use the exchange website to compare and enroll in plans, with the option to receive cost-sharing reductions or premium tax credits. Medicaid or CHIP enrollment may also be available. Consumers can enroll in health insurance plans through their state's individual exchange if they meet residency requirements and are U.S. citizens or lawfully present residents. Undocumented individuals are not allowed to purchase coverage through the exchanges. Enrollment can be done online, by phone, mail, or in person with assistance available. Premiums can be paid through the exchange or directly to issuers. Enrollment periods are specified, with an annual open enrollment period typically in the fall preceding the plan year. The Open Enrollment Period (OEP) for health insurance coverage typically takes place in the fall before the plan year. For calendar year 2018, the OEP was from November 1, 2017, to December 15, 2017, for certain states. States with State-Based Exchanges (SBEs) may have different OEPs. Consumers may also qualify for Special Enrollment Periods (SEPs) due to personal circumstances or loss of qualifying coverage. Medicaid or CHIP enrollment is available whenever individuals qualify, regardless of the exchange OEP. Annual individual exchange enrollment estimates are released in stages, starting with pre-effectuated enrollment, which includes individuals eligible for an exchange plan and have selected one, with or without premium payment. This is followed by effectuated enrollment, which includes those who have selected a plan and made the first premium payment. Effectuated enrollment estimates are point-in-time and may change throughout the coverage year. Enrollment estimates for individual exchanges are subject to change due to life circumstances. Consumers may disenroll or enroll in exchange plans based on eligibility for financial assistance like premium tax credits. These credits aim to reduce the cost of purchasing health insurance through the exchange and vary based on income. The premium credit is designed to provide larger amounts to individuals with lower incomes compared to those with higher incomes. It is refundable and advanceable, allowing individuals to claim the full credit amount when filing taxes or receive it monthly to lower insurance premiums. Some consumers may also be eligible for cost-sharing reductions to reduce out-of-pocket expenses. Cost-sharing reductions are available to individuals to lower out-of-pocket expenses. There are two forms of cost-sharing reductions, one reduces the annual out-of-pocket limit for exchange plans, and the other reduces cost-sharing requirements for exchange plans. Annual out-of-pocket limits for 2018 are $7,350 for self-only plans and $14,700 for other plans, increasing to $7,900 and $15,800 in 2019. Cost-sharing assistance in SHOP exchanges reduces individual responsibility for health care expenses, increasing plan actuarial value. Small businesses eligible for SHOP exchanges are defined by states as having 50 or fewer full-time employees. All states have the option to allow large businesses to use SHOP exchanges, but none have done so. To participate, a small business must offer coverage to all full-time employees working 30 or more hours per week. Employees working 30 or more hours per week are eligible for coverage through a SHOP exchange. Employers can offer coverage to part-time or other employees but are not required to. Employers must select plan options on the SHOP exchange for employees to choose from, who can then enroll through the exchange website or with a broker. Small employers can offer multiple plan options to their employees. Employers can offer plan options to employees through a SHOP exchange using the employee choice method. There is also a vertical choice method available. CMS allowed direct enrollment for SB-SHOP websites in 2014, extended for plan years 2015-2019. CMS allowed direct enrollment for SB-SHOP websites in 2014, extended for plan years 2015-2019. As of April 2016, CMS indicated SB-SHOPs would need online portals by 2019. HHS signaled a new policy direction in April 2018 due to low employer participation in SHOP exchanges. Direct enrollment is now the only option for FF-SHOP and SB-FP-SHOP states starting in 2018. States with SB-SHOPs can choose to maintain direct enrollment or online enrollment, but will no longer be able to use the federal IT platform. Kentucky and Nevada can continue using the SB-FP-SHOP option, but Healthcare.gov functionality will be reduced. Three SB-SHOP states still use direct enrollment, while five others are transitioning. SB-SHOP states are either maintaining direct enrollment or transitioning to it, with some instructing small businesses to enroll directly with issuers off the exchange. Healthcare.gov guides users in FF-SHOP and SB-FP-SHOP exchange states. Enrollment in a SHOP exchange is not limited to a specific OEP, allowing employers to enroll at any time during the year. CMS estimated around 27,000 small employers and 233,000 employees were using SHOP exchanges in January 2017. Certain small businesses are eligible for small business health care tax credits through SHOP exchanges. The credits assist with the cost of providing health insurance coverage to employees and are available for two consecutive tax years. The maximum credit is 50% for for-profit employers and 35% for nonprofit organizations with 10 or fewer full-time equivalent employees. The small business health care tax credit is available to employers with 10 or fewer full-time equivalent employees with average taxable wages of $26,600 or less. The credit is phased out as the number of employees increases from 10 to 25 and as average employee compensation increases. Employees enrolled in a SHOP plan are not eligible for this tax credit or other premium tax credits. Exchanges must establish Navigator and certified application counselor programs for consumer assistance. Consumer assistance personnel, including Navigators and Certified Application Counselors (CACs), are trained to help individuals understand their insurance options and enroll in coverage through exchanges. They cannot advise on plan selection or receive compensation from issuers or consumers. Insurance agents and brokers may also assist consumers and small employers in obtaining coverage through exchanges. Exchanges, brokers, and agents help individuals obtain insurance coverage. Exchanges must provide in-person assistance, operate call centers, and maintain accessible websites. They also certify plans for participation in marketplaces. SBEs, SBE-FPs, and state entities are responsible for certifying or recertifying plans annually as qualified health plans. Exchanges certify plans as qualified health plans (QHPs) for sale in their marketplaces. This involves reviewing benefits, provider networks, premium rates, marketing practices, and quality standards annually. Other administrative tasks include data collection, reporting to government departments, and oversight of plans by state insurance departments and federal regulators. Health insurance plans offered through exchanges must generally be QHPs. Health insurance plans offered through exchanges must be Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), which are certified by the exchange, cover essential health benefits (EHB), and comply with state and federal requirements. QHPs must cover 10 categories of benefits, limit consumer cost sharing, and provide specified preventive services without cost sharing. Plans offered through individual and SHOP exchanges must meet requirements specific to their market segment. The Affordable Care Act requires health insurance plans offered through exchanges to be Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), covering essential health benefits and preventive services without cost sharing. QHPs are the only comprehensive plans offered in exchanges, including child-only, catastrophic, CO-OPs, and MSPs. Stand-alone dental plans are the only non-QHPs available. Some plans offered in exchanges are also available outside of exchanges. The ACA provided indefinite funding for HHS grants to states for exchange support. The HHS Secretary determined the total amount available to each state for exchange grants, which could not be awarded after January 1, 2015. Exchanges were expected to be self-sustaining from 2015 onwards, generating funding through fees on health insurance plans. HHS assesses monthly fees on issuers offering plans through FFEs or SBE-FPs, with user fees being the primary source of funding for FFEs. SBEs also assess user fees on participating issuers. States can use various funding sources to support their exchanges, including user fees on issuers participating in the exchanges. Some states have transitioned to federal IT platforms due to challenges and costs. In 2019, HHS announced that fees would not be assessed for issuers selling plans under reduced federal IT support.
