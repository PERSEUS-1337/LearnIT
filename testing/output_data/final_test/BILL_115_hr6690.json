    "content": "The Act titled \"Fighting Fraud to Protect Care for Seniors Act of 2018\" introduces a Medicare Smart Card Pilot Program under section 1866F of the Social Security Act. The Act \"Fighting Fraud to Protect Care for Seniors Act of 2018\" establishes a pilot program to assess the use of smart card technology in Medicare within 36 months. Smart card technology is defined as a tamper-resistant card with an embedded chip for secure authentication of Medicare beneficiaries. The pilot program aims to authenticate Medicare beneficiaries using smart card technology and a personal identification number at the point of service for a period of 3 years. Card reader technology will be used to verify beneficiary identity, with authentication reflected in the claims adjudication process. The pilot program will be conducted for 3 years in at least three geographic areas, with selected supplier and provider types required to participate. The Secretary will consider fraud risk in the selection process. The pilot program will be limited to 2,000 suppliers and providers. The Secretary can exempt those without card reader technology or sufficient internet access. The Secretary will provide beneficiary smart cards at no cost to Medicare beneficiaries in the pilot program area. The smart cards may contain information typically found on Medicare cards used outside the pilot program. The Secretary will provide smart card hardware and software to participating suppliers and providers at no cost for the pilot program. Information on the operation of the pilot program, including privacy protections, will be provided to participating suppliers, providers, and Medicare beneficiaries. Access to services outside the pilot program allows Medicare beneficiaries with smart cards to receive items and services from non-participating suppliers and providers. These suppliers and providers can still submit claims for services provided without using the smart card. Medicare beneficiaries can receive services without using smart cards, and suppliers/providers in the pilot program can submit claims for services provided to beneficiaries without smart cards. If a Medicare beneficiary does not present their smart card when receiving items or services from a participating supplier or provider, the supplier/provider must still provide the items or services as if the card was presented. They can submit claims for the services provided and must report to the Secretary that the beneficiary received a smart card but did not have it at the time. The Secretary will choose a private sector contractor to implement and operate the pilot program through a competitive procurement process. Privacy protections will be ensured to comply with applicable Federal laws and regulations regarding health information. The pilot program under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 requires mandatory participation from providers or suppliers selected in specific geographic areas for payment under the program.
