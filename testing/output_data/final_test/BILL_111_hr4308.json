    "content": "The \"Deficit Reduction Check-Off Act\" allows taxpayers to designate income tax payments to reduce the deficit. This Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new part for this purpose. Every individual, regardless of income tax liability, can designate an amount (between $1 and $10) to reduce the US deficit. Spouses filing jointly can each make a designation. Income tax liability is defined as the tax imposed minus allowable credits. Designation rules are similar to section 6096(c) with a required statement. The Federal budget can be reduced by designating an amount between $1 and $10 to reduce the deficit. The maximum amount that can be designated increases by $1 each year after 2011. Spouses filing jointly can each make a designation. A required statement must accompany the designation. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010. Part C of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to include a new section on sequestration to reduce the deficit. Sequestration is mandated within 15 days after Congress adjourns to end a session to eliminate the deficit. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) calculates the total designated amount under the Internal Revenue Code before October 1st each year. OMB then enforces a federal spending reduction to reduce the deficit. The Office of Management and Budget calculates the total designated amount under the Internal Revenue Code before October 1st each year. Any amounts not calculated by OMB by the deadline shall be applied to the following fiscal year Federal spending reduction. Each account of the United States shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the level of budgetary resources in that account by a uniform percentage. Exempt programs from reduction include Social Security benefits, Railroad Retirement benefits, Title 18 Social Security benefits, pay rates for judges, and Veteran's benefits listed under the Balanced Budget Act. The Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 905(b), 905(f)) applies to calendar years starting after December 31, 2010. Section 254 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to include new reporting requirements. The OMB report estimates the income tax amount designated under section 6097 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The OMB report includes estimates for the aggregate amount designated under section 6097 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, reductions required under section 253A, and the sequestration percentage needed to achieve the required reduction in accounts. The final reports shall contain all information from the deficit taxation designation report required on October 1, and the President will issue an order implementing sequestration as per section 253A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The President will issue an order fully implementing sequestration as required by section 253A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, effective immediately upon issuance."
