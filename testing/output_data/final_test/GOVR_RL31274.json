    "content": "The welfare reform law of 1996 increased federal child care funding for low-income families to meet the demand created by work requirements for welfare recipients. This funding led to the creation of the Child Care and Development Block Grant program, financed through discretionary and mandatory funding streams known as the Child Care and Development Fund. States have been allocating more federal and state money towards child care since the implementation of the law. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the primary federal funding source for child care subsidies for low-income families. Other federal block grants, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), also contribute to child care funding. While CCDF is solely dedicated to child care subsidies and activities, TANF and SSBG provide a wider range of assistance. This report focuses on the financing structure of CCDF, actual expenditures, and the role of TANF and SSBG in child care funding. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the main federal funding source for child care subsidies for low-income families. Congress is expected to address child care financing issues this year as part of reauthorizations. The funding structure remains complex, leading to calls for simplification. TANF funds also contribute to child care expenditures. Recent TANF expenditure data show states are increasing spending on child care services within the TANF program. States can transfer up to 30% of their TANF block grant to CCDF and/or SSBG. Many states have utilized this option. The report will further discuss child care funding sources and trends in expenditures. The federal child care programs and funding structure evolved from the system prior to 1996, which included four separate programs supporting child care for low-income families. These programs were associated with the cash welfare system and provided free child care for families on welfare, transitional subsidized child care for those leaving welfare, and targeted child care subsidies for families at risk of qualifying for welfare. Prior to 1996, there were four separate federal child care programs for low-income families associated with the cash welfare system. These programs provided free child care for families on welfare, transitional subsidized child care for those leaving welfare, and targeted child care subsidies for families at risk of qualifying for welfare. The programs operated under different rules and targeted different populations, leading to unnecessary complexity according to critics. The programs were funded with mandatory money and fell under the jurisdiction of specific congressional committees. The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) was established in 1990 to support child care for low-income families not connected to the AFDC welfare system. It subsidized child care for children under age 13 from families with incomes below 75% of the state median income. Unlike AFDC-related programs, CCDBG was funded with discretionary funds and aimed to improve the quality and supply of child care. The 1996 welfare reform law repealed AFDC and its associated child care programs, creating a consolidated block of mandatory funding under Section 418 of the Social Security Act targeted towards families on or at risk of receiving welfare. This funding was transferred to each state's lead agency managing the CCDBG for administration. The 1996 welfare reform law allocated $13.9 billion over 6 years for a new child care block grant, with committee jurisdiction remaining with the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees. The law also reauthorized and amended the CCDBG, authorizing $1 billion annually in discretionary funding and expanding program eligibility to 85% of SMI. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is a major source of federal funding for child care subsidies and activities for low-income families. States must allocate a minimum of 4% of their CCDF allotments to improve child care quality and availability. The term \"CCDF\" was coined by the Department of Health and Human Services in 1996 to refer to the combination of mandatory and discretionary funding provided to states. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) provides funding to states for child care programs governed by CCDBG rules. Mandatory funding, also known as entitlement funding, ensures states receive federal funds for child care, although individual entitlement was eliminated in 1996. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) provides fixed federal funding to states for child care programs under CCDBG rules. States receive guaranteed funding based on previous AFDC-child care programs without needing to match it with state funds. States must meet a maintenance-of-effort requirement to access additional matching funds. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) provides fixed federal funding to states for child care programs under CCDBG rules. States must meet a maintenance-of-effort requirement to access additional matching funds, which are determined based on each state's relative share of children under age 13. Discretionary funding for the CCDF is determined in the annual appropriations process. Since 1996, the distinction between discretionary and mandatory funds for child care funding has become less relevant programmatically, as all funds are directed to CCDBG programs. Discretionary funds are allocated based on each state's share of children under age 5, children receiving free or reduced-price lunches, and per capita income. Some funds are reserved for territories and Indian tribes. Funding for Indian tribes and tribal organizations under the CCDF includes discretionary funds that do not require a state match. The CCDBG Act authorizes funding up to $2.1 billion annually, with actual appropriations exceeding $1 billion. Table 1 shows funding available for both discretionary and mandatory portions of the CCDF from FY1997 to FY2002. States can transfer a portion of their TANF allotments to the CCDF for expenditure. States can transfer a portion of their TANF allotments to the CCDF for expenditure. Table 1 shows CCDF appropriations from FY1997 to FY2002, with a shift to advance appropriating of funds for the following fiscal year in FY1997. The FY1997 appropriation law provided $956 million for CCDBG, with only $19 million available immediately during FY1997. In FY1996, most of the appropriation for the year was obligated in the following fiscal year. Time limits for obligating and spending CCDF funds vary depending on the funding stream. States define \"obligate\" funds as money committed to spend from their CCDF grant awards, with some restrictions imposed by CCDF regulations. Examples of obligations include subgranting funds to independent programs or making transactions requiring future payment for services. States have 2 years to obligate discretionary funds and an additional year to spend them. If obligations are not met within 3 years, HHS will reclaim unspent grant awards. Mandatory funds have different deadlines for obligation and expenditure. The deadlines for obligating and expending mandatory funds differ from discretionary funds. Mandatory CCDF funds must be obligated by the end of the fiscal year for matching funds. States must meet maintenance-of-effort requirements to qualify for federal matching funds. Matching funds must be obligated within the fiscal year of the grant award, with an additional year for expenditures. States have flexibility to obligate and spend CCDF funds across years, with an additional year for expenditures. HHS will reclaim unmatched federal grant funds if states fail to spend their share by the end of the second fiscal year. TANF and SSBG also support child care for low-income families. The TANF and SSBG block grants supplement funds for child care, with TANF providing fixed grants for aid to families with children. States can transfer a portion of their TANF allotments to the CCDF and SSBG, with funds required to be administered according to the receiving program's rules. States can transfer a portion of their TANF allotments to the CCDF, with $6 billion transferred from FY1997-FY2000, representing over 9% of their TANF allotments. In FY2000, $2.4 billion was transferred, exceeding the amount appropriated for CCDF in FY2002. This transfer is not the only way states can use TANF funding for child care services. In FY2000, states spent $2.2 billion of federal TANF and state funds on child care services. States can also use the SSBG, a flexible federal fund, to support various social services including child care, with no state match required. States have full discretion over the distribution of SSBG funds. States have the option to transfer up to 10% of their TANF allotment to the SSBG, totaling $3.9 billion over FY1997-FY2000. However, funds transferred to the SSBG are not necessarily used for child care services, with only 13% of FY1999 SSBG expenditures going towards child day care services. In FY1999, 13% of SSBG expenditures were allocated to child day care services, a higher percentage than in FY1998. Funding for SSBG has been decreasing since 1997, with transfers from TANF around $1 billion. FY2002 appropriations were $1.7 billion, a $25 million decrease from the previous year. It is unclear how much of the SSBG funding from FY2000 and FY2001, along with TANF transfers, will be used for child care expenditures. The curr_chunk focuses on actual child care expenditures data from CCDF, TANF, and predecessor programs, with a breakdown of spending by fiscal year. It also mentions different time frames for spending money from various funding streams. Child care expenditures from CCDF and TANF programs have been steadily increasing since the 1996 welfare law, totaling over $9 billion in FY2000, more than double the amount spent in FY1997. Child care expenditures from CCDF and TANF programs have been steadily increasing since the 1996 welfare law, totaling over $9 billion in FY2000, more than double the level of expenditures made for child care in FY1997. Expenditures from the CCDF reached over $7 billion in FY2000, supplemented by over $2 billion in additional child care spending within the TANF system. Figure 3 displays the growth in combined expenditures from CCDF and TANF for FY1997-FY2000. Child care expenditures from CCDF and TANF programs have been steadily increasing since the 1996 welfare law, totaling over $9 billion in FY2000. Expenditures from the CCDF reached over $7 billion in FY2000, supplemented by over $2 billion in additional child care spending within the TANF system. The breakdown of CCDF expenditures for FY1992-FY2000 by funding source is shown in Table 3, distinguishing between mandatory and discretionary funds. Total CCDF expenditures have been steadily increasing since the 1996 welfare law, reaching over $7 billion in FY2000. The funding amounts for CCDF are based on AFDC child care spending, with federal matching money representing new mandatory funding. Expenditures are categorized by federal and state funds, with the trend showing growth each year. Total CCDF expenditures have been steadily increasing since the 1996 welfare law, reaching over $7 billion in FY2000. The funding amounts for CCDF are based on AFDC child care spending, with federal matching money representing new mandatory funding. Expenditures are categorized by federal and state funds, with the trend showing growth each year. The data in Table 3 shows total CCDF expenditures by funding source from FY1992-FY2000, with discretionary fund expenditures including TANF transfers to CCDF and notes on excluded territories and rounding discrepancies. In FY2000, $7.2 billion was spent from the CCDF, with over $3 billion from federal discretionary funds. The total federal expenditures from CCDF exceeded the funding level due to states using funds from previous years and transfers from TANF. In FY2000, $7.2 billion was spent from the CCDF, with over $3 billion from federal discretionary funds. States were able to spend more in discretionary funds than were actually appropriated in FY2000, in part because expenditures from transferred TANF funds are included as discretionary. In FY2000, $7.2 billion was spent from the CCDF, with over $3 billion from federal discretionary funds. States were able to spend more in discretionary funds than were actually appropriated in FY2000, in part because expenditures from transferred TANF funds are included as discretionary. TANF contributes to child care spending in two ways: expenditures made from funds transferred to CCDF. The TANF system contributes to child care spending through expenditures made directly within TANF, funded by federal and state funds. States must meet the TANF MOE requirement to be eligible for their full TANF allotment, which is based on historic spending levels on predecessor programs. This is important in calculating TANF's contribution to child care spending. States may apply child care expenditures towards TANF and CCDF MOE levels. States can \"double count\" child care expenditures towards both TANF and CCDF MOE levels without needing to explain any overlaps. However, to avoid overestimating MOE child care spending, only TANF MOE spending exceeding CCDF MOE expenditures will be considered in this analysis. This method provides a conservative estimate of TANF child care expenditures. The report analyzes TANF expenditures on child care services, showing a significant increase from over $133 million in FY1997 to almost $2.2 billion in FY2000. The data excludes child care expenditures in the territories. Table 6 displays total CCDF spending by each state from FY1992 to FY2000, showing the percentage change in expenditures from FY1996 to FY2000. States have flexibility in using TANF funds for childcare, with Table 7 providing a breakdown of TANF child care expenditures by year and type on a state-by-state basis. Table 7 shows that almost all states have reported using TANF funds for child care over a 4-year period. The data is based on information provided by the Health and Human Services and the Congressional Research Service. The table provides a detailed breakdown of child care expenditures by funding source for each state, including any excess TANF MOE expenditures. The table reflects the calculation of \"excess\" child care TANF MOE expenditures for FY2000. The \"excess\" expenditure amount is any remaining after subtracting CCDF MOE expenditures from TANF child care MOE reported amount. If TANF MOE child care spending is greater than CCDF MOE, the positive difference is counted as the excess amount. For example, Alabama had to make $6.896 million in child care expenditures from state funds to meet its annual CCDF MOE requirement. Alabama spent $6.896 million in FY2000 on child care expenditures from state funds to meet its CCDF MOE requirement. The TANF MOE expenditures did not exceed the CCDF MOE expenditures, resulting in no expenditures counted towards state TANF child care spending. In contrast, Arkansas had TANF MOE child care expenditures exceeding those reported towards the CCDF MOE, resulting in an excess amount of $3.4 billion reported under TANF child care MOE. In FY2000, 12 states reported CCDF expenditures above the required MOE level. Congress is expected to address child care financing issues as part of reauthorizing child care. Congress is expected to address child care financing issues as part of reauthorizing legislation. Funding sources for child care are complex, with questions about allocation, matching funds, transfers, and timelines. Funds from the CCDF are crucial. The funding for child care is complex, with funds coming from various sources like CCDF and TANF. Questions arise about how to allocate funds and the implications of funding decisions on overall TANF levels. The use of TANF funds for child care and the impact of economic downturns on funding decisions are also important considerations. The allocation of CCDF funds varies for states depending on the funding stream, with mandatory funds requiring state matching requirements. States have the discretion to decide whether to access the full matching grant available. For example, Michigan has not always utilized its full matching grant. Michigan has not always accessed its full matching grant for CCDF funds, instead using state child care expenditures to meet TANF MOE requirements. Policymakers face decisions on funding delivery, allocation formulas, historical spending levels, matching requirements, and time limits for obligating and spending funds. Authority to transfer funds between block grants is also expected to be addressed in the reauthorization process. During the reauthorization process, critics argue for states to transfer TANF funds from prior years, not just current year funds. Economic downturns may impact states' decisions on using TANF funds for childcare or transfers. Appendices provide data on CCDF allotments, transfers from TANF to CCDF, and total CCDF and TANF child care expenditures. Child care expenditures data from FY1992-FY2000, excluding territories, show discretionary fund expenditures and mandatory CCDF expenditures. Expenditures from TANF transfers to CCDF and AFDC-related child care matching funds are included in the analysis."
