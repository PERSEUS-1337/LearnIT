    "content": "15-year recovery period for depreciation of designated low-income buildings. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new clause regarding designated low-income buildings. A designated low-income building is defined as a qualified low-income building with specific criteria. The taxpayer must make an election described in subparagraph (B) with respect to a building that has not been allocated a housing credit dollar amount under section 42(h). This election, once made, is irrevocable. No credit is allowed under section 42 for any designated low-income building. During the recapture period, a designated low-income building that no longer qualifies as such will be subject to recapture of accelerated depreciation. The taxpayer must notify the Secretary of the change in status within one year, and the deficiency assessment period is extended accordingly. The amendments made by this section apply to property placed in service after the enactment date. The compliance period under section 42(i)(1) is extended to 20 taxable years. The alternative depreciation system is also updated to include a 20-year option. Qualified low-income buildings are exempt from limitations on passive activity losses and credits. Qualified low-income buildings are exempt from passive activity loss and credit limitations under Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this section shall apply ordering rules to reflect exceptions and separate phase-outs for passive activity loss and credit limitations under Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this section apply to property placed in service after the enactment of this Act."
