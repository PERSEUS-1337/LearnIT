    "content": "The \"Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2012\" cites the dangerous activities of the Haqqani network in Afghanistan, including high-profile attacks like the Intercontinental Hotel assault and a truck bomb attack on a US military base. In September 2011, a truck bomb attack on a US military base in Wardak province injured 77 troops and killed 5 Afghans. Another attack on the US Embassy compound in Kabul resulted in a 20-hour gun battle, leaving 16 Afghans dead. US and Afghan officials linked the Embassy attackers to the Haqqani network, which Admiral Mullen stated acts as an arm of Pakistan's ISI agency. In October 27, 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified before the House of Representatives about taking action against the Haqqani network for their involvement in various attacks, including the embassy bombing and the Intercontinental Hotel attack in Kabul. Clinton emphasized the need to target the Haqqani leadership on both sides of the border and work with Pakistan to address the attacks on Afghans and Americans. The United States Government designated Haji Mali Kahn, a Haqqani Network commander, as a global terrorist for overseeing fighters and planning attacks in Afghanistan. The United States Government designated Haji Mali Khan, a Haqqani Network commander, as a global terrorist for planning and executing attacks in Afghanistan against civilians, coalition forces, and Afghan police. Khan also has links to al-Qaeda. Additionally, five other top Haqqani Network leaders have been designated as global terrorists since 2008, with three of them designated in the last year. Sirajuddin Haqqani, the overall leader of the Haqqani Network, was designated as a terrorist in March 2008, with a $5,000,000 bounty for information leading to his capture. The other four individuals designated are Nasiruddin Haqqani, Khalil al Rahman Haqqani, Badruddin Haqqani, and Mullah Sangeen Zadran. The Haqqani Network, including Khalil al Rahman Haqqani, Badruddin Haqqani, and Mullah Sangeen Zadran, meets the criteria for designation as a foreign terrorist organization. Congress urges the Secretary of State to designate the Haqqani Network as such. The Secretary of State must submit a report on the network's terrorist designation within 30 days of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary must submit a report on the Haqqani Network's terrorist designation to the appropriate committees of Congress, including detailed justification if the network does not meet the criteria for designation. The report should be in unclassified form but may include a classified annex. The House of Representatives' Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence clarifies that the Act does not infringe upon Pakistan's sovereignty in combating militant or terrorist groups within its borders. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
