    "content": "SECTION 1. CAMPUS-BASED CHILD CARE. Subpart 8 of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section, SEC. 420C, regarding campus-based child care. The section may be cited as the 'Child Care Access Means Parents in School Act'. Congress finds that attending college increases earning potential, completing college reduces reliance on public assistance, campus-based child care helps parents stay in school and graduate faster, and high-quality child care benefits children. The 'Child Care Access Means Parents in School Act' aims to support low-income parents in postsecondary education by providing quality child care. Studies show positive outcomes such as higher earnings, graduation rates, and lower rates of teenage pregnancy. Investing in child care yields a $7 return for every $1 spent, but campus-based programs may struggle to access federal funds under current laws. The Secretary may award grants to institutions of higher education to provide campus-based child care services to low-income students. The grant amount shall not exceed 1% of total Federal Pell Grant funds awarded to students at the institution in the previous fiscal year, with a minimum grant of $10,000. The Secretary awards grants to eligible institutions of higher education for campus-based child care services for low-income students. Grants are not less than $10,000 and can be renewed for 3 years. Institutions must have received over $1,000,000 in Federal Pell Grant funds in the previous fiscal year to be eligible. Grant funds must be used for specified purposes. The institution of higher education must use grant funds to support a campus-based child care program for low-income students. The definition of a low-income student is one eligible for a Federal Pell Grant. Institutions can also serve the child care needs of the community. Applications for grants must be submitted to the Secretary. To apply for a grant under this section, institutions must demonstrate eligibility, specify funding amount, show the need for child care services for low-income students, describe the activities to be supported, and identify resources for the program. To support the child care program for low-income students, institutions must access various funding sources, including social services funding, student activity fees, and external support. They must also assure meeting the child care needs of low-income students through services or contracts. If seeking assistance for a new program, institutions must provide a timeline for implementation. The institution must provide a timeline for the period from grant receipt to child care service provision, outline steps to assist low-income students before services are available, and plan for necessary resources. An assurance is required that any child care facility funded will meet state regulations. The institution of higher education must report to the Secretary 18 and 36 months after receiving the grant under this section, including data on the population served. The child care facility assisted under this section must meet state regulations and become accredited within 3 years. The institution of higher education must report to the Secretary on campus and community resources, funding, accreditation progress, and grant impact on child care services. The Secretary will make the third annual grant payment based on the institution's efforts to ensure eligibility. The institution must ensure access to affordable child care services for low-income students. $60,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1998 and subsequent years for this purpose."
