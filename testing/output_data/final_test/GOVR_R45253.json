Many 911 centers still use outdated technology that can only receive voice calls, not data. Next Generation 911 (NG911) technologies allow for sending data like text, photos, and video to PSAPs, improving communication and emergency response. The migration to NG911 is seen as necessary but will be costly and complex. The migration to NG911 will be costly and complex, requiring coordination between state and local 911 agencies and telecommunication providers. NG911 technologies are expected to change the way 911 systems operate and interoperate, potentially creating a nationwide 911 system. Congress will need to determine the appropriate level of federal involvement while respecting state and local authorities. Before the 1960s, there was no universal emergency phone number for the public to call. In 1967, President Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement declared the need for a single nationwide emergency phone number. The Federal Communications Commission partnered with AT&T to establish 911 as the universal number, which was first used in Haleyville, AL in 1968. Since then, 911 services have expanded nationwide. 911 services have expanded nationwide, covering almost 99% of the U.S. population. There are 5,783 separate state and local PSAPs that receive an estimated 240 million calls annually. When a person dials 911, the call is routed to the appropriate PSAP, which then dispatches public safety agencies to the scene. The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 directs the FCC to make 911 the universal emergency telephone number for all communication devices and to ensure a nationwide, seamless communications infrastructure for emergency services. Disparities in 911 services exist across jurisdictions, with some areas lacking traditional 911 services. In Alaska, people are instructed to dial a 1-800 number for assistance, which can vary by region. In the 2017 National 911 Progress Report, 53 counties in 47 states lack 911 authority, with 38 in Alaska. Some areas have Basic 911 services where call-takers may not automatically receive caller location, causing delays in response. Most jurisdictions offer Enhanced 911 services for better location information. Some PSAPs can receive location information for both landline and wireless callers, but not all. The FCC requires wireless carriers to provide location information for mobile callers within six months of a request by the PSAP. Wireless Phase I (WPI) mandates carriers to provide the wireless number and cell site information to PSAPs. Some PSAPs have the technology to receive Wireless Phase II (WPII) calls, which include location information and caller coordinates. NG911 systems use IP-based technologies to process calls from various devices and enable PSAPs to connect to other public safety systems. The 2017 National 911 Progress Report found that 22 states were making progress toward implementing NG911, with most states and localities incrementally upgrading their systems. Upgrades require changes from both telecommunications providers and PSAPs to send and receive enhanced location information and data. Each 911 agency operates differently, with varying levels of services due to different technologies, upgrade phases, and funding sources. There is a need for upgrades to 911 systems to ensure compatibility with modern devices. The adoption of NG911 may lead to a shift from individual PSAPs to interconnected ones, requiring national policies for compatibility, interoperability, and security. Congress may need to address issues such as the migration to IP-based 911 systems, the federal role in establishing national policies, and ensuring state and local compliance. Key issues include determining the level of federal involvement in deploying NG911 and developing governance, funding, and technology policies. The NG911 development requires policies to support deployment without infringing on state and local authorities over 911 services. Federal agencies like the National 911 Program Office and the FCC are involved in coordinating efforts and providing recommendations to Congress on NG911 implementation. The FCC, in coordination with NHTSA, NTIA, and DHS, provides recommendations to Congress on the legal framework for NG911 transition. They work with various stakeholders to improve 911 services and enforce rules on handling 911 calls. DHS focuses on NG911 interoperability and cyber security, while the Department of Justice ensures equal access to 911 for the disabled. Stakeholders recognize the importance of ongoing state and local efforts in NG911 development. Some stakeholders believe federal agencies may need to ensure interoperability and connection of state NG911 networks. The FCC has set timelines for carriers to enhance 911 services and provided guidance on PSAP architecture and cyber security for NG911 systems. The ICO has developed governance documents, technical guidance, and standards for NG911 systems, as well as incentivized investment through grants. However, lack of funding for state and local migration to NG911 could limit implementation. Some Members of Congress have suggested expanding the ICO's role to speed up deployment through better coordination. The ICO and FCC are both crucial in supporting NG911 migration, with the need for a single agency to oversee the transition. Some suggest the appointment of a single agency to accelerate state and local NG911 deployment. The FCC collaborates with carriers and uses its rulemaking authority, while the ICO is developing a roadmap for NG911 systems. The ICO is developing a roadmap for NG911 deployment, and Congress may need to assess federal roles and resources. Stakeholders suggest an advisory committee to assist in NG911 deployment, and new legislation supports the creation of a short-term advisory board for NG911. Funding for NG911 deployment is crucial for the ICO to accelerate the transition effectively. New legislation supports the creation of a short-term advisory board for NG911 interoperability. A permanent advisory committee could provide recommendations on deployment, review emerging technologies' impact on 911 services, promote technical standards, and facilitate coordination between stakeholders and industry representatives. The NG911 NOW Coalition aims for all 911 systems in all states and territories to have sufficient capabilities. The NG911 NOW Coalition aims for all 911 systems in all states and territories to have sufficiently funded, standards-based, end-to-end, IP-based capabilities by 2020. Collaboration with various stakeholders is key to advancing NG911 deployment, but limited funding may hinder progress. Additional federal leadership may be necessary to support NG911 deployment, while state and local entities should retain control over 911 services and upgrades. Authorities are discussing the federal role and funding for NG911 deployment, with stakeholders highlighting funding limitations as a barrier. In 2018, key 911 organizations requested Congress for funding to support migration to NG911 and improve communication between 911 and public safety networks. The FCC estimated in 2011 that it would cost $2.68 billion over 10 years to provide broadband connectivity to PSAPs for next-generation architecture. The cost of deploying NG911 infrastructure is substantial, with estimates ranging from $18 million in Oregon to $50-60 million in Tennessee. Funding for 911 services comes from grants, state and local funds, 911 fees on phone bills, and other revenue sources. Some states have diverted 911 fees for other purposes, despite calls from Congress and the FCC to stop. The FCC has urged states to stop diverting 911 fees and allocate them towards 911 improvements, including NG911. Despite revenue of $2.7 billion annually, most states struggle to support current 911 services and NG911 deployment. Congress has provided limited grant funding for 911 improvements, with $40 million awarded in 2009 and an additional $115 million available through P.L. 112-96. However, these funds are insufficient for nationwide NG911 deployment. The FCC, ICO, and DHS conducted a cost study on NG911 requirements for Congress. The report is under review by OMB and may inform future funding needs for NG911 deployment. Possible funding options include one-time grants to accelerate investment in NG911 infrastructure and annual grants to support state NG911 plans and integration with other systems. Funding over several years with matching contributions could incentivize states to invest in NG911 and enable PSAPs to plan and prioritize improvements. Innovation grants support entities pursuing innovative solutions for deploying NG911, including public-private partnerships and consolidation of PSAPs for cost savings. States and localities will need funding from existing 911 revenues to support operational costs and personnel training during the migration to NG911. The implementation of NG911 will require technical changes to 911 systems, including nationwide standards and policies for interoperability. Key issues for Congress to consider include ensuring 911 fees are used for services, sustaining 911 services during the NG911 build-out, and providing long-term funding solutions for NG911 systems. Increased federal involvement may be necessary for interoperability and security in deploying a new nationwide NG911 system. The implementation of NG911 involves changing the structure of the nation's 911 system to a nationwide network of connected PSAPs. Common technical standards are needed for interoperability among federal, state, and local governments, as well as manufacturers. The development of a single nationwide 911 network raises policy issues for Congress, such as the need for standards-based technology to ensure interoperability. Congress may consider actions to encourage adoption of technical standards for interoperability in the nationwide 911 network, such as requiring compliance with standards, overriding state and local authorities, providing federal grants, and directing agencies to promote standards. NENA has developed i3 standards for NG911, which are widely accepted in the industry. While not yet formally accredited, states moving forward with NG911 deployment have included these standards in their plans. However, adoption by state and local agencies is not mandatory, posing a risk to interoperability among NG911 systems. To enhance interoperability in the nation's 911 system, Congress may consider actions such as requiring compliance with accredited standards in NG911 legislation and federal grants, extending the ICO's role to support joint purchasing agreements, and encouraging cooperation among stakeholders for a standards-based NG911 system deployment. The adoption of NG911 would allow PSAPs to connect with other IP-based public safety systems like FirstNet, providing first responders with additional data for improved response. Stakeholders emphasize the need for integration between 911 and other emergency communication stakeholders to maximize benefits. Congress may need to coordinate between FirstNet and federal agencies supporting NG911 for seamless integration of the two systems. The need for increased security in NG911 systems is highlighted as data sharing capabilities grow, posing potential risks of cyberattacks on PSAPs. The President's National Security Strategy recognizes the vulnerability of interconnected networks and suggests measures to enhance security. Congress may commission studies to identify and address NG911 network vulnerabilities, including continual monitoring and information-sharing to mitigate risks. The need for enhanced security in NG911 systems due to growing data sharing capabilities and potential cyberattack risks on PSAPs. Congress can promote the use of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and encourage cybersecurity agreements between shared networks. The lack of mechanisms to require state and local adoption of best practices poses a risk to the NG911 network. The Congressional Next Generation 911 Caucus, led by Senator Klobuchar and others, educates on 911 issues in the 115th Congress. In the 115th Congress, legislative actions advanced include Kari's Law requiring direct 911 dialing and the Next Generation 911 Act recognizing NG911 as a national priority. Issues for Congress may involve federal roles, funding, and technology for effective NG911 deployment nationwide. Congress may address federal roles, funding, and technology policies to advance NG911 deployment while respecting state and local control over 911 services."
