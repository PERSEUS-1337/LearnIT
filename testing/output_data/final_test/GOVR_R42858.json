    "content": "The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 (Perkins IV; P.L. 109-270) aims to enhance the academic and career skills of students in career and technical education (CTE) programs, preparing them for high-demand professions. CTE, also known as vocational education, provides training for various occupations at different education levels. CTE under Perkins IV offers preparation in various occupations such as nursing, business administration, culinary arts, automotive maintenance, software programming, engineering technology, and cosmetology. The majority of funds are allocated for Basic State Grants, which are awarded to states and used to support CTE activities at secondary and postsecondary levels. Grant recipients are required to establish academic and technical standards. Recipients of Perkins IV grants are expected to develop rigorous academic and technical standards, assist students in meeting these standards, and create linkages between secondary and postsecondary education. Grantees must implement a program of study, provide professional development for CTE instruction, and support partnerships among educational institutions, workforce boards, and businesses. The Tech Prep program, which aims to combine secondary and postsecondary vocational education, has not been funded since FY2010. States award grants to consortia under Tech Prep for a \"2+2\" model of education. Under Tech Prep, states award grants to consortia for CTE 2+2 programs, meeting academic standards, providing professional development, and requiring accountability for performance targets. Perkins IV mandates recipients to meet standards, assist students, and create linkages between secondary and postsecondary education. Under TCPCTIP, Perkins IV authorizes grants to two tribally controlled postsecondary career and technical institutions: United Tribes Technical College in North Dakota and Navajo Technical College in New Mexico, with funds used for CTE programs and institutional support costs. Appropriations for TCPCTIP were $8.1 million in FY2012. Perkins IV also supports national research and information dissemination on best practices for improving CTE programs through National Programs. Perkins IV is the main federal funding source for CTE, with 5% of CTE expenditures coming from federal funds. The remaining funds are from state and local sources. Perkins IV was authorized through FY2012 with $1.1 billion in funding. The General Education Provisions Act extends authorization to FY2013. Reauthorization issues may be addressed in the 113th Congress, with stakeholders raising concerns and evaluations outlining potential issues. The potential reauthorization issues for Perkins IV are based on ED guidance, the Administration's blueprint, stakeholder input, and program evaluations. These issues aim to support the creation of high-quality CTE programs for all high school graduates to be prepared for college and a career. The proposal aims to improve Career and Technical Education (CTE) by aligning programs with labor market needs, enhancing collaboration among institutions and industry partners, implementing an accountability system, and promoting innovation. Reduced funding for Perkins IV over the past decade has led to reauthorization issues. The Obama Administration requested a decrease in funding for Perkins IV in FY2012 due to budget constraints and lack of program performance. The Bush Administration also requested little to no funding for Perkins III and IV from FY2004-FY2009, opting to fund high school reform instead of CTE programs. The Administration emphasized the need for high school reform to improve education for struggling students, potentially impacting the federal CTE program. Criticisms of Perkins IV performance data include concerns about validity, reliability, and program quality, raising questions about CTE student preparedness for college and careers. Perkins IV lacks standard definitions and methodologies for assessing CTE student and program outcomes nationally. States have varying methods for measuring performance indicators, hindering the evaluation of CTE program effectiveness. The flexibility in Perkins IV performance measures frustrates national evaluation efforts, leading to collaboration between ED and states to improve data quality. In March 2007, ED recommended standard definitions and measurement approaches to improve Perkins IV data quality. 15 states used the guidance at the secondary level, and 37 states at the postsecondary level. ED offers technical assistance and hosts events to promote consistency. Congress may revise the performance measurement system during reauthorization to address data quality issues. Perkins IV's performance measurement system is compared to Perkins III, with separate indicators for secondary and postsecondary levels. The Perkins Blueprint aims for common definitions to allow objective analysis of student and program outcomes. Stakeholders suggest consistent indicators across states based on easily collectible data. Program evaluations funded by Perkins IV measure effectiveness and drive improvement, informing potential reauthorization. The Perkins acts in 1998 and 2006 were influenced by national program evaluations in 1994 and 2004. The National Research Center for Career and Technical Education conducts research to enhance CTE education and publishes evaluations, although findings may not be nationally representative. There is a need for a national evaluation of Perkins IV to guide its reauthorization. The 2009 GAO Perkins IV report highlighted that fewer than half of states had evaluated their CTE programs in the past five years, with no requirement to report outcomes. The integration of academic instruction in CTE courses may impact the qualifications and professional development needs of secondary CTE teachers, focusing on recruiting experienced individuals and ensuring they are up-to-date with industry advancements. Discussions on the quality of secondary CTE teachers may arise during reauthorization considerations. In 2004-2005, secondary education providers allocated 27% of Perkins III funds to instructional staff and 7% to professional development. Anecdotal evidence in 2011 suggested school districts faced challenges in hiring CTE teachers with technical knowledge. A 2010 survey of state CTE directors indicated shortages of teachers in various fields. A report based on 2008 data found that CTE teachers often had strong technical backgrounds but lacked pedagogy skills. In public schools, a higher percentage of Career and Technical Education (CTE) teachers enter teaching through alternative certification compared to academic teachers. CTE teachers are less likely to be highly qualified, possibly due to a lower proportion not having a bachelor's degree. This is more common in CTE subjects like repair, transportation, manufacturing, and construction, where bachelor's degrees are not always required. CTE teachers in construction, architecture, and engineering technologies typically have bachelor's degrees. It is crucial for CTE teachers to possess technical skills, academic proficiency, pedagogical abilities, and classroom management skills. In 2008, public school teachers providing occupational education expressed a need for professional development in subject content, student discipline, classroom management, and technology use. While 82% of these teachers received professional development on subject content, only 31% found it useful. Perkins IV aimed to improve connections between secondary and vocational education. Perkins IV aimed to improve connections between secondary and postsecondary education through programs of study, dual enrollment, articulation agreements, and Tech Prep. The Perkins Blueprint would require states to fund consortia for establishing articulation agreements to promote smoother transitions for CTE students. The Tech Prep 2+2 model and POS are methods to facilitate secondary to postsecondary transitions. The Tech Prep 2+2 model under Perkins III was not fully successful in improving secondary to postsecondary transitions. Limited evidence showed that Tech Prep students enrolled in college at slightly higher rates than non-Tech Prep students, but overall, the Tech Prep experience did not differ significantly from other CTE programs. Perkins IV aims to enhance the 2+2 model by requiring programs to be carried out under an articulation agreement. Tech Prep was last funded in FY2010. Local education providers must implement elements of at least one POS under the Perkins IV Basic State Grants. Research projects are ongoing to assess the effectiveness of POS in increasing student completion of structured programs following secondary and postsecondary education. The research focused on schools with strong secondary-postsecondary linkages, dual credit options, and completion of both components of POS. Common issues included scheduling, transportation, teacher credentials, credit acceptance, and guidance counseling for secondary students. The NRCCTE published preliminary results from a qualitative analysis of the status of POS implementation in six states that had shown interest in implementing POS successfully. A key challenge was developing relationships between academic and CTE instructors at the secondary level and between secondary and postsecondary instructors to integrate curriculum. The role of linkages between secondary and postsecondary education may receive attention in a reauthorization. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) aims to increase coordination among federal workforce development programs. Perkins IV advocates for stronger ties with WIA through unified planning, stakeholder consultation, and fund consolidation. States can submit a Perkins IV state plan as part of a Section 501 Unified Plan under WIA, allowing for collaboration between various eligible programs and activities. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) aims to increase coordination among federal workforce development programs. Perkins IV activities include Secondary Perkins IV, Postsecondary Perkins IV, Tech-Prep Education, WIA Youth Activities, WIA Adult Activities, WIA Dislocated Workers Activities, Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA), and employment and training component of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The state plan for Perkins IV Basic State Grants must meet Perkins IV requirements, WIA Section 501 requirements, and coordinate with other federal workforce programs. Perkins IV funds can be used for programs authorized by WIA or the Wagner-Peyser Act. Chapters 4 and 5 of subtitle B of Title I of WIA and the Wagner-Peyser Act authorize grant programs for youth, adults, and dislocated workers. The program supported with Perkins IV funding must meet specific requirements and coordinate with Perkins IV-funded services. Perkins IV also allows for activity coordination with WIA. The Perkins IV program supports secondary and postsecondary CTE education providers in assisting individuals to find jobs through referral to the WIA system. States must provide a listing of programs assisted under Perkins to the WIA one-stop service delivery system. Local CTE provider plans must involve local WIB representatives in assessing Perkins-funded programs. The linkages between Perkins and WIA have been criticized for being voluntary or ambiguous. Improving these linkages may be considered during reauthorization of WIA and Perkins IV. The Perkins Blueprint proposes focusing CTE programs on in-demand occupations in high-growth sectors through collaboration with workforce and economic development agencies. Perkins IV emphasizes business and industry collaboration to ensure curriculum relevance and post-education opportunities. States and local recipients must consult with stakeholders, including business representatives, in developing and implementing CTE programs. Funds can be used to support partnerships between business and education. The Perkins Blueprint proposes requiring a private sector matching contribution from business, industry, or labor partners to increase participation in CTE programs. Strong involvement by local business and industry representatives may lead to programs that lack portable skills for employment in other regions or internationally. Funding for states and local education providers is expected to align with the goals of Perkins IV. Funding for Perkins IV Basic State Grants has decreased from $1.18 billion in FY2006 to $1.12 billion in FY2012. Further reductions in appropriations may occur due to the current fiscal environment. States may receive their FY1998 hold harmless grant amount if appropriations decrease, affecting states with increased population or decreased per capita income since FY1998. In FY2012, 16 states were impacted by this change. In FY2012, 16 states (Alaska, the District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Puerto Rico) received their FY1998 grant amounts, while an additional seven states received the adjusted 0.5% minimum. States not receiving a minimum grant may not reflect current demographics in grant amounts, which could worsen if appropriations decline further. The debate in education grant making centers around whether formula or competitive grants are more suitable for policy and program purposes. Formula grants provide stable funding to predetermined entities over time but may be small, while competitive grants promote innovation but may not ensure program sustainability. The debate in education grant making centers around whether formula or competitive grants are more suitable for policy and program purposes. Competitive grants are said to spur innovation, but may not foster program sustainability and are more likely to fund entities with existing capacity. Adding extra funding specifications can reduce traditional advantages and disadvantages of each funding mechanism. Stakeholders, including the Obama Administration, recommend awarding funds competitively to encourage innovation, labor market responsiveness, and increase access to CTE programs for disadvantaged communities and student populations. The debate in education grant making centers around whether formula or competitive grants are more suitable for policy and program purposes. Stakeholders, including the Association for Career and Technical Education (ACTE), recommend distributing funds to local providers by formula to maximize access to CTE programs. Additional funds should be awarded through competitive grants to encourage innovation."
