    "title": "SB 1063",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1197.5 of the Labor Code is amended to prohibit employers from paying employees of one gender less than employees of the opposite gender for similar work, unless justified by factors like seniority or merit systems. The amended Labor Code prohibits gender-based wage differentials unless justified by factors like seniority, merit systems, or bona fide factors unrelated to sex. The factors must be job-related, consistent with business necessity, and account for the entire wage differential. An employer cannot pay employees of a different race or ethnicity less than others for similar work, unless justified by factors like seniority, merit, or production quality. The text discusses factors that justify wage differentials based on quantity or quality of production, education, training, or experience, as long as they are not race- or ethnicity-based and are job-related with a business necessity. The factors must be applied reasonably and account for the entire wage differential. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement administers and enforces the section on wage differentials. Employers violating the law are liable for wages, interest, and liquidated damages to affected employees. Acceptance of full payment approved by the division waives the employee's right to legal action. Every employer must maintain records of wages, job classifications, and employment terms for three years. Employees can file complaints with the division if they believe they are not receiving the wages they are entitled to or if the employer is violating certain provisions. The division will investigate the complaint confidentially and take necessary actions to enforce payment of any unpaid wages. The department or division can file a civil action on behalf of employees to recover unpaid wages and damages, with the employee's consent waiving their cause of action unless the action is dismissed without prejudice within 180 days. An employee can recover unpaid wages, interest, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees in a civil action if they are receiving less than entitled wages. The civil action must be filed within two years, or three years for willful violations, from the cause of action. If an employee recovers amounts due under subdivision (c) and files a complaint under federal law resulting in additional recovery, they must return the lesser amount to the employer. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees for enforcing this section or discussing wages. An employee who faces discharge, discrimination, or retaliation for engaging in certain conduct can seek reinstatement, lost wages reimbursement, and equitable relief through a civil action within one year. Employers are prohibited from paying employees of the opposite sex less for similar work, unless justified by specific factors. The wage differential is based on factors like seniority, merit, production quality/quantity, or bona fide factors not based on sex. Each factor must be applied reasonably. An employer must not pay employees of different races or ethnicities less for similar work unless justified by factors like seniority, merit, or production quality/quantity. Prior salary alone cannot justify wage disparities. The curr_chunk discusses factors that can justify wage differentials based on merit, production quality/quantity, or bona fide factors other than race or ethnicity. The employer must demonstrate that these factors are job-related, consistent with business necessity, and applied reasonably. The curr_chunk explains that factors justifying wage differentials must be applied reasonably and account for the entire difference. Violations result in liability for wages, interest, and liquidated damages. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement enforces this section and may supervise wage payments for violations. Acceptance of full payment waives the employee's right to legal action. Every employer must maintain records of wages, job classifications, and employment terms for three years. Any employee can file a complaint with the division if they believe they are not receiving the wages they are entitled to or if the employer is violating certain provisions. The division will keep the employee's name confidential until the validity of the complaint is established. The division will take necessary actions to ensure that any unpaid wages are paid to the employees. The department or division can file a civil action on behalf of employees to recover unpaid wages and damages, with employee consent waiving their cause of action unless the action is dismissed. Employees can intervene or initiate independent action if the suit is not resolved within 180 days. An employee can recover unpaid wages, interest, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees in a civil action if they are receiving less than entitled wages. The civil action must be initiated within two years, or three years for willful violations, from the cause of action. If an employee recovers amounts due under subdivision (c) and files a complaint under federal law resulting in additional recovery, they must return the lesser amount to the employer. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees for enforcing wage laws or discussing wages with others. Any employee who faces adverse actions for engaging in specified conduct can seek reinstatement, lost wages reimbursement, and equitable relief through a civil action within one year. Section 1199.5 of the Labor Code is amended to penalize individuals or employers with fines or imprisonment for willfully violating certain provisions. Section 1.5 of the bill prohibits unequal wages based on sex, race, or ethnicity and imposes penalties for violations. It also outlines conditions for the bill to become operative. No reimbursement is required by this act under the California Constitution as any costs incurred by local agencies or school districts are due to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
