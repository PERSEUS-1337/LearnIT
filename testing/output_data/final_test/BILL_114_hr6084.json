    "content": "The \"Improving Cancer Treatment Education Act of 2016\" includes provisions for Medicare coverage of comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services and research on cancer symptom management improvement under the NIH. The Congress finds that cancer patients experience side effects and symptoms that can impact their health and quality of life. Timely symptom management and education can help reduce these effects. Studies show that personalized educational interventions for cancer pain management by registered nurses are effective for patients in outpatient and home-based settings. After attending a family caregiver cancer education program, caregivers reported feeling more informed and confident. Patients benefit from educational sessions with oncology nurses before treatment to manage side effects and improve well-being. The Oncology Nursing Society notes that patients and caregivers often lack adequate education before starting treatment due to limited coverage for patient education programs. The Oncology Nursing Society recommends one-on-one educational sessions for cancer patients before treatment to minimize adverse events and maximize well-being. Insufficient Medicare payments and lack of investment in symptom management research contribute to inadequate patient education and poor symptom management. Patients with cancer often do not experience symptoms related to their disease and treatment adequately managed. They deserve comprehensive care, including appropriate treatment and symptom management. Those receiving infused chemotherapy may receive treatment education, but others undergoing different types of cancer care may not. Comprehensive cancer care should include services for nausea and vomiting. The Institute of Medicine emphasizes the importance of managing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, fatigue, depression, and pain in cancer care to improve quality of life. Patients need relief from distressing symptoms, anxiety, and depression, as well as access to information about therapies and side effects. Medicare payment for comprehensive cancer patient treatment education and expanded cancer symptom management research can improve care and quality of life for older individuals with cancer. Medicare will now cover comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services under the Social Security Act to improve care for older individuals with cancer. Medicare will cover comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services, including a one-hour session delivered by a nurse to educate patients and caregivers about care and potential side effects. The education services for cancer patients cover potential symptoms, side-effects, and ways to minimize them. Information is provided in written form about treatment, self-dosing responsibilities, and addressing symptoms. Cultural and linguistic needs are taken into account when delivering the information. The education services for cancer patients include a one-hour patient treatment education session with updated information on treatment matters. The Secretary will consult with relevant organizations to establish standards for these services. The payment and coverage for comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services are amended under the Act. The payment rate is set at 150 percent of the rate for diabetes outpatient self-management training services, without any coinsurance. Coverage for these services is also expanded under the Act. The Act amends payment and coverage for comprehensive cancer patient treatment education services, setting the payment rate at 150 percent of the rate for diabetes outpatient self-management training services. This applies to services furnished on or after the first day of the first calendar year that begins after the date of the enactment of this Act. TITLE II--RESEARCH ON CANCER SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT\n\nSEC. 201. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that cancer survivors face serious side effects and symptoms from their disease and treatment, impacting their health and quality of life. Addressing these effects is crucial in reducing the burden of cancer. Despite advancements in cancer research, efforts to manage symptoms have not kept pace. The National Institutes of Health should continue supporting research in symptom management. The National Institutes of Health should support research on symptom management and the role of nurses in providing interventions. NIH will conduct research on improving cancer symptom management. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will expand research programs on improving cancer symptom management and evaluating nursing interventions. Collaboration with various institutes is encouraged for the administration of these programs."
