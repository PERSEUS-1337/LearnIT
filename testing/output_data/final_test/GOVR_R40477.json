    "content": "Interest in desalination technologies has increased globally and in the United States due to falling costs and the need for drought-proof water supplies. However, adoption is limited by financial, environmental, regulatory, and social factors. Congress is interested in the federal government's role in desalination research, development, and regulation, as well as the potential of desalination in meeting water demands. Desalination processes treat saline waters to produce freshwater and a saltier waste concentrate, with disposal options for the waste concentrate posing challenges for large-scale projects. Desalination technologies can create freshwater from unusable waters, providing a dependable source that is drought-proof. It is also used for treating contaminated water, industrial water, and municipal wastewater, meeting federal standards for drinking water and disposal requirements. Additionally, desalination technologies can produce high-quality industrial process water. Desalination technologies can produce high-quality industrial process water through thermal and membrane methods like distillation and reverse osmosis. Treatment costs have decreased in recent years, making desalination more competitive with other water supply options. Electricity expenses make up a significant portion of operating costs, and fluctuations in electricity prices can impact the overall cost competitiveness of desalination. The drop in electricity costs improves desalination's competitiveness, but costs and uncertainties remain significant challenges for large-scale facilities. Energy intensity raises concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change adaptation. Uncertainties about environmental impacts persist, affecting social acceptance and regulatory processes. Research and full-scale facilities may alleviate concerns, reduce costs, and mitigate environmental impacts. The federal government primarily supports research, development, and select full-scale facilities for desalination. The federal government supports desalination projects through loans and credit assistance. Local governments and water utilities are responsible for planning, building, and operating desalination facilities. Legislative proposals in recent Congresses have discussed federal roles in desalination research and projects. Issues before the 114th Congress include focusing federal research, supporting projects, and providing a regulatory framework. The 113th Congress authorized the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) to support desalination projects. The Water Desalination Act of 1996 authorized the main desalination research program, but funding extensions were not approved by the 113th Congress. The 113th Congress did not extend the authorization of appropriations for desalination research, but provided funding for research and demonstration activities. Several reports since 2000 have aimed to guide U.S. desalination research, including the 2003 Desalination and Water Purification Technology Roadmap and a 2004 report by the National Research Council calling for a strategic national research agenda. The National Research Council (NRC) recommended federal funding for long-term, high-risk desalination research to reduce costs and address environmental impacts in 2008. In 2010, the Water Research Foundation, WateReuse Foundation, and Sandia National Laboratories published a report on implementing the 2003 roadmap for federal desalination research. The report outlined research agendas for membrane and alternative technologies, concentrate management, energy cost reduction, and regulatory compliance. Federal desalination research funding in FY2005, FY2006, and FY2007 totaled $24 million, $24 million, and $10 million respectively, with the Bureau of Reclamation responsible for half or less of the spending. In FY2005, FY2006, and FY2007, federal desalination research funding totaled $24 million, $24 million, and $10 million respectively. Various agencies and departments, including the Bureau of Reclamation, Army, National Science Foundation, and Department of Energy's National Laboratories, were involved in funding. Sandia National Laboratory played a significant role. Funding decreased after FY2006 due to less congressionally directed spending. The level and type of federal support for desalination research is a public policy question influenced by fiscal priorities and views on the government's role in research and water supply. The role of the federal government in desalination research and development is questioned, with a focus on strategic direction and funding. The National Research Council recommended a federal research level of $25 million in 2008, emphasizing the need for targeted research activities. There is a lack of integrated and strategic direction in federal desalination research efforts. The federal government's desalination research and development efforts are facing challenges due to competition between funding for research and construction. Recent data shows a decline in federal desalination spending, with Reclamation's funding decreasing from $11 million in FY2006 to $3 million in FY2015. New avenues of support, such as ARPA-E and the National Science Foundation's Urban Water Engineering Research Center, may offer opportunities for research in this field. Desalination and membrane technologies are increasingly used to meet water supply demands. The U.S. has over 2,000 desalination plants with a total capacity of 1,600 MGD, representing 2.4% of total freshwater withdrawals. Two-thirds of the capacity is for municipal water supply, while industry uses 18%. The use of desalination for saline water and wastewater treatment in the United States significantly increased from 1990 to 2010, with the number of facilities rising from 98 to 324. By 2010, 32 states had municipal desalination facilities, with Florida, California, and Texas leading in installed capacity. Other states like Texas and California are also expanding their desalination plants. The choice of saline source water for treatment varies based on local availability and demand. In the United States, desalination capacity mainly uses brackish sources and river water for industrial and commercial applications. Globally, seawater desalination accounts for 60% of installed capacity, with rapid expansion in regions like the Middle East, Algeria, Spain, and Australia. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates lead in annual production of desalinated water. The majority of desalination capacity is outside of North America, with the Middle East accounting for 65%. The cost of desalination remains a barrier due to high energy requirements, particularly for reverse osmosis processes. Energy intensity for seawater desalination using reverse osmosis is typically 3-7 kWh/m3. The energy intensity of brackish reverse osmosis desalination is typically 0.5-3 kWh/m3, lower than seawater desalination due to the source water's salinity. Uncertainty in electricity prices affects desalinated water costs. Cost-effective reduction of desalination's energy requirements can lower overall costs, achieved through reduced energy needs in reverse osmosis processes. New desalination facilities now use energy close to the minimum required for separation. Energy efficiency improvements in desalination facilities are close to the minimum energy required for saltwater separation. Enhancements to reverse osmosis membranes may not lead to significant improvements. Instead, advancements in pretreatment, facility design, and new technologies are more likely to increase energy efficiency. Non-membrane components and energy recovery technologies are reducing energy use per unit of freshwater produced. Pumps account for over 40% of total energy costs in desalination facilities. Energy efficiency advances in positive displacement pumps have made desalination more cost-effective and less sensitive to electricity price increases. The Affordable Desalination Collaboration combines resources to support research and operate a demonstration plant in California, testing energy-efficient technologies for seawater and brackish desalination. The energy-efficient demonstration facility for desalination has equivalent energy input per unit of freshwater produced as water imports into southern California. Efforts are being made to switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy or waste heat for desalination. Questions arise about desalination's fossil fuel intensity compared to other water supply options, leading to investigations into renewable energy supplies and co-location with power plants to reduce costs. The increasing attention on coupling desalination with renewable energy sources, such as wind power, for water production and storage. The first large-scale photovoltaic-powered seawater desalination facility in Saudi Arabia is a response to declining aquifer levels. Efforts to integrate renewable energy with desalination may help support the growing demand for desalination. Demand for desalination is increasing in countries like India, China, and small islands, leading to interest in combining desalination with renewable energy. Research is focusing on direct solar distillation desalination technologies for smaller-scale production units in solar-abundant remote areas. In the United States, regulations for desalination as a water supply source are still being developed, creating uncertainty for those considering adopting desalination and membrane technologies. Environmental and human health concerns arise when obtaining permits for desalination facilities. A draft study in Brownsville, TX identified up to 26 permits needed for construction and operation. In California, multiple federal, state, and local agencies may be involved in approving a desalination plant. The U.S. Coast Guard consults with the Army Corps of Engineers during the permit process. The Army Corps of Engineers and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration consult on potential hazards and impacts of desalination facilities. Most states handle desalination projects individually, but California is working on statewide guidance for consistency. Some stakeholders find regulatory requirements challenging, while others see the permit process as a barrier to adoption. Desalination facilities require rigorous review and permitting due to their potential impact on public health and the environment. Concerns include the impingement and entrainment of aquatic species, disposal of waste concentrate, and health risks associated with desalinated water as a drinking supply. Boron levels in seawater used for desalination can pose health concerns as it is a significant constituent that may be removed during the process. Boron levels in seawater used for desalination can exceed health guidelines, causing reproductive toxicity in animals and digestive tract irritation. Treatment optimization can remove boron but may increase costs. EPA does not have a maximum contaminant level for boron due to its rare occurrence in drinking water sources. States are encouraged to issue guidance, but most have not done so. EPA sets federal standards for public water supplies. Most U.S. utilities lack clear guidance on boron levels in drinking water for public health protection. The National Research Council recommended developing boron drinking water guidance based on human health effects analysis. Demineralization by desalination processes can raise health concerns, prompting researchers to promote remineralization of desalinated water. Microorganisms unique to seawater and algal toxins are also health concerns. The concern is the potential passage of microorganisms and algal toxins through reverse osmosis membranes in desalination facilities, particularly in areas affected by harmful algal blooms. Managing these facilities to prevent public health threats from algal blooms is an emerging area of interest. Some coastal facilities in the United States may treat estuarine water, which has lower salinity than seawater and contains a mixture of seawater and surface water. Variability in estuarine water quality and contaminants poses challenges for facility operation. The disposal and reuse of desalination's waste concentrate, especially in estuarine water, may complicate compliance with federal drinking water standards. Constraints on inland brackish desalination adoption include uncertainties and waste concentrate disposal costs. Coastal desalination projects have more concentrate management options due to surface water disposal opportunities. EPA manages the disposal of desalination waste concentrate based on volume, characteristics, and cost-effectiveness of alternatives. The disposal options for municipal desalination facilities are largely influenced by proximity, infrastructure, and treatment investments. Surface and sewer discharge are the dominant concentrate disposal methods used in most states. Surface water disposal is permitted based on environmental effects, while deep well injection is primarily used in Florida for municipal concentrate disposal. Limited amounts of concentrate can also be sent through sewer systems with large-volume wastewater treatment facilities. EPA manages the disposal of desalination waste concentrate based on volume, characteristics, and cost-effectiveness of alternatives. Desalination proponents argue that the waste concentrate should be reclassified for easier disposal options, such as land application and evaporation ponds. Federal environmental regulations, administered by the EPA, largely define the regulatory context of concentrate disposal for desalination and membrane technologies. Desalination and membrane technologies are crucial for meeting water supply needs. The expansion of their role depends on cost-effectiveness and environmental concerns. Federal regulations play a key role in concentrate disposal for these technologies. Desalination processes like thermal distillation and reverse osmosis are used to extract salts from seawater or brackish groundwater for municipal and agricultural purposes. Reverse osmosis, which forces salty water through a membrane to trap salt and produce purified water, is the most common method in the U.S., accounting for 96% of desalination capacity. This technology is less energy-intensive than thermal techniques but still more so than other water supply options. Research advances in traditional desalination technologies like reverse osmosis show potential for improving competitiveness and usage. Nanocomposite and nanotube membranes could reduce energy use by 20% and 30%-50% respectively. Chlorine resistant membranes are crucial to combat biofouling and increase membrane resilience. Advancements in chlorine resistant membranes would increase membrane resiliency and operational flexibility, expanding their applications. Distillation, including multi-stage flash, multiple-effect distillation, and solar distillation, separates saline water by heating and condensing purified vapor. Distillation plants require less maintenance and pretreatment compared to reverse osmosis facilities. Solar distillation research aims to improve technology for freshwater separation using solar energy, particularly for supplying remote settlements with scarce power sources. Capacitive Deionization is an innovative desalination process. Capacitive deionization desalinates saline waters by absorbing salts using electrically charged porous electrodes. The technology separates salts from water based on their ionic charges. Flow-through capacitive deionization is promising for energy-efficient desalination of brackish waters. Electrodialysis relies on electrically charged ions in saline water migrating to positive or negative poles in an electrolytic cell, using ion-selective membranes. Forward osmosis is a membrane-based separation process that utilizes osmotic pressure to drive water across a semi-permeable membrane into a concentrated \"draw\" solution. This method can effectively remove salt from water and is less prone to fouling compared to reverse osmosis. The main challenge lies in selecting a suitable draw solute that is either beneficial or harmless to the water supply. Research is being conducted on using a combination of ammonia and carbon dioxide gases or polymers in the draw solution for forward osmosis. The method can be more energy-efficient when combined with industrial processes that produce waste heat. Potential drawbacks include lower freshwater production and increased brine disposal. Freezing processes involve partial freezing of feed water, separating ice crystals from brine, and melting the ice, offering advantages over distillation in terms of energy efficiency. Freezing processes involve partial freezing of feed water, separating ice crystals from brine, and melting the ice. Freezing has advantages over distillation in terms of energy efficiency and minimal corrosion and scale formation issues. It can concentrate waste streams to higher concentrations and has comparable energy requirements to reverse osmosis. Further research is needed before freeze desalination technology becomes widely available. Ion exchange involves resins substituting hydrogen and hydroxide ions for salt ions, commonly used in water softeners and industries for purifying water after reverse osmosis or electrodialysis. Ion exchange is a final treatment method after reverse osmosis or electrodialysis, primarily used for salt removal. The cost lies in regenerating or replacing resins, which need more frequent renewal with higher salt concentrations. However, ion exchange is not commonly used on a large scale for salt removal."
