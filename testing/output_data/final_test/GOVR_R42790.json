    "content": "Veterans' employment outcomes in the civilian sector are a congressional concern. Various programs exist to aid veterans in obtaining civilian jobs, with ongoing debates on program expansion. This report discusses veterans' employment trends and programs, including general programs, those for veterans with disabilities, and competitive grant programs. The report provides an overview of employment programs for veterans, focusing on the largest initiatives and potential policy implications. It references the Bureau of Labor Statistics for data on veterans' employment and unemployment rates, comparing them to nonveterans. Detailed information on each program can be found in CRS reports or other sources mentioned in the report. The report compares employment outcomes of Gulf War Era II (GWII) veterans, veterans from prior service periods, and nonveterans. GWII veterans have a higher unemployment rate compared to other groups, despite constituting less than one-quarter of the veteran labor force. Factors not shown in the data should be considered when interpreting the employment data. GWII veterans in the labor force are younger than nonveterans, with 55% under 35 years old compared to 36%. They also have different educational distributions, with fewer college graduates. The impact of these factors on employment outcomes is unclear. Additionally, 16% of all veterans and 29% of GWII veterans reported service-connected disabilities. Approximately 16% of all veterans and 29% of GWII veterans reported service-connected disabilities. Among veterans, there was little difference in labor force participation rates and unemployment rates between those with and without service-connected disabilities. GWII veterans with service-connected disabilities were less likely to participate in the labor force but had a lower unemployment rate compared to those without disabilities. Recent veterans who have not secured post-service employment are categorized as unemployed and entitled to unemployment insurance. Recent historical data on unemployment rates for GWII veterans, other veterans, and nonveterans show that the average unemployment rate for GWII veterans was 9.8%, for veterans from other periods of service was 6.9%, and for nonveterans was 8.0%. The unemployment rate for GWII veterans is typically higher than that of nonveterans, while the rate for other veterans is lower. Differences in population characteristics may influence these rates, with GWII veterans experiencing more dynamic changes in unemployment compared to other populations. The unemployment rate for GWII veterans is more dynamic than for other populations, likely due to small sample sizes. Despite this, all groups show a similar upward trend early on and a decline later, reflecting broader labor market influences. This report focuses on programs to improve veterans' employment outcomes. The report emphasizes programs available to veterans of active duty, excluding those for military reserve members and their families. It also discusses the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which may be reauthorized. Veteran-targeted programs are grouped into three categories, broadly available to veterans with or without service-connected disabilities. The report focuses on programs available to veterans of active duty, excluding military reserve members and their families. These programs target veterans with service-connected disabilities and include Vocational Rehabilitation, Employment programs, and Competitive grant programs. Eligibility criteria are not detailed but may exclude some veterans based on specific requirements. In 1990, Congress authorized benefits to assist military personnel in transitioning to civilian life, leading to the creation of the Transition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP underwent significant changes in 2012 and 2013 with the introduction of Transition GPS curriculum, providing pre-separation services and counseling on various transition-related topics for separating Armed Forces members. The Transition Assistance Program (TAP) provides guidance on various transition issues for separating Armed Forces members, including employment issues like military skills transfer to civilian occupations, professional certifications, public service opportunities, self-employment, and education assistance. TAP services are available at military installations through the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Labor (DOL), and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Transition Assistance Program (TAP) is conducted by various government departments including DOD, DOL, VA, and DHS. The curriculum was revised in 2012 to create Transition GPS, aligning with the VOW to Hire Heroes Act. This Act made TAP participation mandatory for most separating military personnel and required individualized assessments for civilian employment opportunities. These changes took effect in November 2012. The Transition GPS pilot program, introduced by DOD in 2012, includes a five-day core curriculum at military bases to ensure servicemembers are \"career ready\" upon leaving the military. It covers pre-separation counseling, VA benefits, employment workshops, financial planning, resilient transition, and skills analysis. Servicemembers must develop an individual transition plan and participate in a capstone event to verify career readiness. The Transition GPS program includes a mandatory five-day core curriculum for separating servicemembers, with smaller class sizes for individual attention. The program focuses on achieving career readiness standards and a viable individual transition plan, culminating in a capstone event. Optional tracks for higher education, entrepreneurship, and technical training are also available. The Transition GPS program includes a mandatory five-day core curriculum for separating servicemembers, with optional tracks for higher education, entrepreneurship, and technical training. Implementation of the optional tracks began in 2013 to align military training with civilian credentials and licenses, enabling servicemembers to obtain civilian credentials while enlisted or apply military experience to civilian licensing requirements after discharge. The armed forces have initiatives to increase enlisted personnel's access to civilian credentials as mandated by Section 548 of P.L. 112-81. The program assesses the feasibility of allowing enlisted members of the Armed Forces to obtain civilian credentials for skills needed in military occupational specialties. Five civilian occupational areas were selected for the pilot program: aircraft mechanics, automotive mechanics, health care support, logistics and supply, and truck driving. The Armed Forces are expanding credentialing opportunities for other military specialties based on the pilot program's success. The Army has implemented a credentialing program and Career Skills Program to help translate military training to civilian credentials. State and federal programs are considering military training and experience for occupational licenses. The Veterans Skills to Jobs Act allows federal licensing authorities to consider relevant training received by veterans. The VA administers educational assistance programs for veterans, such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty, providing benefits for 36 months of schooling. Payments cover tuition, fees, supplies, housing, and other costs. The maximum benefits for tuition and fees under the Post-9/11 GI Bill are based on in-state rates for public institutions and $20,235 per academic year for private or foreign institutions. Monthly housing allowances range from $800 to $3,700 depending on location. The Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty provides a maximum benefit of $1,717 per month. Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits are available within 15 years of discharge, while MGIB-AD benefits are available within 10 years. GI Bill benefits do not affect eligibility for need-based Pell Grants. When calculating a student's eligibility for need-based Pell Grants, a veteran who meets Pell Grant criteria may receive both Pell Grants and GI Bill benefits. Educational assistance received under a VA education program is not subject to federal income tax. The VA estimated total FY2015 benefits for the Post-9/11 GI Bill and MGIB-AD at $13.0 billion. Federal employment programs are administered through American Job Centers, where veterans receive priority of service in all Department of Labor programs. The Department of Labor provides priority of service to veterans in American Job Centers, offering job search assistance, case management, and subsidized training. The Gold Card initiative specifically targets post-9/11 veterans, providing intensive employment services and follow-up support. The Jobs for Veterans State Grants program funds Local Veterans Employment Representatives to assist veterans with employment, training, and placement services. The Department of Labor offers priority of service to veterans at American Job Centers, providing job search assistance, case management, and subsidized training. The Jobs for Veterans State Grants program funds Local Veterans Employment Representatives to facilitate employment services and referral to benefits. Disabled Veterans Outreach Program personnel offer intensive employment services to veterans with barriers to employment, with a focus on disabled veterans. President Obama launched a Veterans Employment Center on the VA website in 2014 to assist veterans in job searching and resume building. The federal government provides preference for veterans in obtaining employment, giving them an advantage in the competitive hiring process. Veterans may receive points in the assessment of their applications for federal jobs, depending on their qualifications and service. Veterans applying for federal jobs may receive preference points based on their qualifications. A 5-point preference is given to veterans who served during a war or in specified campaigns, while a 10-point preference is available to veterans with a service-connected disability or who received a Purple Heart. This preference can raise a veteran's score over 100, with the maximum score typically being 100 points. In some cases, applicants are evaluated using a category rating system, where veterans are listed ahead of others based on their qualifications. Veterans' preference in federal hiring prioritizes preference-eligible veterans, with those with service-connected disabilities listed first. Special hiring programs expedite the appointment of qualified veterans to federal positions without competing with the general public. Eligibility criteria include recent separation from the Armed Forces, service in a combat mission, or disability. Executive Order 13518, issued by President Obama in 2009, aimed to enhance veteran recruitment and employment opportunities. The Executive Order 13518 established a Council on Veterans Employment within the executive branch to promote employment opportunities for veterans. It required agencies to develop specific plans and designate offices/officers for this purpose. The Small Business Administration offers programs to assist veterans in developing and managing small businesses, financing, and acquiring federal contracts. The Small Business Administration (SBA) provides management and technical assistance training for veteran-owned small businesses. In FY2014, over 100,000 veterans received training through various SBA partners. The SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development administers programs like Boots to Business to support veteran entrepreneurs. The SBA has waived loan guaranty fees for small business owners, including veterans, under the Boots to Business program and SBAExpress program since October 1, 2013. This initiative aims to increase access to capital for small businesses and support veteran entrepreneurs in starting and growing their businesses. The SBA offers a 50% loan guaranty on loans up to $350,000 for small business owners, including veterans. This is a reduced guaranty compared to the main 7(a) loan program. Veterans also receive a 50% discount on upfront loan guaranty fees for non-SBAExpress loans above $150,000. The SBA plans to extend these fee waivers through FY2016. Additionally, the SBA provides disaster assistance through the Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (MREIDL) with direct loans up to $2 million for small business owners in need. The SBA offers up to $2 million in assistance for small business owners impacted by essential employees being called up to active duty. They also help service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses acquire federal contracts. Employment services are available for veterans with service-connected disabilities through the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment program. The Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) program provides job training and employment services for veterans with service-connected disabilities. Veterans must demonstrate an employment handicap to be eligible for VR&E services, which offer various tracks based on the veteran's employment goals. The VR&E program offers job training and employment services for veterans with service-connected disabilities. Veterans can receive short-term services like resume assistance and job accommodations, while those needing job skills are eligible for education and training benefits. Long-term services, including education and training, are the most-utilized track. In FY2015, mandatory VR&E benefits were estimated at $1.2 billion, with discretionary expenditures at $313 million. DVOP provides formula grants to states for intensive services to veterans with disabilities and multiple barriers to employment. Services include case management, counseling, and job search assistance. In FY2015, JVSG's budget authority was approximately $175 million, funded out of the Employment Security Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. JVSG is part of DOL's program that also funds the LVER program. Transition Assistance Program and Transition GPS provide specialized services for exiting servicemembers with service-connected disabilities. Disabled veterans have special hiring authorities for federal positions. Disabled veterans have special hiring authorities for federal positions, including noncompetitive appointments for those with a disability rating of 30% or more from the VA. Some tax credits were available for businesses hiring veterans eligible for disability compensation. Competitive grants are also available for entities providing services to veterans, such as the HVRP program administered by DOL with goals of assisting veterans in meaningful employment. The HVRP program aims to help veterans find employment and develop a service system for homeless veterans. Grantees offer services like resume assistance, job search help, and job training. They also provide supportive services like transportation and mental health referrals. The program received $38.1 million in FY2015. The TRIO Veterans Upward Bound program helps veterans prepare for postsecondary education with academic instruction and college admissions assistance. The Veterans Upward Bound program provides tutoring, college admissions assistance, and financial aid support for veterans seeking education beyond high school. Eligibility criteria include academic need and low-income status, with a focus on first-generation college students and those at risk of academic failure. In FY2014, $13.7 million of TRIO funding was allocated to Veterans Upward Bound (VUB) projects. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) provided a tax credit for employers hiring qualified veterans, but authorization expired in December 2014. The Department of Labor (DOL) issued guidance in January 2015 allowing state agencies to accept new WOTC applications, pending reauthorization by Congress for 2015. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) provided tax credits for hiring qualified veterans, with different credit amounts based on specific criteria. The authorization for WOTC expired in December 2014, but new applications may be processed if Congress enacts the WOTC for 2015. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) offered tax credits for hiring eligible veterans, including those qualified for disability compensation from the VA and unemployed for six months prior to hire."
