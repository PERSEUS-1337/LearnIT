    "content": "The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) became law on July 15, 2008, after Congress overrode a Presidential veto. The bill freezes physician fees at the June 2008 level until January 2009, with a 1.1% increase in fees in January 2009. In 2010, there will be a 21% reduction in Medicare physician payment levels. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) resulted in a 21% reduction in Medicare physician payment levels, costing $9.4 billion over the 2008-2010 period. The Act includes provisions that will offset costs, reducing deficits by $0.1 billion over the 2008-2013 period and less than $50 million over the 2008-2018 period.Offsets come from reductions in spending for Medicare Advantage program and physician assistance and quality initiative fund. MIPPA also adds preventive services to Medicare coverage and increases payments for mental health services. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) increases Medicare payments for mental health services and outpatient psychiatric services starting in 2014. It also raises the assets tests for the Medicare Savings program, eliminates competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services, and makes changes to low-income programs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Additionally, MIPPA terminates contracts under the Durable Medical Equipment competitive acquisition program and requires re-bidding in 2009. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) requires re-bidding for the first round in 2009 and delays the second round until 2011. It makes changes to Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as other programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Foster Care. Medicare is the health insurance program for individuals aged 65 and over and certain disabled persons. In FY2008, it will cover 44.6 million people at a cost of $459.4 billion. Federal Medicare spending in FY2007 represented 13% of the federal budget and 3% of GDP. Medicare consists of four parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance), Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance), Part C (Medicare Advantage), and Part D (prescription drug benefit). Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program administered by CMS, providing medical services to over 63 million people at a cost of $206.9 billion to the federal government. Each state administers its own version of Medicaid with variability in eligibility, covered services, and reimbursement. Federal Medicaid spending is a large share of mandatory spending and is open-ended. Federal Medicaid spending is open-ended, dependent on state programs. The provision adds \"additional preventive services\" to Medicare coverage, determined by the Secretary based on necessity and recommendations. The Secretary uses a process for national coverage determinations and may assess outcomes and expenditures for these services. The provision expands Medicare coverage to include body mass index measurement and end-of-life planning. It waives the deductible for the initial preventive screening exam and extends the eligibility period to the first year of Part B enrollment. Medicare Part B pays 80% of approved amount for covered services, with exceptions for mental health treatment. The coverage levels increase over the years, reaching 100% in 2014. New prohibitions on marketing activities of Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Plans are established. New prohibitions on marketing activities for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans and Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) have been established. Plans are prohibited from soliciting beneficiaries door-to-door or on the phone, cross-selling non-health related products, providing meals to prospective enrollees, marketing in healthcare delivery areas, and using unlicensed sales agents. The Secretary will establish limitations on other plan marketing activities by November 15, 2008. MA and PDP plans must provide states with information on agent and broker terminations, performance, and licensing. After January 1, 2010, plan type must be included in all plan names. Starting January 1, 2010, MA and PDP plans must include plan type in all plan names, including Medigap policies that supplement Medicare's coverage. The law incorporates minimum standards established by the NAIC and allows for modifications to reflect program changes. The Secretary is required to implement changes in the NAIC model law approved in 2007, with modifications for this Act and GINA. Carriers are prohibited from issuing new Medigap policies that do not meet the revised NAIC model law requirements. Starting June 1, 2010, policy issuers must offer new or revised Medigap policies that meet the requirements of the revised NAIC model law. Certain low-income individuals eligible for Medicare can have their Part B premiums paid for by Medicaid under the Medicare Savings Program. Eligible groups include QMBs, SLMBs, and QI-1s, with specific income and asset criteria. The QI-1 program, part of the Medicare Savings Program, extends authorization through December 2009. Unlike QMB and SLMB programs, QI-1 has federal spending limits and is fully funded by the federal government up to a state's allocation level. States only cover additional individuals to reach their spending limits. The Act extends the allocation of $200 million from January 1, 2008, to September 30, 2008, increasing the amount to $300 million. It also allocates $100 million for October 1, 2008, to December 31, 2008; $350 million for January 1, 2009, to September 30, 2009; and $150 million for October 1, 2009, to December 31, 2009. Low-income individuals eligible for Medicare can have their Part B premiums paid for by Medicaid under the Medicare Savings Program. The Act modifies asset tests for the Medicare Savings Program (MSP) starting January 1, 2010. Individuals can qualify if their resources fall below the assets level for the low-income subsidy program (LIS) for Medicare Part D. Asset levels are updated annually based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and exclude the value of life insurance. The SSA determines low-income subsidy (LIS) eligibility. The SSA is required to determine low-income subsidy (LIS) eligibility for individuals applying at SSA offices. The Commissioner must provide information on LIS and the Medicare Savings Program (MSP), offer an LIS application, transmit data to the state for MSP application, and assist with completing the application. Effective January 2010, outreach requirements for LIS will be extended. The SSA is required to provide assistance in completing applications for the MSP program, including information on how to contact State health insurance assistance programs. Training will be provided to SSA employees involved in receiving LIS applications, with reimbursement for SSA costs. The GAO will conduct a study on the impact of increasing participation in MSP and submit a report by January 1, 2012. Late enrollment penalties apply for individuals without creditable prescription drug coverage who enroll in Part D after 63 days. CMS has waived late enrollment penalties for low-income subsidy recipients enrolling in Part D through 2008. Starting January 2009, penalties are waived for those eligible for the subsidy. Medicaid allows beneficiaries to keep certain assets and still qualify. States can recover Medicaid expenditures from a beneficiary's estate upon their death. Medicaid law since 1993 requires states to recover certain long-term care expenses from the estate. States also have the option to recover other expenses, such as Medicare cost-sharing for dual eligibles. MIPPA prohibits states from recovering Medicare cost-sharing payments for dual eligibles entitled to Medicare Part A and/or Part B and eligible for full Medicaid benefits from their estates. The provision, effective January 1, 2010, excludes certain income and resources for determining eligibility for the Part D low-income subsidy program. It also grants the right to judicial review for those deemed ineligible for the subsidy by the Commissioner of Social Security. Additionally, Medicaid law mandates the development of a simplified application form for Medicare Savings applicants in states that choose to use it. The provision mandates a simplified application form for Medicare Savings applicants in states that opt to use it. The Secretary must translate the form into at least 10 languages by January 1, 2010. Beneficiaries can access Medicare information from various sources, including state health insurance assistance programs (SHIPs). SHIPs offer personalized assistance on Medicare and health insurance topics and receive federal funding. The Secretary is required to transfer $7.5 million to the CMS Program Management Account for FY2009 to make grants to states for SHIPs. The provision allocates funds to states based on the number of low-income individuals and Part D eligible beneficiaries. It also requires the Secretary to provide funding for outreach to Medicare beneficiaries through area agencies on aging and Aging and Disability Resource Centers. The BBA established grant programs under the Aging and Disability Resource Center grant program to provide outreach for Part D benefits and the Medicare Savings Program. The Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program created critical access hospitals and FLEX grants administered by HRSA. Grant funds have limitations on administrative expenses. The grant program was authorized at $35 million from FY2005 through FY2008 and will be expanded under MIPPA to increase mental health services for veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Secretary will award grants to provide mental health care and other health services to veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in rural areas. States with a high percentage of veterans will receive special consideration. The Director of the Office of Rural Health will be consulted when awarding grants. States awarded grants can use the funds for necessary services. The Secretary will award grants to states for mental health and other health services for veterans in rural areas. States can use the funds to reimburse service providers, with a limit of 15% for administrative expenses. An independent evaluation of the grants is required, and a report assessing the impact must be submitted to Congress within a year of the last grant awarded. HRSA can use up to 5% of the total grant amount for administering the grants. The FLEX grant program will be expanded to support CAHs for quality improvement, reporting, and benchmarking with $55 million authorized annually from 2009-2010. A new rural mental health and services grant program will receive $50 million for fiscal years 2009-2010. An additional grant program allows eligible CAHs to transition to skilled nursing or assisted living facilities with a maximum grant of $1 million. Matching state funds are required, and CAHs must surrender their status within 180 days of receiving the grant. Under MIPPA, $5 million is appropriated from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for grants to sole community hospitals (SCHs) for inpatient services. Medicare payments to SCHs are based on the federal per discharge payment amount or the hospital-specific per discharge amount from FY1982, FY1987, or FY1996. Starting in 2009, SCHs can elect payment based on their FY2006 hospital-specific payment amount per discharge, with annual updates. A three-year demonstration project in up to 4 states will test a new model for integrating acute care, extended care, and other health services. The demonstration project aims to integrate acute care, extended care, and essential health services for Rural Hospital Flexibility Program grantees in states with sparse populations. Eligible entities will select up to six counties with low population density to participate. Participating healthcare providers will be reimbursed for providing necessary services. Coordination of the survey and certification process will be tested. The demonstration project will integrate acute care, extended care, and essential health services for Rural Hospital Flexibility Program grantees in states with sparse populations. Participants will revise states' Medicaid payments, and the project will be jointly administered by ORHP in HRSA and CMS. The Secretary will ensure Medicare expenditures do not exceed the baseline and provide necessary funds. $800,000 will be appropriated to ORHP annually for the project. A status report to Congress with initial recommendations is due within two years, and a final report with legislative and administrative recommendations is due within one year after project completion. The Section 508 of MMA provided $900 million for a one-time, three-year geographic reclassification of certain hospitals. MMSEA extended hospital reclassifications until September 30, 2009. Medicare providers must meet health and safety requirements or be accredited by an approved body to receive payments. The provision in the legislation will revoke JCAHO's unique authority to accredit hospitals, which will now be accredited by national accrediting organizations approved by the Secretary. This change will take effect 24 months after enactment and will not affect hospitals currently accredited by JCAHO. Medicare payments for physician services are based on a fee schedule that considers physician work, practice expenses, and malpractice costs. The Medicare physician payment is based on a fee schedule that considers physician work, practice expenses, and malpractice costs. The law specifies a formula for calculating the annual update to the conversion factors, with a 0.5% increase in the physician fee schedule for the first six months of 2008. This provision averts a reduction in the conversion factor and extends the 0.5% increase through the end of 2008. The fee schedule for Medicare physician payment was extended through the end of 2008. The conversion factor will increase by 1.1% in 2009 and revert to previous calculations for 2010 onwards. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 established the PAQI Fund for physician payment and quality improvement initiatives. Modifications in various acts adjusted the availability and spending of funds in the PAQI Fund. The PAQI Fund, established by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, had $4.96 billion removed in 2013-2015 and returned to Medicare Trust Funds. The physician quality reporting system was extended through 2010, with eligible professionals receiving incentive payments for submitting data on quality measures. The provision allows Medicare payment for covered professional services, including qualified audiologists starting in 2009. MedPAC and GAO recommend providing physicians with information on their resource use to help them assess and adjust their practice styles. The provision of MIPPA will establish a physician feedback program to evaluate physicians' efficiency using Medicare claims data. The program aims to improve efficiency, control costs, and provide confidential reports to physicians. The GAO will conduct a study on the program and submit recommendations to Congress by March 1, 2011. The provision requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a plan for a value-based purchasing program under Medicare. Incentives for electronic prescribing in the Medicare program are established, with professionals receiving incentive payments for successful electronic prescribing from 2009 to 2013. The program offers payment incentives for electronic prescribing from 2009 to 2013. Providers with insufficient qualifying services or facing significant hardships may be excluded. The Secretary has the authority to expand the Medical Home Demonstration Project if it improves patient care without increasing Medicare spending or reduces spending without compromising care quality. The project aims to reduce Medicare spending without affecting patient care quality. $100 million will be allocated from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for potential expansion. Changes in the budget-neutrality adjustor for Medicare physician fee schedule reimbursement will start in 2009. Medicare payments for physician services are based on relative value, geographic adjustments, and a national conversion factor. The law temporarily set a floor of 1.00 on geographic work adjustment from January 2004 to June 2008, extending it through December 2009. Starting January 1, 2009, the adjustment in Alaska is raised to 1.5 if the index is lower. From January 1, 2012, payment under the physician fee schedule for advanced diagnostic imaging services requires accreditation by a designated organization. Services include MRI, CT scans, and others specified by the Secretary. The Secretary must designate an accreditation organization to evaluate suppliers of advanced diagnostic imaging services. Criteria must be specific to each imaging modality. A two-year demonstration project will collect data on physician compliance with appropriateness criteria for imaging services. The project may focus on high-expenditure or rapidly growing services. The Secretary will select criteria for clinical appropriateness of advanced diagnostic imaging for a demonstration project. Feedback reports will be provided to participating physicians. Evaluation and recommendations will be submitted to Congress. GAO will conduct a study on accreditation requirements and access to imaging services. Medicare payment provisions for pathology services were extended through December 31, 2009. Reciprocal billing for services provided by a second physician to patients of the first physician was allowed under certain conditions. Medicare pays for mental health services under the physician fee schedule. The provision under the physician fee schedule increases certain mental health services by 5% from July 2008 to December 2009. Anesthesia services can be personally performed or medically directed by an anesthesiologist. Payment rules for physicians' services change from January 1, 2010, with special considerations for teaching anesthesiologists. The payment provision for anesthesia services performed by teaching anesthesiologists requires their presence during critical portions of the procedure and immediate availability for the entire duration. Payment adjustments are also mandated for services by teaching certified registered nurse anesthetists. Annual per beneficiary payment limits are set for outpatient therapy services provided by non-hospital providers, with caps of $1,810 in 2008 for physical therapy and speech language pathology services. The law mandated an exceptions process for medically necessary therapy services until 2009. Medicare's payment system made separate payments for brachytherapy sources, with cost reimbursement extended until July 1, 2008. Additionally, payments for therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals were established for services provided between January 1, 2008, and July 1, 2008. The provision extends cost reimbursement for brachytherapy and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals until January 1, 2010. It establishes a separate definition for outpatient speech-language pathology services and allows speech-language pathologists to bill Part B independently. The provision also includes cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation services as covered medical services, effective January 1, 2010. Additionally, it repeals the requirement for oxygen equipment suppliers to transfer ownership after a 36-month rental period, effective January 1, 2009. Suppliers will retain ownership of equipment after a 36-month rental period starting January 1, 2009. The provision eliminates competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services and reduces the clinical laboratory fee schedule update by 0.5 percentage points annually from 2009 to 2013. Payments for ground ambulance transports from rural areas will increase by 3% and by 2% from other areas from July 1, 2008, to December 31, 2009. Designated rural areas for air ambulance payments will remain the same from December 31, 2006, to December 31, 2008. Small rural hospitals with no more than 100 beds can receive additional Medicare payments if their outpatient prospective payment system payments are less than those under the prior reimbursement system. They will receive 85% of the payment difference in CY2009. SCHs with not more than 100 beds will also receive 85% of the payment difference for covered HOPD services furnished between January 1, 2009, and January 1, 2010. Services provided by critical access hospitals (CAHs) to patients on an outpatient basis are paid 101% of reasonable costs. Clinical laboratory services for non-patients are based on the Medicare fee schedule. Medicare beneficiaries are not responsible for coinsurance or deductibles. Clinical laboratory services for skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients are paid under consolidated billing as part of the SNF-PPS. Starting July 1, 2009, CAHs will be reimbursed for diagnostic laboratory services at 101% of costs, regardless of the location of the service recipient. The provision expands the list of originating sites for payment of telehealth services to include hospital-based renal dialysis centers, skilled nursing facilities, and community health centers, effective January 1, 2009. MedPAC will conduct a study on establishing a Medicare Chronic Care Practice. On June 15, 2009, a Medicare Chronic Care Practice Research Network was proposed to test new care coordination models for chronically ill beneficiaries. Payment limits for federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) would increase by $5 per patient visit in 2010, with subsequent yearly adjustments based on the Medicare economic index. The GAO would study FQHC payment structures for Medicare beneficiaries. A new section would be added to the Public Health Service Act. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish pilot projects for chronic kidney disease to increase awareness, screening, and surveillance. Medicare coverage is expanded to include kidney disease education services for individuals with stage IV chronic kidney disease. The Secretary will select at least 3 states for pilot projects lasting up to five years, with a GAO evaluation to be reported to Congress within 12 months of completion. Funding will be appropriated as necessary. The Secretary will set standards for kidney disease education services, including comprehensive information on managing co-morbidities and options for renal replacement therapy. Individuals are eligible for up to six sessions of education services. The composite rate for dialysis services will increase by 1% from January 1, 2009, to January 1, 2010. Beginning January 1, 2009, the payment rate for dialysis services will be \"site neutral\" with adjustments no longer made to the composite rate for hospital-based facilities. By January 1, 2011, a bundled payment system will be implemented for Medicare renal dialysis services, ensuring payments equal 98% of what would have been made without the system. The bundled payment system for Medicare renal dialysis services includes payments for ESAs, other drugs, diagnostic tests, and services for ESRD treatment. Adjustments are made for case mix, high cost outliers, rural facility costs, and other items as determined by the Secretary. The bundled payments system for Medicare renal dialysis services will be phased-in over four years, fully implemented by January 1, 2014. Providers can elect to be excluded from the phase-in and be paid entirely based on the bundled payment system. Payment amounts will be annually increased by an ESRD market basket increase factor. The demonstration for a bundled case-mix adjusted payment system for ESRD services is repealed. Beginning in January 1, 2012, providers of renal dialysis services and facilities will be subject to quality incentive requirements, facing a reduction of up to 2% for non-compliance. The requirements include measures on anemia management, dialysis adequacy, patient satisfaction, and other areas. A \"total performance score\" will be developed to assess providers, with larger payment reductions for lower scores. Performance information will be made public, displayed in patient areas, and providers will have the opportunity to review it before publication. Medicare will implement a payment system and quality initiatives by March 1, 2013. The DMEPOS Competitive Acquisition Program will replace the fee schedule for durable medical equipment. Contracts for the first round of the Program will be terminated and re-bid in 2009. Damages for delays could be paid from the Part B Trust Fund. Suppliers cannot seek review of terminations. Puerto Rico, negative pressure wound therapy, and complex rehabilitative power wheelchairs will be excluded from the Program. The DMEPOS Competitive Acquisition Program will delay the second round of bidding and expansion to 2011. National mail order items may be implemented after 2010. The Secretary will be prohibited from expanding competitive acquisition into certain areas before 2015. The Inspector General will assess the program through post-award audits. Bidders will be notified if financial documents are missing and allowed to resubmit them. The fee schedule update in 2009 will pay for the program delay. The fee schedule update in 2009 will be reduced by 9.5% for all round 1 items, services, and accessories to pay for the program delay. Updates for 2010 through 2013 will be based on the increase in the consumer price index (CPI) for items and services outside competitive bidding areas. In 2014, the update will be the CPI increase plus 2 percentage points for specific items and services. The provision delays the Secretary's authority to use competitive acquisition program information to adjust payments in non-competitive areas until January 1, 2011. Suppliers must submit accreditation evidence by October 1, 2009, with exemptions possible. Contracted suppliers must disclose subcontractor accreditation status. A competitive acquisition ombudsman will be established within CMS to address supplier complaints and inquiries. The provision establishes a competitive acquisition ombudsman within CMS to address supplier complaints and inquiries. It exempts certain DME and supplies from competitive acquisition when provided by a physician to their own patients or by a hospital during admission or discharge. Suppliers in the program must bid to cover over 50% of all types of diabetic test strips in use. The Secretary will evaluate the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System for negative pressure wound therapy and transfer funds from the Part B Trust Fund to the CMS Program Management Account. Medicare Advantage benchmarks will be adjusted to phase-out the cost of indirect medical education starting in 2010. Starting in 2010, Medicare Advantage benchmarks will adjust to phase-out the cost of indirect medical education. This provision will not apply to plans in the PACE program. Prior to MIPPA, MA coordinated care plans had to meet access requirements by forming networks of providers, while PFFS plans could meet requirements by establishing payment rates or developing contracts with enough providers. The Act requires PFFS plans to have a sufficient number and range of providers to provide covered services. Starting in 2010, PFFS plans must meet access requirements similar to coordinated care plans. Employer-sponsored PFFS plans must establish contracted networks of providers starting in 2011. Non-employer sponsored PFFS plans must establish networks in areas with at least two network-based plans. Starting in 2010, PFFS and MSA plans are required to have a quality improvement program similar to other MA plans. Data collection, reporting, and analysis requirements for PFFS and MSA plans may not exceed those for local PPO plans. MIPPA removes the requirement for separate data collection requirements for MA regional plans. The provision extends the time current Special Needs Plans (SNPs) may restrict enrollment to special needs individuals and extends the moratorium on the Secretary's authority to designate new SNPs until January 1, 2011. Starting January 1, 2010, all new enrollees in a SNP will be required to meet the definition of a special needs individual. Additional requirements are specified for all three types of SNPs: Institutional, Medicaid, and Chronic Care. SNPs must have a contract with the State for Medicaid benefits or arrange for benefits, with non-compliant Medicaid SNPs allowed to participate in 2010 but not expand. Medicaid SNPs must provide descriptions of benefits and cost sharing, while Chronic Care SNPs must meet a revised definition and comply with care management requirements. The Act also mandates the Secretary to convene a panel to determine severe chronic conditions. Medicaid Special Needs Plans (SNPs) are required to collect and report data for care management by January 1, 2010. Compliance with new requirements will be reviewed by the Secretary during financial audits of MA plans. SNPs serving Medicaid beneficiaries cannot charge excessive cost-sharing starting January 1, 2010. The MA Regional Plan Stabilization Fund was initially $10 billion but later reduced to $1.79 billion. Savings from the regional plan bidding process are added to the fund. The MA Regional Plan Stabilization Fund receives savings from the regional plan bidding process. MIPPA reduces initial funding to one dollar and delays expenditures until 2014. Reasonable Cost Contract Plans are MA plans reimbursed by Medicare for actual service costs. MIPPA extends the operating time for these plans until January 1, 2010, even if there are two other MA plans in the same service area. MIPPA modifies enrollment requirements for local or regional plans in the cost plan's service area. GAO and MedPAC are tasked with submitting reports to Congress on various aspects of Medicare coverage and performance measures. The study examines MA costs for Medicare coverage and county-level spending in the original FFS program, including differences by plan type and geographic area. MedPAC must submit a report to Congress by March 31, 2010, with recommendations for improving estimates and payment processes for Medicare Part D plans. Pharmacies must submit \"clean claims\" within a specified number of days to receive timely payment. This requirement excludes mail-order pharmacies and those in long-term care facilities. Clean claims have no defects or lack necessary documentation. Electronic claims are considered received upon transfer, while non-electronic claims are deemed received five days after the postmark date. The \"applicable number of calendar days\" is defined as 14 days for claim submission. The term \"applicable number of calendar days\" is defined as 14 days for electronic claims and 30 days for non-electronic claims. If payment is not issued within this timeframe, interest must be paid to the pharmacy. Exceptions may apply for cases of exigent circumstances. A claim is considered clean if no deficiencies are reported within 10 days of receipt for electronic claims. If a claim is not deemed a clean claim within 10 days for electronic claims or 15 days for non-electronic claims, the PDP sponsor or MA-PD plan must notify the claimant of any defects and request additional information. Failure to notify the claimant within the specified time frame results in the claim being considered clean. If a claim is not paid or contested within the applicable number of days, it is also considered a clean claim and must be paid by the sponsor or plan. For plan years starting on or after January 1, 2010, pharmacies in long-term care facilities must submit claims for reimbursement within 30 to 90 days. Contracts between pharmacies and PDP sponsors or MA-PD plans using drug cost for reimbursement must update the standard every seven days starting January 1, 2009. Barbiturates and benzodiazepines are not required in formularies for prescription drug plans and MA-PD plans. Plans must pay all clean claims electronically by transfer of funds upon request. For prescriptions dispensed on or after January 1, 2013, plans must include benzodiazepines in their formularies. Barbiturates are required for epilepsy, cancer, or chronic mental health disorder. Medicare Part D plans must cover drugs in specific therapeutic categories, including anticonvulsants, antineoplastics, antiretrovirals, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and immunosuppressives to ensure beneficiaries have access to necessary medications. Beginning in 2010, the Secretary will identify categories and classes of drugs for which restricted access could have major clinical consequences and there is a significant need for individuals to have access to multiple drugs within a category, such as cancer treatments. Prescription drug plan sponsors must include all covered Part D drugs in these identified categories and classes. The Secretary may establish exceptions based on scientific evidence and medical standards, including a public notice and comment period. MMA placed restrictions on Medicare Part D data for confidentiality and trade secrets. CMS issued a rule in 2008 allowing the use of Part D data for research and public health functions, which was questioned by some organizations. MIPPA grants CMS the authority to use the data for purposes other than payment. MIPPA grants CMS authority to use and share Medicare Part D data for public health research and Congressional oversight. The data can be used to improve healthcare services and must be made available to support agencies for analysis. The term medically accepted indication refers to FDA-approved uses. The term \"medically accepted indication\" includes FDA-approved uses and other uses supported by citations in specified compendia. CMS has a process for updating the list of compendia, with transparency and conflict of interest considerations. No compendia will be added to the list after January 1, 2010, without a transparent evaluation process. The Secretary must include Medicaid program compendia in the list if they have transparent evaluation processes and conflict of interest policies. PDPs and MA-PDs can determine the medical acceptance of anticancer drugs based on clinical evidence in specified publications. The Secretary can contract with an organization to develop health care quality measures using up to $10 million from Medicare funds. The GAO will monitor the entity's performance and report on its duties and costs. The Secretary has the authority to develop alternative payment methods for clinical trials and studies sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services. This includes preserving scientific validity by masking intervention identities when necessary. Additionally, the Secretary can initiate efforts to address healthcare disparities based on race, ethnicity, and gender. Several reports will be prepared to identify approaches for these efforts. The Secretary will prepare reports identifying approaches for collecting data on health care disparities based on race, ethnicity, and gender for Medicare beneficiaries. Recommendations on reporting quality measures will also be included. Recommendations for improving the identification of disparities will be submitted to Congress every four years. Implementation of these measures will occur within 24 months of enactment. The Secretary will implement approaches for collecting data on health care disparities based on race, ethnicity, and gender for Medicare beneficiaries within 24 months of enactment. A demonstration project will be established within one year to determine effective outreach methods for previously uninsured beneficiaries in at least 10 sites. The project will run for two years and a report will be submitted to Congress within one year of completion. The National Standards on Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) were published in 2000 as guidelines for health care organizations to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services. These standards aim to improve beneficiary access to care, utilization of services, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, patient satisfaction, and health outcomes. The National Standards on Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) were published in 2000 to guide health care organizations in providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services. The HHS Inspector General will report on Medicare providers' compliance with CLAS Standards and the costs associated with language services within two years of enactment. The Department of Health and Human Services will implement changes to improve compliance with CLAS Standards and enforcement. A Medicare Improvement Fund will be established to make improvements for Medicare beneficiaries under Parts A and B. MIPPA allocates funds from the Part A and B Trust Funds for services in FY2014 and fiscal years 2014 through 2017. Additional funds will be provided for carrying out the provisions of this Act. For fiscal years 2009 through 2013, additional funds of $140 million will be transferred from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund to the CMS Program Management Account. The Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP) will require CMS to process all payments through the FPLP by September 30, 2011. States must continue Medicaid benefits for low-income families facing coverage loss due to income changes, known as transitional medical assistance (TMA). TMA requirements have been funded through short-term extensions since 2001. The 1996 welfare reform law allocated $250 million for an abstinence education program over five years. The Education block grant, used for teaching abstinence, has been extended through June 30, 2009. Disproportionate share hospital payments are capped, with Tennessee and Hawaii having zero allotments due to operating under a waiver. Under a Section 1115 research and demonstration waiver, states like Tennessee and Hawaii can waive certain Medicaid provisions to conduct demonstrations promoting Medicaid program objectives. Special disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allotments were given to Tennessee and Hawaii for FY2007 and part of FY2008, with Tennessee receiving $30 million and Hawaii receiving $10 million. Both states were allowed to submit state plan amendments for distributing these payments. The provision extends special DSH allotment arrangements for Tennessee and Hawaii through FY2010, with $30 million for Tennessee and $10 million for Hawaii each year. State Medicaid programs set drug prices, but federal reimbursements are limited to a federal upper limit (FUL) recalculated by CMS to be 250% of the average manufacturer's price. The DRA provisions aim to make AMPs publicly available, with contested FUL formulas currently set at 150% of the least costly therapeutic equivalent price. The rule defining drug pricing terms under Medicaid is on hold pending legal review, while FUL formulas for federal reimbursement of multiple source drugs remain in effect until September 30, 2009. The DRA provisions set FULs at 150% of the least costly therapeutic equivalent price, with AMP prices not publicly available until December 21, 2006. States submit expense reports for federal reimbursement of Medicaid costs, with disputes over FFP heard by the HHS Departmental Appeals Board. The provision establishes new timelines and procedures for the administrative review of disallowances of federal financial participation under Medicaid. States can request a reconsideration of the disallowance by filing an appeal with the Departmental Appeals Board within 60 days. Judicial review is permitted if no motion for reconsideration was filed within the 60-day period. Certain county-operated managed care plans in California serving Medicaid beneficiaries, known as \"county organized health systems\" or \"health insuring organizations\" (HIOs), are exempt from contracting requirements. The exemption for HIOs was grandfathered by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 and extended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 for up to three county-operated HIOs in California. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 provided exemptions for county-operated HIOs in California, allowing enrollment of up to 16% of Medicaid beneficiaries. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families offered supplemental grants to states with high population growth or low historic welfare grants. Grants totaled $800 million over FY1998-FY2001, increasing from $79 million to $319 million annually. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 exempted county-operated HIOs in California, allowing enrollment of up to 16% of Medicaid beneficiaries. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families provided supplemental grants to states with high population growth or low historic welfare grants, totaling $800 million over FY1998-FY2001. Congress froze supplemental grants at $319 million annually from FY2002 to FY2008. The DRA extended supplemental grants through FY2008, with an additional extension through FY2009 at the same funding level. States receive federal reimbursement for foster care and adoption assistance payments based on their FMAP rate under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Title XIX sets the District of Columbia's FMAP at 70% for Medicaid and SCHIP programs, entitling the District to federal reimbursement for foster care and adoption assistance payments at that rate. This change is effective from the first quarter of FY2009. The Secretary must provide research grants for Type I diabetes prevention and treatment, as well as grants for diabetes services among American Indians and Alaskan Natives. Appropriations are set at $150 million per year for FY2004 through FY2009, with evaluations required. MIPPA will provide $150 million per year for FY2010 and FY2011, with new reporting deadlines. Additionally, the Secretary must contract with the IOM for a study on clinical methods within 60 days of enactment. The IOM is contracted to conduct studies on developing clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness research. The purpose is to ensure objectivity, scientific validity, and consistency in guideline development. A report with recommendations for legislation and administrative action is due within 18 months. Expert stakeholders will participate in the studies. The provision appropriates $3 million for FY2009 and FY2010 for stakeholders with expertise in clinical effectiveness research to conduct studies."
