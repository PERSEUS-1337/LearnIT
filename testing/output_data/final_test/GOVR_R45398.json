Natural gas production has risen by 33% since 2008, while crude oil production has jumped by 87%. Both commodities are being exported in growing quantities. Natural gas liquids (NGLs), including ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and pentanes, make up about 4% of the U.S. energy mix and are extracted from natural gas processing or crude oil refining. The U.S. is the largest producer of NGLs in the world. The shale revolution in the U.S. has significantly increased NGL production since 2008, focusing on NGLs like ethane. Ethane is the lightest NGL, challenging to liquefy, and costly to separate, store, and transport due to its molecular makeup. The rise in ethane production in the United States has led to a significant increase in domestic consumption of ethane, with a more than 35% rise between 2010 and 2017. This increase has also caused companies to export ethane due to downward pressure on its price. Propane, the second-simplest NGL hydrocarbon, has a higher boiling point than ethane and is typically stored in canisters at high pressure for transportation as a liquid. Propane, a portable fuel with lower energy requirements for liquefaction compared to ethane, is used in petrochemical plants and can be converted into polypropylene. It is also used for residential and commercial heating, with a highly seasonal demand. Propane production has increased significantly since 2008, with a large percentage derived from oil refining. The low cost of U.S. propane has driven international demand, especially from Asia. Butane, a four-carbon NGL hydrocarbon, has seen a surge in production since 2008, with uses as a fuel additive in gasoline and a petrochemical feedstock. Its production has more than doubled, leading to increased exports. Butane prices are linked to oil prices due to its use in LPG components. Isobutane, a hydrocarbon with four carbon atoms, has different properties than butane due to its molecular structure. It is mainly used in alkylation to produce alkylate for high-octane gasoline. Other uses include as a fuel, refrigerant, and propellant. Isobutane has seen an increase in production but makes up a small percentage of total NGL growth. Pentanes, a unique NGL, are a mixture of hydrocarbons with five or six carbon atoms. They are used in oil refineries for blending fuel, as a petrochemical feedstock, and as a diluent for heavy crude. Production has grown, but not as much as other NGLs, with most exports going to Canada for use as a diluent. The United States is the largest producer of NGLs, with production doubling in 10 years. Infrastructure for processing and transporting NGL products is expanding, impacting market prices and demand. Regions like Texas benefit from existing infrastructure, while other areas face challenges in distribution. The United States is the largest producer of NGLs, with production doubling in 10 years. Infrastructure challenges in areas like the Appalachian region, Kansas, and North Dakota have led to increased costs due to lagging pipeline construction. States like Pennsylvania heavily rely on storage outside their region for NGLs, with production shifting towards the Midwest and Northeast shale formations. The Northeast has seen a significant increase in NGL production, growing by over 2,200% since 2008 to account for 11% of all U.S. NGL production in 2017. The Gulf Coast states still dominate with 54% of total production. Ethane and propane have been driving the growth, making up 70% of all NGLs produced in 2017. Over 90% of U.S. NGL production comes from natural gas processing. Natural gas, composed mainly of methane, can come from natural gas or crude oil wells. Associated natural gas is produced from oil wells, but chemically similar to gas from gas wells. Most wells produce both oil and natural gas. Raw gas from wells contains methane, NGLs, hydrogen sulfide, and water, termed \"wet\" if high in NGLs. In 2016, 33 states had natural gas wells, with over 2 million active wells in the US. Texas had the most wells, followed by Pennsylvania. NGLs are separated from raw gas through fractionation based on boiling point. Impurities are removed before the separation process. Impurities such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, oxygen, helium, and particulate matter must be removed from natural gas before it can be transported in pipelines. Raw gas streams are sent to treatment plants where impurities are removed. The cleaned raw gas mixture is then sent to a natural gas processing plant where NGLs are separated from the gas. The processed gas is then divided into two outlet streams, one mainly consisting of natural gas. The second outlet stream, mainly composed of NGLs, is sent to a fractionator site to separate individual hydrocarbons by increasing the temperature incrementally. The y-grade mix is first sent to a deethanizer to boil out ethane, which is then cooled, condensed, and stored. This process is repeated until all NGLs are separated. The rapid growth of NGL production has outpaced infrastructure development. NGLs require high pressures and low temperatures for transportation. A network of processing plants, fractionation sites, and distribution methods is needed to move NGLs to markets. Increased domestic production has led to a surplus of NGLs, requiring infrastructure for exporting and storage. The majority of NGLs in the United States are transported via pipelines, with over 90% of volume shipped this way in 2017. There are approximately 54,000 miles of documented NGL pipelines in the country, with a significant portion dedicated to downstream products like petrochemicals and fuel mixes, primarily concentrated in Texas. The transportation of NGLs in the United States is mainly done through pipelines, with Texas being a central hub. However, the West Coast and areas west of the Rockies rely on barges and tankers due to a lack of distribution pipelines. With increasing NGL production, companies are facing transportation and storage capacity shortages. Some regions, like the Kansas-Oklahoma area, are overproducing and need to expand storage facilities. Companies also build up inventories in the summer to meet peak demand in the winter. Companies increase storage capabilities in the summer to prepare for winter shipments and to hold short-term supplies for iterative shipping methods like barges and railcars. Propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline can be stored in aboveground tanks, while ethane is stored underground in geological formations like salt caverns for long-term storage. The EIA identified various underground storage facilities for NGLs in regions with suitable geology, such as the South and Southeast. Shale regions like the Northeast rely on aboveground tanks for storage. In 2012, there were 28 large, 20 mid-sized, and 47 smaller storage facilities, with most smaller facilities colocated with aboveground storage or near processing plants and terminals. The United States is the largest producer of NGLs globally, with significant storage facilities in key market hubs like Mont Belvieu, TX, and Conway, KS. The surplus in supply has led to increased NGL exports, while lower prices due to rising production rates have boosted the competitiveness of U.S. petrochemical companies. The lower prices of NGLs in recent years have made them a competitive feedstock for petrochemical companies, especially in the U.S. This price advantage has led to an increase in production and exportation of U.S.-produced petrochemicals, driving the focus of natural gas production to shale formations in the Midwest and Northeast. The shift in natural gas production to shale formations in the Midwest and Northeast has led to increased NGL production. U.S. NGL prices historically fluctuate between the Henry Hub price and Brent price. With U.S. production surpassing domestic demand, companies are looking to world markets for NGLs. Between 2008 and 2017, U.S. NGL exports grew by over 1,200%, with Canada, Japan, and China being the largest recipients. Over 50% of all U.S. exports go to five countries. In contrast, U.S. imports of NGLs have fallen by over 30% in the same time frame. The United States exports significantly more NGLs than it imports, with Canada, Mexico, Norway, Peru, and Sweden being the main sources of imports. These countries account for over 95% of U.S. imports, primarily propane from Canada. NGLs are volatile organic compounds regulated by the EPA under the Clean Air Act due to their contribution to ground-level ozone formation. Emissions of NGLs can occur throughout production, fractionation, processing, and distribution, leading to lost product and air pollution. Studies have linked VOCs to negative health effects and crop damage due to ozone formation. Oil and gas development in rural areas has been linked to exceedances of air quality standards, with NGLs playing a significant role in emissions. Fugitive emissions of NGLs are a challenge in understanding their impact on air quality. EPA's National Emissions Inventory (NEI) tracks VOC emissions from oil and gas production, showing an 80% increase from 2008 to 2014. Atmospheric measurements help estimate NGL emissions, but attributing them to specific sources is challenging. Concentrations of NGLs in the Northern Hemisphere have recently increased after a 30-year decline. Concentrations of individual NGLs in the Northern Hemisphere have been increasing since 2009, with the rate of increase growing. Scientists attribute this to oil and gas production regions in the United States. EPA has established emission standards to limit VOC emissions, including NGLs, from the oil and natural gas sector. Updates to the NSPS rules were proposed in 2018, potentially loosening regulations. In 2018, the EPA proposed updates to NSPS rules in the Ozone Transport Region, aiming to streamline implementation and reduce burdens on energy producers. NGL consumption has increased by almost 20% between 2010 and 2017, driven by a 40% rise in ethane use. Ethane and propane made up nearly 90% of NGL consumption in 2017, with ethane primarily used by petrochemical companies to produce ethylene. The rise in ethane production has led to ethane rejection due to falling profitability. When ethane recovery is not profitable, plants operate in rejection mode, leaving ethane in natural gas streams to be sold as natural gas. There is a limit to how much ethane can be rejected to avoid damaging pipelines. Propane consumption, the second-largest component of NGL consumption, has declined 6% since 2010 and is seasonal, with 45% used for residential and commercial heating. Propane consumption increases in winter for heating needs, with 30% used by petrochemical companies. Demand surged in 2013 due to wet corn crop and polar vortex, leading to price spike. Demand and price have stabilized since then, but overall demand has been decreasing since 2016. Isobutane consumption rose significantly, but only makes up 6% of NGL consumption. Residential and commercial markets are shifting towards natural gas, reducing propane consumption. The NGL market is critical, with various bills introduced in Congress to address infrastructure, production, safety, the environment, and economics. Bills like H.R. 2568 and S. 1075 propose feasibility studies for ethane storage facilities in shale formations. S. 1340 aims to expedite permitting for energy infrastructure projects, while H.R. 5988 focuses on propane container safety. The Energy Information Administration's (EIA) data on NGLs are limited, hindering market transparency and analysis. S. 1972 proposes collecting additional data on propane exports. U.S. production and consumption of NGLs are increasing, with bills addressing infrastructure, taxes, and safety in the energy sector. The production and consumption of NGLs in the United States or exported depends on market conditions, especially prices. Understanding the differences and specificity of each hydrocarbon is crucial for policymakers to grasp the implications of this growing fuel source."
