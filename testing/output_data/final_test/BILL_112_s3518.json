    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fair Trade in Seafood Act\" and includes findings related to seafood trade. Congress finds that 85% of the world's fisheries are overexploited, depleted, or recovering, with government subsidies contributing to the crisis by creating incentives for continued fishing despite declining catches. Some countries provide significant subsidies to their fishing fleets, estimated to be 20% of the world catch value, leading to a global fishing fleet up to 250% larger. Many global fishing fleets are larger than needed for sustainable fishing due to government subsidies for fuel and operational expenses. Developing countries are disproportionately affected by these subsidies, giving an unfair advantage to industrial fleets over United States fishermen. Foreign fisheries subsidies give an advantage to industrial fleets over United States fishermen, reducing costs and increasing competition. Without global leadership to address overfishing subsidies, there is a risk of depleting oceans, impacting the economy and environment. The United States, as a major seafood importer and exporter, has a responsibility to lead trade negotiations on fisheries subsidies. The United States is leading trade negotiations to clarify and improve disciplines on trade-distorting government fisheries subsidies, as mandated by the World Trade Organization. The goal is to strengthen disciplines on subsidies in the fisheries sector to prevent overcapacity and overfishing. Negotiations on fisheries subsidies in the World Trade Organization and the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement aim to address global overfishing and its impact on international trade. Leaders of nine countries involved in the TPPA announced efforts to combat this environmental issue. Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States have reached an agreement on trade and environment challenges in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The agreement includes provisions to enhance environmental protection and establish an institutional framework for implementation. Various proposals are being discussed to reinforce these disciplines. The United States is actively discussing disciplines on government-subsidized fishing as part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and the World Trade Organization negotiations. They prioritize achieving an agreement on fisheries subsidies to address declining catches, especially in developing countries. The United States is ready to explore new negotiating approaches to eliminate harmful fisheries subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity. They are actively discussing disciplines on government-subsidized fishing in the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and the World Trade Organization negotiations. The United States is exploring new negotiating approaches to eliminate harmful fisheries subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity. An agreement would set a historic precedent by showing that international trade can benefit the environment while promoting exports and open markets. The United States aims to eliminate government fisheries subsidies that distort markets and perpetuate unsustainable fishing practices in trade negotiations. The objective is to ensure enforceable commitments under appropriate trade laws. The Act takes effect on the date of enactment and applies to negotiations for a trade agreement involving the elimination or reduction of government fisheries subsidies entered into on or after that date."
