    "content": "A stable, democratic, prosperous Pakistan actively countering Islamist militancy is crucial to U.S. interests. Pakistan's history of democracy is troubled, with power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs. Military regimes have ruled directly for 34 out of 60 years, lacking effective constitutionalism or parliamentary democracy. The country has had five Constitutions, the latest ratified in 1973 and modified several times. The armed forces see themselves as \"saviors of the nation,\" with limited public support, engaging in three seizures of power from civilian-led governments. Pakistan has a history of military regimes seizing power from civilian-led governments, with three outright seizures by Gen. Ayub Khan in 1958, Gen. Zia-ul-Haq in 1977, and Gen. Pervez Musharraf in 1999. Political turmoil has led to the removal of five successive governments by the army. The country's prominent Prime Ministers, including Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto, faced execution and exile, while Nawaz Sharif endured exile and threats of imprisonment. A 2004 survey showed that nearly two-thirds of Pakistanis were unable to define \"democracy,\" reflecting the country's weak political institutional effectiveness and legitimacy. In 2007, Pakistan faced political crises, including the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, leading to further challenges in democratization efforts. The security situation worsened with armed rebellions in provinces and numerous suicide bomb attacks. In 2007, Pakistan faced political crises, including the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, leading to challenges in democratization efforts. In the latter half of 2007, there were at least 44 suicide bomb attacks that killed over 700 people. In 2008, Pakistan experienced more than one suicide bomb attack per week. President Musharraf's governance structure faced strain, leading to his controversial reelection and subsequent resignation from his military commission. Popular opposition to military rule grew due to political crises, including attempts to dismiss the Chief Justice and constitutional questions about Musharraf's presidency. In 2007, President Musharraf suspended the Constitution and assumed emergency powers to maintain his own power amidst deteriorating security circumstances. He dismissed uncooperative Supreme Court justices, jailed opposition figures, and cracked down on independent media outlets. The emergency order was lifted on December 15, 2007, but its impact on meaningful change was mixed. On December 15, Musharraf lifted the emergency order, but analysts saw mixed evidence of meaningful change due to ongoing media curbs and a biased judiciary. Before lifting the order, Musharraf made amendments to the Constitution to prevent challenges to his actions. Elections were held on February 18, 2008, with predictions of violence and rigging in favor of the incumbent PML-Q faction. Despite pre-election bloodshed, the voting day was calm with higher turnout, and fears of rigging were unfounded. In the 2002 election, the PML-Q was swept from power, leading to a ruling parliamentary coalition formed by the PPP and PML-N. The coalition aims to restore the 1973 Constitution, reinstate dismissed judges, and legislate sovereign powers back to Parliament. President Musharraf's efforts to stay in power have alienated modern, secular, and liberal forces in Pakistan. Despite this, he called the election a milestone and vowed to work with the new Parliament to combat terrorism, establish democratic governance, and promote economic growth. The polls were seen as a rejection of Musharraf's rule and a new beginning for a country previously under dictatorship. The election results in Pakistan were a rejection of Musharraf's policies, seen as a chance for democratic governance. Economic anxieties, inflation, and extremism were key factors in the anti-incumbency vote. Musharraf's damaged status and isolation further weakened, posing challenges for U.S. policy makers. Islamist extremism has been a menace in Pakistan post-2001, with radicals potentially seeking power. In 2007, suicide bombings and attacks increased in Pakistan after the elections, leading to many casualties. The National Assembly completed its full term for the first time in history, with a caretaker government appointed by President Musharraf. There were concerns about government efforts to manipulate the election process. Over 13,500 candidates competed for seats in the National Assembly and provincial positions. In preparation for Pakistan's upcoming elections, candidates filed papers to compete for seats in the National Assembly and provincial constituencies. The Election Commission faced challenges in ensuring a fair electoral process amidst concerns of manipulation by the incumbent government. Following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the polls were delayed until February 18, sparking a national debate. Opposition parties debated whether to participate or boycott the elections, with the Bush Administration supporting calls for the polls to proceed as scheduled. Sympathy votes for the PPP were expected following Bhutto's death, influencing Zardari's decision-making. The main opposition parties criticized the incumbent government and accused it of fearing a major loss, but still chose to participate in the polls. As Musharraf's political influence declined, the Musharraf-allied PML-Q party faced challenges in convincing the electorate to give them another five years in power. The U.S. expressed goals for a successful transition to democracy and civilian rule in Pakistan, acknowledging the likelihood of some level of fraud in the upcoming elections. Over $26 million in U.S. aid was allocated to Pakistan. More than $26 million in U.S. aid was allocated to democracy-related programs in Pakistan in FY2007. Voter turnout was solid, with at least 25,000 domestic observers and 500 international observers present during the election. Despite some concerns about the campaign, voting on election day was generally positive. The State Department-contracted group praised the peaceful and smoothly conducted elections in Pakistan, seen as a step forward for democracy. The PPP won the majority of seats in the National Assembly, viewed as a referendum on President Musharraf's rule. The elections contributed to economic stability with a rise in the Karachi Stock Exchange. The PML-N of Nawaz Sharif won 91 National Assembly seats, giving the secular opposition parties a two-thirds majority. The MQM also performed well, winning 25 seats. The PPP secured a majority in Sindh, while PML-N dominated in Punjab. In Punjab, Sharif's PML-N dominated the PML-Q to win half of the provincial assembly seats. Sharif's brother Shabaz is expected to be Chief Minister in a coalition with the PPP in Lahore. In the NWFP, voters rejected the incumbent Islamist coalition and gave a comeback to the ANP. The PPP and ANP agreed to share power, with the ANP holding key positions. The PML-Q seemed strong in Baluchistan. The new National Assembly is wealthier and more secular. The PPP won 31% of national votes. The PML-N won 31% of national votes, up from 27% in 2002, with support from disgruntled former PML-Q supporters in southern Punjab. Despite some seeing the result as suboptimal, a senior Bush Administration official approved, stating that moderate pro-democracy parties are crucial in Pakistan's political system. The elections reflected the voters' will, showing a shift away from traditional religious-based politics. The successful elections in Pakistan indicate a shift away from the traditional feudal-patronage political system. Opposition parties have called for President Musharraf's resignation, but he is willing to work with the new Parliament. There is a potential for a two-thirds opposition majority to reverse changes made during his rule, including parts of the 17th Amendment. A PPP-led government is unlikely to seek Musharraf's impeachment in the near-term. The opposition alliance in Pakistan aims to remove Musharraf through impeachment, but faces challenges in garnering enough votes in the Senate. Negotiations for coalition building resulted in an agreement between PPP and PML-N leaders to share power, with a focus on restoring deposed judges within 30 days of the new government's formation. The leaders of the opposition alliance in Pakistan have promised to implement a \"Charter of Democracy\" to limit the president's powers and remove military influence. The coalition, including the PPP and PML-N, gained support from independent parliamentarians and the JUI-F faction. Fahimda Mirza became Pakistan's first female National Assembly Speaker. Makhdoom Amin Fahim, PPP's initial prime ministerial candidate, faced discord within the party over his candidacy. Some leaders wanted a Punjabi leader instead. PPP Co-Chair Asif Zardari announced Yousaf Raza Gillani as the new prime ministerial candidate from Punjab. Yousaf Raza Gillani, a party stalwart from Punjab, was announced as the prime ministerial candidate by PPP Co-Chair Asif Zardari. Gillani, a former Parliament Speaker, had spent five years in prison and won 264 out of 306 votes to become Pakistan's new Prime Minister. His cabinet includes ministers from PPP, PML-N, ANP, JUI-F, and an independent candidate. Key federal ministers include Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. Asif Zardari, a PPP lawmaker from Multan, has considered himself as the party's prime ministerial candidate but later ruled himself out. Analysts believe he may be grooming himself for the position in the future. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Benazir Bhutto's son and political heir, is currently studying at Oxford University. As Bilawal Bhutto Zardari completes studies at Oxford University, he is set to run the PPP. Zardari, a controversial figure in Pakistan, has faced multiple unresolved corruption and murder charges, including spending time in prison without conviction. Despite legal obstacles, he may be eligible to serve as Prime Minister. Meanwhile, Nawaz Sharif could benefit from Pakistan's political turmoil. Nawaz Sharif could potentially serve as Prime Minister again, but his criminal convictions from 1999 hinder his candidacy. His past ties to Islamist parties and anti-Western rhetoric make him a controversial figure in Washington. The Murree Declaration, where Pakistan's two main political parties agreed to share power, is seen as a new approach to party politics, despite their history of being bitter enemies in the 1990s. The PPP and PML-N have a history of animosity dating back to 1972. Despite currently opposing President Musharraf, analysts doubt the longevity of their alliance due to potential competition and differences in post-election moves. Asif Zardari's gestures towards the MQM party and the praise of Musharraf by the new defense minister have raised concerns among political partners. The new defense minister's praise of Musharraf has raised concerns about the PPP's commitment to anti-Musharraf agenda. Intra-party rumblings in the PPP suggest a potential split led by Sindh party leaders unhappy with the Punjabi-heavy federal cabinet. President Musharraf's state of emergency led to the dismissal of Supreme Court justices who refused to take a new oath, sparking debate on restoring the deposed judges. The new Prime Minister ordered the release of detained judges and planned to reinstate the pre-November 3 Supreme Court, potentially leading to Musharraf's removal. The former Attorney General rejected the plan, stating only a constitutional amendment could reverse Musharraf's actions. Legal experts doubted this claim. Qayyum argues that Musharraf's emergency imposition was unconstitutional, making all actions taken under it invalid. Critics of the new government view their efforts as a revenge-driven farce and advocate for an independent judiciary. The lawyer's movement, sparked by Chief Justice Chaudhry's dismissal in 2007, continues to protest and boycott courts. Nawaz Sharif has accused the U.S. government. The lawyer's movement, led by Aitzaz Ahsan, aims to restore the pre-November 3 judiciary, which has drawn criticism from Nawaz Sharif and accusations of U.S. government callousness. Ahsan's detention prompted U.S. Senators to call for his release, and he is seen as a potential future leader within the PPP. Aitzaz Ahsan, a key figure in the lawyer's movement aiming to restore the pre-November 3 judiciary, was released from detention and called for the judges' release and full restoration. President Musharraf attempted a deal to relinquish his powers in exchange for dropping efforts to restore the deposed judges, showing signs of desperation. Asif Zardari, the PPP's central leader, may not fully support the coalition's agreement to restore the judges. Asif Zardari, the PPP's central leader, may not stand by the coalition's agreement to restore the ousted judges due to holding some responsible for his past imprisonment. The army's role in Pakistan's politics is shifting under Gen. Ashfaq Pervez Kayani's leadership, distancing from Musharraf and limiting involvement in governance and elections. Gen. Ashfaq Pervez Kayani is focused on improving the military's image and has made key appointments, but will only maintain security during elections. The National Command Authority will continue to control Pakistan's nuclear weapons through military channels. Kayani's actions have received praise, but any interference in Parliament's decisions could harm the military's reputation. The 2008 polls in Pakistan restored a democratically elected government, removing coup-related aid sanctions. The U.S. supported moderate forces for political and economic reforms, post-election. Benazir Bhutto's removal was a setback for democratization and U.S. interests. The 2008 polls in Pakistan led to a rejection of President Musharraf's allies, causing disarray in the Bush Administration's long-standing policy. There are pressures to work closely with civilian and military leaders beyond the president, with suspicions of U.S. influence in coalition-building to keep Musharraf in power despite his weakness and lack of public support.

There are pressures to work closely with civilian and military leaders beyond the president, with suspicions of U.S. influence in coalition-building to keep Musharraf in power despite his weakness and lack of public support. The State Department aims for an effective government partner in confronting extremism and achieving political and economic development goals in Pakistan. The 2008 polls in Pakistan resulted in a rejection of President Musharraf's allies, causing disarray in the Bush Administration's policy. The State Department aims for an effective government partner in confronting extremism and achieving development goals in Pakistan. The White House expressed continued support for President Musharraf despite calls for his resignation, leaving decisions on coalition-building and governance to the Pakistanis. By late March, senior Bush Administration officials recognized the importance of a broader array of political figures in Islamabad and vowed to work with all of them. Many Pakistanis are sensitive to U.S. attempts to influence post-election coalition-building negotiations, leading to widespread resentment. Analysts urge the U.S. to respect Pakistani sovereignty and self-determination in determining their political arrangements without foreign interference. The Bush Administration's public statements reflect a willingness to do so. The Bush Administration's public statements show a shift in U.S. policy towards Pakistan, with Deputy Secretary Negroponte offering little defense for Musharraf and leaving his future status to be determined by Pakistan's internal political process. Criticism arose over the timing of Negroponte's visit, with some viewing it as American interference before the new government was fully formed. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice clarified that the visit had been planned beforehand and coincided with the new government's formation. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Senator Joe Biden expressed support for Pakistan's democratic processes after observing the elections. Biden proposed increasing U.S. economic aid to $1.5 billion and adding a yearly \"democracy dividend\" of $1 billion. Biden also emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in military aid to Pakistan. After observing the elections in Pakistan, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Senator Joe Biden supported democratic processes. Biden suggested increasing U.S. economic aid to $1.5 billion with an additional yearly \"democracy dividend\" of $1 billion. Deputy Secretary of State Negroponte highlighted the strong U.S.-Pakistan partnership and commitment to addressing bilateral issues like extremism and economic growth. The U.S. aims to help Pakistan build a secure, prosperous, and free society under the new political dispensation in Islamabad. The United States is navigating a new political landscape in Islamabad, where there is agreement on combating religious extremism but differing views on how to do so. During initial meetings, U.S. officials faced pushback from Nawaz Sharif regarding commitments to fight terrorism. However, President Bush and Pakistani Prime Minister Gillani agreed on the importance of continuing to combat terrorism and extremism, leading to expectations of continued cooperation. A U.S. congressional delegation also left with the impression that Pakistan's new leadership will closely cooperate with the U.S. on counterterrorism efforts. The new Islamabad government is focused on combating terrorism and extremism, with Prime Minister Gillani prioritizing this issue along with addressing poverty and unemployment. Foreign Minister Qureshi stated they do not intend to negotiate with terrorists but believe in political engagement. Pakistan vows to continue its role in the international fight against terrorism and emphasizes the need for economic development in the FATA region. The defeat of Islamists in the elections does not necessarily align with U.S. interests in the region. The ANP-led government in the North West Frontier Province could resist militarized approaches favored by Washington. Prime Minister Gillani plans to open dialogue with militants, while ANP Chief Minister Hoti emphasizes the need to include militants in negotiations. Hoti demands an end to US missile attacks and calls for military action as a last resort. The ANP asserts that the Pakistan army is not involved in the tribal conflict."
