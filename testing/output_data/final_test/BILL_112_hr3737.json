    "content": "The \"Unlocking Lifesaving Treatments for Rare-Diseases Act\" or \"ULTRA\" aims to improve the accelerated approval pathway for fast track products to address the unmet needs of individuals with ultra rare diseases. Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to allow the Secretary to approve certain orphan drugs for rare diseases as fast track products using surrogate endpoints. The Secretary can approve orphan drugs for rare diseases as fast track products using surrogate endpoints based on scientific data supporting their relevance to the disease state and treatment. The Secretary may consider reliable clinical data for surrogate endpoint assessment without requiring historical clinical data if unavailable. This allows for the use of surrogate endpoints in fast-tracking orphan drugs for rare diseases. The Secretary can require clinical data using surrogate endpoints for fast track product approval. Guidance on qualifying surrogate endpoints without clinical data will be issued within a year of the Unlocking Lifesaving Treatments for Rare-Diseases Act. Considerations for qualifying a surrogate endpoint include the unmet need served by the drug. The unmet need served by the drug and the adverse effects of the rare disease or condition on quality and length of life, the low likelihood of clinical data existing to support a surrogate endpoint due to small patient populations and other barriers, and the available basic scientific data on the disease's pathophysiology and mechanism. The Secretary considers scientific information predictive of clinical benefit in the absence of clinical data, including pathophysiology, drug mechanism, disease biology, biomarker assay quality, and treatment data."
