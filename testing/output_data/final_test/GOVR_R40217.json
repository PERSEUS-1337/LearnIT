The funds were designated for various infrastructure projects and environmental protection initiatives. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $2.50 billion for federal land management agencies, including the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service. The appropriations ranged from about a fifth to a third of each agency's regular annual appropriation, with varying percentages for each agency. The law did not specify geographic requirements for fund allocation. The Senate approved a slightly lower total amount compared to the House, with appropriations levels closer to the Senate's original approval. The focus of the report is on the funds enacted for the federal land management agencies. The report compares House and Senate provisions for federal land management agencies, including FS, BLM, FWS, and NPS, which collectively manage 615 million acres for preservation, recreation, and resource development. Each agency has a unique mission, with NPS focusing on parklands and FWS on wildlife refuges for conservation. The FWS, BLM, and FS manage public lands for various uses like conservation, grazing, recreation, and mineral exploration. Funding for these agencies is provided through annual appropriations laws. The economic stimulus legislation (P.L. 111-5) provided emergency funding for FY2009 for federal land management agencies, with monies available until September 30, 2010. The appropriations in the law did not specify different periods of obligation for the land management agencies. The economic stimulus legislation (P.L. 111-5) provided emergency funding for federal land management agencies until September 30, 2010. Agencies are required to start activities and spending funds quickly, with a focus on infrastructure projects that can be completed expeditiously. Recipients must notify the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on how the funds will be spent and submit a general plan for expenditure within 30 days of enactment. The economic stimulus legislation (P.L. 111-5) provided emergency funding for federal land management agencies until September 30, 2010. Agencies must quickly start activities and spending funds on infrastructure projects. Each agency is required to submit a general plan for expenditure within 30 days of enactment. Additionally, agencies can transfer up to 10% of funds to other accounts within the agency with approval from the agency head and notification to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The House-passed version of the economic stimulus legislation allowed for funds to be transferred to \"other appropriate accounts\" for federal land management agencies. It also specified that up to 0.5% of each appropriation could be used for program management and oversight, with a limit of not more than 5% for land management agencies. These provisions were not included in the final enacted measure. The conferees on the bill emphasized that administrative and support costs for activities funded in the Interior title should not exceed 5% of any specific appropriation, unless specified otherwise. Agencies were advised against permanent staff increases and encouraged to use temporary or contract personnel to handle increased workloads. The report discusses appropriations for land management agencies, including funds for construction, resource management, and wildland fire management. The original House-passed version of the legislation included funds for the NPS Centennial Challenge. The economic stimulus law provided funding for construction activities for the four land management agencies, including the National Park System, which has a significant number of physical assets such as bridges, tunnels, historic structures, public buildings, campgrounds, monuments, dams, and water systems. The economic stimulus law allocated $1.53 billion for construction activities for the National Park System, which includes 770 campgrounds, 8,500 monuments and statues, 500 dams, and various other infrastructure assets. The funding was significantly larger than previous years, with construction funds for the last two fiscal years totaling less than $800 million. The economic stimulus law allocated $1.53 billion for construction activities for the National Park System, including $797.8 million in FY2008 and $757.0 million in FY2009. The law provided large increases for construction over regular annual appropriations for FY2009, with specific amounts allocated to BLM, FWS, NPS, and FS. The construction totals and appropriations for each agency were similar to the original Senate-passed version of H.R. 1, with only a $5.0 million difference for FWS construction. The House-passed bill had a higher total amount for construction, but the same level for FS construction. The economic stimulus law allocated $1.53 billion for construction activities for the National Park System, including remediation of abandoned mine sites. The NPS and FS have smaller abandoned mine land programs targeted at remediation on their lands. The bill language provided flexibility in funding allocation, with priority given to projects creating the most jobs in a short period. The economic stimulus law allocated $1.53 billion for construction activities for the National Park System, with priority given to projects creating the most jobs in a short period. The original Senate-passed version of H.R. 1 did not specify purposes for construction funds for DOI agencies, while the House-passed bill identified specific purposes for each agency. The House-passed language for construction funds for DOI agencies differed from the enacted language. Deferred maintenance, a focus of Congress and the Administration, is estimated at $10.17 billion for the NPS in FY2008, with 56% for roads, bridges, and trails, 16% for buildings, and 28% for irrigation and other structures. The NPS backlog has increased from $4.25 billion in FY1999 to $10.17 billion in FY2008. The NPS and other land management agencies have been working to define and quantify maintenance needs, with a focus on backlogged maintenance. The NPS backlog for FY2008 was estimated at $10.17 billion, with a significant portion allocated to roads. The FS and DOI also have maintenance backlogs, with the FS estimating a backlog of $5.15 billion in FY2008. For FY2008, the DOI estimated the FWS backlog at $2.26 billion to $3.32 billion and the BLM backlog at $0.42 billion to $0.52 billion, contributing to a combined backlog of $16.06 billion to $21.09 billion for four agencies. The NPS and other agencies face maintenance backlogs due to funding shortfalls, leading to accelerated deterioration of facilities and increased repair costs. Debate continues on funding levels, use of funds from other programs, and balancing maintenance with acquiring new assets. The economic stimulus law allocated $15.0 million for NPS Historic Preservation Fund for historic preservation projects. The NPS Historic Preservation Fund is allocated for projects at historically black colleges and universities, with a waiver of matching requirements. The projects will be selected competitively, with $15.0 million transferred from the Construction funds for this purpose. P.L. 111-5 provided appropriations to DOI agencies, including $125.0 million to the BLM. The economic stimulus law allocated $436.0 million to DOI resource management accounts, with $125.0 million for BLM, $165.0 million for FWS, and $146.0 million for NPS. These accounts are typically the largest in annual appropriations bills, funding various agency programs and activities. The law did not provide funding for the FS National Forest System. The economic stimulus law allocated funds for maintenance, rehabilitation, and restoration of facilities, property, trails, and lands on BLM land, as well as for remediation of abandoned mines and wells. For FWS, funds were designated for deferred maintenance, construction, and capital improvement projects on national wildlife refuges and national fish hatcheries. NPS specified funds for deferred maintenance of facilities and trails, critical repair, and rehabilitation projects. The law allowed agencies flexibility in allocating funding among activities. The agencies were given flexibility to allocate funding for projects prioritizing job creation and lasting value. Additional BLM activities included deferred maintenance, watershed improvement, and habitat restoration. The Senate-passed bill sought specific appropriations for BLM, FWS, and NPS. The Senate bill allocated $458.0 million for BLM, FWS, and NPS, compared to $436.0 million in a previous law. The House bill allowed for transfers of appropriations to resource management accounts for agencies, including BLM. The BLM, FWS, and NPS accounts have funded various programs for land protection, wildlife conservation, and national park operations. These programs include management of soil, water, air, rangelands, forests, wildlife habitats, and cultural resources. Funding has also been allocated for wildlife and fisheries, recreation, energy development, law enforcement, and maintenance of facilities. The NPS Operation of the National Park System account funds resource stewardship programs, orientation programs for visitors, maintenance of buildings, and law enforcement operations. There is ongoing debate about the adequacy of funding for these programs. In FY2009, there were increases in appropriations for BLM, FWS, and NPS resource management accounts. In FY2009, there were increases in appropriations for BLM, FWS, and NPS resource management accounts. The economic stimulus law included funds for wildland fire management, with $500.0 million for the FS and $15.0 million for the BLM allocated for hazardous fuels reduction. The law emphasized high-priority projects on federal lands for these funds. The FS was encouraged to prioritize projects that create jobs and lasting value for the public. The law allocated $250.0 million for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health protection, and fire hazard mitigation activities on federal lands. Another $250.0 million was designated for cooperative activities on state and private lands, focusing on programs that provide maximum public benefit. The FS had the authority to determine the allocation of funds for state and private activities under P.L. 111-5. Funds in P.L. 111-5 for state and private activities do not require matching or cost-share. $50.0 million of the total $500.0 million in FS fire funding can be used for \"wood-to-energy grants\" to promote biomass utilization for energy production. The appropriations in P.L. 111-5 for Wildland Fire Management were similar to the Senate-passed version of H.R. 1. The House-passed bill did not specifically fund the $15.0 million for BLM. Both the Senate and House versions of H.R. 1 included appropriations for FS Wildland Fire Management, with the Senate bill providing $485.0 million and the House bill providing $850.0 million. $260.0 million in the Senate bill was allocated for work on state and private lands, with $50.0 million available for biomass grants. The remaining $225.0 million was for hazardous fuels reduction and fire hazard mitigation in high-risk areas. The Senate-passed bill provided additional funding for high-risk wildfire areas within the FS wildland fire management funding account. The House-passed bill allowed for $850.0 million to be transferred to state and private forestry assistance programs and federal lands for fuels reduction, forest health, wood-to-energy grants, and rehabilitation and restoration. Wildfire funding has been a significant congressional issue for the past decade, with appropriations tripling after the severe wildfire season in 2000. Funding levels have remained high due to subsequent severe fire seasons, with appropriations totaling $4.46 billion for FY2008 for the FS and BLM/DOI. The FY2008 appropriations for the FS and BLM/DOI totaled $4.46 billion, with $1.19 billion for BLM/DOI and $3.27 billion for the FS. The FY2009 regular appropriation was $2.99 billion, with $859.5 million for DOI and $2.13 billion for FS. Attention has been on rising wildfire suppression costs and the need to reduce fuel levels on federal lands to control fires. Explicit estimates for fuel treatment funding needs have not been provided, but it would take an estimated 77 years to reduce fuels on high-risk federal lands. The economic stimulus law did not include funds for the NPS Centennial Challenge, which matches private contributions with federal funds for projects in parks. The House-passed bill included $100.0 million for the Centennial Challenge program, with at least 50% of the total cost of each project to come from non-federal sources. President George W. Bush proposed the Centennial Challenge program in 2006. The Centennial Challenge program, proposed by President George W. Bush in 2006, aimed to strengthen visitor services and park programs over 10 years in anticipation of the NPS's 100th anniversary in 2016. Recently, on January 13, 2009, the NPS announced $27 million for Centennial Challenge projects and programs in 2009, with $10.5 million in federal contributions and $16.5 million in private donations. This program was part of the Bush Administration's National Park Centennial Initiative, seeking up to $3 billion in new funds for parks over a decade through a public/private joint effort. The Centennial Challenge program proposed establishing a mandatory fund of $100 million annually to match public donations. Congress debated whether to enact this mandatory spending program, with related legislative proposals introduced but not enacted in the 110th Congress. The House-passed version of H.R. 1 provided an appropriation of $100 million in the absence of the mandatory fund. Funding for the Centennial Challenge began in FY2008 with $24.6 million, but no funds were included in the FY2009 appropriations law. Various proposals for financing the fund have been suggested, including appropriations from the Treasury's general fund, fees from commercial activities on federal lands, and revenues from offshore oil and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The Centennial Challenge program relies on private donations for funding, raising concerns about the influence of non-federal funding on national parks. Some believe it has expanded park programs, while others fear commercialization and excessive private influence over park operations."
