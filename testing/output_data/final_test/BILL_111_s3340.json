The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program has been valuable in helping companies reinvest in themselves through process improvement and business growth initiatives, leading to more sales, new markets, and technology adoption. Manufacturing is becoming increasingly important in the construction sector, requiring more efficient and precise practices for construction and renovation in the United States.
