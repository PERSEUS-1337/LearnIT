    "content": "The United States and the European Union have been in a dispute since 1997 over the EU's ban on imports of U.S. poultry treated with certain pathogen reduction treatments (PRTs). The EU prohibits the use of PRTs, claiming its own production and processing rules are more effective in reducing contamination. Despite being approved by the USDA, the EU still refuses to accept poultry treated with PRTs. The EU banned imports of U.S. poultry treated with PRTs in 1997, citing concerns over contamination. The U.S. views this as a trade barrier and has requested WTO consultations. The issue is also being discussed in trade negotiations between the U.S. and EU. The United States and EU are in trade negotiations to establish a free trade area under T-TIP. The EU is the world's second-largest importer of poultry meat, while the US is the second largest exporter. The EU banned US poultry in 1997 due to PRTs, but prior to that, the US was a supplier to the EU. The EU banned US poultry in 1997 due to PRTs, causing the US to lose markets in Europe. The ban, along with the growth of the EU market, resulted in $200-300 million in lost U.S. sales annually. In 2002, the US requested EU approval for four PRTs on poultry for export. After the EU banned US poultry in 1997 due to PRTs, causing significant financial losses, the US requested EU approval for four PRTs on poultry for export. These PRTs, including sodium chlorate and trisodium phosphate, are approved for use in poultry processing by both USDA and FDA. They are applied during the final washing procedure after slaughter to reduce fecal contamination, with specific concentration levels and regulations in place. European opinions on PRT use helped support the US request, with the EFSA stating in 2005 that their use under specified conditions poses no risk to public health. The EFSA stated that the use of four PRTs on poultry carcasses poses no risk to public health, but emphasized the importance of good hygienic practices during processing. Another EFSA opinion highlighted limited effectiveness of peroxyacids and the need for defined conditions of use. In 2008, EFSA found no evidence that these substances cause resistance to PRTs or therapeutic antimicrobials. Additionally, two other scientific committees suggested specific conditions for use. The European Commission issued a joint opinion on low environmental risk associated with residues on poultry carcasses but lacked data for a comprehensive assessment, especially regarding post-processing environmental risk. In December 2008, the EU rejected the U.S. request to approve four PRTs on poultry for export. Proposed EU regulatory changes to allow PRT-treated poultry meat in the EU were rejected in June and December 2008 by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and the EU Agricultural and Fisheries Council, respectively. The EU rejected the US request to approve four PRTs on poultry for export, leading to WTO consultations in January 2009. The outgoing Bush Administration expressed frustration with the EU's decision, citing favorable European scientific opinions on PRTs. The rejected changes included labeling requirements and limitations on PRT use. USTR concluded that further negotiation would not resolve the issue. The U.S. poultry industry supported the WTO filing by the USTR to address the EU's ban on PRTs in poultry processing, citing violations of WTO obligations. The U.S. requested WTO consultations in January 2009, stating that the EU's ban on PRTs for poultry violates WTO agreements. The EU's ban on PRTs for poultry violates WTO obligations, including SPS Article 2.2, Article 5, Article 8, and TBT Agreement Article 2. The U.S. requested WTO consultations in 2009 and later asked for a dispute settlement panel to review the ban. The United States has requested a WTO panel to review the EU's ban on imports of U.S. poultry meat processed with PRTs, citing violations of WTO obligations. The case has been ongoing since 2009, similar to the long-standing U.S.-EU dispute over hormone use in beef. Despite WTO rulings against the EU's hormone ban, the EU continues to enforce it, leading to retaliatory tariffs imposed by the United States. The EU maintains its hormone ban despite a 2009 MOU with the US. The US exports hormone-free beef to the EU, but divergent views on food safety regulations complicate the issue. The EU enforces restrictions on antibiotics and hormones in animal production, while the US takes a different approach. The European Parliament argues that their stricter production and processing rules are more effective in reducing contamination compared to the U.S. use of treatments to compensate for poor sanitary standards. They have invested in reducing pathogen contamination throughout the food chain and believe allowing the use of certain treatments without evidence of safety is not in line with public expectations for food safety and hygiene. The European Parliament emphasizes the importance of maintaining high hygiene standards in food production and distribution to uphold consumer confidence. The 2012 EFSA opinion criticizes the EU's meat inspection procedures for not effectively detecting and controlling Campylobacter and Salmonella in chicken meat. The Codex guidelines released in 2011 address the control of these pathogens in chicken meat. The Codex guidelines released in 2011 cover hazard-based control measures for pathogens in chicken meat, including acidified sodium chlorite and trisodium phosphate. The EU lifted its ban on lactic acid use on beef in 2013, seen as a victory for science-based food processing. The US and EU still have disagreements on veterinary equivalency measures. The U.S. is seeking EU approval for four poultry treatments: peroxyacetic acid, chlorine dioxide, acidified sodium chlorite, and trisodium. This issue is part of trade negotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), with the U.S. poultry industry pushing for better access to the EU market."
