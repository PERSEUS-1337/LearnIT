    "content": "The \"Small Business Tax Fairness Act of 2001\" amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand expense treatment for small businesses. The \"Small Business Tax Fairness Act of 2001\" expands expense treatment for small businesses by amending Section 179(b)(1) to set a $100,000 limit on aggregate costs for any taxable year, with inflation adjustments for years after 2001. Section 179(b)(2) is amended to expand the phase-out of the limitation for taxable years beginning after 2001. The limitation for any taxable year will be reduced by the amount that the cost of section 179 property exceeds $400,000. If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $1,000, it will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000. For taxable years starting after 2001, the dollar amount in subparagraph (A) increases annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment. If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $10,000, it will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10,000. This adjustment applies to the deduction timing under section 179(a) for certain depreciable business assets. The section relating to the election to expense certain depreciable business assets is amended to include the option to elect the preceding taxable year if the property was purchased in that year. Additionally, the definition of \"section 179 property\" now includes tangible property under section 168 and computer software under section 167.
