    "content": "The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA) defines severe forms of trafficking in persons, including sex trafficking and labor trafficking. In cases involving minors, commercial sexual activity is considered sex trafficking even without force, fraud, or coercion. This means that a minor involved in a commercial sex act is considered a victim of sex trafficking by the federal government. The TVPA defines severe forms of trafficking, including sex trafficking involving minors. Minors are considered victims regardless of force or knowledge of age. Federal enforcement targets traffickers and buyers, often prosecuted under various acts. Child prostitution investigation and prosecution are primarily state matters. Child prostitution and human trafficking are outlawed in every state, including sex trafficking of children. Despite federal protection, juvenile victims may be treated as criminals at the state level, leading to their arrest and placement in juvenile detention with serious offenders. This labeling and placement in the criminal justice system can harm these victims further. The criminalization of juvenile trafficking victims is influenced by factors such as state laws on sexual activities and youth, age of consent laws, and cutoff ages for juvenile vs. adult status in the criminal justice system. Awareness of key indicators is crucial for identifying victims who may not self-identify as such. Law enforcement officers may mistakenly charge children as victims of commercial sexual exploitation with crimes like prostitution due to lack of training in victim identification. Some juveniles may enter the justice system despite being recognized as trafficking victims, as officers may place them in detention facilities for safety reasons. Safe facilities for child victims of sex trafficking are limited, leading law enforcement to rely on juvenile justice for security. In 2012, 136 males and 443 females under 18 were arrested for prostitution. Data on sexually trafficked juveniles treated as offenders is lacking, with varying studies on how law enforcement handles prostituted children. Based on NIBRS data from 76 law enforcement agencies in 13 states, a study examined 241 prostitution incidents involving juvenile offenders or victims between 1997 and 2000. Out of these incidents, 229 juveniles were implicated as offenders, with arrests made in about 74% of cases. Juveniles were more likely to be treated as offenders than victims, despite a lower arrest rate compared to adult prostitutes. Researchers noted the data limitations and that the cases predated the TVPA. The TVPA may have influenced states' perceptions and treatment of juveniles involved in commercial sex, as shown in a study categorizing juveniles as victims or delinquents based on police treatment.juveniles were categorized as victims if only the exploiter was arrested or if the charge against the juvenile was not prostitution-related.juveniles were categorized as delinquents if they were the only ones arrested or detained. Based on a study categorizing juveniles as victims or delinquents based on police treatment, 53% were classified as victims, 31% as delinquents, and 16% as both. Cases where juveniles were classified as both were reevaluated, with 69% ultimately being classified as victims. The study found a strong association between how cases came to the police's attention and how juveniles were treated. Cases starting with a police report were more likely to result in juveniles being treated as victims. Factors like age, gender, fear, and appearance also influenced how juveniles were treated. Another study examined police files of 126 youth involved in prostitution between 2000 and 2006. Police often view juveniles involved in prostitution as either victims or offenders. Factors such as law enforcement cooperation, identifying exploiters, no prior criminal record, and local residence influence whether they are seen as victims. Despite being seen as victims, police may still arrest them for criminal charges as a protective measure. Law enforcement's role in identifying victims, investigating cases, and making referrals is crucial in combating commercial sexual exploitation and sex trafficking. Law enforcement plays a crucial role in combating sex trafficking by identifying victims, investigating cases, and making referrals. Experts suggest various options to prevent minor trafficking victims from entering the juvenile justice system, such as training on human trafficking, community partnerships, safe harbor laws, diversion programs, and sealing or expunging records. Some states and localities have implemented law enforcement training on human trafficking awareness and established community partnerships to help trafficked youth avoid the juvenile justice system and receive specialized services. Federal agencies like the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security have also provided guidance on human trafficking victim identification and case investigation. The Department of Justice and Homeland Security have provided guidance to law enforcement on identifying human trafficking indicators. Training programs have been developed for law enforcement at both federal and state levels, with grants available for such training programs. Some states have laws requiring law enforcement personnel to receive training on human trafficking. Some states have laws requiring law enforcement personnel to receive training on human trafficking, with specific criteria outlined in statute. Other states may allow for training without a statutory mandate. The lack of a mandate does not mean training is unavailable, as it can be initiated by state agencies or nonprofit organizations. The DOJ's Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force Initiative funds nationwide task forces composed of federal, state, and local law enforcement, U.S. Attorneys, and victim service providers. The DOJ's Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force Initiative funds task forces that coordinate cases and provide training on human trafficking for law enforcement. Some state criminal justice systems and local law enforcement agencies partner with social service providers to prevent trafficked youth from entering the juvenile justice system. The Dallas Police Department created a unit in 2005 to track high-risk victims and train officers on victim identification. The Letot Center partners with the Dallas Police Department to provide shelter and services to high-risk and trafficked youth, serving 250-300 individuals annually. The Georgia Care Connection was established in 2009 to address the needs of child sex trafficking victims, providing comprehensive assessment, treatment, and aftercare services without arresting victims. Experts emphasize the importance of collaboration among various community elements to address trafficking issues and support victims. There is a need for increased awareness and coordination efforts, with a question on which entity should lead these efforts, whether it be law enforcement or another professional segment. Many individuals interacting with youth are unaware of these crimes and lack the necessary skills to respond effectively. The federal government may question its role in influencing state and local law enforcement's community coordination efforts in identifying and assisting victimized youth, especially in cases of child sex trafficking. Different states may designate various entities, such as law enforcement or social services, to lead anti-trafficking coordination efforts. The federal government considers juveniles involved in commercial sexual activities as victims of trafficking and recommends states adopt \"safe harbor\" laws to prevent prosecution of minor victims for prostitution and provide specialized services. Congress outlined safe harbor in the 2013 TVPA reauthorization by amending the requirements for the Attorney General's model state trafficking statute. The 2013 TVPA reauthorization updated the requirement for the Attorney General to create a model state trafficking statute, including safe harbor provisions for individuals under 18 involved in commercial sexual activities. These provisions aim to treat minors as victims of trafficking, prohibit their prosecution for prostitution offenses, refer them to appropriate services, and eliminate the need to prove fraud, force, or coercion to receive protections. As of August 2013, 18 states had enacted safe harbor statutes to protect minor victims of human trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. However, there is an inconsistency in implementation, as some states still arrest and prosecute juvenile victims. For example, New York, Illinois, and Tennessee have eliminated criminal liability for juveniles under 18 involved in prostitution, but FBI data shows that these states still arrested individuals under 18 for prostitution in 2012. Some suggest that safe harbor laws should go beyond decriminalization and diversion for minors involved in prostitution, including training for officials and interagency information sharing. Arrest data in 2012 show juveniles under 18 being arrested for prostitution, despite not necessarily being prosecuted. This may reflect issues like lack of awareness of victimization or limited services for these victims. Federal policy makers interested in incentivizing states to enact safe harbor laws may consider whether the incentive is for the enactment of such laws or for their full implementation by the states. Diversion or specialty courts, similar to drug courts, may serve as an option to move youth victimized by commercial sexual exploitation away from the traditional juvenile justice system. These courts can provide specific program models to support exploited youth with services and rehabilitation. Diversion courts, like drug courts, offer specialized programs for youth involved in commercial sexual exploitation. These courts follow a model involving offender assessment, judicial interaction, monitoring, supervision, sanctions, incentives, and treatment services tailored to specific populations. Juvenile drug courts and Juvenile Mental Health Courts aim to divert youth from detention facilities to community-based services. Diversion courts for youth involved in commercial sexual exploitation follow a model with scheduled dockets, screenings for trauma and substance abuse, team meetings, and defined success criteria. Some argue that these courts may not be the best option for trafficking victims compared to full decriminalization, while others support their use. Some diversion courts target youth involved in commercial sex, providing victims with shelter and specialty services. These courts, also known as girls courts or human trafficking courts, vary in structure and approach across states and localities. For example, Hawaii Girls Court focuses on at-risk girls and female offenders. Girls Court programs target at-risk girls and female offenders, offering gender-specific services such as open court systems, group sessions for girls and parents, and mental health, education, and employment services. The Hawaii Girls Court focuses on adolescent females who are often victims of abuse, while the Orange County Girls Court aims to help girls in foster care with mental health, substance abuse, and academic issues. The Orange County Girls Court does not specifically target trafficking victims. Harris County (Texas) GIRLS Court focuses on young girls who are victims or at risk of trafficking, diverting them from the traditional juvenile justice system. New York Human Trafficking Intervention Initiative targets cases involving individuals charged with prostitution-related offenses to identify and assist sex trafficking victims. Successful completion of GIRLS Court program results in sealed records to prevent criminal adjudication stigma. The Franklin County Changing Actions to Change Habits (CATCH) Court in Ohio assists human trafficking victims charged with prostitution-related offenses by providing resources such as shelter, healthcare, and education. Successful completion of the two-year program can lead to the dismissal of charges. The program is not specific to juveniles or females. Some diversion programs for trafficking victims measure success beyond recidivism, considering factors like employment, housing, and protection orders. Congress may need to consider if federal incentives can adapt to various program outcomes. States are reevaluating how to treat individuals involved in commercial sexual activities, including juveniles and adults. Some researchers, advocates, and policymakers are exploring options to vacate criminal records of trafficking victims involved in commercial sexual activities. New York was the first state to enact legislation allowing victims to seek to vacate convictions related to prostitution if their participation was a result of being a victim of sex trafficking. Some states are considering vacating and expunging records of trafficking victims, including minors, to provide them with a fresh start. Federal influence may be needed to ensure consistent treatment of trafficking victims across states. Federal law views juveniles involved in prostitution as trafficking victims. Policymakers aim to align state treatment of trafficking victims with federal standards, often using grant funding incentives. Programs enhancing law enforcement awareness and treatment of juvenile sex trafficking victims are of interest. Discussions focus on identifying and supporting juvenile victims of commercial sex. The focus is on federal incentives to support law enforcement in treating trafficked youth as victims. The TVPA authorizes grants for identifying and assisting minor victims of sex trafficking and prosecuting trafficking cases. These programs aim to combat sex trafficking of minors and support trafficking investigations with a law enforcement focus. The Department of Justice Grants for Victim Services is a law enforcement-centered program aimed at combating sex trafficking of minors in the United States. In FY2014, the program received $14.3 million in appropriations and specifically targeted U.S. citizen and lawful permanent resident minor victims of trafficking. DOJ may award grants to state and local law enforcement for anti-trafficking programs, including investigating and prosecuting trafficking offenses, training personnel to identify victims, prioritizing cases involving minor victims, educating offenders, and training law enforcement to work with trafficking victims. Grants may also be awarded for law enforcement training programs to assist in identifying and protecting trafficking victims. DOJ and HHS are to establish a grant program to assist U.S. citizens and LPRs who are victims of severe forms of trafficking, consulting with NGOs to determine the most beneficial assistance. Grants may be awarded to states, tribes, local governments, and NGOs to facilitate communication and coordination between assistance providers. DOJ and HHS may provide block grants to combat sex trafficking of children in regions with significant criminal activity. Grants can be used for residential care, social services, case management, and legal services. Federal government funds grant programs to assist states' juvenile justice programs. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) administers grant programs for states' juvenile justice. Congress funds various grants under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) for different purposes. Some policymakers may explore modifying existing grant programs to help trafficking victims avoid juvenile justice systems. The State Formula Grants program under the JJDPA provides funding for various purposes, including community-based alternatives to incarceration, treatment for juvenile offenders who have been victims of abuse, mentoring programs, and mental health services. States must adhere to four core mandates to receive funding. The JABG program provided grants to states and local governments to strengthen juvenile justice systems and hold juveniles accountable for their actions. Funding could be used for purposes such as establishing drug and gun courts, risk assessment programs, and comprehensive services for juvenile offenders. The JABG program funds intervention programs and comprehensive services for juvenile offenders. JAG funds support state and local law enforcement with personnel, equipment, training, and other resources for crime control efforts. Grants are targeted towards prosecution, court programs, corrections, community corrections, and crime victim programs. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) primarily addresses violent crimes like intimate partner violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking through grant programs to various entities. The most recent VAWA reauthorization clarified that victim services include assistance to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who are also victims of trafficking. The VAWA reauthorization expanded grant programs to serve victims of trafficking, including child victims of sex trafficking. The CHOOSE Children & Youth program was established to enhance the safety of youth and children who are victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or sex trafficking. The Grants to Indian Tribal Governments Program was also expanded to serve victims of trafficking and assist tribal governments in developing responses. The program aims to assist tribal governments in developing effective plans to respond to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, sex trafficking, and stalking. Purpose areas include improving services for victims, strengthening tribal criminal justice systems, creating community education campaigns, addressing the needs of children who witness violence, providing supervised visitation programs, transitional housing assistance, and legal aid. Grant programs now also serve victims of trafficking, in addition to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) was established by the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA, P.L. 98-473) to provide funding for state victim compensation and assistance programs, supporting various victim-related activities such as discretionary grants for private organizations, the Federal Victim Notification System, funding for victim assistance staff, the Children's Justice Act Program, and more. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) was established by the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to provide funding for state victim compensation and assistance programs. The Administration's FY2015 budget proposed raising the CVF cap to fund initiatives such as victims of trafficking grants focused on domestic victims of human trafficking. Policymakers may consider expanding the uses of the CVF to support victim-centered grant programs outside of those authorized by VOCA."
