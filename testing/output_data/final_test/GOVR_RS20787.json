    "content": "The U.S. military has a long history of modernization efforts, with a recent surge during the \"Reagan build-up\" in the 1980s. Key weapons developed during this time, such as the M1 Abrams tank and Apache attack helicopter, played crucial roles in Cold War and Gulf War successes. However, post-Cold War downsizing led to decreased equipment purchases and deferred development of new weapons, with some exceptions like R&D for a howitzer. The U.S. military focused on modernization through upgrading existing equipment and developing new technologies, particularly in information technology. The Army launched Army Force XXI in the 1990s, digitizing the battlefield for network-centric warfare. This initiative connected weapons systems, enhancing situational awareness and decision-making speed. One mechanized division at Fort Hood, TX was equipped in 2001 and tested in Iraq in 2003. The Army at Fort Hood, TX was equipped and tested in Iraq in 2003. The changing battlefield required readiness for operations short of war, leading to challenges in troop coverage and funding diversions. The need for rapidly projecting heavy forces was highlighted during Desert Shield/Desert Storm in 1990-91. In 1999, concerns were raised about the heaviness of an Army task force in Albania for potential action in Kosovo. The Army prioritized transforming into a force that could rapidly deploy and be lethal, leading to the creation of the Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) in 1999. They are also developing the Future Combat System (FCS) for mobile formations with advanced lethality and survivability. Legacy weapons systems like the M1 and M2 are being maintained and upgraded until the FCS is fielded. The Army is focused on maintaining and upgrading legacy weapons systems like the M1 and M2 while transitioning towards the transformed Objective Force. The new Army Chief of Staff emphasized the need for transformation during the Global War on Terrorism, leading to a reorganization of combat brigade modules and an increase in soldier end strength. Additionally, the Army is fielding the Stryker Brigade Combat Team for enhanced strategic and operational mobility. The Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) is an infantry brigade with armored mobility designed for mid-intensity battlefields. It consists of about 3,500 soldiers and can be airlifted inter-theater within 96 hours. The SBCT includes reconnaissance and intelligence capabilities, as well as advanced command, control, and communications systems. The Army selected the Light Armored Vehicle III (LAV III), now called Strykers, for the SBCT under a $4 billion contract. The Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) consists of 2,131 Strykers with two vehicle variants - an infantry carrier and a mobile gun system. The vehicles can travel at 62 mph on flat surfaces, convert to 8-wheel drive off-road, and self-recover with a winch. The Brigade also plans to procure the Joint Lightweight 155 mm Howitzer for field artillery, with an estimated cost of $1.1 billion. Additionally, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Army are working on 25 critical technologies for new systems to be fielded by 2008 and achieve initial operating capability by 2010. The Future Combat System (FCS) is a key component of the Army's plans, expected to be as transportable and mobile as the Stryker, with advanced technologies like robotics and electric guns. Boeing Company and Science Applications International Corp. are the lead system integrators, with a budget of $20 billion allocated for development. Future Force units will incorporate information technology advancements to respond to various operational requirements. The Army's current force must be prepared for all types of conflict, from stability operations to high-intensity battles. Programs to replace and upgrade older equipment, such as trucks, Abrams tanks, and Bradley fighting vehicles, are ongoing. The force includes M1A2 SEP and M1A1D tanks, as well as M2A3 and M2A2ODS Bradley's, aiding in the transition to a digitized force. Modernization is crucial, but some programs were sacrificed to prioritize transformation goals. The 107th and 108th Congresses supported Army modernization and transformation initiatives, including the purchase of Stryker over converting the M113A3 APC. The 108th Congress's future support will depend on evaluations of key issues. All Services are under pressure to adapt to technological advances and post-Cold War challenges. The Army faces opportunities and challenges from technological advances, new mission requirements, and threats from potential enemies. There are questions about whether current transformation plans will meet future military force capabilities. The Army must consider its approach to transformation, including the balance between power projection capabilities and reliance on airlift assets. The Army needs to balance resources between modernizing current forces and developing the Future Force. Aging M1 tank fleet and support vehicles require modernization to prevent further degradation. Deciding on resource allocation is complex due to the large number and diverse types of vehicles and weapons systems in the Army. The Navy, with a fleet of about 315 ships, may have an easier time determining investment needs. The Army's plan for transformation involves managing a fleet of about 315 ships and developing an aggregate portrayal of fleet capitalization status. The interim Stryker force is low risk for meeting technology objectives, with deliveries supporting the fielding of 6 SBCTs by May 2010. Plans for the Future Force involve higher risk in technology and time, with potential integration challenges for specific FCS technologies. The Army's plan for transformation involves fielding the first unit of a system of 18 systems by 2010, facing technical and schedule challenges. Concerns exist about the affordability of the plan and the ability to finance all elements while meeting non-transformation priorities. The Army's transformation plan includes equipping 6 brigades with LAV III's at a cost of $9 billion through FY2032. Additional funding of $10 billion annually is needed for R&D and procurement. Congress must decide on funding levels for Army modernization, potentially impacting other DoD programs or deployments. During the FY2003 budget cycle, DoD planned to cut non-\"transformational\" acquisition programs like the Army's Crusader Howitzer. Congress supported this decision with the condition that Crusader expertise be integrated into the FCS program. The 108th Congress may enforce DoD's commitment to maintain fire support during FCS development. The Army debated whether to use tracked or wheeled armored vehicles for the Interim Force. Traditionally, the Army preferred tracks for combat vehicles due to their low ground pressure and traction. The Army selected the wheeled LAV III from General Motors, named Stryker, for its combat vehicles. Critics argue for a reversal of the decision, but the Army defends it. The question of whether the FCS will be based on wheels, tracks, or a combination remains open. DoD has raised questions about the number and stationing of SBCT's. Units five and six may not be funded unless they can be \"spiral developed\" into a more transformational force.

Funding for all 6 SBCT's will now be requested, potentially leading to political complications in stationing SBCT's in Hawaii and Alaska. The 108th Congress may play a crucial role in deciding the fate of the proposed SBCT Force."
