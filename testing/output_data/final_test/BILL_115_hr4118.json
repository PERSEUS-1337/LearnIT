    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act\" and extends the publicly traded partnership ownership structure to energy power generation projects, transportation fuels, and related energy activities. The \"Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to include income and gains derived from minerals, natural resources, renewable energy, and electric power generation exclusively utilizing certain resources. The \"Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to include income and gains derived from minerals, natural resources, renewable energy, and electric power generation. This includes the sale of electric power, capacity, resource adequacy, demand response capabilities, or ancillary services produced from energy storage property. The \"Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to include income and gains derived from energy storage property that stores energy for later conversion to electricity or direct use for heating/cooling without the need for electricity. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of combined heat and power, renewable thermal energy, and waste heat to power in relation to the generation, storage, or distribution of thermal energy using specific resources or energy property. The curr_chunk defines recoverable waste energy, renewable fuel infrastructure, and renewable fuels in relation to the production, storage, or transportation of specific fuels or renewable energy sources. The curr_chunk discusses the production, storage, or transportation of fuel derived from captured carbon dioxide, which must achieve a reduction of at least 60 percent. The curr_chunk specifies a 60 percent reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for fuel production, excluding those using carbon dioxide from subsurface springs. It also includes provisions for the production, storage, or transportation of qualifying renewable chemicals. The curr_chunk discusses various energy-efficient initiatives, including the audit and installation of energy-efficient building property and gasification with sequestration projects meeting specific requirements. The curr_chunk discusses carbon capture and sequestration for power generation facilities, including the storage of electric power produced from such facilities. The curr_chunk discusses the sale of goods or services from qualified facilities, including power generation units, that dispose of or utilize qualified carbon dioxide emissions. The curr_chunk defines a qualifying renewable chemical as any renewable chemical produced by the taxpayer in the United States or its territories, as per the Agriculture Act of 2014. The curr_chunk specifies that a qualifying renewable chemical must be produced in the United States, have a biobased content of 95% or higher, and be used for the production of chemical products or as chemicals or polymers. The curr_chunk lists specific chemicals and products that qualify as renewable chemicals, excluding those used for food, feed, or fuel production. The curr_chunk lists various renewable chemicals such as malonate, DDDA, ethyl acetate, farnesene, glucaric acid, HMD, isoprene, itaconic acid, PLA, PEF, PET, polyols, and 1,3-propanediol. The curr_chunk discusses the biobased content percentage of renewable chemicals listed by the Secretary, including various chemicals like succinic acid, terephthalic acid, and vegetable fatty acid derived from ethyl esters. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a program to list renewable chemicals based on their biobased content percentage, as determined by ASTM testing. Additionally, there will be provisions for the disposal and utilization of captured carbon dioxide. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a program to list renewable chemicals based on their biobased content percentage, as determined by ASTM testing. Provisions for the disposal and utilization of captured carbon dioxide include secure geological storage, tertiary injectant use in qualified projects, fixation through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, and chemical conversion to a material. The amendments made by this section allow for the secure storage, utilization, or conversion of captured carbon dioxide from man-made sources to strengthen the competitive market. The effective date for these changes is the enactment of the Act, applicable in taxable years ending after that date."
