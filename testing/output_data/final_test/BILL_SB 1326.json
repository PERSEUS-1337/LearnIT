    "title": "SB 1326",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The 2015 Realignment Legislation, also known as the Justice Reinvestment Act, aims to reduce recidivism among criminal offenders by providing adequate funding to local governments. California must reinvest its resources in community-based corrections programs and evidence-based practices to improve public safety outcomes. Realigning low-level felony offenders to community-based corrections programs can improve public safety outcomes and aid in their reintegration. However, local governments lack resources for adequate bed space, evidence-based programs, and treatment options. Additional funding is needed to meet the needs of offenders shifted as a result of the 2011 Realignment Legislation. The 2011 Realignment Legislation aims to manage criminal justice populations more cost-effectively, reinvesting savings in evidence-based strategies for public safety. The Legislature intends to use state savings to provide local governments with flexibility and funding to manage new offenders in the best interest of public safety. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation published a document in April 2012 detailing their plan to implement the 2011 Realignment Legislation and save billions of dollars. A report in January 2016 indicated that the Governor's proposed budget for the department for the 2016\u201317 fiscal year is $1.3 billion less than the pre-Realignment forecast. Savings should be allocated to counties to mitigate costs. Savings from the 2011 Realignment Legislation should be allocated to counties to mitigate public safety costs. Chapter 6.4 establishes the Realignment Reinvestment Fund for realigned offenders, funded through the State Treasury for specific purposes. The Director of Finance calculates net savings from the 2011 Realignment Legislation for the previous and current fiscal years. The Director of Finance calculates net savings from the 2011 Realignment Legislation using the same methodology as the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's budget calculations for 2016-17. This includes adjustments for employee compensation, retirement contributions, Proposition 98 funding, and the activation of the California Health Care facility. The Controller transfers funds from the General Fund to the Realignment Reinvestment Fund based on net savings estimates for each fiscal year. The Controller annually allocates funds from the Realignment Reinvestment Fund to counties and city and counties based on the average daily population of realigned offenders. Each county establishes a Realignment Reinvestment Services Account to receive these funds for implementing the chapter. Each county's local Community Corrections Partnership recommends a comprehensive community-based corrections plan to the county board of supervisors to improve outcomes of the 2011 Realignment Legislation. The plan may include mental health programs, substance abuse programs, transitional housing, job placement, improved supervision strategies, community-based punishment programs, increased law enforcement staffing, county jail operations, assessment and prosecution of offenders, and supervision for certain offenders. The supplemental community-based corrections plan for realigned offenders includes an assessment of existing services, identification of high-risk areas, and a local action strategy for swift and graduated responses to crime. The supplemental community-based corrections plan for realigned offenders includes a schedule of proposed programs with funding amounts, an accounting of new crimes by offenders, and an evaluation of existing services and gaps. Programs must be evidence-based, coordinate county and city actions, and provide data for measuring success. The plan for funding programs for realigned offenders must include specific objectives, outcome measures, and accounting for all participants. Outcome measures should include arrest rates, completion of probation and community service, and costs of the program. To assess program effectiveness, counties must report annually on funded programs and outcomes to the Board of State and Community Corrections. The reports should include quantification of per capita costs and use specified program outcome criteria. The Board of State and Community Corrections compiles local reports on program expenditures and outcomes annually by March 15th, as required by Section 9795 of the Government Code, to report to the Governor and Legislature. The supplemental community-based corrections plan must be approved by an executive committee of each county's Community Corrections Partnership, which includes key officials. If a plan has been previously approved, it must be reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary. The supplemental community-based corrections plan must be approved by the county board of supervisors with a four-fifths vote, or it will go back to the Community Corrections Partnership for further consideration. The plan must be submitted to the Board of State and Community Corrections by October 15 each year for funding allocation by the Controller. Funds allocated under subdivision (c) must be used by June 30 of the following fiscal year. Failure to comply requires the unspent money to be returned to the Controller for deposit in the Realignment Reinvestment Fund. The Director of Finance, in consultation with the Legislative Analyst, develops an estimate of cost avoidances by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation due to the 2011 Realignment Legislation. The report is submitted to relevant legislative committees for consideration of appropriating funds based on the cost avoidances reported. Moneys from a Realignment Reinvestment Services Account must be used for services in the county's supplemental community-based corrections plan, not for law enforcement. Recipient entities cannot use the funds for administrative overhead costs exceeding 1 percent of their allocation. The recipient entity can only charge administrative overhead costs up to 1 percent of its Realignment Reinvestment Services Account allocation for capital or construction projects not directly supporting programs in the community-based corrections plan. The Realignment Reinvestment Services Account funds must be used exclusively as required by the chapter and cannot be mixed with other funds, except for transfers to the general fund for necessary appropriations. If state mandates incur costs, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts. Section 8585.05 of the Government Code is amended. Section 8585.05 of the Government Code is amended to define key terms for the Office of Emergency Services, including \"Agency,\" \"California Emergency Management Agency,\" and \"Director.\""
