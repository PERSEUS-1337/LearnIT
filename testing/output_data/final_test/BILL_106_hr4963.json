    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Democratic Rights for Union Members Act of 2000\" and references amendments to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. The purpose of the Act is outlined in Section 2. The Congress finds that the labor movement's strength lies in democracy, and unions must have true democracy to fulfill their functions in society. Union officers should prioritize members' wishes, and authoritarian control goes against labor movement principles. The amendments aim to enhance the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act to safeguard democratic processes and rights of union members. The amendments aim to ensure labor organizations express members' will and empower union members to govern themselves. SEC. 3. INFORMATION. In General, Section 105 (29 U.S.C. 415) is amended to require labor organizations to provide information to new members within 90 days of joining and periodically to all members to promote understanding of their rights. Enforcement under Section 102 (29 U.S.C. 412) allows for investigation of complaints by the Secretary of Labor regarding violations of Section 105. The Secretary will investigate complaints and if probable cause is found for a violation that has not been remedied, the Secretary will bring a civil action in a district court for appropriate relief. SEC. 4. TRUSTEESHIPS. Section 302 (29 U.S.C. 462) is amended to allow for the establishment of trusteeships after a fair hearing to determine necessity. A temporary trusteeship can be established for up to 30 days in cases where immediate action is required. After 18 months, a trusteeship is presumed invalid unless proven necessary under section 302. Upon dissolution, previous officers are reinstated or a new election is held. If dissolved by court order, an election must be conducted under title IV. If a trusteeship is dissolved by court order, an election must be conducted under court supervision. SEC. 5. ELECTIONS. If a trusteeship is dissolved by court order, an election must be conducted under court supervision. Section 401 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act is amended to allow for the inspection and request of membership lists, specify the election frequency of officers in intermediate bodies, and remove the requirement for reasonable qualifications uniformly imposed. Section 402(c)(2) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act is amended to address election integrity by ensuring that support for candidates is not substantially understated or overstated to the point of undermining the democratic purposes of the election. Additionally, eligibility requirements for candidates are clarified to include reasonable qualifications that do not exclude a majority of members and are uniformly imposed. The Secretary of Labor must review and revise regulations within 6 months of the enactment of the Act to implement amendments to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. The amendments will take effect 180 days after the enactment of the Act."
