    "content": "Insurance companies are a major segment of the U.S. financial services industry, divided into life and health insurance companies and property and casualty insurance companies. In 2017, premiums for life and health insurance totaled $592.2 billion with assets of $7.07 trillion, while premiums for property and casualty insurance totaled $556 billion with assets of $1.98 trillion. Life insurance involves longer-term contracts with well-defined risks, while property and casualty insurance is shorter-term with various commercial lines of insurance. Property and casualty insurance are shorter-term propositions with greater exposure to catastrophic risks, while health insurance involves insurance companies heavily involved in health care delivery and regulated by the federal government. This report focuses on the regulation of property and casualty insurance and life insurance, which have been solely regulated by states for the past 150 years. Legal and legislative landmarks in the state-based insurance regulatory system have shaped the industry. The McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945 preserved states' authority to regulate and tax insurance, granting a federal antitrust exemption to the insurance industry. Each state has its own department regulating insurance companies and products, overseeing solvency, content, and market conduct. Federal insurance regulators do not exist like those for securities firms or banks. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) sets national standards through model laws and regulations, which must be enacted by states. The McCarran-Ferguson Act has somewhat expanded federal government involvement in insurance, leading to division within the industry over federal actions. States argue they are better positioned to regulate insurance and address consumer needs. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act expanded the federal role in insurance, but states remained the primary regulators. GLBA allowed securities firms, banks, and insurers to coexist under a financial holding company overseen by the Federal Reserve or the Office of Thrift Supervision. The GLBA established functional regulation for subsidiaries within holding companies, with limited oversight by federal regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act maintained this regulatory structure, giving enhanced systemic risk authority to the Federal Reserve and FSOC. The act also created OLA, potentially allowing FDIC oversight of insurer resolutions. Holding companies, including those with insurance subsidiaries, are subject to oversight. The Dodd-Frank Act consolidated oversight of holding companies with insurance subsidiaries under the Federal Reserve, adding capital requirements. It also established the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) and addressed international insurance issues post-2007-2009 financial crisis. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) named U.S. insurers as global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs), and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) developed regulatory standards for G-SIIs and other globally active insurers. The U.S. and EU negotiated a covered agreement on reinsurance collateral. The 115th Congress is addressing insurance regulatory issues, including oversight of the Dodd-Frank Act, reforming the regulatory system, and responding to international developments. Senator Mike Crapo introduced S. 1463, and H.R. 3110 was also introduced. H.R. 3110, introduced by Representative Randy Hultgren, passed the House and Senate with overwhelming support and was signed into law by President Trump. The law amends the Dodd-Frank Act to allow an independent member with insurance expertise to serve beyond their initial term until a successor is appointed and confirmed. President Trump nominated Thomas E. Workman to the position, and the Senate confirmed him in March. S. 2155, introduced by Senator Crapo, passed the Senate and House with bipartisan support and was signed into law as P.L. 115-174. The bill includes various financial services provisions and a new section on insurance transparency in international forums. The enacted law, S. 2155, establishes an \"Insurance Policy Advisory Committee on International Capital Standards and Other Insurance Issues\" at the Federal Reserve with 21 members. The Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury are required to provide annual reports and testimony on discussions at the IAIS through 2022. Additionally, a study and report on the impact of international capital standards must be completed by the Federal Reserve and FIO, with public comment and review by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) before agreeing to such standards. Unlike S. 1360, the enacted law does not specify requirements on the final text of any international capital standard. After signing S. 2155, the President expressed concerns about congressional directions conflicting with his authority over international negotiations. H.R. 10, introduced by Representative Jeb Hensarling, aims to make various changes to the financial regulatory system, including some insurance-related regulations. Title X of H.R. 10 would merge Treasury's FIO with other entities. Title X of H.R. 10 proposes merging Treasury's FIO and FSOC's insurance expert to create the Office of Independent Insurance Advocate within Treasury. The Advocate, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, would have new duties, including observing the insurance industry and adding a public notice period for covered agreements. H.R. 10 would also repeal the nonbank designation authority. H.R. 10 proposes significant changes to financial regulations, including repealing nonbank designation authority and Dodd-Frank Title II. H.R. 4537, introduced by Representative Sean Duffy, aims to replace OLA with a new bankruptcy code for financial firms, excluding insurers. The bill was marked up by the House Committee on Financial Services and reported in July 2018. S. 488, originally introduced as the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, was amended in the House to focus on securities regulation. Title XIV of the amended version is similar to H.R. 4537, both bills institute requirements on international insurance standards and agreements. U.S. federal representatives are directed not to agree to any proposal that does not recognize the U.S. system. The bill, H.R. 4537, requires U.S. federal representatives to consult with state insurance regulators and Congress before negotiating international insurance agreements. They must submit a report to Congress before entering into any agreement. Future agreements must provide congressional access to negotiating texts and closely consult with State insurance commissioners. Congressional Budget Office's cost estimate depends on the frequency of negotiations and consultations with state commissioners. H.R. 5059, introduced by Representative Keith Rothfus, defines a new category of \"insurance savings and loan companies.\" The bill passed the House but has not been acted on by the Senate. The cost of consultations with state insurance commissioners is estimated to be less than $500,000 per year. The bill H.R. 5059 introduces a new category of \"insurance savings and loan companies\" exempt from certain Federal Reserve regulations. The Federal Reserve is directed to align record keeping with state insurance regulators and tailor its supervisory framework to insurers' unique risks. Insurance assets are exempt from supervisory assessment fees. The bill H.R. 5059 introduces a new category of \"insurance savings and loan companies\" exempt from certain Federal Reserve regulations, resulting in a reduction in federal revenues. CBO estimates a net reduction in revenues of $261 million over the 2019-2028 period. H.R. 3746, introduced by Representative Sean Duffy, was marked up and ordered reported by the House Financial Services Committee. H.R. 3746 and S. 2702 aim to amend the Dodd-Frank Act to clarify the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over the business of insurance. The bills would limit CFPB's authority and favor state insurance regulators. CBO's cost estimate found no significant effect on agency costs but could reduce civil penalties collected by the CFPB. S. 1360, introduced by Senator Dean Heller, would establish an \"Insurance Policy Advisory Committee on International Capital Standards and Other Insurance Issues\" at the Federal Reserve. It requires annual reports and testimony on ongoing discussions at the IAIS through 2020. The Federal Reserve and FIO must conduct a study and report on the impact of international capital standards, with public comment and review by the GAO before agreeing to such standards. H.R. 3363, introduced by Representative David Kustoff, aims to preempt state laws on claims adjuster licensing, allowing adjusters to operate in multiple states under NARAB. This preemption would apply four years after enactment, excluding states with uniform licensing laws. H.R. 3762, introduced by Representative Sean Duffy, does not require a license for claims adjusting. It was discussed in a hearing on October 24, 2017, but has not seen further committee action. Another bill, H.R. 3861, also introduced by Representative Sean Duffy, aims to amend provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act related to the Federal Insurance Office. H.R. 3861 would amend Dodd-Frank Act provisions regarding the Federal Insurance Office, limiting its focus and size. It would place FIO within the Office of International Affairs, restrict its role in international issues to representing the Treasury, and require consensus with states on international matters. The bill would remove FIO's authority to collect and analyze insurer information, including subpoena power, and preempt state laws under covered agreements. FIO would be limited to five employees. Introduced by Representative Alexander Mooney, the bill aims to abolish FIO created by Dodd-Frank Act provisions. H.R. 4483 would remove the FIO director's preemption authority and replace them with the Secretary of the Treasury in certain roles. Introduced by Representative Mark Takano, H.R. 4885 requires the FIO director to collect data on automobile insurance disparities between racial minority and non-minority areas. H.R. 5502, introduced by Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, aims to prohibit insurers from using certain factors in setting rates for personal automobile insurance and requires public availability of insurer underwriting rules. The bill would be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission and states. The bill, introduced by Representatives Dennis Ross and Denny Heck, and Senators Tim Scott and Doug Jones in 2018, aims to amend the Dodd-Frank Act by adding a state insurance commissioner as a voting member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. This commissioner would be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a four-year term, replacing the current nonvoting insurance commissioner position on the FSOC."
