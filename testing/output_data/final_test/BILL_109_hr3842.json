    "content": "The Emergency Gas Price Relief Act of 2005 may reduce fuel taxes on highway motor fuels when weekly U.S. retail gasoline prices exceed a benchmark. The Emergency Gas Price Relief Act of 2005 amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce highway motor fuel taxes by 10 cents per gallon during a reduction period when U.S. retail gasoline prices exceed a benchmark. The Emergency Gas Price Relief Act of 2005 reduces highway motor fuel taxes by 10 cents per gallon when U.S. retail gasoline prices exceed $3.00 per gallon, ending when prices drop below $2.50 per gallon. Highway motor fuel excludes aviation gasoline and aviation-grade kerosene. Additionally, funds are appropriated to trust funds to offset reduced revenues from tax rate reductions. The amendment reduces tax rates under the Emergency Gas Price Relief Act of 2005, with appropriated funds transferred to trust funds to offset revenue reductions. The amendment takes effect upon the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3. FLOOR STOCK REFUNDS. Before the tax rate reduction date, if tax has been imposed on highway motor fuel under section 4081 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the fuel is held by a dealer for sale, a credit or refund will be given to the taxpayer for the excess tax paid. Claims for credit or refund must be filed with the Secretary of the Treasury within 6 months after the tax rate reduction date. The taxpayer can claim a credit or refund for excess tax paid on highway motor fuel before the tax rate reduction date. The taxpayer must repay the amount claimed to the dealer or obtain written consent for the credit or refund. No credit or refund is allowed for fuel in retail stocks. The tax rate reduction date is defined as the first day of any reduction period under section 4081(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The terms \"dealer\" and \"held by a dealer\" are defined in section 6412 of the Internal Revenue Code. Similar rules to section 6412 apply for this section. SEC. 4. FLOOR STOCKS TAX. Imposition of Tax: A floor stocks tax is imposed on highway motor fuel held on the tax restoration date, calculated as the difference between the tax due on that date and any tax previously paid. Liability and Payment: The person holding the fuel is liable for the tax, to be paid within 45 days of the tax restoration date as prescribed by the Secretary. Definitions: Specific terms are defined for this section. The tax restoration date is defined as the first day after the reduction period. Highway motor fuel is defined as per section 4081(f) of the Internal Revenue Code. Fuel held by a person means title has passed to them. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Treasury. The tax does not apply to exempt uses. On the tax restoration date, no tax is imposed on highway motor fuel held by a person if the amount does not exceed 2,000 gallons. Exempt fuel is not included in this calculation. Controlled groups are treated as one person under certain conditions, with specific criteria outlined for corporations and nonincorporated persons under common control. Under regulations set by the Secretary, similar principles apply to a group of persons under common control if one or more of them is not a corporation. All relevant laws and penalties applicable to taxes imposed by section 4081 also apply to floor stock taxes imposed by subsection (a) to the same extent."
