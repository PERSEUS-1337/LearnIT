    "content": "Congress's authority to review, amend, and approve or disapprove the mayor's education proposal is derived from the \"District Clause\" of the Constitution, granting limited home rule to District citizens while retaining Congress's constitutional authority to legislate within the District. The Home Rule Act and D.C. Code recognize Congress's constitutional authority to legislate in the District. The proposed Education Reform Act allows for restructuring the public school system through city council legislation or congressional amendment of the Home Rule Act. The Education Reform Act proposes reorganizing the public school system through city council legislation or congressional amendment of the Home Rule Act. Congress may need to pass legislation amending certain provisions of the Home Rule Act for the implementation of the reorganization proposal. The mayor could seek a congressional sponsor to amend the city's home rule charter for the Education Reform Act. The process would involve regular legislative procedures in Congress, potentially resulting in a significantly altered proposal. Congress has previously amended the home rule for education reform in 1995. In 1995, Congress passed the District of Columbia School Reform Act, allowing for the creation of public charter schools. In 2004, the DC School Choice Incentive Act was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, establishing a private school voucher program. Both programs were included in District of Columbia appropriations acts. The city council and Congress have the authority to make significant changes to public education in the District. The District's home rule charter allows for legislation to be passed without mayoral or city council approval, but certain amendments may be subject to a referendum vote. Some residents have expressed concerns about the lack of a referendum vote for proposed changes. The legislative process for amending the Home Rule Act by referendum involves city council approval, voter ratification, and congressional review. The Education Reform Act does not include provisions for a referendum vote. The Home Rule Act allows for legislation without mayoral or city council approval, but certain amendments may require a referendum vote. The Education Reform Act does not include provisions for a referendum vote. If a charter amendment by referendum process is used, city council and voter approval is needed, followed by congressional review. Congress has four options: pass a resolution of disapproval, do nothing, allow the referendum outcome to take effect, or pass legislation waiving the review period. Congress can expedite the effective date of a charter amendment by waiving the 35-day review period. In the past, Congress has used the appropriations process to show opposition to measures approved by the city council and citizens of the District. This includes preventing the implementation of a voter-approved medical marijuana initiative."
