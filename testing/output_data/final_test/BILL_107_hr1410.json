The \"Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act\" finds that the Internet Tax Freedom Act should be extended, states should simplify sales tax systems, and sales transactions should be treated equally regardless of the method. Congress aims to facilitate equal taxation in line with the Quill Corp. v. North Dakota decision, allowing states to correct tax system inequities. The States should lead in developing fair sales tax collection systems for in-state sales, regardless of seller location, to address tax inequities. Online consumer privacy is crucial for electronic commerce growth and must be safeguarded. The Internet Tax Freedom Act moratorium is extended through 2005, and a streamlined sales and use tax system is implemented. Development of Streamlined System: Congress encourages States and localities to collaborate on creating a centralized, multi-state registration system for sellers, uniform definitions for taxable goods/services, rules for attributing transactions to taxing jurisdictions, procedures for tax-exempt purchasers, relief for sellers following State procedures, and certification of sales tax software. The streamlined system development includes uniform tax rates, formats for tax returns, electronic filing methods, state administration of taxes, audit procedures, reasonable compensation for tax collection, exemption from tax collection for small sellers, and consumer privacy protections. The system described includes consumer privacy protections and other features deemed necessary by States to promote simplicity, uniformity, neutrality, efficiency, and fairness. Congress believes that this system will not unduly burden interstate commerce or hinder electronic commerce growth. Additionally, a study should be conducted to determine the cost of collecting and remitting State and local sales taxes to ensure reasonable compensation for sellers. SEC. 5. INTERSTATE SALES AND USE TAX COMPACT. States are authorized to enter into an Interstate Sales and Use Tax Compact with Congress's consent. The Compact must establish a uniform tax system and expire if not formed by January 1, 2006. Congressional consent is withdrawn if the Compact is disapproved within 120 days. The Interstate Sales and Use Tax Compact must be formed within 120 days after the adopting States transmit it to Congress, as per the Trade Act of 1974. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION TO SIMPLIFY STATE USE-TAX RATES THROUGH AVERAGING. SEC. 6. Authorization to simplify state use-tax rates through averaging. A state that adopts the Compact authorized under section 5 and levies a use tax must impose a single, uniform state-wide use-tax rate on all remote sales for any calendar year, meeting the averaging requirement. The state-wide use-tax rate should not exceed the weighted average of sales tax rates imposed by the state and its local jurisdictions in the preceding 12-month period. The legislation allows states to impose a single, uniform state-wide use-tax rate on remote sales, not exceeding the weighted average of sales tax rates imposed in the previous 12-month period. Remote sellers can choose to collect the actual applicable State and local use taxes annually. The legislation allows remote sellers to collect the actual applicable State and local sales or use tax due on each sale made in the State, with relief from liability if relying on information provided by the State. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION TO REQUIRE COLLECTION OF USE TAXES. States that adopt the Compact system may require sellers to collect and remit sales taxes on remote sales to purchasers in the state. States not adopting the system cannot enforce this requirement. This authority does not affect the determination of nexus for sellers. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement allows states to require sellers to collect and remit sales taxes on remote sales. This authority does not impact the determination of nexus for sellers in other tax matters. SEC. 8. LIMITATION. This Act does not subject sellers to certain taxes or licensing requirements of states or political subdivisions. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"State\" refers to any State in the United States including the District of Columbia. \"Goods or services\" encompass tangible and intangible items. A \"remote sale\" is a sale in interstate commerce attributed to a specific taxing jurisdiction. The \"locus of remote sale\" pertains to the location of a remote sale of goods or services. A remote sale is a sale of goods or services attributed to a specific taxing jurisdiction."
