    "content": "Section 702 of FISA allows the AG and DNI to authorize targeting of non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. for up to one year, with limitations to prevent targeting of U.S. persons or those believed to be in the U.S. Acquisitions under Section 702 of FISA are conducted in a manner consistent with the Fourth Amendment and focus on electronic communications or electronically stored information. The certification supporting the acquisition requires the AG and DNI to attest that it involves obtaining information from electronic communication service providers, which may include wiretaps, intercepting digital communications, or accessing stored data. Section 702 acquisitions require joint AG/DNI authorization based on court approval or exigent circumstances. Certification must ensure targeting procedures limit acquisitions to persons outside the US and prevent intentional acquisition of known communications. The FISC reviews targeting and minimization procedures for Section 702 acquisitions involving known US persons. Court orders may require corrections if deficiencies are found, or cease implementation if necessary. The AG and DNI can authorize targeting of non-U.S. persons abroad in exigent circumstances without a court order. A certification must be submitted to the FISC within seven days. The USA FREEDOM Act amended FISA to allow surveillance of targets believed to be abroad but found to be in the U.S. Section 702 originally did not permit surveillance of persons in the U.S. The USA FREEDOM Act amended FISA to allow surveillance of non-U.S. persons in the U.S. for 72 hours in exigent circumstances. A traditional FISA order is required for continued surveillance. Organizations challenged the joint authorization procedure for violating the Fourth Amendment. In Clapper v. Amnesty International, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs did not have legal standing to challenge Title VII due to lack of concrete injury. In August 2013, the Obama Administration declassified FISC opinions on Section 702 collection activities, including procedures for \"upstream collection\" of Internet traffic. The government's upstream collection activities acquired unrelated international and domestic communications. The FISC found proposed minimization procedures deficient on statutory and constitutional grounds, focusing mainly on information analysts wanted to use. This led to retention of unrelated communications for up to five years, even if not intended for use. The government's upstream collection activities led to the retention of unrelated communications for up to five years, despite not intending to use that information. The FISC found the proposed minimization procedures deficient on statutory and constitutional grounds, as they did not align with FISA's mandate to minimize the retention of U.S. persons' information. The court also determined that the procedures did not satisfy the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness test. After the Fourth Amendment violation was identified, revised minimization procedures were presented and approved by the FISC on November 30, 2011. These procedures addressed the court's concerns by segregating communications most likely to involve unrelated or wholly domestic content and implementing special handling and markings for such communications. The court approved modifications to upstream collection procedures, including special handling for certain communications and reducing retention period. The Supreme Court considered standing for criminal defendants challenging Section 702, with some defendants moving to suppress evidence gathered unconstitutionally. They argue Fourth Amendment violations and Section 702's conflict with Article III of the Constitution. Amendment challenges have been raised against Section 702, alleging violations of Article III of the Constitution. Courts have not ruled in favor of defendants in these cases. Two cases are pending in the U.S. Courts of Appeals, while a third is proceeding to trial in the U.S. District Court."
