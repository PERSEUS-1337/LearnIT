The framework establishes structure relations between nodes based on attributes, paths, and local structures, with meta-optimization to enhance graph inference capability for self-adaptation. Evaluations on benchmark datasets show GIL's superiority over other methods in node classification tasks. The aim of semi-supervised classification is to infer categories of unlabeled nodes using graph priors. Previous works focused on explicit graph Laplacian regularizations, but deep learning advancements have led to graph convolutional neural networks for more discriminative node representations. Graph CNN based methods have improved graph embedding but are limited in a semi-supervised framework. In few-shot learning, where only a few nodes are labeled, performance is compromised. The proposed GIL framework focuses on efficient inference for graph node labeling by computing similarity between query and reference nodes. The GIL framework focuses on similarity computation between query and reference nodes for efficient graph node labeling. It considers node attributes, local topological structures, and between-node path reachability. High-level features are encoded with graph convolution, and reachable probabilities of random walks are abstracted. A meta-learning strategy optimizes structure relations learning from training to validation nodes. The GIL framework proposes a graph inference learning approach to improve semi-supervised node classification by inferring unlabeled nodes from reference labeled nodes using node attributes, connection paths, and graph topological structures. The GIL framework utilizes graph convolution for high-level feature extraction, random walk algorithm for between-node path reachability, and meta-learning strategy for inferring structure relations in a graph.

Comprehensive evaluations on three citation network datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach. The GIL framework enhances generalization by transferring knowledge from training to validation samples. Evaluations on citation network datasets show its superiority in semi-supervised classification. Graph CNNs are utilized for analyzing irregular graph-structured data, with spectral and spatial convolution methods being key strategies. Graph CNNs utilize spectral and spatial convolution methods to analyze irregular graph-structured data. Spectral-based approaches involve spectral filters through graph Laplacian decomposition, while spatial methods define filtering based on adjacent vertices' spatial structures. Various techniques like diffusion CNNs, GraphSAGE, PSCN, and NgramCNN are used for aggregating neighboring vertices. To reduce computational complexity, local spectral filtering methods parameterize frequency responses using Chebyshev polynomial approximation. Recently, the Gaussian induced convolution model has been proposed for disentangling the aggregation process in data distribution. Semi-supervised node classification has gained attention with various approaches like graph Laplacian regularization and graph embedding methods. Classic algorithms include label propagation, local/global consistency regularization, and random walk-based sampling for context information acquisition. Scalable semi-supervised learning challenges are being addressed with the Anchor Graph method. The Anchor Graph regularization approach is proposed to address scalable semi-supervised learning issues and is applied to massive-scale graph datasets. Various graph convolution network methods have been developed to obtain discriminative representations of input graphs, such as scalable graph CNN models and Graph attention networks (GAT) for computing hidden representations of each node. The proposed GIL introduces a graph inference strategy for semi-supervised node classification, leveraging a meta optimization mechanism to learn an inference model.

It defines structure relations on graphs and treats semi-supervised node classification as a specialized task. The task involves predicting node labels based on a small number of labeled vertices in a graph data setting. The proposed method aims to predict node labels on graphs by utilizing node attributes and edge connections. Existing methods focus on choosing the best classifier based on training and validation sets, but overlook transferring knowledge to unlabeled nodes. To address this, a meta-learning mechanism is introduced to infer node labels by jointly modeling graph structure, node connectivity, and attributes. The learning process involves modeling graph structure, node attributes, and between-node path reachability. A structure relation is built between labeled and unlabeled nodes to improve label prediction accuracy. This is achieved by propagating information from labeled nodes to unlabeled nodes for better classification on a testing set.

The implementation of the model involves computing node similarity scores and class-to-node relationships for semi-supervised node classification. It utilizes a loss function based on cross entropy and iteratively updates the model on the training set to optimize performance on the validation set. The model involves gradient descent on V tr to improve performance on V val. Batch sampling is used during training, while all training nodes are taken during testing. The final model is updated and used to infer class labels for query nodes. All modules of the structure relation are instantiated in this section. The spectral graph convolution operation on subgraph G vi encodes local representations of an input graph. The normalized graph Laplacian matrix is used for this purpose. The convolution is defined as the multiplication of signal X with a filter parameterized by Fourier coefficients. Chebyshev polynomial is used to reduce computational complexity and obtain local information. The graph filtering operation involves Chebyshev coefficients and Chebyshev polynomials evaluated at the scaled Laplacian matrix. Multi-scale receptive fields are constructed for each vertex based on the Laplacian matrix to record hopping neighborhood relationships. Path reachability is computed by employing random walks on graphs to determine probabilities of paths between vertices. The matrix P = D \u22121 E defines probabilities of transitions between vertices in a graph. P t ij represents the probability of reaching vertex v j from v i in t steps. Transition probabilities in t steps are calculated as matrix entries P t ij. Node reachability from v i to v j is represented as a d p -dimensional vector, where d p is the step length of the longest path. The node relationship between vertices in a graph is defined by considering path reachability, local representations, and weight values. This is achieved through fully connected layers and regression scores to evaluate the proposed method. The GIL method is evaluated on citation network datasets and a knowledge graph NELL dataset. Graph data is split into training, validation, and testing sets. The GIL model includes graph convolution layers, mean-pooling layers, a relationship regression module, and a softmax layer. The configuration of the relationship regression module is detailed in Section 4. The GIL model is trained with specific parameters and settings, including channel sizes, dropout rates, and activation functions.

The inference process of GIL becomes more difficult with increased reachability path length, requiring more graph structure information. Influence of different label rates is also explored. The GIL method outperforms GCN in predicting category information for unlabeled nodes. The performance of GIL improves with increasing label rates, but the relative gain narrows. The reachable path lengths between labeled and unlabeled nodes decrease with more labeled nodes, weakening the inference learning effect.
