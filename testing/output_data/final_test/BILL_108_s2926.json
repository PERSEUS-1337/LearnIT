    "content": "The \"Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2004\" is also known as the Environmental Remediation Credit Act. It provides a credit for expenditures to remediate contaminated sites under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Environmental Remediation Credit Act offers a 50 percent credit for qualified remediation expenditures on contaminated sites in eligible areas. Qualified expenditures include abatement of hazardous substances and demolition of structures as part of an approved remediation plan. The Environmental Remediation Credit Act provides a credit for qualified remediation expenditures on contaminated sites, including abatement, disposal of property, and reconstruction of utilities. The credit amount allocated by the State development agency cannot exceed the approved plan for remediation and redevelopment. The Environmental Remediation Credit Act allows for a credit on qualified remediation expenses for contaminated sites. The allocation must be made before the start of the taxable year and must be part of a qualified allocation plan by the State development agency. The State development agency must have a qualified allocation plan that prioritizes contaminated sites based on poverty levels, location in enterprise zones or renewal communities, and central business districts. The State development agency must prioritize contaminated sites based on various factors such as poverty levels, location in enterprise zones, and central business districts. States may impose conditions on projects receiving credit allocation, including environmental remediation, redevelopment extent, financial commitment, and expected new employment. The State environmental remediation credit ceiling for any calendar year includes the unused ceiling from the previous year, the state's share of the national limitation, returned credits, and any newly allocated credits. The national environmental remediation credit limitation for each calendar year is $1,000,000,000, with each State having a share based on a specific ratio. Unused State environmental remediation credit ceiling is calculated by subtracting the aggregate allocated amounts from the sum of specified factors. The national environmental remediation credit limitation for each calendar year is $1,000,000,000, with each State's share based on population ratio. Unused environmental remediation credits can be carried over to the next year and allocated among qualified States. The formula for allocating unused environmental remediation credit carryovers among qualified states is based on population ratio and follows rules similar to section 42(h)(3)(D). Population is determined according to section 146(j), and there is an inflation adjustment for the $1,000,000,000 national environmental remediation credit limitation after 2004. The $1,000,000,000 amount in paragraph (2) will increase annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment. The term 'eligible area' refers to an area with at least one census tract having a poverty rate of 20 percent. The term 'qualified contaminated site' is defined in section 198, treating petroleum as hazardous substances. The term 'State' includes possessions of the United States. The subsection allows for the assignment of tax credits to another person designated by the taxpayer, who will be treated as the taxpayer for that purpose. Any amount paid for the assignment of the credit will not be included in the payee's gross income. No credit will be allowed to potential responsible parties under this section. The subsection allows for the assignment of tax credits to another person designated by the taxpayer, who will be treated as the taxpayer for that purpose. Any amount paid for the assignment of the credit will not be included in the payee's gross income. A potential responsible party must bear at least 25 percent of the cost of remediating a contaminated site to avoid liability under Federal law for the remaining 75 percent. Amounts paid for credit assignment are not eligible. The assignment of tax credits to another person will not affect the taxpayer's eligibility for the credit. If the environmental remediation of a contaminated site is deemed incomplete by the State development agency, the taxpayer's tax for that year will be increased by the credit recapture amount. This amount is determined by the decrease in credits allowed. The taxpayer's tax for a year will be increased by the credit recapture amount, which is determined by the aggregate decrease in credits allowed under section 38 for prior years if the credit allowable by this section were not allowed, plus interest for each prior year. No deduction is allowed for this interest. No deduction allowed for portion of qualified remediation expenditures equal to credit determined for the year under this section. Adjustments to carryforwards and carrybacks if credits not used to reduce tax liability. Increase in tax not considered for determining credits or tax under section 55. The credit determined for the taxable year under this section may reduce the amount chargeable to capital account for qualified remediation expenditures. Controlled groups may have specific rules applied. The environmental remediation credit under section 45G(a) is treated as a business credit under Section 38(b) of the Code. No carryback of the section 45G credit is allowed before the effective date. No portion of the unused business credit for any taxable year attributable to the environmental remediation credit under section 45G can be carried back to a taxable year before the enactment of section 45G. The environmental remediation credit under section 45G applies to taxable years beginning after the enactment of the Act."
