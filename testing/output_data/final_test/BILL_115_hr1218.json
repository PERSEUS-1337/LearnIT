    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the section's title and the findings that will be discussed. The \"Social Security and Medicare Lock-Box Act\" addresses the serious fiscal health problems of the trust funds associated with Social Security and Medicare. Projections indicate that the funds will be depleted by 2034, highlighting the urgency for action. The Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is projected to be exhausted by 2028, urging legislative action to protect the trust funds' solvency. The Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees emphasize the need for lawmakers to act promptly to avoid unexpected program changes and provide ample time for preparation. Social Security and Medicare aim to ensure older Americans can live with dignity. Protecting future trust fund surpluses requires meaningful Congressional reform for solvency. It is crucial to act promptly to avoid sudden program changes and allow time for preparation. SEC. 2. INTERIM PROTECTIONS FOR SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND SURPLUS. Section 201(d) of the Social Security Act is amended to establish a Social Security Surplus Protection Account in the Trust Fund. The Managing Trustee will transfer amounts equivalent to the social security surplus for each fiscal year to this Account. The Managing Trustee will transfer estimated amounts to the Social Security Surplus Protection Account based on taxes imposed for the fiscal year, with adjustments made for any prior overestimations or underestimations. The Secretary of the Treasury determines taxes on wages and self-employment income for the fiscal year, with adjustments for specified amounts. The balance in the Account shall not be available for investment by the Managing Trustee. The Account balance cannot be invested by the Managing Trustee, except for fiscal years starting from 2018 where Federal law allows investment in vehicles other than US obligations. SEC. 3. INTERIM PROTECTIONS FOR MEDICARE PART A TRUST FUND SURPLUS. Section 1817(c) of the Social Security Act is amended to establish a Medicare Surplus Protection Account in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. The Managing Trustee will transfer amounts equivalent to the Medicare part A surplus for each fiscal year after 2018 to this Account. The Managing Trustee will transfer Medicare part A surplus amounts to the Account based on estimates, with adjustments made for any prior discrepancies in transferred amounts. The Treasury determines taxes on wages and self-employment income reported to the Secretary of the Treasury. This is compared to benefits paid from the Trust Fund and authorized amounts from the Trust Fund. The Trust Fund balance in the Account cannot be invested by the Managing Trustee. Starting from the first fiscal year after 2018, if a Federal law allows investments in vehicles other than US obligations, the provisions regarding investment in the Trust Fund will not apply. The law must include a specific clause to meet the requirements of the Social Security Act. SEC. 4. SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE PART A INVESTMENT COMMISSION. Established in the executive branch is a Social Security and Medicare Part A Investment Commission tasked with studying effective investment options for the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. The Commission must submit recommendations and proposed changes to the President and Congress by October 1, 2018. The Commission, composed of members appointed by various leaders, must have expertise in financial investments and pension plans. Members serve for the life of the Commission, with vacancies filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The Commission meets monthly and at additional times as needed. Three members constitute a quorum for decision-making. Vacancies do not affect the Commission's authority. The Commission members are compensated at the daily rate of basic pay for level IV of the Executive Schedule. They are also reimbursed for travel and other necessary expenses. The Commission will terminate 90 days after submitting its report."
