    "content": "The 115th Congress continues to prioritize U.S. research and development (R&D) activities, supported by the federal government despite concerns about budget deficits. Increased budget caps for FY2018 and FY2019 may alleviate some pressure on R&D funding decisions. The U.S. government funds a wide range of scientific and engineering R&D efforts for various purposes. The federal government funds scientific and engineering R&D for national defense, health, safety, the environment, and energy security, among other purposes. R&D budgets are developed internally by individual agencies and are subject to review and approval by the Office of Management and Budget. The federal R&D budget is determined by aggregating activities from each agency and is part of the President's budget submission to Congress. Congress plays a key role in setting R&D priorities and funding levels, with some members concerned about federal spending due to the deficit and debt, while others support increased R&D investment for future competitiveness. Congress faces decisions on the amount and allocation of federal R&D funding in the FY2019 appropriations process. President Trump's FY2019 R&D budget request was discussed, along with an additional $12.9 billion request for nondiscretionary R&D funding. The report analyzes the R&D budget requests of federal departments and agencies that make up 99% of total federal R&D funding. The Trump Administration changed the definition of development in R&D calculations in FY2018, excluding some activities at DOD and NASA. The new definition, \"experimental development,\" is used for FY2017 and FY2019 budgets, except for the Department of Defense section. Despite the changes, funds excluded from development definition still support system upgrades and production efforts. The President's budget request for FY2019 compares to FY2017 levels as FY2018 funding was already appropriated. Agency sections will be updated with FY2018 R&D levels for comparison. The new definition of R&D includes a proposed $12.9 billion. President Trump is proposing approximately $131.0 billion for R&D for FY2019, an increase of $5.7 billion above the FY2017 level. The request includes funding for existing programs, new initiatives, and will be analyzed by agency and other perspectives. Additional information will be provided as Congress acts on the budget request. President Trump's FY2019 budget proposal allocates $131.0 billion for R&D, with funding distributed among eight federal agencies. The Department of Defense would receive 48.4%, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 20.9%, Department of Energy (DOE) 10.7%, NASA 9.0%, and National Science Foundation. Funding data for FY2018 was not included in the budget request. The report analyzes R&D budget requests for federal agencies, including DOE, NASA, NSF, USDA, DOC, and VA. Excluding addendum funding, most agencies would see decreased R&D funding in FY2019 compared to FY2017 levels. DOD, Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, and Smithsonian Institution are the only agencies with increased R&D funding in FY2019. President Trump's FY2019 budget request includes significant decreases in R&D funding for various federal agencies, with the largest declines in HHS, DOE, NSF, USDA, and DOC budgets. The request allocates $27.341 billion for basic research, $31.648 billion for applied research, $56.696 billion for development, and $2.371 billion for facilities and equipment. Public investments in basic research and incentives for private sector research are key policy justifications. The private sector may underinvest in basic research due to factors such as long time horizons, technical risk, and shareholder demands for short-term returns. The federal government is the largest supporter of basic research, funding 44% of U.S. basic research in 2016, while businesses funded 27%. In 2016, business funded 27% of U.S. basic research, while state governments, universities, and nonprofit organizations funded the remaining 29%. Business was the primary funder of U.S. applied research at 53%, with the federal government at 35%. For development funding, business provided 82%, the federal government 16%, and others 2%. Federal R&D funding is distributed across basic research, applied research, development, and facilities/equipment. The federal R&D budget reflects national priorities such as spaceflight, energy sources, and counterterrorism efforts. In the President's FY2019 budget request, the Department of Health and Human Services, mainly NIH, would receive the most funding for basic research and applied research. DOD would be the primary funder of development projects. The President's FY2019 budget request shows that DOD is the main federal funder of development, accounting for 87.4% of total federal development funding. Multiagency R&D initiatives are often detailed in presidential budgets, with some having a statutory basis while others operate at the discretion of the President. President Trump's FY2019 budget is not clear on funding levels for these initiatives. The FY2019 budget is unclear on funding levels for R&D initiatives, including the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development program established in 1991. Coordination of these efforts involves 21 agencies, with non-members also participating. The budget lacks details on the continuation of nonstatutory initiatives. The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Networking and Information Technology Research and Development coordinates NITRD efforts involving non-member agencies. The director of NITRD is required to prepare an annual report for Congress and the President's budget request. President Trump is requesting $5,277.6 million for NITRD research in FY2019, an increase from FY2018. More information can be found at https://www.nitrd.gov. The U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates federal research on global change, aiming to advance climate science and inform human responses. The program involves 13 departments and agencies, overseen by the NSTC Subcommittee on Global Change Research. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 requires annual reporting to Congress on federal budget and spending for global change research. The National Nanotechnology Initiative, launched in FY2001, is a multiagency R&D initiative focused on advancing understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale. Congress enacted the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act in 2003 to provide a legislative foundation for some of the initiative's activities. The President is required to submit a comprehensive report to appropriations committees detailing all Federal agency funding for climate change programs, projects, and activities. The most recent report was submitted in December 2016 for FY2017. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) is coordinated by the NSTC Subcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET). In FY2019, the President's budget request includes NNI funding for 16 federal departments and agencies dedicated to nanotechnology R&D. The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act requires the NSTC to prepare an annual report for Congress detailing the program's budget for the current fiscal year. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) budget for FY2019 is $1,395.6 million, which is $81.8 million less than FY2018. Additional information on NNI can be found at http://www.nano.gov. Presidential initiatives like the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, Cancer Moonshot, BRAIN Initiative, Precision Medicine Initiative, and Materials Genome are not explicitly addressed in President Trump's FY2018 or FY2019 budgets. The report discusses various federal initiatives such as Moonshot, BRAIN Initiative, Precision Medicine Initiative, Materials Genome Initiative, and clean energy R&D funding. It provides an in-depth analysis of R&D in 12 federal departments and agencies receiving nearly 99% of total federal R&D funding. Annual appropriations for these agencies are provided through regular appropriations bills. Agencies are presented based on the size of their FY2019 R&D budget requests. R&D funding is often difficult to identify in agency budget data reported to Congress, leading to discrepancies in R&D data between agency analyses and the president's budget. Appropriations for R&D are typically included in line items with non-R&D activities, making it challenging to determine the exact allocation for R&D. Funding levels for R&D are only known after departments allocate their appropriations. As of the report date, the House had completed action on six of the 12 regular appropriations bills, while the Senate had completed action on nine. Five bills had been enacted into law, including the Department of Defense Appropriations Act and the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act. Division C of P.L. 115-245 provides continuing appropriations for various agencies until the enactment of specific projects or activities, the fiscal year 2019 appropriations Act, or December 7, 2018. Congress will update the report as needed to complete the FY2019 appropriations process. Additional reports on individual appropriations bills can be found on the CRS website. The Department of Defense's mission is to provide military forces for deterrence and national security. Congress supports DOD's research and development activities through RDT&E funding, primarily in Title IV of the defense appropriations bill. These funds are crucial for developing future military technology and rely on a strong science and technology base. RDT&E funds are appropriated in various parts of the defense appropriations bill, including the Defense Health Program and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. The Defense Health Program supports healthcare for DOD personnel and their families, with RDT&E funds allocated for research on various medical conditions. Congress appropriates funds for these programs in Title VI of the defense appropriations bill. The Defense Health Program and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program receive RDT&E funds allocated for research on medical conditions and disposal of lethal chemical agents and munitions to prevent future risks and costs. Funding for these programs is requested through Defense-wide Procurement appropriations and Title VI, with additional support from the National Defense Sealift Fund for naval reserve fleet operations and maintenance. RDT&E funds have also been used for efforts in the Global War on Terror and Overseas Contingency Operations. The Obama and Trump Administrations have utilized Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds for various activities related to the Global War on Terror. These funds are allocated to specific Program Elements (PEs) in Title IV, with transfers to accounts like the Iraqi Freedom Fund and Afghanistan Security Forces Fund. Congress authorizes the Secretary to make transfers at his discretion, which are reflected in prior-year funding figures. The Trump Administration is requesting $92.365 billion for DOD's Title IV RDT&E PEs for FY2019, which is $1.783 billion above the FY2018 level. The request includes funding for Defense Health Program, Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program, and Inspector General activities. The FY2019 budget does not include RDT&E funding via the National Defense Sealift Fund. The House passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019 (H.R. 6157) on June 28, 2018, with $92.422 billion allocated for RDT&E funding. This represents a 2.0% increase over FY2018 levels. The bill includes funding for Defense Health Program, Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program, and Inspector General activities. The Senate passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019 (H.R. 6157) with $96.308 billion allocated for RDT&E funding, representing a 6.3% increase over FY2018 levels. The bill includes funding for Defense Health Program, Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program, and Inspector General activities. For FY2019, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act allocates $96.090 billion for RDT&E funding, representing a 6.1% increase over FY2018 levels. This includes funding for various programs such as the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program and Inspector General activities. For FY2019, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act allocates $96.090 billion for RDT&E funding, a 6.1% increase over FY2018 levels. This includes $2.181 billion for DHP RDT&E, $887 million for Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program RDT&E, and $4.0 million for Inspector General RDT&E activities. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY2019 allocates $96.090 billion for RDT&E funding, a 6.1% increase over FY2018 levels. This includes separate RDT&E funding for the Army and Navy, with the Army receiving $11.384 billion and the Navy receiving $18.678 billion. The funding levels for both departments are above the enacted level for FY2018 and the requested levels. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY2019 allocates $96.090 billion for RDT&E funding, a 6.1% increase over FY2018 levels. This includes funding for the Army, Navy, Air Force, Defense-wide account, and OTE. The Air Force receives $41.551 billion, Defense-wide account receives $24.095 billion, and OTE receives $381 million in RDT&E funding. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY2019 allocates $96.090 billion for RDT&E funding, with budget activities ranging from basic research to system improvements in existing operational systems. Congressional policymakers are particularly interested in DOD's Science and Technology program funding as it supports the development of new technologies and science. The FY2019 request for Title IV S&T funding is $13.700 billion, with the House-passed bill at $14.648 billion and the Senate-passed bill at $15.441 billion. P.L. 115-245 provides $15.973 billion for Title IV S&T funding in FY2019. In FY2019, DOD's basic research budget is $2.269 billion, with a focus on universities. This is a decrease from the FY2018 enacted level. The House-passed bill allocates $2.298 billion for DOD basic research, slightly below the FY2018 level. The Senate-passed bill allocates $2.798 billion for DOD basic research in FY2019, which is significantly above the request and House-passed levels. Division A of P.L. 115-245 provides $2.530 billion for DOD basic research in FY2019, slightly above the FY2018 enacted level. The Department of Health and Human Services focuses on enhancing and protecting the health of Americans through research funded by the National Institutes of Health. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) focuses on research and development funded primarily through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which accounts for over 95% of total HHS R&D funding. Other HHS agencies providing funding for R&D include CDC, CMS, FDA, AHRQ, HRSA, and ACF. NIH is the main federal agency for biomedical and behavioral research, training researchers, and disseminating health information with a mission to enhance health and reduce illness and disability. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) focuses on research to improve health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The organization consists of the NIH Office of the Director (OD) and 27 institutes and centers (ICs) that focus on specific diseases and areas of human health. Each IC manages its own research programs in coordination with the OD. NIH supports basic and clinical research, research training, and health information dissemination across biomedical and behavioral sciences. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research in biomedical and behavioral sciences. Approximately 10% of the NIH budget funds intramural research projects conducted by NIH scientists in Bethesda, MD. Over 80% of the budget goes to extramural research through grants and contracts, supporting research at universities, hospitals, and other institutions. NIH's funding primarily comes from the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations act, with additional funding from the Interior/Environment appropriations act. Additionally, NIH receives $150 million in mandatory funding annually from the Public Health Service Act. The NIH receives mandatory funding of $150 million annually from the Public Health Service Act for type 1 diabetes research. President Trump's FY2019 budget requested a total NIH program level of $34.792 billion, a decrease of $2.519 billion from FY2018. The request included discretionary budget authority, PHS Act transfers, and funding for Superfund-related research. Buildings and Facilities would have received a 55% increase in funding for FY2019. The FY2019 NIH budget request proposed consolidating existing HHS research programs to establish three new NIH Institutes: NIOSH, NIDILRR, and NIRSQ. This would require an amendment to the Public Health Service Act. The FY2019 budget request proposed creating three new NIH Institutes, requiring an amendment to the Public Health Service Act. The budget would provide funding for these institutes and also included initiatives to limit salaries for investigators to stretch grant dollars. The FY2019 budget proposed limiting salaries for investigators to stretch grant dollars, capping salaries at $152,000 and shifting funding for type 1 diabetes research to discretionary funding. Additionally, $741 million in funding was proposed to be transferred to NIH through the Program Evaluation Set-Aside. The PHS Act authorizes the Secretary to use a portion of eligible appropriations to study federal health programs and make improvements. Recent LHHS appropriations acts have specified a higher tap amount (2.5% in FY2018) and directed funding transfers to HHS programs. NIH, the largest PHS agency, has historically been a donor of program evaluation funds but has become a net recipient due to tap transfers directed to NIH in recent years. The FY2019 NIH budget request included $711 million from the 21st Century Cures Act. Funds were allocated for the Cancer Moonshot initiative, the BRAIN Initiative, and the Precision Medicine Initiative. The House Appropriations Committee-reported version of the FY2019 LHHS appropriations bill would have provided NIH with $37.411 billion in discretionary budget authority. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported version of the FY2019 LHHS appropriations bill recommended a total of $38.066 billion for NIH in discretionary budget authority. Adding additional funds would have brought the NIH program level total to $39.312 billion. The bill did not receive floor consideration in the Senate but was similar to the LHHS division in H.R. 6157. The Senate passed an amended version of the bill on August 23, with no amendments affecting NIH funding. The bill was guided by a previous committee report and resolved differences through a conference committee. President Trump signed the bill into law on September 28, 2018 (P.L. 115-245), providing NIH with $37.937 billion in discretionary budget authority. Additional funds were allocated for specific programs, totaling $39.312 billion. The NIH received a program-level total of $39.312 billion, which is $2 billion more than the FY2018 level. Specific research areas saw funding increases, including $425 million for Alzheimer's research, $37 million for antibiotic resistant bacteria research, $40 million for a universal flu vaccine, and $11 million for Institutional Development. The NIH received a program-level total of $39.312 billion, with funding increases for Alzheimer's research, antibiotic resistant bacteria research, a universal flu vaccine, and the Institutional Development Awards (IDeA) program. The IDeA program supports faculty development and research infrastructure in states with historically lower NIH funding levels. Funding for Alzheimer's, antibiotic resistant bacteria, and IDeA program matches Senate committee recommendations, while the increase for universal flu vaccines exceeds both House and Senate committee recommendations. Congress has recently started specifying amounts for specific diseases. The NIH allocates funding to various research areas, allowing flexibility to pursue scientific opportunities important to public health. Recent changes include specific authorizations for research purposes, such as Alzheimer's disease and the NIH Innovation account. The impact of limiting a researcher's salary paid with grant funds is unclear. The Senate and House reports rejected the creation of three new institutes at the NIH and did not support moving the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program from CDC to NIH. The impact of limiting a researcher's salary paid with grant funds is unclear. The House report rejected the creation of three new institutes at NIH, including NIOSH, stating it is better suited within CDC. The enacted law did not include the proposal to shift $150 million for type 1 diabetes research to NIDDK discretionary funding. The President's FY2019 budget identified research priorities for NIH, emphasizing partnerships to tackle complex challenges and increase the pace of biomedical research. Public-private collaborations like the Accelerating Medicines Partnership aim to develop innovative technologies and treatments. The Partnership aims to identify biological targets for new therapies in diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders. A new initiative for Parkinson's disease has been launched. NIH is using public-private partnerships to address the opioid crisis by developing new medications and non-addictive pain therapies. The FY2019 budget proposal includes $500 million for NIH research on opioid addiction. The agreement includes $500 million for NIH research on opioid addiction, development of opioid alternatives, pain management, and addiction treatment. This funding is in addition to the $774 million NIH is expected to spend on research for opioid misuse, addiction treatment, and pain research. NIH is the largest funder of basic biomedical research in the United States, with more than half of its budget going towards basic research each year. This research provides a critical foundation for both public and private sectors to build upon, including understanding neural pathways related to the opioid crisis. Investing in translational and clinical research to improve health is a key focus for NIH, building on basic research to convert scientific knowledge into interventions. The Senate committee supports these advancements through increased funding for all Institutes and Centers, recognizing the importance of unexpected discoveries in research. NIH targets investment towards clinical and translational research to move basic discoveries from 'bench-to-bedside.' This includes large population studies to understand health and disease at all levels. The Precision Medicine Initiative's All of Us Research Program aims to collect data for research on novel therapeutics and prevention strategies. The National Cancer Institute is directed to design a study on navigation services. The conference report directs the National Cancer Institute to design a study on providing navigation and patient expense reimbursement to improve participation of underrepresented and minority communities in clinical research for cancer. The President's budget for FY2019 includes goals such as updating the infrastructure of NIH facilities and fostering a diverse and talented research workforce with dedicated funding for the Next Generation Research Initiative. The FY2019 budget proposed initiatives to support early-stage investigators, advance data science through the BD2K initiative, and encourage innovation through prize competitions. The Department of Energy was established in 1977 to combine energy-related programs and defense-related nuclear programs. The Department of Energy (DOE) conducts basic scientific research in various fields, including nuclear physics, energy production, and national security. It operates 17 national laboratories, accounting for 40% of DOE expenditures. The FY2019 budget request for R&D is $11.720 billion, a decrease from the previous year. The DOE Office of Science is allocated $5.391 billion. The FY2019 budget request for the DOE Office of Science is $5.391 billion, a decrease of 13.9% from the previous year. Funding for Advanced Scientific Computing Research would increase by $89 million (11.0%) to support the Exascale Computing Initiative. However, other major research programs would see decreases, including Fusion Energy Sciences by $192 million (36.1%) and Biological and Environmental Research by $173 million (25.7%). The FY2019 budget request for the DOE Office of Science is $5.391 billion, with funding for Science Laboratories Infrastructure decreasing by 50.7% to $127 million in the FY2019 request. The House bill would provide $6.600 billion for the Office of Science, with increases for Advanced Scientific Computing Research, Fusion Energy Sciences, and Biological and Environmental Research. The Senate bill would provide $6.650 billion, with additional funding for Advanced Scientific Computing Research and Fusion Energy Sciences. The FY2019 budget request for the DOE Office of Science is $5.391 billion. Funding for Fusion Energy Sciences would receive $85 million more than the request, Biological and Environmental Research would receive $215 million more, and Science Laboratories Infrastructure would receive $302 million. The request for DOE national security R&D is $4.268 billion, with increases for Naval Reactors program and decreases for Inertial Confinement Fusion. The House bill proposes $4.371 billion for national security R&D, including funding for Naval Reactors and Weapons Activities. The Senate bill offers $4.182 billion, with increased funding for Weapons Activities. The DOE energy R&D budget request is $2.061 billion, a significant decrease from FY2018. Funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D would also decrease. Funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D would decrease by 65.5%, with a shift towards early-stage R&D. Fossil energy R&D funding would decrease by 30.9%, particularly in coal carbon capture and storage and natural gas technologies. Nuclear energy funding would decrease by 37.2%, with cuts to specific programs like the Integrated University Program and the Supercritical Transformational Electric Power initiative. ARPA-E funding would be impacted as well. The House bill proposes $4.502 billion for energy R&D, including increases for energy efficiency, renewable energy, fossil energy (with a focus on coal carbon capture and storage), nuclear energy, and ARPA-E. The Senate bill suggests $4.531 billion, with similar allocations for energy efficiency, renewable energy, fossil energy (including coal carbon capture and storage), nuclear energy, and ARPA-E. The House bill proposes $4.502 billion for energy R&D, including increases for energy efficiency, renewable energy, fossil energy (coal carbon capture and storage), nuclear energy, and ARPA-E. NASA conducts civilian space and aeronautics activities, with research programs in planetary science, Earth science, heliophysics, astrophysics, and aeronautics. The Administration is requesting about $16.474 billion for NASA R&D in FY2019, which is 1.6% less than the FY2017 level. The funding comes through five accounts: Science, Aeronautics, Exploration Research and Technology, Deep Space Exploration Systems, and ISS. The FY2019 request for Science is $5.895 billion, with increases for Planetary Science and decreases for Earth Science and Astrophysics. The FY2019 NASA budget request includes a $407 million increase for Science, with a $167 million decrease for Astrophysics. The Earth Science program would see the termination of three missions, while Planetary Science would receive additional funding for the Double Asteroid Redirection Test and a new Lunar Discovery and Exploration program. The FY2019 NASA budget request includes a proposed decrease in funding for the James Webb Space Telescope and Exoplanet Exploration. There is also an increase in funding for Aeronautics, specifically for the Low Boom Flight Demonstrator. Additionally, there is an increase in funding for Exploration Research and Technology. The FY2019 NASA budget request includes an increase in funding for Research and Technology by $1.003 billion, supporting various programs such as the Space Technology Mission Directorate and Human Research Program. Funding for Technology Maturation and Demonstration would also increase, while funding for certain in-space robotic satellite servicing activities would decrease. Additionally, there is an increase in funding for Deep Space Exploration Systems by 9.0%, supporting the development of the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle and Space Launch System for future human exploration beyond Earth orbit. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 outlines future human exploration beyond Earth orbit. The first test flight of SLS carrying Orion without crew (EM-1) is expected in December 2019. The first crewed flight (EM-2) is expected in late 2022 or early 2023. Funding for Exploration Systems Development would decrease by $259 million, while Advanced Exploration Systems would increase by $791 million, including funding for a lunar orbit platform (Gateway). Commercial Crew funding would decrease by 85.4%, ISS funding would increase by 0.8%. The request for the ISS in FY2017 is $1.462 billion, with a 0.8% increase. Commercial LEO Development program receives $150 million. Boeing and SpaceX are expected to start crewed flights to the ISS in early 2019. The Commercial LEO Development program aims to boost a commercial space economy in low Earth orbit post-2025 when direct ISS funding ends. The National Science Foundation supports basic research and education in non-medical sciences and engineering. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is a key source of federal support for U.S. university research, particularly in mathematics and computer science. It also plays a significant role in federal STEM education programs and student aid. NSF has six appropriations accounts for various purposes, including research, education, and agency operations. Appropriations are typically provided at the account level, with program-specific directions included in appropriations acts or accompanying reports. The National Science Foundation (NSF) receives funding through appropriations acts and reports. The requested R&D funding for FY2019 is compared to FY2017 actual funding, with FY2018 levels included for reference. R&D funding is allocated to the RRA, EHR, and MREFC accounts, comprising 95% of NSF's total requested funding. Specific R&D obligations are determined after funding allocations are made for research, physical assets, and major equipment. The Administration is requesting $7.47 billion for the NSF in FY2019, $295.4 million less than the FY2018 enacted amount. The request includes additional funding provided in the Addendum to the President's FY19 Budget. Budget authority would decrease in two accounts but increase in others, with slight increases to the RRA, OIG, and NSB accounts. Overall, NSF estimates the funding levels for basic and applied research, R&D facilities, and major equipment. The FY2019 request for NSF includes $6.12 billion for R&D activities, a 3% increase from FY2017. Of this, $5.68 billion is for the conduct of R&D, with 87% for basic research and 13% for applied research. Additionally, $441 million is allocated for R&D facilities and major equipment. Funding rates are expected to decrease slightly, resulting in 300 fewer grants awarded compared to FY2017. The Administration seeks $6.151 billion for RRA in FY2019, with decreases for 7 of the 10 RRA subaccounts. The largest percentage increase would go to Integrative Activities, while the largest percentage decrease would go to Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences. The FY2019 request also includes $160 million for the RRA Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program. The FY2019 request for R&D funding in the RRA account is $5.617 billion, a 3.2% increase from FY2017. Majority of the funding is allocated for research, with $4.79 billion for basic research and $483 million for applied research. In the EHR account, the FY2019 request is $28.6 million less than FY2018, with increases for some programs and decreases for others. The FY2019 request for EHR programs includes $270.7 million for GRF and $52.1 million for NRT, with a total R&D funding request of $410 million. The MREFC account is seeking $94.6 million for large construction projects, a decrease from FY2018. The FY2019 MREFC funding request is $94.6 million, a decrease from previous years. The funding would support projects like the LSST and DKIST telescopes, as well as the RCRV program for research vessels. The budget request aims to maintain spending restraint by supporting construction of two vessels instead of three. The FY2019 NSF budget request includes funding for three multiagency initiatives, with reductions in funding for the National Nanotechnology Initiative, Networking and Information Technology Research and Development program, and U.S. Global Change Research Program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture conducts research through federal facilities and external grants. The USDA conducts research in various areas such as agriculture, bioenergy, nutrition, food safety, and social sciences. It is supported by four agencies under the Research, Education, and Economics mission area. The House-reported bill recommends $3,109.0 billion for FY2019, while the Senate-passed bill recommends $2,985.7 billion for these agencies. The Senate-passed bill recommends $2,985.7 billion for the four research agencies, a reduction from FY2018. Agricultural research is also funded by state contributions, private donations, and mandatory funding. The Agricultural Research Service operates 90 laboratories nationwide with 6,600 employees focusing on food and fiber production and new agricultural products. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) focuses on fiber production, developing new agricultural products, pest management, and supporting USDA programs. The Senate-passed bill recommends $1,301.0 billion for ARS salaries and expenses in FY2019, an 8.2% increase from FY2018. The House-reported bill recommends $1,259.9 billion, a 4.8% increase. The Administration had requested $1,019.0 billion. Additionally, the House-reported bill provides $136.0 million for buildings and facilities, while the Senate-passed bill does not allocate any funds for this purpose. In FY2019, ARS will take over the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) from DHS. The Senate-passed bill recommends $10.6 million for one-time costs related to the transfer of the science program to NBAF and $42 million for stand-up activities.

The Senate amendment proposes a $3.9 million greater rescission than enacted. The President's FY2019 budget request did not specify a rescission within the S&T account. The recent House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports did not specify funding for all sub-program areas in EPA's budget justification. Some S&T subprogram areas were not reported and labeled as \"NR.\" The President's FY2018 and FY2019 requests modified program area titles, which were adopted by the Appropriations Committees. Concerns were raised during hearings about proposed reductions and eliminations of EPA funding. The FY2019 budget request proposed reductions and eliminations of funding for EPA, including scientific research programs. The $6.19 billion FY2019 request for EPA was $2.70 billion less than the FY2018 enacted appropriations. The S&T account saw a reduction below FY2018 levels, representing 7.5% of the President's FY2019 total budget request for EPA. The FY2019 budget request proposed reductions and eliminations of funding for EPA, including scientific research programs. The requested FY2019 amount for the S&T account for individual EPA program areas and activities would be less than the FY2018 enacted appropriations. The House-passed H.R. 6147 program area and activity funding would be below or the same as the FY2018 enacted levels, but above the FY2019 requested level. The Senate passed amendment proposed funding for program areas and activities would be virtually the same as FY2018 enacted, with few exceptions, and above the FY2019 requested amounts. House and Senate committee reports include discussion under \"Additional Guidance\" for certain program areas and activities within the S&T account. The House and Senate Committee reports proposed funding for specific program areas and activities within the S&T account for FY2019, including national priorities for water quality research. The President's FY2019 budget request did not include funding for these national priorities. The President's FY2019 budget request did not include funding for national priorities. The largest proposed increase in the FY2019 budget request is for the \"Operations and Administration\" program area, with a $6.5 million (9.5%) increase above the FY2018 enacted level. The additional funding is for agency \"Workforce Reshaping\" and improving EPA's laboratories. House-passed H.R. 6147 and Senate-passed amendment proposed the same funding level for FY2019 as FY2018. The Senate Appropriations Committee specified no funding for workforce reshaping in its report. The FY2019 budget request did not include funding for workforce reshaping activities as proposed in the FY2018 budget request. The agency's workforce size and structure were debated during the FY2019 appropriations process. The workforce reshaping program aims to restructure the agency, reprioritize activities, and reallocate resources to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Funding for this program area was not included in the FY2019 congressional budget justification. The FY2019 budget justification includes funding for workforce reshaping, voluntary retirement, separation pay, and relocation costs. EPA's reform plan aims to implement Executive Order 13781 goals, including improving management of EPA laboratories. The FY2019 budget includes funding for workforce reshaping and implementing an enterprise-wide framework to manage laboratory capabilities. H.R. 6147 proposed restrictions on EPA's use of funds for regulatory actions and research. The Senate's version of the bill had similar provisions to previous fiscal year appropriations.
