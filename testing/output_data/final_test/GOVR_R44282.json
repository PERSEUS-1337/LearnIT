    "content": "Part A provides grant funds for medical and support services to eligible metropolitan and transitional areas with high numbers of people living with HIV. The areas are based on Metropolitan Statistical Areas and must meet specific criteria to remain eligible for funding. The 2006 reauthorization established a grant program for transitional grant areas (TGAs) in metropolitan areas with specific criteria. P.L. 111-87 allows areas with a certain number of living AIDS cases to remain eligible as TGAs. If an area loses TGA eligibility, the grant amount is affected. During FY2015, Part A grants were provided to 29 TGAs and 24 EMAs, totaling 53 jurisdictions. 75% of the funds for each Part A grant must be spent on core medical services, including outpatient/ambulatory care, ADAP treatments, oral health care, and mental health services. Core services spending requirement can be waived under certain conditions. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program allocates funds for core medical services for eligible individuals with HIV/AIDS under Part A. 25% of funds can be used for support services like outreach, transportation, and respite care. Coordination with other funding sources is required, with Part A serving as the \"payer of last resort.\" Two-thirds of Part A funds are distributed through formula grants, and the remaining one-third through competitive grants. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program distributes funds through formula and competitive grants. Supplemental grants are awarded based on need and weighting factors, including success in HIV/AIDS testing. CDC collects HIV case surveillance data for the program, transitioning to name-based reporting in 2005. Grant award amounts are based on living HIV/AIDS cases, not cumulative AIDS cases. The 2006 reauthorization of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program changed funding distribution to be based on the number of living HIV and AIDS cases in each EMA or TGA. This shift from code-based to name-based reporting was influenced by legislation, with a transition period provided for states to adapt. Starting from FY2013, only living name-based cases of HIV/AIDS are considered for Part A grant determinations. Part A grants are given to the chief elected official of the city or county in the EMA or TGA with the most HIV patients. The HIV Health Services Planning Councils, established by the official, set priorities for care delivery. The councils must reflect the local HIV epidemic's ethnic and racial makeup. Part A Planning Councils are required to develop strategies for identifying individuals with HIV/AIDS who are unaware of their status and connecting them with healthcare and support services. The 2006 reauthorization introduced restrictions on the use of unexpended funds for HIV/AIDS services, requiring eligible areas to return any unobligated funds if not spent within one year. A waiver can be requested to extend the spending deadline for formula grant funds, with an additional carryover year granted if approved. If funds are still not spent by the end of the carryover year, they must be returned. The 2006 reauthorization imposed restrictions on unexpended funds for HIV/AIDS services, requiring return if not spent within one year. If funds are not spent by the end of the carryover year, they must be returned. The 2009 reauthorization specified that the reduction in formula grant funds would not include approved carryover balances, and the reduction does not apply if the unobligated balance is 5% or less. Returned grant funds are available for Part A supplemental grants, while Part B grants can be used for various services for low-income individuals. ADAP, funded through specific appropriations within Part B, provides drug treatments for low-income individuals with HIV who lack coverage. Funds can also be used for health insurance and services to enhance treatment access and adherence. 75% of Part B funds must be spent on core medical services, with the remaining 25% for support services. P.L. 111-87 mandates a comprehensive plan to identify and provide access to HIV/AIDS testing for unaware individuals. The comprehensive plan must include efforts to remove legal barriers to routine HIV/AIDS testing for unaware individuals. Two-thirds of non-ADAP Part B funds are used for base awards, while one-third is reserved for a supplemental grant program. The Part B base award formula is based on the state's proportion of HIV/AIDS cases nationally, outside Part A-funded areas, and in states with no Part A funding. Funding distribution is now based on P.L. 109-415. P.L. 109-415 changed funding distribution based on living HIV/AIDS cases for states with name-based reporting systems. Some states hesitated due to privacy concerns, but a transition period was provided. P.L. 111-87 extended the transition period, and from FY2013, only living name-based cases are considered for Part B grants. One-third of non-ADAP Part B funds are reserved for a supplemental grant program under Section 2623(b)(2) of the PHS Act. Supplemental grant funds under Part B are reserved for eligible states with demonstrated financial need and no cancelled grant funds. Priority is given to states with funding declines due to changes in the distribution formula. Funds must be used for core medical services. HRSA must report to Congress within 45 days of awarding supplemental funds. An \"emerging community\" is defined as a metropolitan area with 500-1,000 reported AIDS cases in the past five years. The grant amount for AIDS cases is determined by the Secretary and the proportion of living cases in emerging communities. In 2013, 55.2% of HIV-positive people in the US received medications through state ADAPs based on each state's proportion of living HIV and AIDS cases. Beginning in FY2013, only living name-based cases of HIV/AIDS are used in making ADAP allocations. In FY2013, living name-based HIV/AIDS cases are used for ADAP grant determinations. 5% of the ADAP appropriation is set aside for supplemental grants for states with a severe need for HIV/AIDS drugs. States must have at least one drug from each class of HIV/AIDS drugs in their formulary based on HHS guidelines. Federal funds provided 43% of the national ADAP budget in FY2014. The AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) is the payer of last resort for HIV/AIDS drugs, coordinating with other programs like Medicaid to help people access necessary medications. States have had to implement cost containment measures in the past due to insufficient ADAP funds, but supplemental grants from the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations have helped alleviate this issue. Starting in FY2007, states were required to obligate grant funds by the end of the grant period. Starting in FY2007, states must obligate grant funds by the end of the grant year for various grants. If there is an unobligated balance, states must return the amount for certain grants, while for others, they can apply for a waiver to use the funds in the next year. If a state fails to use the funds in the carryover year, they must return the funds, which will be used for supplemental grants. The 2009 reauthorization allowed for a reduction in grants if there is an unobligated balance, except if it is 5% or less and approved for carryover. Drug rebates must be spent before federal funds, leading to penalties for states with late rebates. GAO reported that spending drug rebate funds first makes it challenging to avoid unobligated balances. HRSA attempted to address the issue of unobligated balances by requesting an exemption for grantees using drug rebates, which was denied. Under P.L. 111-87, states could have their unobligated balance reduced by the amount of ADAP rebate funds spent. Part C grants provide HIV primary care to low-income individuals, with 75% required for core medical services. Part C grants focus on underserved populations and require 75% for core medical services and 50% for early intervention services. Services include counseling, HIV testing, referrals, clinical and diagnostic services, drug treatments, mental health, substance abuse services, and support services. A $4 million increase for Part C was provided in FY2016. The Act of 2016 (H.R. 2029, P.L. 114-113) increased funding by $4 million for Part C in FY2016. Part D offers grants for family-centered care for individuals with HIV/AIDS, providing outpatient health care, case management, referrals, and services to recruit and retain youth with HIV. Grantees must coordinate with programs to reduce HIV/AIDS risk. Part D is the payer of last resort for clients with other health coverage. Obama Administration proposed merging Part D with Part C to expand focus on women, infants, children, and youth. In 2014, 67% of Part D Programs funded by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program were dually funded under Part C. The consolidation proposal to merge Part D with Part C was rejected by the House and the Senate in FY2015 and FY2016. Part E, which authorized grants for emergency response employees, was never funded. The 2006 reauthorization (P.L. 109-415) deleted sections of Part E on emergency response and incorporated sections from Part D with some text changes, along with new sections on public health emergencies and privacy protections. P.L. 111-87 reinstated language on \"procedures for the notification of occupational infectious diseases exposure\" into a new Part G of Title XXVI of the PHS Act, allowing the Secretary to suspend requirements in a public health emergency. Part F supports various programs related to HIV/AIDS care. The Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) includes programs like the ADR, Community-Based Dental Partnership Program, AETC, and SPNS, which provide oral health care, training, education, and grants for innovative HIV treatment models. The SPNS program is funded up to $25 million from Parts A, B, C, and D appropriations, with recent funding changes to direct budget authority. The FY2016 House appropriation bill and Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provide $25 million in budget authority for SPNS. The FY2017 request seeks $34 million for SPNS, including funding for a new initiative to address hepatitis C in people living with HIV. MAI, part of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, funds grants to address HIV/AIDS disparities among racial and ethnic minorities. HRSA is developing a formula for awarding MAI grants based on populations disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. GAO found that MAI grantees faced administrative challenges due to multiple funding streams, leading to inefficiencies and duplicative efforts. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended consolidating MAI funding into core HIV/AIDS funding to reduce inefficiencies and duplicative efforts. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agreed, stating it aligns with the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and federal program accountability goals. The NHAS is a five-year plan to guide the national response to the HIV epidemic, with goals to reduce new infections and improve access to care. The NHAS aims to reduce new HIV infections, improve access to care, address health disparities, and coordinate a national response. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program is crucial for providing lifesaving care and treatment. Early antiretroviral treatment can lead to viral suppression and reduce HIV transmission risk. However, only 30% of people living with HIV were virally suppressed in 2012. The Program grant awards support cities, states, and communities in treating HIV patients to achieve the goals of the updated NHAS. Prior to the ACA, obtaining private health insurance was challenging for individuals with HIV/AIDS. In 2012, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program served over half a million low-income individuals with HIV/AIDS in the US, with a significant portion being uninsured or underinsured. The CDC estimates that over 1.2 million people in the US have HIV/AIDS, with 28% uninsured and 59% underinsured. The ACA expanded insurance coverage, including Medicaid for low-income individuals and premium subsidies for those unable to afford private insurance. Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds were used to supplement insurance gaps for the underinsured. The ACA may impact the need for services provided by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. The ACA expanded insurance coverage, including Medicaid for low-income individuals and premium subsidies for those unable to afford private insurance. States have the option to expand Medicaid coverage for adults under 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level. This change affects the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and its service population. Some services provided under the program are not covered by the ACA. The Medicaid expansion was implemented by several states before January 2014, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Washington State. By November 2015, over half of all states had adopted the expansion. The expansion has a significant impact on the Ryan White ADAP program, with about half of ADAP clients being Medicaid-eligible in expansion states. HRSA is studying the effects of Medicaid expansion on ADAP, finding that expansion states reduced ADAP clients while non-expansion states saw an increase. In expansion states, ADAP funds can still supplement Medicaid coverage, helping with cost sharing and monthly prescriptions. The Medicaid expansion has minimal effects on the non-ADAP parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. Most non-ADAP clients are insured, and the program offers services like dental care not covered by all state Medicaid programs. Private health insurance includes group and non-group coverage, with the ACA making changes to non-group coverage. The ACA made changes to non-group coverage, benefiting people with HIV/AIDS by prohibiting policy cancellation due to preexisting conditions and eliminating lifetime caps on benefits. It also required U.S. citizens to have qualifying health insurance or pay a penalty, with private insurance plans needing to cover essential health benefits. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provides services not covered by exchange plans, such as case management and oral health care. The ACA created health insurance exchanges and subsidies for individuals with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level, with about half of ADAP clients eligible for premium subsidies. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds can be used to pay for insurance premiums and cost sharing on the exchange. A 2014 study found that these funds are increasingly being used to help individuals enroll in exchange plans and understand how to use insurance coverage. The ACA changes to insurance coverage have enabled some Ryan White clients to better manage their non-HIV related medical conditions. However, there have been challenges with coverage of HIV medication under exchange plans, with some individuals experiencing difficulty obtaining their medication due to high costs and plan design variations. The ACA expands insurance coverage to previously uninsured individuals, supporting changes to physician training, compensation, and practice to increase the medical workforce and incentivize practice in underserved areas. It also aims to incentivize changes to healthcare delivery by promoting patient-centered care models. Some insurance plans place HIV drugs in expensive tiers, leading to high out-of-pocket costs or reliance on Ryan White funds, potentially diverting funds from other expenses. The ACA promotes patient-centered care models, including health homes for individuals with chronic conditions in Medicaid. It also authorized the federal health center program and created the Community Health Center Fund. Despite some funds being used to supplement annual appropriations, the overall funding and services provided by health centers have increased. Many health centers also receive Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds. The impact of the ACA on the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program is still uncertain. Even if all states expand Medicaid coverage, gaps may still exist for undocumented or newly arrived immigrants with HIV/AIDS. Ryan White provides additional services like dental care and medical transportation that may not be covered by Medicaid or private insurance. Some analysts anticipate continued need for Ryan White funds to cover premiums and out-of-pocket expenses for individuals with private health insurance. The ACA's expansion of coverage may increase the demand for training healthcare providers, but concerns remain about physician shortages in certain areas or specialties. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program advocates emphasize its role in providing essential services and training. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program plays a public health role by providing health education, increasing treatment compliance to reduce HIV transmission, and retaining people in treatment through case management services. Its authority is currently expired, but Congress continues to appropriate funds for the program. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program's authority is expired, but Congress continues to fund it. The program may be affected by the ACA and state decisions on Medicaid expansion. The Obama Administration requested $2.323 billion for FY2016, with an increase going to Part C. The House bill proposed $2.319 billion for the program. The House bill proposed $2.319 billion for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, while the Senate bill would have provided $2.294 billion, $25 million less than the FY2015-enacted level. The President signed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2016, which funded the program through December 11, 2015, at the same level as in the FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, with a 0.2108% reduction. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided $2.323 billion for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program in FY2016, including $25 million for SPNS. The Obama Administration requested $2.298 billion in budget authority and $34 million for SPNS in FY2017, totaling $2.332 billion. There is a proposed $9 million increase for a new SPNS initiative to expand screening and treatment of hepatitis C in people living with HIV. The FY2017 budget request also suggests consolidating Part C and Part D. The FY2017 budget request proposes consolidating Part C and Part D, a plan previously rejected by Congress, aimed at improving services for individuals living with HIV."
