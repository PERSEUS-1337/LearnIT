    "content": "The U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, a free trade agreement, came into effect on May 15, 2012. It was implemented through legislation passed by the 112th Congress and signed into law by President Obama on October 21, 2011. The agreement aimed to eliminate tariffs and barriers in bilateral trade, with both governments working to review laws and regulations for its implementation. The U.S.-Colombia FTA negotiations resulted in the signing of the agreement on November 22, 2006, after modifications to include new labor and environmental provisions. The Colombian Congress approved the agreement in June and October 2007. Since the 1990s, Latin America and the Caribbean have been a focus of U.S. trade policy with agreements like NAFTA, U.S.-Chile FTA, CAFTA-DR, and U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. Post-2004, the focus shifted to completing trade negotiations with Colombia, Peru, and Panama, with the U.S.-Peru FTA approved in December 2007 and the U.S.-Panama FTA approved in October 2011. The expectation is that these agreements will bring economic benefits. The U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement aims to provide economic benefits for both countries by expanding trade, improving investor confidence, and increasing foreign direct investment in Colombia. Before the agreement, U.S. tariffs on Colombian goods were lower than Colombia's tariffs on U.S. goods. This agreement is part of Colombia's strategy to promote economic growth and stability. Before the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, Colombian tariffs were structured into three levels: 0% to 5% on certain goods, 10% on manufactured goods, and 15% to 20% on consumer goods. Exceptions included high duties on specific U.S. exports under the Andean Price Band System. Upon entry into force of the U.S.-Colombia FTA, Colombia ceased imposing variable tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports, including corn, wheat, rice, soybeans, pork, poultry parts, cheeses, and powdered milk. The agreement, reached after extensive negotiations over nearly two years, addressed concerns about the impact of liberalization on rural regions and smaller farmers. The U.S. agreed to longer phase-out periods for sensitive sectors like poultry and rice to allow Colombia time to adjust to trade liberalization. The U.S.-Colombia FTA eliminated 80% of duties on U.S. exports to Colombia upon entry into force, with an additional 7% duty-free after five years. Most remaining tariffs will be eliminated within 10 years. Over 99% of U.S. and almost 76% of Colombian industrial and textile tariff lines became duty-free immediately, with all tariffs in textiles and apparel to be duty-free by 2022. Colombia is to eliminate quotas and tariffs on agricultural products over a period of time, ranging from 3 to 19 years. The trade agreement provided immediate duty-free access on 77% of all agricultural tariff lines, with most other tariffs to be eliminated within 15 years. U.S. farm exports to Colombia received immediate duty-free treatment. The trade agreement with Colombia provides immediate duty-free access for U.S. farm exports, including high-quality beef, cotton, wheat, soybeans, fruits, vegetables, and processed food products. The agreement also includes improved market access for pork, beef, corn, poultry, dairy products, and more. Colombia removed its price band system on U.S. products and agreed to join the World Trade Organization's Information Technology Agreement. Colombia agreed to join the World Trade Organization's Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and eliminate barriers to information technology products. This includes allowing trade in remanufactured goods, duty-free treatment for textiles and apparel meeting origin requirements, and cooperation commitments for verifying claims of origin. The rules of origin are based on the yarn-forward standard to promote production and economic integration. The U.S. and Colombia agreed on provisions for production and economic integration in apparel trade. A special textile safeguard allows temporary tariff relief if imports harm domestic producers. Government procurement contracts grant non-discriminatory bidding rights. U.S. companies have access to Colombia's government enterprises. In services trade, Colombia exceeded WTO commitments by removing barriers for U.S. firms. Colombia agreed to eliminate investment barriers for U.S. firms, including requirements to hire nationals and establish branches. U.S. financial service suppliers have full rights to establish subsidiaries or branches. Investment provisions protect all forms of investment, including enterprises, debt, concessions, and intellectual property, treating U.S. investors as Colombian investors. The United States and Colombia have an agreement that treats U.S. investors in Colombia similarly to Colombian investors, providing substantive and procedural protections, including due process and fair market value in case of expropriation. The agreement also includes intellectual property rights protections for both U.S. and Colombian companies, ensuring equal treatment in all categories of intellectual property rights. The agreement between the United States and Colombia includes provisions for trademark protection, resolving disputes about trademarks in internet domain names, developing an online system for trademark registration, protecting copyrighted works in a digital economy, and enforcing rules for copyright infringement by Internet service providers. The U.S.-Colombia FTA includes provisions for protecting patents, trade secrets, test data, and newly developed plant varieties. It also addresses piracy of music and motion picture properties with penalties for piracy and counterfeiting. The U.S.-Colombia FTA includes IPR provisions with penalties for piracy and counterfeiting, mandates damages for copyright infringement, and ensures only U.S. and Colombian goods benefit from the agreement. It also includes customs procedures provisions and labor rights obligations. The U.S.-Colombia FTA includes labor rights obligations based on the 1998 ILO Declaration, ensuring fair working conditions and dispute settlement procedures. It also establishes a mechanism for labor cooperation and capacity building activities. The U.S.-Colombia FTA includes labor rights obligations based on the 1998 ILO Declaration, ensuring fair working conditions and dispute settlement procedures. It establishes a mechanism for bilateral or regional cooperation activities related to ILO labor standards, including compliance with ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. The agreement also covers environmental obligations, requiring both countries to enforce domestic environmental laws and fulfill obligations under multilateral environmental agreements. The U.S.-Colombia FTA includes environmental obligations to enforce laws and fulfill obligations under multilateral environmental agreements. The agreement ensures high levels of environmental protection, fair proceedings, and promotes market-based mechanisms for environmental protection. Civil society views are considered through a public submissions process, and all obligations are subject to dispute settlement procedures. The agreement's provisions on dispute panel proceedings promote openness and transparency through public hearings, release of legal submissions, and opportunities for third parties to submit views. Parties must attempt to resolve disputes through cooperation and consultations; if unsuccessful, an independent arbitral panel may be requested. Possible outcomes include monetary penalties or trade benefits suspension. Some Members of Congress in 2007 sought stronger provisions in pending U.S. FTAs, especially regarding core labor standards. After negotiations, bipartisan leaders and the Bush Administration agreed on a new trade framework in May 2007, including labor rights and environmental provisions in free trade agreements. Amendments to the U.S.-Colombia FTA were made to reflect this understanding, similar to those in the U.S.-Peru FTA. Key amendments include obligations related to ILO labor rights, environmental agreements, and pharmaceutical intellectual property rights. The Colombian Senate approved labor and environmental amendments to the U.S.-Colombia FTA, enforcing provisions through the dispute settlement mechanism. The amendments required adopting internationally recognized labor principles and strengthened earlier labor provisions. The bipartisan trade framework amendments aimed to enhance worker rights protection by including enforceable ILO core labor principles in the agreement, such as freedom of association, collective bargaining rights, elimination of forced labor, child labor abolition, and non-discrimination in employment. Changes also addressed labor law enforcement, ensuring signatories allocate resources without affecting compliance with labor provisions. The amended trade agreement includes provisions on labor obligations, intellectual property rights, government procurement, and port security. Concerns were raised about the original commitments impeding access to generic medicines for treating diseases like AIDS. The amended text aims to balance IPR protection for pharmaceutical companies with promoting access to generic medicines. The amended trade agreement includes provisions on data exclusivity for pharmaceuticals, government procurement, and port security. It allows for quicker entry of generic medicines in Colombia if certain conditions are met. Government contracts can now include adherence to labor laws and environmental protection requirements. Additionally, there are provisions for port security involving foreign-owned companies. The Labor Affairs Council of the U.S.-Colombia FTA met in Washington, DC to oversee the implementation of the labor chapter, reaffirming commitments to uphold rights as per the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The Labor Affairs Council of the U.S.-Colombia FTA met in Washington, DC to oversee the implementation of the labor chapter, discussing Colombia's progress and challenges in fulfilling the FTA's labor provisions. Colombia's population is 49 million, making it the third-most populous country in Latin America, with the fourth-largest economy in the region. Colombia's economy is the fourth-largest in Latin America, with a GDP of $714 billion in 2017. The country's exports and imports were 14% and 19% of its GDP, respectively. The United States is Colombia's main trading partner, but overall trade has decreased in recent years. Colombia has regional trade agreements with many Latin American countries. Colombia has regional trade agreements with Central America Northern Triangle, Mexico, Mercosur, and Chile. It also has FTAs with Canada, the European Union, and South Korea. Colombia is part of the Pacific Alliance with Chile, Mexico, and Peru, aiming to eliminate tariffs on 92% of goods traded within the Alliance. The United States has observer status within the Alliance. Colombia accounts for about 1% of U.S. total trade. In 2017, Colombia ranked 22nd among U.S. export markets and 27th among foreign exporters to the United States. U.S. merchandise exports to Colombia totaled $13.3 billion, while imports totaled $13.4 billion. The dominant U.S. import category from Colombia was crude oil and gas, followed by gold, coffee, and fresh-cut flowers. Leading U.S. export categories to Colombia included non-crude petroleum products, corn, and telephone sets. U.S. exports to Colombia increased in 2017 but did not surpass the 2015 figure. In 2009, U.S. exports to Colombia decreased to $9.5 billion from $11.4 billion in 2008, following global trade trends after the financial crisis. Between 2003 and 2008, exports to Colombia increased from $3.8 billion to $11.4 billion. In 2017, U.S. imports from Colombia decreased to $13.4 billion, down from $13.8 billion in 2016. Trade in services with Colombia totaled $9.2 billion in 2016, with U.S. services exports at $6.2 billion and imports at $3.0 billion. In 2016, the U.S. had a services trade surplus of $3.2 billion with Colombia. The main U.S. services import category from Colombia was travel, followed by air transport, business services, and telecommunications. The leading U.S. services export categories to Colombia were travel, air and sea transport, telecommunications, and charges for intellectual property. U.S. services exports to Colombia decreased to $6.2 billion in 2016 from $6.4 billion in 2015, while services imports decreased to $3.2 billion from $3.3 billion in 2015. In 2016, U.S. services exports to Colombia decreased to $6.2 billion from $6.4 billion in 2015, while services imports decreased to $3.2 billion from $3.3 billion in 2015. U.S. foreign direct investment in Colombia totaled $6.2 billion in 2016, down from $7.1 billion in 2014 and $6.5 billion in 2015. The largest amount of FDI was in mining, followed by manufacturing and finance/insurance. The U.S.-Colombia FTA is expected to boost investor confidence and increase foreign investment. The United States is expected to have a small, positive economic effect from the trade liberalization with Colombia. The adjustment costs in Colombia may arise as industries adapt to lower trade barriers. However, the overall impact on the U.S. economy is projected to be minimal due to Colombia's small economy and the low percentage of trade with the U.S. The removal of tariff barriers by Colombia is likely to have the most significant economy-wide trade effects. The U.S. already had duty-free imports from Colombia before the agreement, so the marginal effects of the FTA on the U.S. economy are not expected to be significant. The 2006 USITC study assessed the potential effects of a U.S.-Colombia FTA on the U.S. economy, predicting increased U.S. exports to Colombia and a $1.1 billion increase in exports. The largest increases in U.S. exports would be in chemical, rubber, and plastic products; machinery and equipment; and motor vehicles and parts. The USITC reviewed studies on the economic effects of a U.S.-Colombia FTA. The largest increases in U.S. exports would be in rice and dairy products, while the largest estimated increases in U.S. imports from Colombia would be in sugar and crops. The FTA would have minimal impact on most U.S. sectors, with the sugar sector being the only one expected to decline. Studies varied in their predictions, with one estimating a 2.4% to 8.3% increase in U.S. exports to Colombia. Two studies found varying estimates on the impact of a U.S.-Colombia FTA, with one predicting a 2.0% to 44% increase in U.S. exports and another predicting a 2.0% to 37% increase in U.S. imports from Colombia. The largest increases were expected in agriculture products, metal and wood, and food products for exports, and in apparel and leather goods, textile products, and metal and wood for imports. Overall, the FTA was projected to result in small welfare gains for both countries and a positive impact on the U.S. agricultural sector. The study on the U.S.-Colombia FTA projected a 37% increase in U.S. imports from Colombia and a 44% increase in U.S. exports to Colombia. Welfare gains were expected for both countries, with larger benefits for Colombia. The agreement would have minor sectoral effects on the U.S. economy but more significant impacts on Colombia due to its smaller size. Structural adjustment issues were noted for Colombia, particularly in the displacement of low-skilled workers, but job possibilities were expected in expanding sectors. The U.S.-Colombia FTA may lead to trade diversion, where goods from the U.S. replace cheaper imports from other countries in Latin America. The IIE study suggests that while the FTA may not cause trade diversion in the U.S., it could have some impact in Colombia. The IIE study estimated that a U.S.-Colombia FTA would decrease Colombia's imports from other countries by approximately 9%. The USITC study found that the FTA would increase U.S. agricultural exports to Colombia, particularly in meat products. Colombia's removal of trade barriers under the FTA would likely result in increased exports to the United States. The U.S.-Colombia FTA would likely increase U.S. grain exports to Colombia, with rice accounting for most of the increase. Soybeans, soybean products, and animal feeds would also see an increase. Colombia would gain more secure market access to the U.S. for agricultural products, while U.S. exports would gain a preference in the Colombian market. Tariff phasing and safeguard provisions would mitigate the impact of increased imports from the U.S. The study on the pending FTA shows that Colombia would initially lose $63 million, but gain $550 million annually in the long term, equivalent to a 0.5% GDP increase. Concerns about labor rights violations and violence in Colombia have led to opposition to the FTA by some Members of Congress. The Obama Administration and policymakers expressed concerns about labor rights violations and violence in Colombia, leading to opposition to the FTA. Some supporters argued that Colombia has made progress in curbing violence and is a crucial ally in Latin America. The Colombian government responded to U.S. concerns and acknowledged the need for improvement. The Colombian government acknowledged improvements in reducing killings of labor union activists and teachers since 2002, with a significant decrease in assassinations. However, there were fluctuations in the number of murders reported by different sources, with varying figures recorded in different years. Colombia's Ministry of Labor reported a 51% decrease in the homicide rate for labor union members between 2010-2016. The Colombian government reported a 51% decrease in the homicide rate for labor union members between 2010-2016. The United States and Colombia negotiated an \"Action Plan Related to Labor Rights\" to address concerns about violence against union members and workers' rights in Colombia. The Colombian government made commitments to address U.S. concerns regarding labor rights. The Action Plan included obligations with target dates up to 2014, such as hiring extra labor inspectors. By November 2011, a new Labor Ministry was established as part of the plan. President Santos appointed Rafael Pardo to lead the ministry on October 31, 2011. Santos appointed Liberal Party leader Rafael Pardo to head Colombia's new Labor Ministry, aiming to enhance labor rights enforcement. The Ministry was created to strengthen labor laws, separate from the Ministry of Social Protection under the Uribe Administration. The Action Plan included hiring 480 new labor inspectors by December 2011. The Colombian government aims to enhance labor rights enforcement by hiring 480 new labor inspectors over four years, with 100 new inspectors hired in 2011 and budgeting for an additional 100 in 2012. They plan to improve the system for citizens to file complaints through a toll-free hotline and web-based mechanism, as well as enhance mediation and conflict resolution in all 32 departments. Legislation has been submitted to reform the criminal code. The Colombian government submitted legislation to the Congress to establish criminal penalties for employers undermining labor rights, with violators facing up to five years in prison. The legislation also accelerates the effective date of a law prohibiting labor rights violations. The Colombian government submitted legislation to the Congress to establish criminal penalties for employers undermining labor rights, with violators facing up to five years in prison. The legislation also accelerates the effective date of a law prohibiting labor rights violations to June 15, 2011. The Labor Ministry was to direct 50 new labor inspectors to be assigned exclusively to cases involving cooperatives, with hiring and training to be completed by December 15, 2011. Inspections in priority sectors like palm oil, sugar, mines, ports, and flowers were to begin by April 22, 2011. Regulations implementing the 2010 cooperatives law were to be issued by June 15, 2011. The Colombian government submitted legislation to Congress to establish criminal penalties for employers undermining labor rights, with violators facing up to five years in prison. The legislation also accelerates the effective date of a law prohibiting labor rights violations to June 15, 2011. The purpose of these regulations is to clarify earlier cooperatives laws, increase inspections, sanctions for labor law violators, and ensure cooperatives are autonomous and self-governing. The Colombian government agreed to work with the U.S. government to enforce these regulations and provide quarterly reports on the enforcement results. The Colombian government committed to implementing measures to prevent the use of temporary service agencies to circumvent labor rights, including improving inspection processes, training labor inspectors, and creating databases to identify regions with abuses. The enforcement regime includes monitoring and reporting mechanisms for all interested parties to verify compliance with labor laws. Quarterly reports will be issued with results of inspections, penalties, fines, license cancellations, and violators list. The government will share a draft of the enforcement plan with the U.S. government by April 22. The Colombian government committed to implementing measures to prevent the use of temporary service agencies to circumvent labor rights. They conducted preventive inspections and fully implemented the enforcement plan by December 15, 2011. The criminal code reform included provisions to prohibit the use of collective pacts to undermine the right to organize and bargain collectively. The Labor Ministry is enforcing the reforms through public outreach campaigns and preventive inspections. The Labor Ministry in Colombia is enforcing reforms through preventive inspections and new labor complaint mechanisms to detect and prosecute violations. The government has committed to requesting technical assistance from the International Labor Organization (ILO) to monitor the use of collective pacts and work with the U.S. government to ensure agreed objectives are addressed. The Ministry of Social Protection (MSP) is collecting Colombian doctrine, case law, and jurisprudence on essential services and disseminating this information to relevant parties. The formal request to the ILO for technical assistance was completed by September 15, 2011. The Colombian government sought assistance from the ILO to implement measures in the Action Plan, expand the protection program to include labor activists, union formers, and increase resources by 50% for FY2011. The Colombian government requested additional funding for the protection program in FY2012 and committed to eliminating the backlog of risk assessments for union members by July 30, 2011. They also pledged to implement a national policy for conducting risk assessments within a 30-day period and provide monthly updates on the progress. Additionally, a decree was to be issued by September 15, 2011, to reform the interagency committee responsible for reviewing risk assessments. The Colombian government agreed to enhance objectivity in risk assessments by forming a new committee with representatives from the Inspector General's Office and the Public Defender's Office. They also committed to sharing relevant parts of a draft decree with the U.S. government by April 22, 2011, and to strengthen the protection system by implementing administrative measures. Additionally, Colombia agreed to amend the teacher relocation and protection program to ensure meritorious requests are granted and eliminate sanctions against teachers not deemed at extraordinary risk. Colombia agreed to assign 95 additional full-time judicial police investigators to support prosecutors investigating criminal cases involving union members and activists. The government also approved increased funding for the Prosecutor General's Office to reduce impunity and implement the Action Plan. The Prosecutor General submitted the budget request by May 20, 2011. The General's Office of Colombia informed the government of actions taken to combat impunity in cases involving union members and labor activists, including issuing directives for investigators, sharing evidence, developing training programs, and working with the U.S. government. Developed a plan and specified budgetary needs by May 20, 2011, to strengthen institutional capacity, prosecutors, and judicial police investigators; Finalized an analysis by July 15, 2011, on closed cases of homicides of union members and activists to improve future investigations and prosecutions; Widely publicized results to reduce impunity and deter future crimes; Identified budgetary needs for victims' assistance centers specialized in human rights cases, with staff expertise in human rights and labor issues; Shared plans and budget allocations with the U.S. government by June 15, 2011; Developed a program by the Prosecutor General's Office to address backlog of unionist homicide cases. The Prosecutor General's Office developed a program to address the backlog of unionist homicide cases by meeting with union confederations and the National Labor School, providing internal guidance to prosecutors, and improving public reporting of completed criminal cases involving labor violence. The U.S. and Colombian governments agreed to assess progress in implementing the Action Plan periodically. The United States and Colombia agreed to continue bilateral meetings to discuss progress on commitments under the Action Plan, including additional technical-level meetings and possible future meetings. Colombian labor confederations responded favorably to working with the Santos Administration and business representatives on labor issues, especially related to work cooperatives. President Santos' proposal under the 2010 labor cooperatives law was well-received by the Secretary General of Colombia's National Labor Confederation. President Santos' proposal under the 2010 labor cooperatives law was praised as a significant achievement for the trade union movement in Colombia. While some unions support the Action Plan, others oppose the FTA with the United States due to concerns about labor abuses in cooperatives. The Solidarity Center in the Andean Region argues that Colombia has not fully implemented the 2010 Cooperatives Law, as the decree signed in June 2011 is considered incomplete. Some Colombian unions oppose the FTA with the United States despite a tripartite labor agreement reached in May 2011. The agreement includes a request for ILO cooperation on the Action Plan measures, but major labor confederations like CTC and CUT did not sign it. The General Labor Confederation (CGT) and the Colombian Pensioners Confederation (CPC) signed the agreement, stating it was a significant advancement for the labor movement in Colombia. Proponents argue it improves market access for U.S. exporters, especially in agriculture. The National Pork Producers Council sees new export opportunities for U.S. pork producers. U.S. exporters were concerned about losing market share in Colombia due to FTAs with other countries before the agreement's passage. The U.S. faced concerns about losing market share in Colombia due to FTAs with other countries. U.S. wheat producers noted a decline in Colombia's wheat market share after the Colombia-Canada FTA. Colombia signed multiple FTAs with Latin American countries, the EU, EFTA, and joined the Pacific Alliance. There are worries in Colombia about the negative impact of the U.S.-Colombia FTA on small farmers. Many in Colombia's farming sector are concerned that the U.S.-Colombia FTA is hurting small farmers by allowing lower-cost imports to enter the market, leading to competition and putting local food production at risk. This has led to protests and strikes by agricultural workers and their supporters against President Santos' trade liberalization policies. The trade liberalization and privatization policies in Colombia are negatively impacting small farmers, who are now competing with subsidized U.S. products and facing market fluctuations. Farmers are protesting for more government protection and services, with reports of police using tear gas and the army patrolling the streets. Human rights organizations accuse Colombian military personnel of violating protestors' rights through beatings and unwarranted arrests. Additionally, farmers struggle with expensive credit rates, production supplies, and poor supply routes for transporting goods. The Colombian government responded to protests by reshuffling the cabinet, negotiating with protestors, and announcing a \"National Pact\" for the agriculture industry. Concessions included regulated fertilizer prices, a freeze on imports, and suspending a resolution against seed production. The Colombian government made concessions to protestors, including regulated fertilizer prices and a freeze on imports. U.S. labor groups oppose the U.S.-Colombia FTA, citing attacks on Colombia's labor movement through violence, intimidation, and legal challenges. The AFL-CIO remains concerned about the government's commitment to protect worker rights despite some progress. The U.S.-Colombia FTA was announced in 2011, with Colombian labor unions having mixed opinions. Some unions supported the agreement, citing progress in protecting worker rights by the Colombian government. They believed it would create jobs in various industries. The CGT representatives acknowledged positive changes under the Uribe and Santos Administrations. Some Colombian union representatives believed the violence in Colombia was due to conflict with guerrillas and paramilitaries, not targeting union workers. However, others, including the Central Union of Workers (CUT), opposed the U.S.-Colombia FTA, arguing it would interfere with the government's governance rights and negatively impact the economy. The CUT also criticized the labor chapter in the agreement for not adequately protecting worker rights and believed the Action Plan Related to Labor Rights would not end impunity for crimes against unionists in Colombia. The United States, Colombia, and the ILO are working on implementing the Labor Action Plan to address high levels of impunity and lack of justice for crimes against unionists in Colombia. This includes supporting the establishment of a separate Ministry of Labor to elevate the importance of labor issues within the Colombian Government. Regular meetings and ongoing engagement focus on providing technical assistance and building the institutional capacity of Colombia's Ministry of Labor. Both governments acknowledge progress made by Colombia but also highlight areas of concern such as fines for labor violations and targeted inspections in priority sectors. Colombia has made progress in lowering its unemployment rate since the U.S.-Colombia FTA entered into force, with the rate decreasing from 10.4% to 9.4% between 2012 and 2017. Efforts are being made to protect vulnerable groups, including an increase in the annual budget to protect union leaders. The number of union leaders protected has also increased, with Colombia excluded from the 2015, 2016, and 2017 lists of member states invited to appear for the annual International Labor Conference's Committee on the Application of Standards. Colombia's progress in applying international labor standards was highlighted at the 2017 International Labor Conference in Geneva. The country was excluded from the list of member states invited to appear, indicating recognition for its efforts in labor rights and inspection. Colombia continues to collaborate with the International Labor Organization to promote job creation, particularly in rural areas. The ILO Director emphasized cooperation to create formal sector jobs in Colombia and move away from informality. Some Members of Congress expressed concerns about the Labor Action Plan's implementation. A 2013 congressional staff report acknowledged Colombian government efforts to protect worker rights but noted that conditions for workers and activists had not improved. Key findings included pervasive indirect employment, an ineffective inspection system, and weak worker protections. Prior to the approval of the U.S.-Colombia FTA, labor groups raised concerns about indirect employment relationships in Colombia, such as labor cooperatives, leading to a lack of worker rights protection and lower benefits. The Colombian government recognized the issues and implemented reforms, including a key law passed in 2010. Article 63 of Ley 1429, passed by Colombia's Congress in 2010, introduces stronger measures to protect worker rights and impose sanctions on violators. The law increases penalties for violations, holds inspectors accountable, and enhances bargaining rights for cooperative workers. Originally set to take effect in July 2013, the law was accelerated to June 2011 as part of an agreement with the United States. Critics argue that cooperative work arrangements lead to worker oppression and hinder union participation. Critics argue that cooperative work arrangements in Colombia lead to worker oppression, prevent union participation, and deny basic benefits. Marginalized groups, like the Afro-Colombian population, are especially vulnerable. Labor representatives urged Congress to delay the FTA until labor laws improved. Despite an Action Plan, indirect employment relationships persist, hindering workers' rights. The government claims cooperatives must provide benefits but many fail to comply, leading to increased inspections and sanctions. Between 2007 and January 2011, Colombian inspectors conducted numerous investigations and imposed sanctions on work areas, resulting in a decrease in cooperative workers from 2 million to 600,000 and cooperatives from 12,317 to 4,555. In 2012 and 2013, formalization agreements between employers and workers led to 15,700 workers transitioning to permanent direct employment in various sectors. The Colombian government addressed U.S. concerns about worker rights protection through these agreements. The Embassy of Colombia in the United States reported on the progress made in strengthening worker rights in Colombia since 2001. Government reforms since 2002 have protected rights to form unions, bargain collectively, and strike. Homicides decreased significantly, and a protection program led to an 86% reduction in homicides of union members. The Colombian government disputes claims that it is the most dangerous country for union members, citing different data tracking methods. They argue that many victims of violence are union members but may not have been targeted for their union activities. In April 2016, the Obama Administration recognized Colombia's progress in labor rights, including reductions in fake worker cooperatives and improved labor conditions. The report highlighted reductions in fake worker cooperatives and increased labor inspectors in Colombia. However, illegal subcontracting is a growing concern, and the government has been slow to address labor law violations and collect fines from employers. The Obama Administration has been working closely with Colombia on these issues, including sending a labor attach\u00e9 to the U.S. Embassy in Bogota. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has emphasized the importance of worker rights in Colombia. Colombian officials believe that the U.S.-Colombia FTA and Labor Action Plan showcase significant cooperation on labor issues. In 2016, the U.S. Office of Trade and Labor Affairs (OTLA) received a complaint from Colombian labor organizations and AFL-CIO, alleging that the Colombian Government had not upheld labor rights outlined in the FTA. The complaint cited failures in protecting workers' rights to association and bargaining, particularly in industries like petroleum and sugar. The U.S. Office of Trade and Labor Affairs (OTLA) investigated claims of labor rights violations in Colombia, highlighting issues with the Labor Inspectorate, inspection process, and fines collection. They also noted Colombia's high impunity rate for violence against unionists, unlawful collective labor pacts, and widespread subcontracting. OTLA provided 19 recommendations to address these problems. The U.S. Office of Trade and Labor Affairs (OTLA) investigated labor rights issues in Colombia, recommending improvements to the labor inspection system, prosecution of violence against unionists, and addressing abusive subcontracting practices. Colombia has made progress in implementing some of the recommendations, with OTLA planning to reevaluate the government's actions within nine months. The Ministry of Labor in Colombia implemented an electronic case management system and converted inspector positions into career civil servant roles to address high turnover rates. Other changes include remedial training for employees and increased budget appropriation for 2018. The U.S. Office of Trade and Labor Affairs will continue to monitor Colombia's progress with the help of the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Trade Representative."
