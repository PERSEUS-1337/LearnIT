The Act titled the \"Oxon Run Parkway Land Transfer and Restoration Act\" defines key terms such as \"ancillary facilities,\" \"District,\" \"initial sale,\" \"low and moderate income,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Act titled the \"Oxon Run Parkway Land Transfer and Restoration Act\" defines key terms for conveyance of property to District of Columbia for low and moderate income housing use. The Secretary of the Interior is required to convey property to the District of Columbia for development into single-family houses for low and moderate income individuals, along with recreational facilities. The Secretary must disclose the property's condition before the conveyance. The property described in section 4 is a portion of land in the District of Columbia, formerly known as United States Reservation 501, consisting of approximately 25 acres. It is bordered by South Capital Street, Oxon Run Parkway, and the boundary between Maryland and the District of Columbia. Upon conveyance of the property to the District, the transfer of jurisdiction from the National Park Service will be null and void, the property will no longer be part of Oxon Run Park, and liability for its condition and remediation will lie with the District. Inspection and treatment of the conveyed property will be conducted. Following conveyance of the property to the District, inspections and treatments will be conducted to ensure suitability for use, with costs borne by the District. The District will then reconvey the property to the United States. The District may reconvey the property to the United States without cost if it cannot use it for the Act's purposes. The District will bear the expenses of reconveyance, and any claims prior to reconveyance remain its responsibility. This action does not imply liability and cannot be legally challenged until all restoration actions are finished. The conveyance of property under section 3(a) is subject to the condition that it be developed into a community of single-family houses for low and moderate-income individuals with recreational facilities. If construction is not started within four years or not completed, the property reverts to the United States. The Secretary will determine if a reversion is necessary for the property conveyed in section 3(a) of the Act, excluding areas with single-family houses and facilities for low and moderate-income individuals. The Secretary will consult with the Mayor of the District of Columbia before determining if any property conveyed under the Act is subject to reversion to the United States. The periods mentioned in this section can be extended during lawsuits or environmental activities by the District. Following reversion to the United States, all claims and judgments from that period will be addressed. Upon reversion of the property to the United States, all claims and judgments from the period prior to reversion will remain the responsibility of the owner of the property. Any leases, rights, or privileges to use the reverted portion of the property will be extinguished. SEC. 9. SAVINGS PROVISIONS. This Act does not endorse any development on the property, does not exempt the District from laws post-conveyance, allows for additional conditions on property development, and requires compliance with environmental laws by the United States."
