    "content": "The focus of recent research has been on modeling style in synthesizing natural human speech from text. State-of-the-art approaches train an encoder-decoder network on paired text and audio samples to reconstruct the audio waveform. However, modeling style in text-to-speech (TTS) is challenging, and training models with a reconstruction loss alone is not sufficient. A new end-to-end TTS model is introduced in this work, which offers improved content-style disentanglement and controllability by combining pairwise training, an adversarial game, and a collaborative game in one training scheme. The proposed model in this work delivers a controllable generator and a disentangled representation for synthesizing human-like speech from text. It achieves state-of-the-art results in style transfer, emotion modeling, and identity transfer tasks. The model focuses on style modeling, which is crucial for Text-To-Speech systems using deep neural networks. The proposed model focuses on style modeling for synthesizing human-like speech from text, using Tacotron-based approaches to specify expected style with reference speech audio. The model uses latent variables to encode content and style separately, allowing for the generation of new audio waveforms conditioned on both. This approach aims to improve style transfer and speech synthesis tasks by disentangling content and style representations. The proposed model enhances controllability and disentanglement ability by training on paired and unpaired text-audio samples, addressing limitations in prior work. The model trains on paired and unpaired text-audio samples, using adversarial and collaborative games to match joint data distribution and minimize distance between real and generated samples in original and latent space. Additional losses like reconstruction and style loss are introduced for explicit style constraints. The generator and discriminator compete and collaborate to achieve controllability and disentanglement. The model delivers a controllable generator and disentangled representation for Text-to-Speech (TTS) by conditioning on a style variable. Tacotron-based systems solve this using a conditional probabilistic model with content and style variables. The model provides a controllable generator for Text-to-Speech by conditioning on a style variable. It involves sampling content and style variables from input text and audio, and maximizing the log-likelihood during training. The goal is to learn an injective mapping for a one-to-one correspondence between input conditions and output audio waveform. The model aims to disentangle style components from other factors in audio data to prevent copying of waveform information. A proposed approach combines adversarial and collaborative games to train a Text-to-Speech stylization model, swapping style components to maintain content consistency. The proposed model uses adversarial games to disentangle style components in audio data, ensuring content consistency. It involves training with generative adversarial networks to assign high probabilities to target domain elements. The model utilizes a conditional GAN to model joint distribution of audio and content, enforcing decisions based on content variables. The discriminator is a ternary classifier, enhancing its power compared to traditional binary classifiers. The model uses a ternary discriminator to distinguish subtle differences in audio samples. However, the adversarial game alone is insufficient to find the desired distribution due to a lack of supervision on what certain variables should represent. Explicit constraints are imposed on generated samples to address this issue. The model imposes explicit constraints on generated samples with a style loss and a reconstruction loss. The gram matrix of feature maps computed from a mel-spectrogram captures local statistics of an audio signal in the frequency-time domain, representing low-level characteristics of sound. Certain characteristics, such as emotion, are captured by local statistics in the time-frequency domain. A temporary reduction in the average fundamental frequency correlates with sarcasm expression. Past studies on prosody focused on spectral characteristics. Gram matrices are computed from feature maps of mel-spectrograms. Style loss is calculated as the L2 distance between these matrices. A four-layer CNN with random weights is found to perform well for mel-spectrograms, unlike VGG-19 pretrained on ImageNet. A simple four-layer CNN with random weights, denoted by R, is effective for capturing low-level image statistics in mel-spectrograms. Reconstruction in the original mel-spectrogram space is encouraged using deterministic encoding functions and an inference network C. C and Enc s share layers, with a final fully-connected layer outputting parameters for the conditional distribution p c (z c |x aud). To train p c (z c |x aud), a collaborative game in the latent space is defined. Minimizing terms w.r.t. C guides it towards the true posterior, while enhancing G with extra controllability. Minimizing both L sty and L rec drives the model to match the data distribution and posterior. The model is trained with a combination of GAN, style, and reconstruction losses. Our model, based on Tacotron, uses \u03b1 = 0.1, \u03b2 = 10 in experiments to predict mel-spectrograms from character sequences. The Griffin-Lim method is used for fast waveform generation. The style encoder combines reference encoder and style token layers. The inference network C processes style embeddings through fully-connected layers for classification. The model utilizes a 2-D fully-convolution neural network with four layers for classification. A style and content fusion unit is added to the discriminator architecture. The model is trained with a minibatch size of 32 using the Adam optimizer for 200K steps for EMT-4 and 280K steps for VCTK datasets. During testing, only text and audio pairs are inputted into the model for Text-To-Speech (TTS) without the need for unpaired audios. Various TTS models like WaveNet, DeepVoice, VoiceLoop, Char2Wav, BID18, BID20, BID32, and Tacotron have made significant progress. DeepVoice2 and DeepVoice3 use lookup tables for speaker identities, while VoiceLoop can synthesize voices of unseen speakers during testing. Tacotron-based approaches like Tacotron-prosody and prosody-Tacotron are also explored. Domain mapping using GANs like Cycle-GAN and UNIT for image-to-image translation, StackGAN for text-to-image generation, and DA-GAN for cross-domain transformations. Other approaches include Tacotron-prosody and prosody-Tacotron for style embedding from audio waveforms, and GST for capturing acoustic styles. Our work focuses on one-sided cross-domain mapping in text and speech domains without cycle consistency loss, inspired by Bicycle GAN. We are the first to approach TTS as a cross-domain mapping problem using GANs, similar to style transfer in image processing. In this work, the authors adopt the image style transfer concept to impose explicit style constraints on audio mel-spectrogram. They evaluate their model on disentanglement ability, style modeling effectiveness, and controllability using two datasets: EMT-4 and VCTK. EMT-4 consists of American English audio-text samples with four emotion categories, while VCTK is a multi-speaker dataset. The study compares their method with three state-of-the-art approaches on the VCTK dataset, which contains recordings of clean speech from 109 speakers. The audio clips are preprocessed by downsampling to 24kHz and trimming silence, reducing the duration. The comparison includes prosody-Tacotron, GST, and DeepVoice2, focusing on the reconstruction error of style embeddings. The study evaluates their model by reconstructing audio samples from style embeddings. An autoencoder is trained with the same architecture as the style encoder for this task. The baseline reconstruction error is 0.12 using only L2 loss. The decoder network is then trained using precomputed style embeddings from different approaches. The study evaluates different approaches for training the decoder network using reconstruction loss. Prosody-Tacotron has the lowest reconstruction error, while GST shows improvement with a style token layer. DeepVoice2 performs well on modeling speaker identities. The model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both datasets, with the adversarial loss providing a significant improvement. The study evaluates various training approaches for the decoder network, showing improvement with a style token layer. Adding style and reconstruction losses to the baseline GST model resulted in worse results. Adversarial training helps optimize the model, allowing for better performance with style and reconstruction losses. Qualitative evaluation involves generating audio samples from different text and audio pairs. The study explores training approaches for the decoder network, highlighting the benefits of a style token layer. Results show that adding style and reconstruction losses to the baseline GST model led to worse outcomes. Adversarial training improved model optimization, enhancing performance with style and reconstruction losses. Qualitative evaluation includes generating audio samples from text and audio pairs, showcasing disentangled content and style components in parallel and unparalleled style transfer. The study evaluates the effectiveness of a model in disentangling style and content components, achieving 86% accuracy in emotion classification. It also demonstrates the model's ability to produce generic feature representation for various auditory styles, including speaker identity, comparable to i-vector representation in speaker verification systems. Visualization of style embedding is shown in FIG2. The visualization in FIG2 displays clear boundaries between different style categories such as emotion and speaker identity. \"Sad\" speech is notably distant from other emotion categories due to its lower pitch, while \"neutral\" falls in the middle. Male and female samples also show distinct boundaries. A good TTS system should allow users to control both content and style in the output. A good TTS system should allow users to control both content and style of the output. Factors affecting controllability include fidelity and naturalness. Fidelity is validated through a speech recognition task, showing that the model performs comparably with state-of-the-art approaches. Results suggest that all compared methods perform well in controlling verbal content in TTS. Our model avoids overfitting by using unpaired samples during training, acting as a strong regularizer. Classification accuracy for synthesized samples is evaluated through a classification task, with classifiers achieving 98% and 83% accuracy for EMT-4 and VCTK datasets, respectively. Testing is done on 1000 samples from EMT-4 and samples from both seen and unseen speakers in VCTK. Our model performs well on EMT-4 dataset and outperforms prosody-Tacotron and GST. It also shows good performance on VCTK dataset for seen speakers, but struggles with unseen speakers. Qualitative evaluation includes style transfer experiments comparing our model with GST on modeling varied styles in EMT-4. Our model outperforms prosody-Tacotron and GST on EMT-4 dataset. We conducted a style transfer experiment with four reference audios ('happy', 'angry', 'sad', 'neutral') producing 60 new audio samples. A subjective study with seven participants compared our model to prosody-Tacotron using 7-point ratings. Our model was rated significantly closer to the reference in emotion samples and individual styles (neutral, happy, sad, angry). The results show that our model can synthesize speech with correct content and styles better than the state-of-the-art comparison. Additionally, our model outperformed prosody-Tacotron in mean opinion score (MOS) naturalness tests with a score of 4.3, surpassing previous reports. The proposed end-to-end conditional generative model for TTS style modeling, built upon Tacotron, demonstrates enhanced content-style disentanglement and controllability. Through a pairwise training approach involving adversarial and collaborative games, the model generates highly controllable speech signals with natural human-like qualities. It outperforms previous models in synthesizing high fidelity speech with correct content and realistic style, establishing state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. Future research could explore training on unpaired data. The proposed model for TTS style modeling, based on Tacotron, achieves content-style disentanglement and controllability. It outperforms previous models in generating high-quality speech. Future research could focus on training with unpaired data to reduce alignment work. Architecture details include encoder and decoder networks, with specific parameter settings provided. The Conv1D projection has three layers with 128 units and ReLU activation. Followed by four fully-connected layers with 128 units and ReLU activation. The final Bidirectional GRU has 128 cells. The style encoder includes a reference encoder and style token layers, with Conv2D layers having filters [32, 32, 64, 64, 128, 128] and a single-layer GRU with 128 units. The reference embedding is produced by a fully-connected layer with 128 units and tanh activation. 10 global style tokens (GSTs) are randomly initialized in the style token layers. The style encoder includes a reference encoder and style token layers with 10 global style tokens (GSTs) that are randomly initialized. The inference network shares the same architecture as Enc s, with a new N-way classifier added on top. The decoder network architecture consists of a decoder that takes a content embedding sequence and style embedding as input, followed by fully-connected layers, attention RNN, and decoder RNN. The decoder RNN in this work has 256 cells and predicts 5 spectrogram slices per time step. These slices are fed into the CBHG block for processing. The final output is the predicted spectrogram, which is then used by a vocoder to synthesize voice audios. The discriminator network architecture is similar to the reference encoder but takes a combination of spectrograms and content information as input. Global sentence embedding is used to represent the content information. The content embedding from the Content Encoder is averaged over the sequence to create a single embedding. This embedding is replicated to match the spectrogram's time steps and concatenated with it. Attention plots comparing model robustness for different reference audio lengths are shown. Adding a global style token layer improved the network's robustness to varying reference audio lengths. The optimal embedding size for analyzing the inference and attention mechanisms of the model is 128, as shown in TAB2. A size of 32 is too small, hindering essential information flow, while a size of 512 hampers the ability to disentangle style components. Additionally, using four attention heads yields the best performance, as indicated in TAB3."
