SEC. 3. EXCLUSION FROM GROSS INCOME OF BENEFITS UNDER CERTAIN STUDENT LOAN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. This section introduces a new provision in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding student loan payment assistance programs. The provision excludes gross income of qualified employees from amounts paid by employers for student loan payment assistance, limited to $6,000 per year. Qualified employees must contribute at least $50 per month towards loan payments. The earned income limitation states that the excluded income for an employee cannot exceed their earned income for the year. A student loan payment assistance program is a written plan by an employer to help employees with student loan payments, meeting specific requirements. The student loan payment assistance program must not favor highly compensated employees and should benefit those who qualify under a non-discriminatory classification set by the employer. Additionally, not more than 25 percent of the assistance can be provided to principal shareholders or owners. The program does not require funding and must notify eligible employees of its availability. A written statement of expenses must be provided to employees by January 31. The benefits provided should not favor highly compensated employees and should meet non-discriminatory classification criteria set by the employer. The paragraph discusses the requirement for average benefits provided to non-highly compensated employees to be at least 55 percent of those provided to highly compensated employees under all employer plans. Salary reduction agreements can exclude employees with compensation below $25,000. Compensation is defined by section 414(q)(4) unless determined differently by the employer. The text discusses requirements for employer plans to provide compensation without discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees. Plans must pay benefits directly to the lender and may include matching contributions. Definitions and special rules apply, including student loan payment assistance. The term 'student loan payment assistance' refers to paying principal or interest on indebtedness incurred by an employee for qualified higher education expenses. This includes education expenses paid within a reasonable timeframe before or after the debt was incurred, and for education during the employee's eligible student period. Refinanced debt is also covered. The term 'eligible student' refers to a student as defined in section 25A(b)(3), and 'dependent' refers to a dependent as defined in section 152. The term 'earned income' is defined in section 32(c)(2) and excludes employer payments for student loan assistance. An 'employee' includes an individual under section 401(c)(1), and an employer can be an individual with an unincorporated business or a partnership. Ownership of stock is subject to attribution rules. Ownership of stock in a corporation and interest in an unincorporated trade or business are determined based on specific rules. A student loan payment assistance program is not disqualified for failing to meet certain requirements solely due to utilization. The text discusses disallowance of excluded amounts as credit or deduction for employees under a student loan payment assistance program. Matching contributions withheld from an employee through a salary reduction agreement are treated as amounts paid by the employee, not the employer. Conforming amendments are made to various sections of the tax code. Amendments are made to various sections of the tax code, including inserting \"127A,\" after \"127,\" in specific sections. A clerical amendment is also made to the table of sections. Section 127A introduces student loan payment assistance programs. The effective date for the amendments is for taxable years after the enactment of the Act. Section 4 introduces a deduction for student loan payments matched by an employer under section 224 of the Internal Revenue Code. The deduction for student loan payments made by qualified employees with matching contributions from employers is limited to $6,000 annually and $50,000 lifetime.

Principal and interest deductions under this section do not affect other deductions or credits allowed under this chapter. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Code. The deduction for student loan payments matched by an employer is limited to $6,000 annually and $50,000 lifetime. The amendments apply to taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
