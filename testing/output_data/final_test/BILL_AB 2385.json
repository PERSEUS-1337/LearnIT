    "title": "AB 2385",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 19320 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require all commercial cannabis activity to be conducted between licensees. Licensing authorities may issue state licenses to qualified applicants for commercial cannabis activity. One year after licenses are issued, individuals must have both a state license and local authorization to engage in commercial cannabis activity. Applicants must obtain local authorization before applying for a state license. State licenses will not be issued without documentation of local government authorization. Applicants must obtain local authorization from the local jurisdiction before obtaining a state license for commercial cannabis activity. Each licensee must have a separate license for each location where they conduct commercial medical cannabis activity. Revocation of a local license will halt operations until reinstated by the local jurisdiction. Local authorities must notify the bureau of any revocations. Revocation of a state license suspends a medical cannabis licensee's operations in California until the license is reinstated. Local jurisdictions can still impose fees and taxes on licensed facilities. State agencies like the Department of Food and Agriculture can establish fees to support their regulatory programs. In the City of Los Angeles, licensing authorities will issue a state license for commercial cannabis activity if the applicant meets all requirements and criteria established by Measure D. This includes operating as a medical marijuana business in the city by September 14, 2007. The applicant registered with the City of Los Angeles city clerk by November 13, 2007, and obtained a business tax registration for a medical marijuana collective. A state license for commercial cannabis activity will have the same benefits and responsibilities as licenses issued outside the city. The City of Los Angeles must confirm an applicant meets criteria for a state license, or else the license will not be issued. If voters approve an initiative allowing the city to issue local licenses to medical marijuana businesses, local licensing requirements will supersede state licensing."
