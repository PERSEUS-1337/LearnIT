    "content": "The \"Universal Classroom Breakfast Expansion Act\" establishes a grant program for universal free classroom breakfast programs. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a grant program for State agencies to award subgrants to qualifying schools for a universal free breakfast program. Grants awarded to State agencies cannot exceed 10% of the total amount appropriated. State agencies must submit an application to receive a grant and use the funds for the breakfast program. The Act allows funds to be used for awarding subgrants to qualifying schools for a universal free breakfast program, providing technical assistance, and conducting targeted outreach to schools with high percentages of students eligible for free and reduced-price lunches. The Act allows State agencies to award subgrants to qualifying schools, prioritizing those with 75% or more students eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches. State agencies are limited to using 5% of grant funds for technical assistance and targeted outreach. The Act allows State agencies to award subgrants to qualifying schools with a maximum amount of $10,000 per fiscal year for up to 2 years. Qualifying schools are defined as those with at least 40% of students eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches. The Act allows State agencies to award subgrants to qualifying schools with a maximum amount of $10,000 per fiscal year for up to 2 years. Qualifying schools must serve all students enrolled in the school breakfast at no charge for a minimum of 3 school years, allowing students to eat breakfast in the classroom. Qualifying schools must provide free breakfast to all students for at least 3 school years and allow students to eat in the classroom. To receive a subgrant, schools need to submit an application to the State agency. The funds can be used by qualifying schools as specified. Qualifying schools receiving a subgrant must use funds to cover costs for program establishment, including training for staff, promotional materials, and equipment for serving breakfast outside the cafeteria. The Secretary, in collaboration with educational agencies, must report to Congress. Educational agencies, State educational agencies, and qualifying schools must submit an annual report to Congress detailing how funds were used and the impact on participation in the school breakfast program and the educational environment. Qualifying schools receiving special assistance payments under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act can still receive a subgrant under this Act. $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2011 and 2012 to carry out this Act. The Act appropriated $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2011 and 2012. The term \"State agency\" refers to a State agency administering child nutrition programs under specific acts."
