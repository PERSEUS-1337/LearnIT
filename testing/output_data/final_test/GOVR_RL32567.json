Issues involved the level of protection detainees are entitled to under the Geneva Conventions of 1949. The Defense Department released documents on interrogation techniques for individuals deemed unprotected by the Conventions in the Global War on Terrorism. Investigations revealed some discussed techniques for \"unlawful combatants\" were used in Iraq, despite no prisoners being labeled as such. This report outlines Convention provisions for prisoners of war and civilians. The report analyzes the treatment of prisoners of war and civilians under the Geneva Conventions, focusing on interrogation techniques such as torture, coercion, and degrading treatment. It also discusses approved interrogation methods used at Abu Ghraib prison. Belligerents prioritize gathering military intelligence, leading captors to question POWs using any available means to extract information. The emergence of \"total war\" in the twentieth century increased the military utility of economic data, industrial secrets, and other information about the enemy. The ill-treatment of prisoners of war, even for eliciting vital information, has long been considered a violation of the law of war. The Lieber Code, adopted by the Union Army, emphasized the ban on such practices. The Geneva Convention prohibits any form of coercion or torture on prisoners of war to obtain information. Prisoners who refuse to answer cannot be threatened or mistreated in any way. This rule replaced a previous provision allowing pressure to extract information from prisoners. The Geneva Convention prohibits coercion or torture to obtain information from prisoners of war. It also prohibits using pressure to elicit confessions from prisoners. Additionally, prisoners must be treated humanely at all times. The Geneva Convention mandates humane treatment of prisoners of war, protecting them from violence and intimidation. Any unlawful act causing harm to a prisoner is considered a serious breach. Prisoners are entitled to respect for their persons and honor, with reprisals explicitly prohibited. All prisoners must be treated equally without discrimination based on race, rank, or sex. Prisoners of war must be treated equally without discrimination based on race, nationality, religious belief, or political opinions. They should be provided with living conditions as favorable as those for the Detaining Power's forces in the same area, ensuring their health and protection from environmental hazards. Physical conditions of confinement are also addressed to uphold humane treatment standards. Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention address physical conditions of confinement for prisoners of war, prohibiting solitary confinement for interrogation purposes. Article 21 states that close confinement is only allowed to safeguard health, while Article 22 requires the transfer of prisoners from unhealthy areas to more favorable climates. Prisoners must be grouped in camps based on nationality, language, and customs, with exceptions for those captured serving in the same armed forces. The Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 governs the treatment of civilians in occupied territory, protecting them as \"protected persons\" entitled to respect for their persons. The Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 protects civilians in occupied territory as \"protected persons\" entitled to respect for their persons, honor, family rights, religious convictions, and customs. It prohibits any measures causing physical suffering or extermination, including murder, torture, and mutilation, and mandates humane treatment and protection against violence and insults. The Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 protects civilians in occupied territory as \"protected persons\" and prohibits brutality by civilian or military agents. Reprisals against protected persons and their property are prohibited, and civilians may only be detained if absolutely necessary for security reasons. Detained individuals who pose a threat to the occupying power must be treated with humanity and granted fair trial rights. Protected civilians in occupied territory must be granted fair trial rights as per the Fourth Geneva Convention. Internment or assigned residence is allowed for those posing a security threat, subject to regular review. Interrogation of protected persons must not involve coercion, and holding them as hostages is prohibited. Protected civilians in occupied territory must be granted fair trial rights as per the Fourth Geneva Convention. Imprisonment as a punitive measure is allowed only after a regular trial, with protections in place. Article 33 prohibits punishment for offenses not personally committed and collective penalties. Discipline in internment camps must adhere to humanitarian principles, prohibiting dangerous physical exertion or victimization. Tattooing or imprinting signs on the body is prohibited, as well as prolonged standing, punishment drills, military maneuvers, and food ration reduction. Protected civilians in occupied territory are entitled to fair trial rights as per the Fourth Geneva Convention. Imprisonment as punishment requires a regular trial, with protections in place. Collective penalties and punishment for offenses not personally committed are prohibited. Discipline in internment camps must adhere to humanitarian principles, prohibiting physical exertion, victimization, tattooing, prolonged standing, punishment drills, military maneuvers, and food ration reduction. The 1949 Geneva Conventions have common provisions, including equal treatment for all protected persons without adverse distinctions based on race, religion, or political opinion. Common Article 3 applies to armed conflicts not of an international character, requiring minimum provisions to be followed by each Party to the conflict. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions mandates humane treatment for all individuals in hostilities, regardless of their status. It prohibits acts such as violence, murder, mutilation, torture, taking hostages, and degrading treatment. The wounded and sick must be cared for. This article is considered a fundamental provision that upholds human values universally. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions mandates humane treatment for all individuals in hostilities, prohibiting acts like violence, torture, and degrading treatment. Despite absolute-sounding provisions, the debate continues on whether certain interrogation techniques violate the Geneva Convention. The line between permissible treatment and torture remains unclear, especially when interrogators use multiple techniques simultaneously. Interrogators may use multiple techniques simultaneously, and courts evaluating claims of prisoner abuse consider the totality of treatment. Governments may interpret conduct differently based on their role, while human rights advocates and governments have varying interpretations of treaty language. Threshold definitions can be identified to establish boundaries for the conduct of a Detaining Power under the Geneva Convention with respect to prisoners of war. Torture is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions and international law. It can be physical or mental and is defined as intentionally inflicting severe pain or suffering on a person for various purposes. The United Nations Convention Against Torture provides a definition for torture. The International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has identified elements of the crime of torture in armed conflict, including the intentional infliction of severe physical or mental pain or suffering for various purposes. The U.S. Army Field Manual (FM) 34-52 addresses physical torture. The U.S. Army Field Manual lists examples of physical torture, including electric shock, chemical infliction of pain, forced abnormal positions, food deprivation, and beatings. The International Military Tribunal found Japanese soldiers used water treatment, burning, electric shocks, and other forms of torture. The U.S. District Court found U.S. POWs in Iraq were tortured with severe beatings, mock executions, and starvation. The POWs in the former Yugoslavia were subjected to physical and mental torture, including starvation, sleep deprivation, exposure to cold, electric shocks, and confinement in filthy conditions. They suffered serious injuries such as broken bones, nerve damage, infections, and severe weight loss. The torture also included beatings, sexual violence, and threats to torture or kill relatives. Examples of mental torture included mock executions, abnormal sleep deprivation, and chemically induced psychosis. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East noted that mental torture was commonly employed, citing the case of the Doolittle fliers as an example. This involved blindfolding the victims, creating sounds of a firing squad, and threatening execution if they did not talk before sunrise. The treatment of American POWs by Iraqi agents during the 1991 Gulf War involved causing severe mental anguish by falsely reporting deaths of Americans, including a pilot's wingman and the President. The POWs suffered knowing their families were enduring agony due to lack of information. The ICTY considers forcing individuals to witness severe mistreatment of relatives or serious sexual attacks as mental torture. The presence of onlookers, especially family members, can cause severe mental harm amounting to torture for the person being raped. Not all physical or mental suffering constitutes torture, but even psychological pressure and non-impact physical abuse could be considered torture if applied with intensity or duration. The distinction between physical and mental forms of torture is crucial. The severity of pain or suffering is a key factor in determining torture, with no precise threshold defined. The Trial Chamber must consider the harm inflicted when assessing mistreatment. Different individuals may experience varying levels of suffering from non-violent physical methods. The severity of mistreatment is assessed based on the harm inflicted, considering factors like the victim's physical and mental well-being. Some experts argue that torture involves coercion for information, while others believe any cruel treatment can constitute torture. The Geneva Conventions protect against cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment, regardless of whether it meets the definition of torture. The Geneva Conventions prohibit coercion and cruel treatment, even if it does not amount to torture. Protected civilians cannot be subjected to any physical or moral coercion for information. Prisoners of war cannot be threatened, insulted, or exposed to unpleasant treatment. The use of coercion is not explicitly forbidden in Common Article 3. Common Article 3 does not explicitly forbid coercion, which involves compelling a person involuntarily through unlawful force. FM 34-52 explains that coercion eliminates free will through physical or mental torture, brainwashing, and drugs that induce lasting mental damage. These activities are not authorized but are distinct from psychological techniques outlined in the manual. The use of coercion in U.S. criminal law is often asserted as a defense or to render a confession inadmissible in court. Coercion as a defense requires showing a fear of imminent harm, while a confession is considered coerced if the defendant's will was overborne. Various coercive tactics include prolonged questioning, incommunicado detention, interrogation by a hypnotist, violence, threats, and other forms of mental persuasion. The Geneva Conventions do not necessarily apply the same standards as criminal cases when determining coercion. The key question is whether a person can freely choose to comply with treatment designed to influence their conduct. Courts have not been receptive to using coercion by the enemy as a defense in treason cases, applying similar tests as in other criminal cases. In the case of Iva Ikuko Toguri D'Aquino (Tokyo Rose), the court maintained that ordinary rules regarding duress and coercion still applied, even during hostilities. The defense of coercion and duress in treason cases is not easily accepted, as individuals must show a determination to resist enemy commands until faced with immediate harm. The failure of a coercion defense does not justify unlawful behavior, as acts intended to coerce do not have to succeed to be considered coercion. In the context of prisoners held by the Chinese during the Korean War, the conditions in the prisoner of war camps were described as brutal. During the Korean War, American prisoners of war in Korea faced brutal and inhumane conditions, leading to a high death rate due to lack of basic necessities. Despite the harsh treatment, soldiers were expected to resist torture and coercion from the enemy. During the Korean War, American prisoners of war in Korea faced brutal conditions. Soldiers were expected to resist torture and coercion from the enemy. Non-coercive interrogation methods were used to generate pressure for information disclosure voluntarily. The manual describes techniques for non-coercive counterintelligence interrogation, including \"Nobody Loves You,\" \"The All-Seeing Eye,\" \"The Informer,\" and \"News from Home.\" These methods aim to generate pressure for information disclosure voluntarily. Coercive Interrogation techniques include methods like \"News from Home,\" \"The Witness,\" \"Joint Suspects,\" \"Ivan Is a Dope,\" and \"Joint Interrogators,\" which involve creating pressure on the subject to elicit information. The coercive interrogation techniques aim to induce regression in the subject by using outside forces and impairing their ability to cope with challenges. Techniques include arrest, deprivation of sensory stimuli, threats, pain, suggestibility, hypnosis, and narcosis. The prohibition of inhumane treatment of prisoners of war was established in the 19th century. Both the Union and Confederate governments were accused of mistreating prisoners, with the North accused of exposing them to harsh conditions and the South accused of torture and suffering. The mistreatment of prisoners of war during wars, despite provisions in treaties to protect them, includes confining them in unhealthy conditions, exposing them to harsh weather, providing inadequate food and water, and using bloodhounds to track escapees. The ICRC Commentary emphasizes humane treatment as a key theme in the Geneva Conventions, with GPW art. 13 requiring POWs to be treated humanely at all times. The mistreatment of prisoners of war includes unlawful acts causing harm, physical mutilation, exposure to violence, and public display for propaganda. The prohibition on acts of violence and public curiosity stems from World War II practices. The ICRC interprets GPW art. 13 to prohibit public display of prisoners through the news media. The Geneva Conventions prohibit the public display of prisoners of war through the news media to prevent degradation and humiliation. The Department of Defense allows for POWs to be filmed or photographed with their identities disguised for reporting purposes, but broadcasting images for humiliation or propaganda is considered inhumane. Other degrading treatments include urinating on POWs and forced genital inspections. Belligerents have sometimes argued that certain prisoners are not entitled to protection under the laws of war and relevant treaties, allowing for harsher treatment. During the Civil War, the Union initially promised to treat Confederate soldiers as common criminals but later relented for regular soldiers to secure better treatment for captured Union soldiers. During the Civil War, the Confederate States denied prisoner-of-war status to black Union soldiers, causing contention. In World War II, Germany and Japan had different standards for prisoners, with harsh interrogation techniques used on certain prisoners by the Security Police and Gestapo. During World War II, the Gestapo used harsh interrogation methods on specific prisoners, including a \"Third Degree\" involving deprivation of basic needs and physical punishment. These methods were reserved for specific groups and required permission from the Gestapo Chief. At Nuremberg, defendants argued that mistreatment of Soviet prisoners was justified due to the Soviet Union not ratifying the Geneva Convention, but this defense was largely rejected by international and national military tribunals. Some countries have also employed special interrogation techniques for suspects in terrorism or insurgency cases, such as Great Britain in the 1970s implementing sensory methods. Great Britain in the 1970s implemented sensory deprivation interrogation methods known as the \"five techniques\" against suspected members of the Irish Republican Army. The European Court of Human Rights described these techniques as wall-standing, hooding, and subjection to noise during interrogations. The European Court of Human Rights found that the \"five techniques\" used by Great Britain in the 1970s, including subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and food and drink, constituted inhuman and degrading treatment but not torture. Israel's General Security Service also employed interrogation methods involving psychological and moderate physical pressure, as investigated by Justice Moshe Landau. The Landau Commission justified the use of physical pressure in interrogations as necessary and recommended acknowledging and monitoring coercion techniques. The Knesset endorsed the Commission's findings and enacted guidelines for interrogation methods, including non-violent psychological pressure and moderate physical pressure when necessary. The specific methods were detailed in a classified annex to the report. The Israeli High Court shed light on the pressure tactics used by the GSS, including hooding, sleep deprivation, tight handcuffs, and exposure to uncomfortable conditions. These methods were deemed inhuman and degrading, although not classified as torture. The Defense Department released documents on interrogation policies at Abu Ghraib prison and Guantanamo Bay following reports of abuse. The released documents reveal deliberations about appropriate techniques for interrogating persons deemed as \"enemy combatants\" in Afghanistan or elsewhere. Approved methods for interrogation of terror suspects were based on FM 34-52 guidelines, which set limits on measures allowed to gain cooperation from prisoners of war. The lack of detailed information on how these methods were implemented makes comparisons with past practices challenging. The approved techniques for interrogating enemy combatants in Afghanistan were based on FM 34-52 guidelines, which set limits on measures allowed to gain cooperation from prisoners of war. Some techniques may be considered coercive for criminal prosecution but are deemed acceptable by the Army. Military experts may disagree on the propriety and boundaries of these techniques. The \"approach phase\" begins when the interrogator first contacts the source. The \"approach phase\" of interrogating enemy combatants involves establishing control, rapport, and manipulating emotions to gain cooperation. Techniques may include direct questioning without deception, as long as fear or suffering is not exploited. The Geneva Conventions allow questioning of prisoners of war as long as coercion is not used. Exploiting a detainee's suffering or withholding medical treatment is prohibited. The incentive approach rewards cooperation without withholding any rights under the Conventions. The Geneva Conventions prohibit using coercion or withholding medical treatment when questioning prisoners of war. Incentives can be used to reward cooperation without denying any rights, but it is improper to withhold necessities like food and water as incentives. Comfort items and privileges can be used as lawful incentives, but items necessary for basic subsistence or human dignity should not be used in this way. The Geneva Conventions allow for incentives to be used with prisoners of war, such as clothing and privileges, as long as they are not degrading or dehumanizing. Other provisions, like retaining personal articles and practicing religion, should also be respected. Realistic incentives like meals, showers, and letters home can help establish rapport in the short term, while repatriation or political asylum can be considered for the long term. The Geneva Conventions allow for incentives like clothing and privileges for prisoners of war, while respecting provisions for personal articles and religious practices. Providing realistic incentives such as meals, showers, and communication with family members can help establish rapport. However, varying privileges based on detainee cooperation during interrogations may violate the prohibition on disadvantageous treatment. For example, depriving POWs of any communication with the outside world was deemed as \"torture\" by a U.S. court. The Defense Department described the harsh conditions faced by U.S. prisoners of war held by North Korea, including scarcity of water, unsanitary barracks, and limited supplies. Incentives such as tobacco, candy, and mail were given as rewards for cooperation. British POWs held by the Chinese also received supplies based on their level of cooperation, which was criticized. The report criticized the use of physical violence and solitary confinement as incentives for cooperation with captors. Chinese manipulation of mail to induce cooperation was also condemned as a breach of the Geneva Convention. Interrogators may exploit emotions such as love or fear to override a source's resistance, using incentives like communication or promised reunification. The use of emotional manipulation in interrogation, such as exploiting feelings of love or hate, is a tactic to hasten a source's cooperation. This approach does not violate the Geneva Conventions and relies on the interrogator's perception skills for success. The \"increased fear up harsh\" technique in interrogation aims to instill fear in the source to cooperate by using threatening behavior and a loud voice. This method has the potential to violate the law of war due to its coercive nature. The 'mild' version of the 'fear up' approach in interrogation involves subtly blackmailing the subject into cooperating by creating a credible distortion of the truth. The interrogator persuades the subject that there is good cause for fear but hints at concealing or altering circumstances if the source cooperates. The \"decreased fear down\" approach aims to calm a fearful source by assuring proper and humane treatment. The interrogation approach involves calming the source and building rapport through small talk. The \"pride and ego\" approach focuses on tricking the source into revealing information by flattery or abuse, especially targeting low-ranking personnel. The \"pride and ego down approach\" exploits a source's sense of inferiority by attacking their personal worth, loyalty, intelligence, and other perceived weaknesses. The interrogator uses a sarcastic tone to provoke defensiveness and elicit information. This approach may violate the Geneva Conventions' prohibition of insults and degrading treatment. The \"futility\" approach exploits doubts in the source's mind to make them believe resistance is useless. It allows the source to rationalize cooperation. The \"we know all\" approach involves convincing the source that the interrogator already has all information about them. The interrogator uses tactics like providing the correct answer when the source refuses to cooperate, convincing them that all information is already known. In the \"establish your identity\" approach, the source is tricked into giving detailed information to refute allegations of being an infamous criminal. The technique of repetition in interrogation involves asking the same question multiple times to wear down the source and elicit more information. Another tactic, the \"file and dossier\" approach, uses a prop to create the illusion of having extensive information on the source, leading them to believe cooperation is the best option. The interrogator uses tactics like rapid fire questioning, silence, and exploiting contradictions to extract information from the source. The interrogator uses tactics like rapid fire questioning, silence, and exploiting contradictions to extract information from the source. The methods listed below were authorized to be used under certain conditions but required the approval of the Commanding General. Some of these techniques resemble coercive methods described in the CIA manual and may involve environmental control to induce fear or debility. Pentagon officials argue that these methods can be applied within the framework of the Geneva Convention as long as the prisoner's basic physical needs are met. The Geneva Convention allows for tactics like change of scenery and dietary manipulation during interrogations, as long as basic physical needs are met and the environment meets health standards. These techniques aim to disorient the detainee psychologically without being seen as punishment for non-cooperation. Environmental Manipulation involves altering the environment to create discomfort without causing harm to the detainee. This method includes adjusting room temperature or introducing unpleasant smells. Subjecting prisoners to inhospitable climate conditions has been a basis for complaints of inhumane treatment. Sleep Adjustment disrupts the detainee's sleep schedule without depriving them of sleep, inducing feelings of disorientation similar to jet lag. The DOD Working Group approved \"sleep management\" for up to 72 hours at Abu Ghraib with the commander's approval, distinguishing it from \"sleep deprivation.\" Other nations consider sleep deprivation as torture or cruel treatment. Sleep disruption is recommended as a more effective coercion method by the CIA manual. The interrogator disrupts patterns of response by irregularly granting meals and sleep, which disorients the detainee and saps their will to resist. Isolation from other detainees is recommended for no longer than 30 days, but must comply with basic standards of treatment. The DOD Working Group suggested using military dogs to create anxiety without causing mental trauma, which may violate the CAT. Sensory deprivation, a byproduct of solitary confinement, deprives detainees of familiar sensory experiences. Sensory deprivation can induce stress, hallucinations, and delusions by limiting external stimuli, causing individuals to project their unconscious thoughts outward. The CIA believed that complete elimination of sensory stimuli in confinement would deeply affect the interrogatee. The CIA believed that sensory deprivation could deeply affect the interrogatee, with results that usually take weeks or months to achieve in a regular cell being replicated in hours or days in a controlled environment without light, sound, or odors. Stress positions, such as prolonged standing, were suggested but are considered inhumane treatment and have been found to constitute torture or cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment. The KUBARK manual recommended coercive interrogation methods, including prolonged standing to sap resistance. Stress positions like standing at attention could violate the Geneva Conventions, while depriving detainees of clothing may endanger their health. The goal was to create helplessness and dependence, but environmental conditions needed monitoring. Forced nudity without threats or sexual assault may be considered inhumane and degrading. Removal of comfort items, including religious items, could violate Geneva Conventions. Forced grooming involves shaving hair or beard without risking injury to the detainee. Forced grooming involves shaving hair or beard without risking injury to the detainee, which may violate the Geneva Conventions. Techniques like inducing a feeling of suffocation or convincing the detainee of imminent death are considered inhumane and degrading, constituting coercion and mental torture. Techniques like inducing suffocation or convincing of imminent death are considered inhumane and coercive, possibly violating Geneva Convention standards."
