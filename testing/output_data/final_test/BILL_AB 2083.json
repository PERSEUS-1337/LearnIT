    "title": "AB 2083",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 11174.32 of the Penal Code is amended to allow counties to establish interagency child death review teams to investigate suspicious child deaths and improve communication among agencies involved in child abuse cases. These teams ensure that child abuse is recognized, and provide services to siblings and family members in need. Each county may develop a protocol for autopsies on children to identify child abuse or neglect, determine if it contributed to death, and establish proper reporting procedures. This includes consulting experts in forensic pathology and pediatricians with expertise in child abuse. The child death review team includes experts in forensic pathology, pediatricians specializing in child abuse, coroners, criminologists, district attorneys, child protective services staff, law enforcement personnel, local agencies involved in child abuse reporting, county health department staff, and local professional associations. Records exempt from disclosure to third parties remain confidential when in possession of the team. The child death review team may request written and oral information related to a child's death for review. Individuals or agencies are not obligated to disclose information but can voluntarily do so. Information that can be disclosed includes medical and mental health information. Notwithstanding various sections of the Welfare and Institutions Code, certain information such as mental health, child abuse reports, criminal history, reports of physical injuries from firearms, and records of in-home supportive services may be disclosed under specific circumstances. Child death review team information is confidential and not subject to disclosure unless required by law. Each team must annually release findings, conclusions, and recommendations to the public, including statistical data on child deaths. The team's report must protect the privacy of the child and siblings unless disclosure is mandated by law. The Legislature finds that limitations on public access to child death review team information are necessary to protect the confidentiality of the information."
