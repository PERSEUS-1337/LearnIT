    "content": "In the first session of the 110th Congress, the House and Senate passed different versions of energy efficiency and renewable energy legislation. The Senate's H.R. 6 focused on appliance efficiency standards, increasing the renewable fuel standard to 36 billion gallons by 2022, and raising the corporate average fuel economy standards to 35 mpg by 2020. Tax provisions and a renewable energy portfolio standard were not included. The House passed H.R. 3221, which included a 15% renewable portfolio standard. The House-approved version of H.R. 2776 added a 15% renewable portfolio standard (RPS) through a floor amendment. Division B, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2007, includes a four-year extension of the renewable electricity production tax credit and other efficiency and renewables incentives. This report compares the major provisions of the House version of H.R. 3221 and the Senate version of H.R. 6. The CRS Resources, Science, and Industry Division contributed to this report on various energy-related topics such as transmission, electric utilities, fuel economy standards, wildlife habitats, international climate cooperation, carbon storage, loan guarantees, oil and natural gas royalties, marine energy, energy taxes, energy prices, agriculture-based energy, and biofuels. The Senate version of H.R. 6, the proposed Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act, is discussed. The proposed Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007, derived from multiple bills, including the Energy Savings Act and the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act. An RPS amendment was introduced during Senate floor action but ruled non-germane. During Senate floor action on H.R. 6, a tax package amendment (S.Amdt. 1704) with oil and natural gas revenue offsets and incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency was considered but failed by a vote of 57-36 on a cloture motion. H.R. 3221, with two divisions, includes the New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act. Division B of H.R. 3221, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2007, includes the House-approved version of H.R. 2776 and adds four titles. The bill addresses energy efficiency and renewable energy legislation in the 110th Congress, highlighting key differences between House and Senate provisions. The challenges in reconciling differences between the House and Senate versions of bills H.R. 3221 and H.R. 6, getting them to conference committee, and facing opposition from the Administration. The Administration expressed opposition to the Senate bill H.R. 6, citing concerns about oil and natural gas supply, price gouging provision, foreign oil cartels jurisdiction, fuel economy targets, medium- and heavy-duty truck standards, RFS provision, and loan guarantees. The Administration opposed House bills H.R. 2776 and H.R. 3221, citing concerns about domestic oil and gas production, energy costs, and taxes. They also objected to repealing the manufacturing tax deduction for the oil and gas industry, royalty requirements for offshore leases, increased authorization for clean renewable energy bonds, and expansion of the Davis-Bacon Act. In 1999, there was an increase in authorization for clean renewable energy bonds and expansion of Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements. Informal bipartisan negotiations over omnibus energy bills began after the House completed action on H.R. 3221. Key issues included the RPS provision, differences over proposals for increasing the renewable fuels standard, and a proposal to offset costs by repealing certain oil and natural gas subsidies. EIA issued a report on the impacts of the RPS and oil and gas provisions in H.R. 3221. Senate negotiations ceased due to the House Leadership's intent to include an RPS, and the White House threatened to veto the bill if it included an RPS, oil tax increases, and other provisions. The DOE Secretary warned against a narrow renewable portfolio standard and tax increases for the oil and gas sector. A comparison of major provisions in House-passed H.R. 3221 and Senate-passed H.R. 6 is provided. Some provisions are contained under specific titles or subtitles. The proposed New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act (H.R. 3221) includes provisions for energy efficiency and renewable energy, with a renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS) amendment approved by the House. Loan guarantee provisions are found in various titles and subtitles. The House approved the amended bill by a vote of 241-172, which included tax provisions from H.R. 2776. Key provisions included an RPS target of 15% by 2020 and extensions of tax incentives for renewable energy. Amendments were approved for renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. Proposed Amendment 81 to H.R. 3221 aimed to increase the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to 36 billion gallons by 2022 but was withdrawn. Proposed amendments 62 and 95 suggested different policies for increasing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards, with Amendment 95 being withdrawn and Amendment 62 not included in the rule for floor action. Proposed Amendments 36 and 72 focused on reducing imported oil and cutting U.S. oil use, but were not included in the rule for floor action.
