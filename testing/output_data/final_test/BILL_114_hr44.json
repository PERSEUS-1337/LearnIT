The United States recognizes the suffering and loyalty of the residents of Guam during World War II, acknowledging the harm they endured under the occupation of Imperial Japanese military forces and their steadfast loyalty to the United States despite facing threats of death or harm. The Guam World War II Claims Fund is established. The Secretary of the Treasury establishes a special fund called the Claims Fund for compensable Guam victims and survivors. The fund is composed of deposited amounts and other payments for claims. Duties, taxes, and fees collected from Guam are deposited into the fund. After fiscal year 2014, duties, taxes, and fees collected under this section shall be deposited into the Claims Fund. No payment can be made under section 4 until funds are deposited into the Claims Fund. Total payments in a fiscal year under section 4 cannot exceed the available funds in the Claims Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury deducts 5 percent of amounts deposited into the Claims Fund for administrative expenses. The deducted amounts are reimbursed to the Federal Government for expenses incurred by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission and the Department of the Treasury. SEC. 4. PAYMENTS FOR GUAM WORLD WAR II CLAIMS. After receiving certification from the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, the Secretary of the Treasury will make payments to compensable Guam victims and survivors of decedents. Victims who have suffered specific injuries will receive $15,000, while those with other injuries will receive $12,000. In cases where victims do not fall under specific categories but have certain injuries, they will receive $10,000. Survivors of compensable Guam decedents will receive $25,000 for distribution, with payments made to the spouse if there are no living children. In cases where a decedent's spouse is not living, and there are living children, the payment will be divided among the children into equal shares. The Act specifies that if a decedent had no living children but had a living parent, the payment will be made to the parent. If the decedent had two living parents, the payment will be divided equally between them. If the decedent's spouse is not living, and there are no living children or parents, no payment will be made. The term \"compensable Guam decedent\" refers to a resident of Guam who died as a result of the attack. The Guam Meritorious Claims Act of 1945 compensates residents of Guam who died during the attack and occupation by Japanese forces in World War II or during the liberation by US forces. A \"compensable Guam victim\" is someone who suffered rape or severe injury as a result of these events. The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission will define severe personal injuries and personal injuries within 180 days of the Act's enactment, related to events like rape, forced labor, disfigurement, and internment during World War II in Guam. SEC. 5. ADJUDICATION. The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission will adjudicate claims and determine eligibility for payments under section 4. The Chairman will publish necessary rules and regulations within 180 days. Claims must be submitted for payments to be considered. Individuals must submit a claim to the Commission in the specified manner and form to receive payment under section 4. Claims must be filed within one year of the Commission's notice publication. The notice deadline will be published in the Federal Register within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission makes adjudicatory decisions on claims filed under the Act by majority vote, in writing, stating reasons for approval or denial, and specifying payment amount and distribution. Deductions may be made from payments to compensable Guam victims or survivors. The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission makes adjudicatory decisions on claims filed under the Act by majority vote, in writing, stating reasons for approval or denial, and specifying payment amount and distribution. Payments to Guam victims or survivors under the Guam Meritorious Claims Act of 1945 are not subject to interest. Compensation for representational services is limited to one percent of the total payment amount. After a claim is approved by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, the Chairman certifies the decision to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment authorization. Any demand or receipt of compensation exceeding the approved amount is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment for up to one year. Appeals of Commission decisions are final and not subject to further review by any court or agency. The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission treats a claim accompanied by an affidavit as establishing eligibility for payment under section 4 without further documentation, except as required. Material facts must include a detailed description of the injury or circumstance supporting the claim and the payment sought. Acceptance of a payment under section 4 for a claim related to a compensable Guam decedent or victim will settle all related claims under the Guam Meritorious Claims Act of 1945 or this Act. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a grant program to memorialize the occupation of Guam during World War II, awarding grants for research, educational, and media activities. Eligibility for grants requires submitting an application with specified information. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of appropriations is provided for Guam World War II claims payments, adjudication, and grants program.
