The credit amount is $1,500 for employees under 25 years old and $1,000 for those 25 and older. The apprenticeship credit is limited to 2 taxable years for apprenticeship employees.

An employee must be in an apprenticeship agreement with a program that has a completion rate of at least 50% for the two-year period prior to the apprenticeship. The applicable apprenticeship level is determined based on the average number of apprenticeship employees. The employer's tax credit for apprenticeship employees is based on the average number of apprenticeship employees in the preceding 3 taxable years. If it's a new apprenticeship program, the credit is calculated differently. The employer's tax credit for apprenticeship employees is based on the average number of apprenticeship employees in the preceding 3 taxable years. The credit allowed under section 45S(a) will reduce other applicable credits for the same employee.
