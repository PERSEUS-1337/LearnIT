    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Home Energy Affordability Tax Relief Act of 2008\" or the \"HEATR Act of 2008\". It introduces a refundable credit for residential energy costs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Home Energy Affordability Tax Relief Act of 2008\" introduces a credit for residential energy costs in the tax code. For individuals, the credit is the lesser of 33% of energy costs or $500. There is an income limitation that reduces the credit based on adjusted gross income exceeding $50,000 for individuals. The \"Home Energy Affordability Tax Relief Act of 2008\" introduces a credit for residential energy costs in the tax code. Adjusted gross income is determined without regard to certain sections. Residential energy costs include payments for electricity, natural gas, and qualified fuel for heating the principal residence. The definition of principal residence is provided. The term 'principal residence' is defined as the main place of abode during the heating season, excluding residences outside the US. The heating season is from October to March, and qualified fuel includes propane, heating oil, kerosene, wood, and wood pellets. Other special rules apply for individuals paying on a level payment basis. Individuals paying on a level payment basis can allocate amounts paid for natural gas, electricity, or qualified fuel based on usage during the heating season. Homeowners associations and cooperative housing members can also allocate residential energy costs accordingly. The residential energy cost incurred can be allocated among individuals in a joint occupancy. The credit allowed by this section is treated as a refundable credit. Dollar amounts in subsections (a)(2) and (b)(1)(A) are subject to inflation adjustment for taxable years beginning in 2009. The amount is determined by multiplying a dollar amount by the fuel price inflation adjustment for 2009 and the cost-of-living adjustment for 2009. The fuel price inflation adjustment for 2009 is calculated based on the percentage increase in fuel prices. The fuel price inflation adjustment for 2009 is the percentage difference between the CPI fuel component for October 2008 and October 2007. The CPI fuel component refers to the fuel component of the Consumer Price Index. Any dollar amount not a multiple of $10 will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. The section applies to residential energy costs paid after enactment, in taxable years ending before January 1, 2010. Conforming amendments include adjustments to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending after the enactment date. Elimination of deduction for intangible drilling and development costs for major oil companies. The amendment to Section 263(c) of the Internal Revenue Code states that certain taxpayers are exempt from the subsection if oil and gas prices exceed specified amounts. The Secretary will determine average prices based on Energy Information Administration data. Dollar amounts will be adjusted for inflation. The amendment to Section 263(c) of the Internal Revenue Code exempts certain taxpayers if oil and gas prices exceed specified amounts. The amendment is effective for taxable years starting after the enactment of the Act. MODIFICATIONS OF FOREIGN TAX CREDIT RULES APPLICABLE TO MAJOR OIL COMPANIES WHO ARE DUAL CAPACITY TAXPAYERS. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include special rules for major oil companies that are dual capacity taxpayers. Any amount paid to a foreign country or possession of the United States by an applicable taxpayer will not be considered a tax if the country does not impose a generally applicable income tax or if the amount exceeds a certain limit. The special rules for major oil companies as dual capacity taxpayers state that any amount exceeding a certain limit paid to a foreign country or possession by an applicable taxpayer will not be considered a tax if the country does not impose a generally applicable income tax. The term 'applicable taxpayer' in the United States refers to integrated oil companies and other crude oil producers or refiners with gross receipts over $100,000,000. A 'dual capacity taxpayer' in a foreign country receives a specific economic benefit and is subject to that country's levy. The term 'generally applicable income tax' refers to an income tax imposed by a foreign country on income derived from business activities within that country, excluding taxes that do not apply to individuals who are not dual capacity taxpayers. The amendments made by this section apply to taxes paid in taxable years after the enactment date, except where contrary to US treaty obligations. SEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY CREDIT FOR MAJOR OIL COMPANIES. The amendment to Section 43 of the Internal Revenue Code excludes its application for taxable years if the average price of crude oil in the US exceeds $34.71 per barrel. The Secretary will determine average prices based on data from the Energy Information Administration. Adjustments will be made annually based on changes in the Consumer Price Index. The amendment made by this section applies to taxable years starting after the enactment of this Act."
