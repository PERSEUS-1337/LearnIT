The \"Bitterroot National Forest Dam and Reservoir Maintenance Act\" aims to grant rights-of-way to dam owners in Montana for benefits like groundwater recharge, open space preservation, increased streamflows, and flood control. In this Act, \"dam\" refers to a dam in the Bitterroot National Forest, \"Forest\" means the Bitterroot National Forest in Montana, \"owner\" includes dam owners and water storage rights holders, \"Secretaries\" are the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Interior, \"State\" is Montana, and \"trail\" is a trail, access route, or primitive road in the Forest. SEC. 4. RIGHTS-OF-WAY. The Secretaries shall grant owners rights-of-way for access to dams and adjacent areas in the Forest for dam construction and maintenance, disregarding certain laws. Owners must establish boundaries for the granted rights-of-way. The Secretaries grant owners rights-of-way for access to dams and adjacent areas in the Forest for construction and maintenance. The right-of-way for trails must be 8-60 feet wide from the trail center. The adjacent areas must be located 50-500 feet from the highwater mark and downstream dam toe, including necessary land for dam operations. An owner granted a right-of-way in the Forest may construct, maintain, and repair the right-of-way.

Activities related to the construction, maintenance, repair, and operation of dams for specific purposes are regulated by the State and are not subject to various federal laws or provisions related to environmental protection and wildlife. Dam owners are not liable for any claims or damages arising from these activities. The rights-of-way granted for dam construction can be conveyed by the owner without consent. A right-of-way terminates if the owner is inactive for 10 years. Water rights are not affected by this Act. The Act ensures conformity with land and water management laws, grants additional rights-of-way, and compensates owners for interference with water rights or rights-of-way."
