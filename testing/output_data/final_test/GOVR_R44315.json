    "content": "The trafficking business thrives on demand and vulnerability factors like youth, gender, poverty, and social exclusion. Actors range from family-run groups to organized crime syndicates. Victims endure mental and physical abuse for control, including debt bondage, isolation, violence, and threats. U.S. anti-trafficking efforts focus on victim assistance and the JVTA aims to enhance victim services. An issue in U.S. policy is ensuring equal treatment for all victims, regardless of nationality or type of trafficking. There is confusion over whether U.S. citizens, as well as noncitizens, are eligible for services under all the anti-trafficking grant programs authorized by the TVPA. DOJ, HHS, and DOL have programs to provide services to trafficking victims, with only DOJ and HHS programs receiving specified funding. Congress has appropriated approximately $20 million each year for victims' services between FY2002 and FY2013, increasing to $28 million. Despite recent increases in funding for victims' services, NGOs report federal funding remains insufficient to address the needs of individual victims. The 113th Congress amended grant programs through the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act to include sex trafficking victims for services. This includes assistance for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who are also victims of trafficking. The JVTA expands services for victims of sex trafficking, including youth and Indian women, through new grant programs administered by DOJ. It also allows DOJ grants to be used for housing and extends funding to noncitizen victims. The TVPA provides additional rights for victims of federal crime, including the right to be informed of court agreements and certain victims' services. Noncitizen victims of trafficking are certified by HHS for eligibility for services, while U.S. citizen and LPR victims may not be certified but may still be eligible for certain services. The JVTA clarifies that U.S. citizen and LPR victims of trafficking are eligible for certain victims' services without certification. Job Corps, administered by DOL, is available to victims of severe trafficking without income requirements. Victims may require medical care, psychological treatment, and job training for recovery. The JVTA requires the Attorney General to collect data on restitution orders for victims of peonage, slavery, or trafficking. It also mandates the use of trafficking-related forfeitures to fulfill restitution orders for victims and provides training for court officers to assist victims in seeking restitution. The JVTA directs DOJ to provide a database on counseling, housing, legal assistance, and other services for trafficking victims. Stakeholders include advocates, hotline personnel, foster parents, law enforcement, and crime survivors. Law enforcement aims to enhance investigations and prosecutions of trafficking offenders, targeting criminal networks involved in various capacities. JVTA allows prosecution of traffickers involved in advertising commercial sexual exploitation. The JVTA permits prosecution of traffickers involved in advertising commercial sexual exploitation by requiring knowledge or reckless disregard of coercion, deception, or underage victims. It expands law enforcement's ability to obtain wiretap orders for trafficking investigations and enhances prosecution of individuals traveling interstate or internationally for commercial sexual activity with a child. The affirmative defense standard for defendants in such cases is raised to \"clear and convincing evidence.\" The JVTA clarifies the U.S. Marshals Service's authority to assist in locating missing children and increases penalties for traffickers. It imposes a $5,000 penalty assessment on various offenses related to trafficking, with the funds deposited into a Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund administered by the Attorney General. The JVTA clarifies the U.S. Marshals Service's authority to assist in locating missing children and increases penalties for traffickers. It imposes a $5,000 penalty assessment on offenses related to trafficking, with funds deposited into a Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund administered by the Attorney General. Money from the fund may be used to support grant programs for victims of child pornography and victims of child abuse, but not for medical items or health care services. Efforts to reduce trafficking should address both the supply and demand. The JVTA focuses on combating the demand for sex trafficking by prohibiting the patronizing or soliciting of commercial sex. It also clarifies prosecution requirements for offenders and mandates the enhancement of capabilities for law enforcement to detect and prosecute individuals who solicit children. The JVTA mandates law enforcement to combat sex trafficking by targeting individuals who solicit children for sex. It requires the Bureau of Justice Statistics to report on arrests and prosecutions of buyers. The Secretary of Homeland Security operates a Cyber Crimes Center within ICE to assist in cyber-related crime investigations, including a Child Exploitation Investigations Unit, Computer Forensics Unit, and Cyber Crimes Unit. The CEIU coordinates ICE's efforts in child exploitation cases and provides training and support as needed. The CEIU, CFU, and CCU within ICE collaborate with other agencies to combat child exploitation and enhance cyber security. They provide training, technical expertise, digital forensics, and support to law enforcement personnel. The CEIU collects data on law enforcement activities and produces reports. The CFU offers digital forensics services, while the CCU oversees ICE's cyber security strategy. The JVTA authorizes collaboration with the Department of Defense and National Association to Protect Children for recruitment and training. The Department of Defense and National Association to Protect Children collaborate to recruit, train, and hire wounded veterans and transitioning servicemembers to combat domestic sex trafficking of children in the United States. Child victims of sex trafficking, regardless of consent or age representation, are considered trafficking victims under federal law. The exact number of child victims is unknown due to challenges in defining the population and estimating methodologies. Most victims are believed to be U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, with factors like homelessness and child abuse contributing to commercial sexual exploitation. The National Academy of Sciences recommended collaboration among various stakeholders to address child sex trafficking, with factors like family conflict, peer pressure, and societal sexualization increasing the risk of exploitation. The JVTA focuses on policy changes in areas such as missing and exploited children, runaway youth, child welfare, and juvenile justice to combat sex trafficking of children. The Missing and Exploited Children's program provides support for missing and sexually exploited children under the DOJ. The JVTA amends the Missing Children's Assistance Act by directing NCMEC to operate a tipline for reporting child sex trafficking, including child prostitution. It also amends the Crime Control Act of 1990 concerning reporting children to the federal National Crime Information Center. The JVTA amends the Crime Control Act of 1990 by requiring law enforcement agencies to report missing children to the NCIC with a recent photograph and notify NCMEC of reports related to children missing from foster care. It also shortens the time for verifying and updating records of missing children to 30 days and specifies that records should include a recent photograph. Additionally, state law enforcement agencies must notify NCMEC of reports related to missing children from foster care. The JVTA amends provisions in the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to prioritize research and projects addressing severe forms of trafficking and staff training. The act funds organizations to provide services to youth who have run away or experienced homelessness, as well as supports research, evaluations, and technical assistance for grantees. The TVPA defines severe forms of trafficking in persons and sex trafficking, encompassing child and adult victims of sex and labor trafficking. The Victims of Child Abuse Act supports improving the investigation and prosecution of child abuse through Children's Advocacy Centers (CACs) and related training for attorneys. CACs coordinate a multidisciplinary response to child abuse. The JVTA expands the definition of child abuse to include child pornography and human trafficking. It also establishes a Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund to provide support services to victims. The Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund, overseen by the HHS Secretary, awards grants for victim programming, including services for child victims of sex trafficking. State and local child welfare agencies are responsible for promoting the safety and well-being of all children, including those in foster care who may be vulnerable to trafficking. Youth who run away from foster care are vulnerable to sex trafficking. State and local child welfare agencies may struggle to respond due to various challenges. The JVTA aims to improve the investigation and assessment of child trafficking cases through state grants provided under CAPTA. Funding for CAPTA state grants helps states enhance their CPS systems. State grants under the JVTA aim to improve CPS systems by addressing sex trafficking of children. CAPTA state plans must include provisions for identifying and assisting child sex trafficking victims, with a focus on training CPS workers and coordinating with law enforcement and social service agencies. Child welfare agencies must report the number of identified sex trafficking victims annually to HHS as required by CAPTA. The JVTA enables states to define child sex trafficking victims as victims of \"child abuse and neglect\" and \"sexual abuse\" for purposes of CAPTA. The term \"child\" is defined as an individual under age 18 in CAPTA, but states can define it as under 24 for sex trafficking victims. Federal agencies face challenges in providing services to minor victims of sex trafficking who are U.S. citizens or LPRs. The 2013 TVPA reauthorization created a grant program for child sex trafficking victims, allocating funds for NGOs to provide services such as counseling and shelter. The JVTA authorizes grants for domestic child human trafficking deterrence programs to aid victims and prosecute trafficking offenses. Eligible entities include states and units. The JVTA authorizes grants for domestic child human trafficking deterrence programs to aid victims and prosecute trafficking offenses. Eligible entities include states and units of local government meeting specified criteria. Grants can be used for specialized training programs, law enforcement units, court programs for child trafficking victims, and funding activities to find homeless and runaway youth. DOJ can use the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund to carry out these grants. The 2013 TVPA reauthorization (P.L. 113-4) established the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund for grants to aid victims of commercial sexual activity. Minors under 18 involved in such activities are treated as victims at the federal level but may be labeled as criminals at the state level. Safe harbor provisions are included in state anti-trafficking laws to protect minors arrested for prostitution and refer them to service providers. The JVTA incentivizes states to enact safe harbor laws that treat minors involved in commercial sexual activity as trafficking victims, discouraging prosecution for prostitution. Concerns exist about coordination among agencies conducting anti-trafficking activities and the efficiency of fund usage. The TVPA established the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor trafficking activities. The TVPA, as amended, established the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking (PITF) and the Senior Policy Operating Group (SPOG) to coordinate anti-trafficking policy across U.S. government agencies. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires HHS to establish the National Advisory Committee on Sex Trafficking of Children and Youth to improve the nation's response to sex trafficking. The federal government lacks a national strategy to combat human trafficking, but the JVTA directs the PITF to review human trafficking prevention in the United States. The JVTA mandates a review of human trafficking prevention in the United States, including cataloging government efforts, surveying related literature, identifying best practices for preventing child trafficking, and addressing research gaps. The GAO is required to report to Congress on programs authorized under the law and five related statutes to assess duplication. The JVTA mandates a review of human trafficking prevention in the United States, including creating the United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking. The Council, comprised of human trafficking survivors, will advise on federal anti-trafficking policy and programs, serving as a point of contact for federal agencies seeking input from survivors. The JVTA mandates the United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, comprised of survivors, to advise federal agencies on anti-trafficking policies. The Council formulates assessments, recommendations, and produces annual reports on best practices in human trafficking prevention. The Attorney General is directed to implement a National Strategy for Combating Human Trafficking, integrating federal, state, local, and tribal efforts, coordinating cases, addressing budget priorities, and assessing future trends to enhance anti-trafficking efforts. The JVTA directs the Secretary of DHS to implement a training program within 180 days on deterring, detecting, and disrupting human trafficking for personnel from TSA, CBP, and other agencies encountering trafficking victims during their regular duties. The JVTA requires the Secretary of DHS to ensure personnel from TSA, CBP, and other relevant agencies receive training on detecting human trafficking. The Secretary must certify completion of training within one year and submit annual reports on its effectiveness. The JVTA allows sharing of training curricula with state, local, and private entities to aid in identifying human trafficking. The JVTA mandates training programs for law enforcement, prosecutors, and judges on investigating, prosecuting, and providing services to trafficking victims. It also includes members of the Foreign Service in training requirements for identifying and protecting trafficking victims. The JVTA mandates training programs for law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, and members of the Foreign Service on identifying and protecting trafficking victims. It requires state child welfare agencies to develop procedures for relevant training for caseworkers in consultation with various agencies and organizations. The JVTA mandates training programs for various professionals to identify and protect trafficking victims, including CPS workers. It also requires HHS to award a grant for developing best practices for health care professionals to recognize and respond to human trafficking victims. Additionally, the SORNA sets minimum standards for sex offender registration in the US. The JVTA mandates training programs for professionals to identify and protect trafficking victims, including CPS workers. It also requires HHS to award a grant for developing best practices for health care professionals to recognize and respond to human trafficking victims. Additionally, SORNA sets standards for sex offender registration in the US, with concerns raised about military sex offenders' information access. There have been cases of rapists suing victims for custody of children conceived during the assault. The JVTA requires increased grant funding for states with laws allowing mothers of children conceived through rape to seek court-ordered termination of parental rights of the rapist, regardless of the parents' age or marital status at the time of the offense. Some states lack statutes for terminating parental rights in rape cases, with restrictions like requiring a conviction before termination. The JVTA authorizes increased grant funding for states with laws allowing mothers of children conceived through rape to seek court-ordered termination of parental rights of the rapist. The funding can be provided for up to eight years, with 25% allocated for STOP grants and 75% for the Sexual Assault Services Program, totaling $5 million a year for FY2015 through FY2019."
