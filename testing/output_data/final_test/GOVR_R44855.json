    "content": "Banks play a vital role in the economy by connecting borrowers to savers and allocating capital. Banking is inherently risky but can bring economic benefits. Regulation has evolved to balance these risks. Recent years have seen transformative changes in the banking industry, especially after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The 2008-2009 financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the financial system and led to regulatory changes, including the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. International bank regulators also agreed to the Basel III Accords to make bank regulations more stringent. Some observers have raised concerns about the potential benefits of these changes. The report provides an overview of banking-related issues post-financial crisis, including regulatory changes, concerns about benefits outweighing costs, market forces impact, and selected banking issues like prudential regulation and consumer protection. It does not cover all bank policy issues but offers concise background and analysis on prominent topics. The report discusses prominent banking issues such as bank failures, moral hazard, systemic stress, and prudential regulation to prevent and mitigate losses. It also lists specific Congressional Research Service reports on bills like the Financial CHOICE Act (H.R. 10) and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (S. 2155). Prudential regulations ensure banks are safe and profitable, reducing the risk of failure. This includes requirements on capital ratios, permissible activities like the Volcker Rule, and the structure of a bank's balance sheet with assets, liabilities, and capital raised through various methods. Banks can issue equity or special bonds for capital, which fluctuates in value and helps absorb losses. This practice allows banks to earn more interest on riskier assets than they pay on liabilities, reducing the risk of failure. Regulators can require banks to hold minimum levels of capital, liquidity, or stable funding to absorb losses and reduce risks. Ratio requirements have been in place for decades, with the Basel Capital Accords adopted in 1988 setting international standards for the United States today. The Basel Capital Accords adopted in 1988 set international standards for capital requirements, leading to the development of Basel II in 2004 and Basel III in 2010. U.S. regulators implemented new capital and liquidity requirements post-crisis, with ongoing evolution of restrictions on bank activities. Historical examples include the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. The Glass-Steagall Act prohibited certain banks from engaging in securities market activities, but over time, regulations became more permissive. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealed parts of Glass-Steagall in 1999, expanding permissible activities for banks. The financial crisis led to restrictions on bank activities, with Dodd-Frank placing limits to reduce riskiness. The Volcker Rule in Dodd-Frank aimed to separate proprietary trading from banking activities. Banks are required to meet regulatory ratio requirements, with capital ratios falling into leverage or risk-weighted types. Leverage ratios treat all assets equally, while risk-weighted ratios assign a risk weight based on asset riskiness. Riskier assets require banks to hold more capital. Banks must meet regulatory ratio requirements, with capital ratios falling into leverage or risk-weighted types. Riskier assets require banks to hold more capital, with different ratios based on bank size and capital quality. The largest banks are required to hold more capital than smaller banks. Some argue for both risk-weighted and leverage ratios to complement each other in banking regulation. Riskier assets offer higher returns but require more capital. Without risk weighting, banks may favor riskier assets. However, some believe risk-weighted ratios should be limited as they may not accurately reflect asset risk. Some observers criticize the risk weights used in banking regulation, suggesting they were poorly calibrated before the financial crisis. This led to banks investing heavily in risky assets with low risk weights, such as highly rated mortgage-backed securities, which suffered significant losses during the crisis. The risk-weighted system is also criticized for being overly complex and favoring larger banks. The complexity of regulatory ratios in bank regulation, including leverage and risk-weighted ratios, is a key issue. Prudential regulation involves various requirements like liquidity, asset concentration, and counterparty limits. Some argue that sufficient capital is crucial for absorbing losses, while others believe additional regulatory restrictions are necessary. Some argue that prudential regulation components are essential for financial institution safety, while others debate the trade-off between increased bank safety and potential reduced credit availability. Higher capital requirements may make funding more expensive for banks, potentially slowing economic growth. However, a stable banking system could lead to higher long-run economic growth despite regulatory costs. Estimating the value of regulatory costs and benefits is uncertain due to complex economic modeling. Congress could reduce regulatory reliance on risk-weighted ratios by providing exemptions for banks operating safely. This could include exempting banks from liquidity requirements, stress-testing, and dividend limitations. Another option is to adjust risk weights for specific asset classes. The Volcker Rule prohibits depository banks from engaging in proprietary trading or sponsoring hedge funds. Proponents argue that this would add further risk to commercial banking and that other institutions are better suited for proprietary trading. They also assert that moral hazard is a concern for banks engaging in risky activities. The Volcker Rule aims to prevent banks from taking excessive risks with taxpayer-backed deposits by prohibiting proprietary trading and sponsoring hedge funds. Critics question the rule's necessity, arguing that proprietary trading did not cause the financial crisis. The effectiveness of the rule in reducing bank risk is also debated, as it is unclear if prohibited activities pose greater risks than traditional banking activities. Some argue that diversifying a bank's risk profile by engaging in different markets can reduce the likelihood of failure. The Volcker Rule, which restricts proprietary trading at depository bank subsidiaries, may hinder beneficial trading activities and market efficiency. Exceptions are made for activities like hedging and market-making, but determining the motives behind trades poses regulatory challenges and compliance costs. Differentiating motives for bank trading creates regulatory complexity and compliance costs. The debate over exempting small banks from the Volcker Rule continues. Some argue that community banks can easily comply with clear policies, while others find evaluating compliance burdensome. A community bank exemption is supported to ease regulatory burdens. Congress could consider amending the Volcker Rule to exempt community banks from compliance, potentially replacing it with provisions similar to the Glass-Steagall Act or enacting an exemption for small banks. Financial products' complexity may pose challenges for consumers. Financial products can be complex and challenging for consumers to understand, making them vulnerable to deceptive practices. Laws and regulations are in place to protect consumers in financial transactions, ensuring fair lending practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's authorities and regulations aim to strike a balance between consumer protection and credit availability. Fair lending practices are enforced through federal laws and regulations, including disclosure requirements to ensure consumers understand financial product terms. Discrimination in credit transactions based on borrower characteristics is prohibited. Banks must comply with consumer protection and fair lending laws. The financial crisis exposed weaknesses in consumer protection regulations, with mortgages using weak underwriting standards contributing to the crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB to regulate consumer financial products like mortgages in response to deceptive practices that led to the financial crisis. The CFPB focuses on enforcing federal consumer financial laws to protect consumers. The CFPB was created to enforce federal consumer financial laws and ensure fair markets for financial products. It has regulatory authority over banks and nonbank providers, with powers varying based on asset size. Regulatory authorities include supervision, enforcement of consumer protection laws, and rulemaking for a wide range of consumer financial activities. The CFPB regulates consumer financial activities for banks with over $10 billion in assets, while smaller banks have rulemaking divided between the CFPB and a prudential regulator. The CFPB has limited supervisory and enforcement powers over small banks. The CFPB regulates consumer financial activities for banks with over $10 billion in assets, while smaller banks have rulemaking divided between the CFPB and a prudential regulator. The CFPB has limited supervisory and enforcement powers over small banks. The CFPB may refer potential enforcement actions against small banks to their prudential regulators, but the regulators are not obligated to take further action. Concerns have been raised about the CFPB's structure, with some questioning its balance between independence, transparency, and accountability. The CFPB is led by a single director and funded by the Federal Reserve, leading to criticisms of lack of diversity in viewpoints and accountability. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) faces issues regarding its accountability and structure, including the director's removal protection and funding cap. Supporters argue for transparency through director testimony and funding limits. The balance between consumer protection and access to financial products is also a policy concern. The CFPB's rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act is scrutinized for its impact on consumers. The CFPB has implemented rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, but regulations like oversight of auto lending and credit card-like protections for prepaid cards are debated. Some argue that CFPB regulations are burdensome, leading to reduced credit availability. However, new leadership since November 27, 2017, has signaled a review of regulations. Critics claim recent changes have made the CFPB too lenient on financial service providers, weakening consumer protections. Some believe the CFPB has struck a balance between consumer protection and credit availability, but others argue it has been too lenient on financial service providers. The impact of recent rulemakings on credit availability is complex due to economic conditions and the lack of a track record for analysis. Additionally, the $10 billion asset threshold for CFPB regulation is questioned. Supporters argue for raising the threshold for CFPB regulation to reduce burden on small banks, as they would still be examined by their primary regulators. Critics oppose raising the threshold, stating it would exempt large institutions that need closer supervision. They point out that banks close to the threshold were involved in violations during the housing bubble. During the housing bubble, banks close to the threshold for CFPB regulation, like IndyMac with $30 billion in assets, were involved in violations. Congress could alter the CFPB's regulatory authority by expanding its mandate to include consumer credit availability, increasing agency accountability, and altering rulemaking and enforcement authorities. The housing bubble led to a rapid increase in housing prices and sales, fueled by home mortgages. However, the bubble burst in 2007, causing a decline in home prices, leading to mortgage defaults and foreclosures. The collapse of the bubble played a significant role in the financial crisis, with factors like relaxed mortgage standards and misaligned incentives contributing to the crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act made changes to the mortgage system after the financial crisis, requiring lenders to verify borrower information and report more data. There is a perceived trade-off between consumer protection and credit availability in financial regulations. Some policymakers believe post-crisis mortgage rules strike a balance between consumer protection and credit availability. Regulations aim to prevent those unable to repay loans from receiving credit while ensuring those who can repay are able to receive credit. Critics argue that services may reduce product offerings due to increased costs from regulations. Some critics argue that mortgage rules have imposed compliance costs on lenders, resulting in less credit available to consumers and restricting certain types of products, especially for mortgages in rural areas or for manufactured housing. There is no consensus on whether these rules have unduly restricted mortgage availability, as it is challenging to isolate the effects of rules from broader economic and market forces. Mortgage credit is tighter post-housing bubble, leading to debate on whether it's a necessary correction or unnecessary restriction. Congress could amend Dodd-Frank rules to increase mortgage availability. Some bank holding companies are so large that they are believed to be too big to fail. The concept of \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) institutions arises from the belief that certain institutions are crucial to the financial system and their failure would have significant economic and societal costs. TBTF institutions may engage in excessive risk-taking, gain unfair advantages, and expose taxpayers to losses. Measures such as enhanced regulation, capital requirements, liquidity requirements, living wills, stress-testing, and the Orderly Liquidation Authority aim to address issues related to TBTF institutions. Market forces drive banks and financial institutions to grow in size and complexity. Market forces drive banks and financial institutions to grow in size and complexity, potentially increasing efficiency and improving outcomes. Economies of scale reduce costs, offering consumers one-stop shopping for financial products, and diversifying bank risk. Before the crisis, some banks became very large and complex, with a few holding a significant portion of industry assets. This trend continued, with nine banks holding over $250 billion in assets by the end of 2016, accounting for 50.3% of industry assets. Many observers argue that large financial institutions may be incentivized to take excessive risks due to their size, complexity, and interconnectedness. This can lead to moral hazard, where they believe they can profit from potential gains while being protected from losses. Shareholders and creditors expect a balance between risk and returns, but market discipline may be lacking in certain banks. Large banks may take on excessive risks due to the perceived government support in case of distress, leading to potential economic and social devastation. This belief can result in lower funding costs and interconnectedness with other financial institutions, causing contagion effects. The financial crisis of 2008-2009 highlighted issues related to \"too big to fail\" institutions taking on large risks and facing threats of failure. During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, large banks faced threats of failure due to excessive risk-taking and perceived government support. To address the issue of \"too big to fail\" institutions, actions were taken by the U.S. government, including capital injections and government-assisted acquisitions. Measures such as enhanced prudential regulation and the Basel III Accords were implemented to reduce the likelihood of large bank failures and the need for government support. These measures are subject to policy debate. Enhanced prudential regulation aims to prevent large bank failures by increasing capital ratios, liquidity standards, and stress-testing by the Federal Reserve for major banks. Capital ratios measure a bank's loss-absorbing capacity, while liquidity standards ensure enough liquid assets to cover cash outflows in times of stress. Stress-testing evaluates banks' capital adequacy in economic downturns. Enhanced prudential regulation involves preparing resolution plans for review by regulatory agencies to address TBTF problems. Proponents argue that market forces failed to restrain large institutions from taking risks leading up to the financial crisis. Proponents argue that market participants have a higher risk tolerance than society as a whole and may not internalize systemic risks. They believe regulators have better access to risk information and that enhanced prudential regulation promotes best practices for risk management. Opponents claim regulators are ineffective in curbing risk-taking, citing past failures to prevent excessive risk at certain firms. Some argue that large firms are \"too complex to regulate,\" with implications for the effectiveness of simple versus complex rules. Critics also claim that large firms are \"too big to jail,\" hindering effective supervisory actions. Additionally, creating a special prudential regulatory regime is seen as counterproductive. Critics argue that creating a special prudential regulatory regime for banks could backfire by signaling protected status, potentially exacerbating moral hazard. Firms in this regime may end up borrowing at lower costs, leading to increased systemic risk as risky activities could shift to less regulated institutions and markets. The potential migration to shadow banking and the debate over appropriate thresholds for enhanced regulation are key issues in the financial system. Critics argue that creating a special regulatory regime for banks could increase systemic risk by shifting risky activities to less regulated institutions. The cost and benefit trade-offs of enhanced prudential regulation for large banks are also under scrutiny, with concerns about the impact on credit availability and economic growth. Critics debate whether regional banks, often with traditional banking models, should be subject to the same enhanced prudential regulation as Wall Street banks. Some argue that certain regional banks engage in complex activities and may not be systemically important, making the regulation burdensome. Opponents suggest alternative policy approaches to regulate large banks. Alternative policy approaches for regulating large banks include creating exemptions from enhanced prudential regulations, breaking up big banks through asset limits or stringent capital requirements, imposing restrictions on mixing commercial banking and investment activities, and raising the threshold above $50 billion for institutions considered too big to fail. Some suggestions for addressing the TBTF problem include raising the threshold above $50 billion for banks considered too big to fail, altering regulations to provide relief, reducing the frequency of stress tests, ensuring losses are borne by shareholders and creditors, and eliminating the possibility of government bailouts. The bankruptcy process is not equipped to resolve large financial institutions without disrupting the financial system due to the inability to liquidate firms dominating important market segments. Government commitments to let financial firms fail may not be credible if the failure is likely to be disruptive. Dodd-Frank created an alternative resolution regime for certain financial firms outside of bankruptcy. The Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) created by the Dodd-Frank Act addresses the challenges of resolving very large banking organizations, particularly bank-holding companies with complex structures. This authority aims to prevent chaotic, disruptive failures with systemic implications. The Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) created by the Dodd-Frank Act allows the FDIC to resolve large BHCs and certain nonbank financial institutions without government assistance. Proponents argue that this regime offers an alternative to messy bankruptcies, citing successful resolutions like Wachovia and Washington Mutual during the crisis. Losses were imposed on stockholders and unsecured creditors in the resolution of Washington Mutual. Critics argue that the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) could lead to backdoor bailouts and preferential treatment of creditors, potentially increasing costs to the government. They doubt the OLA's effectiveness in resolving very large, complex financial institutions like BHCs and their subsidiaries. The FDIC's resolution regime for banks like Wachovia and Washington Mutual minimizes these risks by imposing losses on stockholders and unsecured creditors. Some suggest that a resolution regime for TBTF firms may need to prioritize systemic risk over least-cost resolution. This could make a resolution more favorable to creditors than the bankruptcy process. There are calls to amend the bankruptcy code to create a special chapter for complex financial firms, addressing issues like a quicker process and reorganization. Unlike Title II, the bankruptcy process cannot consider financial stability concerns or ensure access to necessary liquidity until a TBTF firm fails. The effectiveness of a special resolution regime for TBTF firms is uncertain, as it may struggle to shut down a failing firm without causing systemic disruption or taxpayer losses. The FDIC, acting as receiver in a future failure, could face incentives to limit creditor losses to contain systemic risk, similar to past bailouts. The Federal Reserve's \"total loss absorbing capacity\" requirement aims to address these concerns. The Federal Reserve imposes a \"total loss absorbing capacity\" (TLAC) requirement on large banks to ensure shareholders and creditors bear losses in a failure. Opponents suggest resolving large banks through bankruptcies to protect taxpayers from potential losses. Repealing the FDIC's OLA authorities and amending the Bankruptcy Code could be considered by Congress. Community banks in the U.S. are smaller, simpler institutions that operate locally and focus on core banking activities like making loans and taking deposits. They differ from large banks not just in asset size but also in their business models and geographic scope. Issues related to community banks include regulatory relief and the long-term decline in their numbers. Small banks, also known as community banks, operate within a smaller geographic area and practice relationship lending. Proponents argue that these banks are crucial credit sources for local communities and underserved groups. Compared to large banks, small banks have fewer employees, fewer resources for regulatory compliance, and pose less systemic risk to the financial system. There is no standard definition or asset size threshold for small or community banks. The definition of small or community banks varies based on asset size thresholds. The Federal Reserve defines community banks as those with less than $10 billion in assets, while the OCC defines them as banks with $1 billion or less in assets. The FDIC has a research definition that includes banks with less than $1 billion in assets, as long as they make loans and take deposits. Small banks, also known as community banks, are defined by criteria such as asset allocation in loans, core deposits, and limited geographic presence. The terms \"small bank\" and \"community bank\" are used interchangeably in this report, referring to banks focused on serving local credit needs. The central question is whether the benefits of bank regulation outweigh the costs, known as regulatory burden. A regulation is considered beneficial if its benefits exceed the costs, but it is detrimental if the costs outweigh the benefits. Regulation could be positive if benefits exceed costs, but negative if costs exceed benefits. Critics argue that regulation on community banks may have large costs (compliance expenses) and small benefits (increased stability). However, small banks are given exemptions or tailored regulations to reduce their burden. Regulatory impact on small banks is considered during rulemaking. Bank regulators must consider the impact of rules on small banks under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act. Supervision for small banks is less burdensome compared to larger banks, with less-frequent examinations. The focus on systemic risk is primarily on large banks, leading to heightened regulatory standards for them under the Dodd-Frank Act. Opponents argue that small banks should still be subject to regulations despite posing less systemic risk. They point out that many small banks failed during and after the crisis due to insufficient prudential regulation. Easing regulations on small banks could be justified if there are economies of scale in regulatory compliance costs. Compliance costs may rise with size, but as a percentage of overall costs or revenues, they are likely to decrease. Regulatory complexity could make compliance relatively more costly for small firms. From a cost-benefit perspective, regulatory compliance costs may vary depending on the size of the bank. Small banks may face a larger burden in expanding their workforce to comply with regulations compared to larger banks. The balance of costs and benefits for a regulation could be different for small banks due to potential economies of scale in compliance costs. Some argue for reducing the regulatory burden on small banks to promote greater access to credit or lower credit prices. Empirical evidence on the impact of compliance costs on economies of scale is mixed. Small banks are argued to provide greater access to credit and lower prices for certain borrowers, such as those in low-income or rural communities. They are better suited for personalized \"relationship banking\" transactions and hold a significant portion of deposits in rural areas. Setting exemption thresholds for regulations is a challenge due to the lack of a clear definition. The debate over regulatory relief for small banks revolves around setting exemption thresholds based on size. Congress may choose to provide relief through ad hoc exemptions or by using size-based exemptions at higher thresholds. Size-based exemptions can benefit regional banks that are larger than community banks but smaller than the largest organizations. The number of FDIC-insured institutions in the United States has significantly decreased over the years, with small banks experiencing a decline in numbers and industry assets. One proposed alternative to the current system is a single, consistent exemption based on size or other criteria set by statute. The number of banks with more than $10 billion in assets increased significantly from 1986 to 2016, with their share of total industry assets rising to 82%. The decline in the number of banks was mainly due to mergers, averaging over 400 a year from 1990 to 2016. Failures also contributed to the decrease, especially during the financial crisis. Recently, new chartered institutions providing information to the FDIC have been minimal, with zero in 2016. Industry consolidation has been attributed to various factors, including regulatory issues. Industry consolidation in the banking sector has been driven by various factors, including regulatory burdens on small banks. Mergers, which are the largest factor in consolidation, can occur for reasons such as financial struggles or to benefit from a smaller bank's success. Other changes in the banking system besides regulatory burden may also be contributing to consolidation. The restrictions on branching and banking across state lines were not substantially deregulated until 1997 through the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. This led to easier consolidation for small banks and expansion opportunities for mid-size and large banks. Economies of scale in banking, driven by factors like information technology advancements, also contribute to industry consolidation. The slow growth post-recession and macroeconomic conditions like low interest rates may deter new firms from entering the banking market. Regulatory relief for community banks could address the decline in their numbers. Financial regulatory agencies operate independently, raising accountability issues. Financial regulators, including federal financial regulators, operate independently to implement laws and supervise financial institutions. They have characteristics that make them more independent from the President and Congress, such as self-funding ability and specific rulemaking requirements. Financial regulators have the ability to self-fund outside the appropriations process and have specific rulemaking requirements. This independence allows experts to design technical rules but raises questions about accountability to the electorate. The balance between independence and accountability is debated, with some arguing for more accountability for better regulatory outcomes. Self-funding provides financial regulators with a high degree of independence, while Congress can influence agencies through the appropriations process and reauthorization legislation. Financial regulators have the ability to self-fund outside the appropriations process, which some believe has led to excessive independence. Bringing financial regulators into the appropriations and authorization processes would increase accountability and provide Congress with opportunities to evaluate agency performance and influence activities. This could be done through legislating provisions that reallocate resources or place limitations on the use of appropriated funds to better reflect congressional priorities. Congress has control over an agency's funding, which can impact its independence and accountability. Critics argue that reduced independence could lead to politicized decision-making. To increase accountability, Congress could bring financial regulatory agencies into the appropriations and authorization processes. Different bank regulatory agencies have varying leadership structures, with some led by a single leader and others by multimember boards. Arguments are made for both structures, with boards promoting diverse views and unified leadership under one individual leading to faster decisions. The independence versus accountability trade-off is also a consideration, with Congress having control over agency funding impacting their independence and politicized decision-making. The leadership structure of regulatory agencies, whether headed by a single individual or a multimember commission, raises issues of independence versus accountability. A single leader may align more closely with the President's views, while a commission is seen as increasing agency independence. Characteristics like longer, staggered terms, expertise requirements for nominees, and removal only \"for cause\" can enhance independence from political influence. The leadership of financial regulatory agencies typically includes issue expertise and \"for cause\" removal protections, except for the Comptroller of the Currency. Congress could modify agency structures to adjust the balance between independence and accountability, such as by eliminating \"for cause\" removal protections or implementing a cost-benefit analysis requirement in the rulemaking process. The agency must demonstrate reasoned consideration for the necessity and effects of a rule, but fully quantified analysis is not always feasible due to uncertainty in predicting outcomes and challenges in quantifying human behavioral responses. The availability and accuracy of relevant data raise questions about the required scope, level of detail, and degree of quantification in the rulemaking process. Overly lenient requirements may lead to burdensome regulation with limited benefits, while overly onerous analytic requirements could impede progress. Debate over appropriate CBA requirements for financial regulators involves an additional complication. Most financial regulators are not subject to certain executive orders, giving them a high degree of discretion in the CBAs they perform. Experts disagree over whether greater discretion for financial regulators is appropriate, with some asserting that attempts to quantify the effects of financial regulation are imprecise. Some argue that quantifying the effects of financial regulation is imprecise and unreliable due to causal assumptions, data issues, and difficulty in measuring behavioral responses. There are calls for stricter CBA requirements to discipline agencies and assess regulations objectively. Some argue that quantifying the effects of financial regulation is challenging but possible. Congress has alternatives to change CBA requirements for financial regulators, such as requiring specific effects to be examined and quantified in the analysis. Another option is to extend executive orders related to CBA to independent regulatory agencies. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) provides a mechanism for Congress to invalidate final rules issued by federal agencies, increasing banking regulatory agencies' accountability. CRA was enacted due to concerns about Congress's ability to control the growing body of administrative rules. It requires agencies to report on their rulemaking activities and provides expedited procedures for Congress to consider legislation striking down agency rules. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to invalidate federal agency rules. It limits debate and amendments on joint resolutions disapproving a rule, ensuring a simple majority vote. If both houses agree on a resolution, it goes to the President for approval. If enacted, the rule is invalidated, and a new similar rule cannot be issued without specific authorization. Judicial review is prohibited under the CRA. Observers have criticized the CRA disapproval process as largely unworkable for oversight. A President is likely to veto resolutions against their own Administration's rules, requiring a supermajority to override. Congress can only block rules during transitions between administrations with aligned regulatory policies. The 115th Congress met these criteria, enacting 14 disapproval resolutions. The 115th Congress enacted 14 disapproval resolutions under the CRA mechanism, which critics find unworkable for oversight. There is a proposal to change the mechanism to require a resolution of approval for rules to go into effect, increasing congressional oversight but potentially politicizing the process. Banking is also influenced by market trends, with concerns about migration of certain issues affecting banks. The section analyzes issues related to trends concerning banks, including the migration of financial activity to nonbanks or \"shadow banking,\" the rise of financial technology (\"fintech\"), future interest rate increases, and competitive and regulatory challenges. Credit intermediation, a core banking activity, involves transforming short-term liabilities into long-term assets through deposits and loans. Legislative alternatives are not discussed due to the complex market forces involved. Banks face liquidity risks due to illiquid assets, which could lead to a \"run\" on the bank if depositors lose confidence. Government programs like the Federal Reserve and FDIC help mitigate these risks. Prudential regulations ensure banks manage risks effectively. Nonbank institutions also engage in credit intermediation, raising concerns about nonbank credit activities. Shadow banking, also known as nonbank credit intermediation, poses significant risks as it operates without government safety nets or prudential regulations like banks. This lack of explicit government support means taxpayers are less exposed to risk, but it also makes shadow banking more vulnerable to financial crises. Increased regulatory burdens on banks post-financial crisis could shift credit intermediation to lightly regulated nonbanks, potentially exacerbating systemic distress. During financial crises, risks in the shadow banking sector can lead to systemic distress. Money market mutual funds and short-term funding markets can experience run-like events, causing losses for investors. Nonbanks can also face liquidity problems when investing in mortgage-backed securities or other asset-backed securities. Since the financial crisis, regulatory changes have been made to address risks in money market, commercial paper, and repurchase agreement markets. Concerns remain about shadow banking and the potential migration of credit intermediation activities to nonbanks. Fintech technologies have the potential to change financial services, impacting banks' investment decisions and business models, while also introducing new competition. Fintech technologies, such as online marketplace lending, crowdfunding, blockchain, and robo-advising, are changing financial services. They offer greater efficiency, lower prices, and increased access to financial services for customers and small businesses. However, there are also risks of unexpected financial losses. Automation and digital technology are replacing traditional processes, leading to cost savings and affordable services for new customers. Fintech technologies offer efficiency, lower prices, and increased access to financial services. However, there are risks of unexpected financial losses. Some customers previously without access due to lack of credit information or geographic remoteness could benefit. Fintech may also create risks with new technologies having limited history of operation, potentially leading to inefficiencies. Additionally, fintech could eliminate experienced financial professionals who provide advice on financial products and risks. Fintech innovations may lead consumers to engage in financial activities with unclear risks. Some argue that regulations could hinder beneficial innovation and fail to address risks from new technologies. Companies incur compliance costs, but existing regulations could potentially accommodate new technologies while protecting against risks. Some countries use regulatory \"sandbox\" or \"greenhouse\" for companies to work with regulators on new products. Concerns exist about regulatory arbitrage in fintech and cybersecurity risks as digital technology use grows. Fintech and cybersecurity are closely related as digital activities generate sensitive data that can be used to assess risks and improve customer services. However, there are concerns about data theft, privacy issues, and the ownership and control of data. Companies using and collecting data must meet appropriate cybersecurity requirements. The Federal Reserve responded to the financial crisis by keeping interest rates low for an extended period using tools like quantitative easing. The Federal Reserve has increased its target rate as economic conditions improve, leading to concerns about how and when monetary policy will be normalized. Banks face challenges in a rising interest rate environment due to interest rate risk, with fixed-rate assets and short-term liabilities causing potential stress on net income. Banks face challenges in a rising interest rate environment as rates can increase quickly, impacting net income and market value of fixed-rate assets. Managing interest rate risk is crucial, as it can affect profitability by influencing the difference between long-term and short-term rates. Banks and regulators carefully examine balance sheets and plan for different interest rate scenarios to mitigate risks. Managing bank risk in a rising interest rate environment poses challenges due to prolonged low rates and unprecedented monetary policy tools. The mix of loans with different rates is difficult to achieve, and controlling the pace of interest rate growth may be challenging. Different types of charters, such as national bank, state bank, and federal savings association, are available for institutions engaged in traditional commercial banking activities. Different types of charters, like a state bank charter, federal savings association charter, or credit union charter, determine permissible activities, restrictions, and primary regulators for financial institutions. This system allows institutions to choose a regulatory regime that suits their business needs and risks. Each charter type subjects institutions to unique regulatory treatment and restrictions, creating competition among institutions with different business models. Institutions with different charters compete for business by taking deposits and making loans. Proposed regulation changes affect all charter types, leading to competition and resistance between institutions. Credit unions and community banks, despite similarities in customer service, have key differences such as credit unions being not-for-profit cooperatives. Credit unions are not-for-profit cooperatives serving members' financial needs, while banks serve the general public for profit. Regulation differs between the two, with credit unions facing limits on member business lending and banks being evaluated under the Community Reinvestment Act. Banks oppose easing credit union lending restrictions, while credit unions object to extending the Act to other institutions. The debate over extending the Community Reinvestment Act to other institutions, such as credit unions, continues as different types of institutions disagree on appropriate regulation. Despite efforts to minimize regulatory differences, challenges remain in aligning regulations between commercial banks and thrifts. Differences in regulations between commercial banks and thrifts have been challenging to align, with proposed legislation addressing these issues. The Financial CHOICE Act and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act propose changes to the financial regulatory system, including provisions related to banking issues. The report examines S. 2155, a bill proposing wide-ranging changes to the financial regulatory system, including provisions related to banking issues. It also discusses other bills related to regulatory relief for banks introduced in the 114th Congress and provides background and analysis of reforms in the Dodd-Frank Act. The report analyzes S. 2155, a bill proposing changes to the financial regulatory system, including provisions related to banking found in various titles."
