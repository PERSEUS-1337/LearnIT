    "content": "Weight decay is a common technique in neural networks, but its regularization effects are not well understood. Recent research challenges the traditional view of weight decay as $L_2$ regularization. Empirical studies show that weight decay can outperform $L_2$ regularization for certain optimizers. Three mechanisms of regularization by weight decay are identified: increasing the effective learning rate, approximately regularizing the input-output Jacobian norm, and reducing the effective damping coefficient for second-order optimization. Our results shed light on improving neural network regularization. Weight decay, a common technique, is often seen as L2 regularization, but recent findings challenge this view. Studies show weight decay can enhance training accuracy and generalization, especially with certain optimizers like Adam. This technique can increase the effective learning rate, regularize the input-output Jacobian norm, and reduce the damping coefficient for optimization. Weight decay regularization is widely used in networks with Batch Normalization, but its effect remains poorly understood. To better understand its impact, experiments were conducted with weight decay and L2 regularization on image classifiers using different optimization algorithms. The results align with previous observations, suggesting weight decay can enhance training accuracy and generalization, particularly with optimizers like Adam. This understanding can aid in designing more efficient and robust neural network architectures. Weight decay consistently outperformed L2 regularization, especially boosting the K-FAC optimizer and closing generalization gaps between optimizers and batch sizes. Three distinct mechanisms for weight decay's regularizing effect were identified, varying based on algorithm and architecture. Test accuracy comparisons were made on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, showing the impact of weight decay compared to L2 regularization and a baseline model. Weight decay improves performance across different optimizers and settings by affecting the effective learning rate, particularly in networks with batch normalization. Applying weight decay to layers with batch normalization captures its full regularization effect. The use of weight decay in K-FAC regularization reduces the Jacobian norm and improves generalization in linear and nonlinear networks. The damping effect in K-FAC is not scale-invariant, leading to increased effective damping without weight decay. Weight decay prevents the weights from growing large in K-FAC, maintaining its second-order properties and improving generalization. This highlights the complexity of neural network training and the importance of practical regularization effects. Further analysis is needed to understand the full extent of these mechanisms. To minimize the empirical risk in neural network training, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is commonly used. Gradient descent methods aim to minimize a surrogate objective in each iteration, with the distance function chosen as 1/2 * \u2206\u03b8^2. Solving this yields \u2206\u03b8 = -\u03b7\u2207 \u03b8 L(\u03b8), where \u03b7 is the learning rate. Despite their popularity, gradient descent methods can struggle to navigate effectively. Natural gradient descent is a variant of second-order methods that can navigate loss surfaces more effectively by considering curvature information. It can be derived by adapting steepest descent formulation using alternative distance functions like KL divergence or L2 distance. The Gauss-Newton algorithm updates neural network parameters using L2 distance on output logits. It is invariant to parameterization and equivalent to the Fisher matrix in regression tasks with squared error loss. In classification tasks with cross-entropy loss, the Fisher matrix is equivalent to the generalized Gauss-Newton matrix. In regression with squared error loss, the Hessian H is the identity matrix. Preconditioned gradient descent involves preconditioning the gradient with an extra curvature matrix C(\u03b8). Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC) uses a Kronecker-factored approximation for efficient natural gradient updates, applicable to Fisher and Gauss-Newton metrics. Batch Normalization (BN) stabilizes input distribution in network layers during training by subtracting the mean \u00b5 and dividing by standard deviation \u03c3. Normalized inputs are scaled and shifted based on trainable parameters \u03b3 and \u03b2. Weight decay regularization in training deep neural networks is discussed, with a focus on understanding its impact. Regularization in training deep neural networks is discussed, focusing on the relationship between L2 regularization and weight decay in different optimizers. Weight decay is equivalent to L2 regularization in gradient descent, but differs in preconditioned updates like Adam or K-FAC. The update rule for weight decay involves a rate \u03b2 and learning rate \u03b7, while the preconditioned gradient descent update with L2 regularization involves a matrix C-1. The difference lies in whether the preconditioner is applied to \u03b8t, with the weight decay update interpreted as a preconditioned gradient descent on a regularized objective. The text discusses the relationship between L2 regularization and weight decay in different optimizers.

The difference lies in whether the preconditioner is applied to \u03b8t, with the weight decay update interpreted as a preconditioned gradient descent on a regularized objective. Initial experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets show that the difference between the two updates has a substantial impact on generalization performance. The study compares VGG16 BID5 and ResNet32 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using different optimization algorithms: SGD, Adam, and K-FAC. Results show that weight decay consistently improves performance and closes generalization gaps between optimizers and batch sizes. Weight decay significantly improves performance across different optimizers and batch sizes, especially boosting the K-FAC optimizer when batch normalization is disabled. The study explores how weight decay interacts with batch normalization, showing unexpected effects on test accuracy. Different weight decay regularization schemes are tested on CIFAR-100 with SGD and Adam, demonstrating the impact on generalization. Weight decay applied to the last layer (fc) in the wd-fc model has a generalization effect when used with Batch Normalization (BN). In networks with BN, an L2 penalty does not constrain the representation significantly, as predictions are invariant to weight and bias rescaling. This means weight decay on layers with BN should have minimal effect on optimization. Weight decay in layers with Batch Normalization (BN) may not affect the optimal solution theoretically, but it has been found to improve generalization in BN networks. This improvement is attributed to weight decay increasing the effective learning rate by reducing weight scale, indirectly acting as a regularizer through the effective learning rate. This effect has been supported by additional evidence, particularly in the context of SGD optimization. The weight direction in SGD optimization is updated based on the weight vector's direction, leading to an effective learning rate proportional to \u03b7/ \u03b8 l 2 2. Weight decay regularization increases the effective learning rate by decreasing the scale of the weights, as shown in FIG3 for BN networks trained with SGD. The normalization effects of weight decay lead to a decrease in effective learning rate over epochs. Applying weight decay to convolution layers explains most of the generalization effect. Top layer weight decay has minimal impact on training curves for SGD and Adam. The effective learning rate hypothesis was tested by rescaling weights in each layer of a BN network without weight decay. This transfer scheme closed the generalization gap, showing that weight decay primarily achieves regularization through effective learning rate for BN networks trained with SGD or Adam. In Section 3, weight decay has a strong regularization effect when K-FAC is used as the optimizer. The effect of weight decay for K-FAC without BN is analyzed, showing regularization of the input-output Jacobian. Weight decay can be seen as approximate preconditioned gradient descent on the norm \u03b8 2 C = \u03b8 C\u03b8, with different interpretations based on the matrix C used. The K-FAC Gauss-Newton norm is derived from the K-FAC approximation to G, serving as a regularization method for neural networks. It is proportional to the average L2 norm of the network's outputs, aiming to moderate extreme predictions. The norm is related to the input-output Jacobian and parameter-output Jacobian for feed-forward neural networks with ReLU activation and no biases. For deep linear networks with whitened inputs, the K-FAC Gauss-Newton norm is proportional to the network's outputs. The K-FAC Gauss-Newton norm for linear networks with whitened inputs is proportional to the squared Frobenius norm of the input-output Jacobian. This relationship is significant for regularization, as the input-output Jacobian norm is linked to generalization performance. Theorem 1 states that for deep linear networks without biases and under certain assumptions, the Jacobian norm can be approximated. This provides insights into the dynamics of neural network training. The Jacobian regularization can help understand weight decay in practical networks. Training feed-forward networks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 shows a correlation between the Jacobian norm, K-FAC GN norm, and generalization gap. This relationship can inform the regularization of nonlinear networks. The Jacobian regularization can inform the regularization of nonlinear networks by understanding the correlation between Jacobian norm, K-FAC GN norm, and generalization gap. Weight decay with K-FAC optimizer reduces the Jacobian norm significantly compared to SGD. Applying weight decay to non-BN layers has the largest regularization effect. The regularization effect of weight decay is significant, especially on non-BN layers. The analysis focuses on the GN version of K-FAC, which may also inform the behavior of K-FAC-F. The Fisher-Rao norm has been proposed as a complexity measure for neural networks. K-FAC with weight decay is seen as constraining the network's capacity, particularly in architectures with BN layers. The Jacobian regularization mechanism does not apply in BN networks as rescaling the weights does not affect the input-output Jacobian. The regularization effect of weight decay is significant, especially on non-BN layers. In BN networks, rescaling the weights does not affect the input-output Jacobian. When using K-FAC, the effective learning rate mechanism does not apply, making it questionable to apply weight decay to BN layers with K-FAC. Applying weight decay to subsets of layers, especially non-BN layers, had a significant effect with K-FAC as the optimizer. The regularization hypothesis was consistent, and even applying weight decay to BN layers led to gains, particularly for K-FAC-F. The practical implementation of K-FAC dampens updates by adding a multiple of the identity matrix to the curvature, which explains why the invariance property is not contradicted. The update rule for normalized weights shows that for large weight norms or small weights, the update is close to the idealized. Weight decay helps K-FAC retain its second-order properties by keeping weights small. The norm of the GN matrix remains stable throughout training, unlike the norm of the Fisher matrix which decays significantly. In a classification task with cross-entropy loss, the Fisher matrix is equivalent to the generalized GN matrix E[J \u03b8 H J \u03b8]. Weight decay is beneficial for K-FAC in BN networks, even for layers with BN, to reduce effective damping and retain second-order properties. Weight decay reduces effective damping, helping K-FAC retain second-order properties. This effect is stronger for K-FAC-F due to the Fisher matrix shrinking during training. Weight decay improves generalization by increasing effective learning rate, reducing Jacobian norm, and damping parameter. Understanding weight decay's mechanisms is crucial in the complex dynamics of neural net training. The interactions between hyperparameters can impact generalization in neural networks. Automatic adaptation of optimization hyperparameters is necessary to focus on higher-level design issues. Experiments on image data support these findings. In this paper, experiments are conducted on image classification using different datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Various network architectures like fully-connected networks, VGG16, and ResNet32 are utilized. Three optimization methods - Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam, and K-FAC - are investigated. Different curvature matrices are studied in K-FAC. Default batch size is 128, and training is done with a budget of 200 epochs. In experiments on image classification with datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, various network architectures are used. Optimization methods include Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam, and K-FAC with different curvature matrices. Training is done with a budget of 200 epochs, adjusting learning rates and regularization factors through grid search on a validation set. The model is retrained with both training and validation data. For a feed-forward neural network with ReLU activation and no biases, Lemma 1 states a key observation. Lemma 1 states that rectified neural networks are piecewise linear up to the output f \u03b8 (x) with ReLU activation function. For a feed-forward neural network of depth L with ReLU activation function and no biases, the K-FAC Gauss-Newton norm is derived for linear networks with fully-connected layers. The Kronecker-product is exact under the condition that the network is linear, resulting in G K\u2212FAC being the diagonal block version of the Gauss-Newton matrix G. K-FAC is a diagonal block version of the Gauss-Newton matrix G. The natural gradient update is given by a specific formula, and the resulting gradient has a similar form to when Gauss-Newton matrix is considered constant. K-FAC has been used for efficient natural gradient optimization in deep neural networks. K-FAC, a method for efficient natural gradient optimization in deep neural networks, can be applied to general pullback metrics like the Fisher metric. It decouples the Fisher matrix of each layer using approximations, assuming independence between input activations and outputs. The whole Fisher matrix can be approximated as block diagonal consisting of layerwise Fisher matrices. The Fisher matrix F can be approximated as block diagonal with layerwise Fisher matrices. Decoupling into A and S avoids memory issues and allows for efficient natural gradient computation. K-FAC scales well with larger mini-batches compared to SGD. In this subsection, the generalization performance of K-FAC with large batch training and the effect of weight decay are analyzed. Comparisons are made between K-FAC and SGD using different batch sizes, showing a substantial generalization gap when moving from small to large batches. However, adding weight decay regularization to K-FAC closes the gap on CIFAR-10 and reduces it on CIFAR-100. Surprisingly, well-tuned weight decay regularization also eliminates the generalization gap of SGD. The text discusses the impact of weight decay regularization on training loss and speed, comparing different optimizers on CIFAR-10 dataset using VGG16 BID5 and ResNet32 models. The study focuses on generalization and convergence speed of deep neural networks. In experiments with different optimizers on CIFAR-10 dataset using VGG16 and ResNet32 models, K-FAC-G shows superior optimization in training loss per epoch compared to other baselines. Despite longer epoch times, K-FAC-G still demonstrates improvements in wall-clock time. Additionally, widening the network with a factor of 4 further enhances K-FAC-G's performance in terms of optimization and compute time."
