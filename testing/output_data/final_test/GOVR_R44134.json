    "content": "The FDA regulates the sale of drugs and biological products in the US under the FFDCA. Manufacturers need approval for prescription drugs (NDA) and vaccines (BLA). The FDA can expand access to drugs through mechanisms like compassionate use and emergency use authorization. Compassionate use allows terminal patients to access investigational drugs when other options have been exhausted. In 2014, FDA approved 1,882 requests for investigational drugs, with only 9 denials. Companies do not disclose how many access requests they deny. Bioethicist Arthur Caplan suggests that only a small fraction of requests are likely to be granted by manufacturers. Expanded access to investigational drugs is a topic of increasing public and congressional discussion. Advocates are pushing for right-to-try laws to bypass FDA authorization, using social media to influence decision-making. FDA's high approval rate may not reflect the number of patients and doctors who did not pursue expanded access due to the lengthy process. Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) can be issued during emergencies by FDA for unapproved products. Advocates aim to bypass FDA authorization using social media influence to access investigational drugs. Demand for unapproved medical products to combat Ebola is increasing. Congress questions FDA's compassionate use and emergency use authority for patients with life-threatening conditions. FDA weighs risks and benefits to allow access to medical products through normal approval channels or outside them. FDA policies on compassionate use and emergency use authority allow access to investigational drugs. Manufacturers must obtain FDA approval before selling a drug in the US. The process involves submitting a new drug application (NDA) or a biologics license application (BLA) with data from clinical trials. An investigational new drug (IND) application can be submitted after laboratory and animal studies. After obtaining FDA approval, a sponsor can start Phase I clinical trials to test the safety of a new drug in human volunteers. If the results are promising, the sponsor can proceed to Phase II and Phase III trials to assess the drug's efficacy in larger groups of individuals with specific conditions or diseases. The FDA approves drugs based on clinical trial analyses presented in marketing applications. Prescribing decisions are left to licensed clinicians, but the FDA may impose restrictions like REMS to manage risks. The FDA may require patient registries or tests at dispensing for drugs with REMS. Ongoing requirements for manufacturers include facility registration, inspections, and adverse event reporting. FDA may also mandate studies to address safety or efficacy concerns. Manufacturers can distribute drugs in the US only with FDA approval or in clinical trials under an IND. Expanded access to investigational drugs can be granted through individual investigational new drug applications (compassionate use) or emergency use authorizations. This allows individuals who are excluded from clinical trials due to specific criteria or trial limitations to request access to the investigational drug through FDA's expanded access procedure. A person, with a licensed physician's approval, can request access to an investigational drug if there is no alternative therapy available for a serious disease, the risks are not greater than the disease, and there is evidence of safety and effectiveness. The sponsor or clinical investigator must submit a clinical protocol to the Secretary for approval. Expanded use of investigational drugs involves submitting a clinical protocol to the Secretary for approval, following FFDCA Section 505(i) and related regulations. Different categories of expanded use include individual patient INDs, intermediate-size patient populations, and treatment INDs for widespread use. FDA evaluates these requests on a case-by-case basis, with the requesting physician acting as the investigator responsible for informed consent and IRB review. The manufacturer is accountable for ensuring safety. The FDA may permit a manufacturer to charge for the direct costs of making an investigational drug available through expanded access. The manufacturer's agreement to provide the drug is crucial as it cannot be obtained otherwise. The FDA commissioner can issue an emergency use authorization for temporary use of medical products that are not approved or licensed. Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) allows temporary use of medical products not approved or licensed, in response to a military, domestic, or public health emergency. The FDA commissioner must consult with HHS officials and ensure the product is effective with benefits outweighing risks, with no approved alternatives available. FDA has issued EUAs for various products like anthrax vaccine and antivirals for H1N1 influenza. In response to public health emergencies, FDA issues Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for medical products like antivirals for H1N1 influenza and diagnostic tests for Ebola. Decisions on EUAs consider factors like patient prognosis, community threat, and available treatments. Using unapproved products poses risks to patients, research, and manufacturers, as safety and effectiveness thresholds are established for all drugs, even FDA-approved ones. FDA approval involves weighing potential risks against benefits, with the threshold for acceptable risk increasing with the risk of not taking action. The FDA's decisions on drug approval generally fall into four categories: approved use for a new drug, unapproved use of a drug approved for another use, off-label use by physicians, and emergency use authorizations during public health emergencies. The threshold for acceptable risk increases with the risk of not taking action, as seen in scenarios where patients may opt for treatments with higher risks but potential benefits. The FDA regulates drug approval for various categories, including approved use for new drugs, unapproved use of drugs approved for other purposes, off-label use by physicians, and emergency use authorizations during public health emergencies. In cases of off-label use, clinicians may use a drug for a different condition than its approved indication, with limited data on effectiveness. The FDA requires clinical trials to protect patients from unnecessary risks, prohibiting sponsors from providing unapproved drugs outside of trials without permission. Individual access to investigational drugs may be allowed by the FDA, but sponsors cannot be compelled to provide them. Before clinical tests have started, researchers have conducted no human safety studies. FDA might analyze animal studies and information about similar drugs or diseases to assess the use of experimental products. Risk criteria for an individual may differ from public health policy. Some criticize the process of requesting a treatment IND from FDA as cumbersome, while others question FDA's role as a gatekeeper. Manufacturers may refuse to provide their experimental drugs. Critics argue that the FDA's procedures for compassionate use access are bureaucratic and flawed, calling for measures to bypass the FDA. Congress may need to examine if the FDA's application process discourages patients from seeking treatment. The FDA is addressing concerns about the time-consuming application process for individual patient expanded access. A new draft form is being circulated to simplify the process by allowing reference to information already submitted in an IND. This aims to facilitate access to drugs for individual patient treatment use. USA Today proposed a \"right-to-try\" solution to bypass the FDA's bureaucratic procedures for compassionate use access. The FDA is addressing concerns about the application process for individual patient expanded access by circulating a new draft form. USA Today proposed \"right-to-try\" laws to allow terminally ill patients access to investigational drugs under certain conditions set by state laws. \"In early June 2015, governors in 20 states signed laws addressing informed consent and liability issues for terminally ill patients to use investigational medical products. Arizona voters passed a similar ballot referendum in November 2014, with legislators in 17 other states introducing bills. The Goldwater Institute's model has influenced many of these bills, while three House bills in the 114th Congress at the federal level also aim to allow terminally ill patients access to experimental drugs with informed consent. The 2013 movie Dallas Buyers Club has also been a motivating factor, depicting the challenges faced by people with AIDS in obtaining experimental drugs.\" State right-to-try laws allow patients to access investigational drugs without FDA permission after passing Phase 1 trials. However, experts doubt these laws increase access due to potential federal law preemption and FDA approval processes. FDA granted 99.5% of expanded access requests from FY2010 to FY2014, showing existing pathways for access. The push for state right-to-try laws is seen as part of a broader strategy for patient access to experimental treatments. The push for state right-to-try laws is part of a broader strategy to influence Congress and FDA. FDA's inability to compel drug manufacturers poses a key obstacle. In a case in March 2014, an unapproved drug was not provided to a boy with cancer, highlighting the limitations of FDA approval processes. The FDA may allow the use of unapproved drugs in certain cases through compassionate use, but manufacturers must agree to provide the drug. Companies face a complex decision when deciding to provide experimental drugs, considering factors like profit, public relations, limited resources, liability, safety, and FDA approval implications. Limited drug supply can also impact the decision-making process. Limited drug supply can impact the distribution of experimental drugs, as manufacturers may only have small amounts for early clinical trials. Scaling up production for emergency circumstances involves financial and logistic decisions. Committing additional resources to increase production could be a solution in such cases. The FDA may adapt inspection and review timetables in emergencies, contact other manufacturers, or import unapproved products. During the Ebola outbreak, funds were used to scale up production of potential treatments. Manufacturers have raised liability concerns regarding expanded access to investigational products. Congress could address these concerns as it has in the past. Congress could consider diverse approaches to protect manufacturers, clinicians, and patients in various situations. Limited resources may hinder setting up a compassionate use program, potentially delaying clinical trials and product launches. One CEO emphasized the ethical standard of equitable access to investigational drugs, prioritizing approval for the benefit of many individuals. The CEO highlighted the importance of equitable access to investigational drugs, emphasizing the potential delays in clinical trials and product launches if resources are diverted. Government or private resources could supplement a small biotech company's staff and facilities to allow research to continue while providing experimental products to those in need. Manufacturers could modify clinical trial designs with FDA consultation to incorporate information from patients in expanded access programs. Taking experimental drugs through expanded access programs may hinder the collection of data necessary to assess safety and effectiveness. The lack of disclosure on the number of requests and denials for expanded access makes it challenging to address obstacles faced by manufacturers. Manufacturers do not report the number of individuals approaching them for experimental drugs, which may be significantly higher than successful requests submitted to the FDA. The manufacturer of an investigational immunotherapy drug received over 100 requests for it, despite not having a compassionate use program. Congress aims to balance public safety with expediting new drug approvals. FDA has tools like compassionate use and emergency use authorization to speed up drug access for patients. The FDA provides incentives for drug development, including market exclusivity and priority review vouchers to expedite approval for drugs treating certain diseases. The FDA provides incentives for drug development, including market exclusivity and priority review vouchers to expedite approval for drugs treating tropical or rare pediatric diseases. Manufacturers can use the voucher to get priority review for subsequent NDAs or sell it to another manufacturer. FDA can expedite development and review for drugs addressing unmet needs or serious conditions, offering better outcomes, or meeting other criteria for better public health. Fast track and breakthrough designations speed up the application process, while accelerated approval and animal efficacy approval change the evidence needed for approval. The FDA regulates drug access through product approval, licensing, and risk evaluation strategies. It enforces restrictions on imports, exports, and supply chain, and recommends controlled substance status to the DEA. Government tools like laws and regulations also control access through patents, insurance coverage, and Medicare/Medicaid. The FDA focuses on regulatory science to develop new tools for assessing product safety and efficacy. Efforts include expertise in evaluating animal models, biomarkers, genomics, and nanotechnology. Computer simulations and data analysis can lead to new statistical techniques for clinical trials, potentially shortening their length. Interest in compassionate use and emergency use policies is increasing. Increased interest in compassionate use and emergency use policies is driven by concerns of individuals facing serious conditions and the public attention on the Ebola virus outbreak. The 114th Congress may need to consider defining risks and benefits, making changes to FDA authority, and increasing access to drugs in development. The 114th Congress may need to consider changes to FDA authority and policy to increase access to unapproved products and encourage research for unmet needs, balancing scientific rigor with compassion in public health. No FDA-approved drugs or vaccines specifically treat or prevent Ebola virus disease. In August 2014, during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, there were no approved drugs or vaccines available. The World Health Organization deemed it ethical to provide unapproved drugs to Ebola-infected individuals, emphasizing the importance of ethical criteria, data collection, and conducting clinical trials. Further discussions will focus on determining the ethical threshold for such interventions. During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in August 2014, two volunteers were infected with the virus while providing medical care. They received an experimental drug that had shown promise in nonhuman primates but had not yet entered human testing. The volunteers were flown to a hospital in Atlanta and both survived, raising questions about the drug's effectiveness. FDA's policies on expanded access to investigational drugs were not applicable in this case due to the drug not being in the investigational new drug stage. Since August 2014, Ebola-specific medical products have entered clinical trials with support from the U.S. and other governments. FDA may allow the use of investigational drugs and vaccines under expanded access policies. Emergency use authorization could be considered as more information on these products becomes available. FDA has approved several diagnostic tests under EUA. Several commentators, including NIAID Director Anthony Fauci, emphasize the need for data collection to support the safety and effectiveness of unapproved drugs distributed in emergencies. Placebo use in deadly situations is deemed unethical, but in cases of drug scarcity, not all patients may receive treatment. A strategic approach could ethically determine drug allocation or track patient outcomes to prevent misinterpretation of a drug's efficacy due to lack of data. Incorrect assumptions about a drug's effectiveness or ineffectiveness can harm future patients and the larger community by preventing rigorous assessment of its safety and effectiveness. This lack of information could lead to increased spending on ineffective or unsafe products in critical situations. Emergency use plans should address data collection and access to inform future decisions on drug usage."
