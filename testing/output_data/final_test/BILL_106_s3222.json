    "content": "The Act titled \"Harmful Nonnative Weed Control Act of 2000\" is established for the purpose of controlling nonnative weeds. Congress finds that public and private land in the United States is facing unprecedented and severe stress from harmful, nonnative weeds, causing economic and resource value destruction. The damage is estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars annually, requiring coordinated action by all stakeholders at the local, state, and federal levels. The Act aims to provide assistance to weed management entities to control harmful nonnative weeds on public and private land, coordinate projects with existing weed management areas, and stimulate the formation of new local or regional cooperative weed management entities. Inadequate funding and coordination have hindered effective action against nonnative weeds. The Act aims to assist weed management entities in controlling harmful nonnative weeds by leveraging funds from various sources and promoting healthy plant communities. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms such as Advisory Committee, Secretary, and State. SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM. The Secretary will establish a program to provide financial assistance to control harmful nonnative weeds. SEC. 5. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. An advisory committee will be established under section 5. The Secretary will establish an advisory committee in the Department of the Interior composed of up to 10 individuals with expertise in harmful, nonnative weed management. Committee members serve 4-year terms and receive no compensation for their service. The Advisory Committee members are allowed travel expenses while performing their duties, and the Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to them. SEC. 6. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS TO STATES. The Secretary, in consultation with the Advisory Committee, allocates funds to States for weed management projects based on the seriousness of the weed problem, leveraging non-Federal funds, and State progress in addressing the issue. The Secretary, in consultation with the Advisory Committee, allocates funds to States for weed management projects based on the seriousness of the weed problem, leveraging non-Federal funds, State progress, eligibility for base payments, and other recommended factors. The Secretary allocates funds to States for weed management projects based on various factors. A State receiving funds under section 6 must allocate not more than 25 percent for base payments to weed management entities and at least 75 percent for financial awards to these entities. Base payments are used for project costs or other related purposes. To be eligible for a base payment, a weed management entity must be established by local stakeholders to control harmful weeds on public or private land or increase public knowledge about weed control. The Federal share of project costs shall not exceed 50 percent. The weed management entity must provide education on controlling harmful weeds and report on their activities to the State annually. The weed management entity must control harmful, nonnative weeds on public or private land and increase public knowledge about the need for weed eradication. Financial awards are provided to weed management entities for these activities. Weed management entities can use financial awards to cover 50% of project costs selected by the State. To be eligible, entities must meet requirements for a base payment and submit a project description to the State. An eligible weed management entity can use financial awards to fund projects for controlling or eradicating harmful, nonnative weeds on public or private land. Projects can include education, inventories, monitoring, and innovative activities, with projects selected by the State on a competitive basis. The financial awards can fund projects to control harmful, nonnative weeds on public or private land. Projects selected on a competitive basis based on seriousness of the problem, likelihood of resolution, leveraging non-Federal funds, progress made in addressing the issue, comprehensive approach, and reduction of harmful weeds. The weed management entity determines the scope of projects to reduce harmful, nonnative weeds within the State using financial awards. Projects can also address weed problems in multiple states if they meet applicable laws. A weed management entity can use funds to control or eradicate weeds on public or private land with owner approval, excluding land for row crops, fruits, or vegetables. Funds cannot be used for aquatic noxious weeds or animal pests. Administrative costs are limited to 5% of funds available. The program established by this Act requires States or the Federal Government to cover administrative costs, including those related to Federal environmental laws. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS: Sums necessary for carrying out this Act can be appropriated."
