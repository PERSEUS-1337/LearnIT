    "content": "As of February 11, 2009, 240 individuals have served for 30 years or more in the US Congress, which is only 2% of all representatives and senators since 1789. Among them, 139 served in the House, 29 in the Senate, and 72 in both chambers. The number of long-serving members has increased over time, with only two starting in the 18th century and 100 by 1967. As of February 11, 2009, 240 individuals in the 111th Congress have served for 30 years or longer. Among them, 16 Senators and 18 Representatives have reached this milestone. The table lists Members in descending order of their length of service, including party, state, dates of service, and total days in Congress. Calculations of days of service varied based on the Member's pattern of service. For example, Clarence A. Cannon of Missouri served continuously from 3/4/1923 to 5/12/1964, totaling 15,045 days. Cannon, Morrill, and Jackson served in Congress for extended periods. Morrill served for a total of 16,006 days, while Jackson's total days of service were 15,582 days due to an overlap in his official dates of service. Jackson's total days of congressional service were 15,582 days. Samuel Smith served in the House and Senate with breaks in between, totaling 14,276 days of congressional service. Dates of service were drawn from official sources. The text chunk discusses the sources used to gather information on United States Senators in the U.S. Congress, including the Senate Manual and Congressional Directory. If dates were unclear, other sources were consulted for clarification."
