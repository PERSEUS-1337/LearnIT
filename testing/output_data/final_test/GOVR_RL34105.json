    "content": "Child support constitutes 17% of family income on average, rising to about 30% for poor households. It is a crucial income source for single-parent families, with custodial mothers receiving $4,647 annually on average, 20% more than fathers. This financial support helps low-income families become self-supporting. In 2003, child support represented 19% of custodial parents' income, with most child support for TANF families being kept by the government. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 incentivizes states to allocate more child support to families. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 encourages states to pass through child support payments to former TANF families, allowing them to keep more or all of the support without it affecting their benefits. This policy aims to promote self-sufficiency and cooperation with child support enforcement. If states implement this policy, the federal government will waive its share of the child support collections, up to $100 per month for one child or up to $200 per month for two or more children. This report explores the potential impact of six states adopting these policies. The report analyzes the financial impact of adopting the DRA child support pass-through and disregard policies for TANF families in six states. It compares the distribution of child support under current rules and DRA rules for a mother with two children, showing detailed tables in the appendices. The report examines the financial impact of adopting the DRA provisions on child support pass-through and disregard policies for TANF families in six states. It compares the distribution of child support under current rules and DRA rules, showing tables in the appendices. The DRA incentivizes states to have a pass-through and disregard policy by requiring the federal government to share in the cost. The DRA requires the federal government to share in the cost of passing through and disregarding up to $200 per month for a TANF family with two or more children. States with existing pass-through and disregard policies would benefit financially from the DRA provisions. Opting for the full $200 pass-through and disregard may result in a cost to the state, depending on various factors such as pre-DRA policies, family income, TANF eligibility, and FMAP. The DRA provisions would reduce the cost of the pass-through and disregard policy for poorer states compared to higher-income states in sharing child support collections. For example, West Virginia sends back 72.82% of its child support collections to the federal government, while Maryland sends back 50.00%. Under the DRA policy, the federal government would forego its share of child support collections in poorer states like West Virginia. The cost of the policy would be higher for the federal government than for the states overall. The DRA provisions could increase a TANF parent's income by up to $200 per month, but families ineligible for TANF due to earnings may not benefit. Some states have income eligibility thresholds that make families ineligible for TANF even with 20 hours of work per week. In California, a mother of two working 40 hours per week at $7.25 per hour would be eligible for TANF based on January 2007 rules. The interests of the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program and CSE families may not always align, as families aim for maximum income while the program focuses on investing in CSE activities. Retaining child support collections is often prioritized over pass-through and disregard amounts in many states. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, established in 1975, aims to secure financial support from noncustodial parents to lower government welfare costs. All states and territories operate CSE programs to receive federal matching funds. Retaining child support collections is prioritized over pass-through and disregard policies, benefiting families and reducing welfare dependency. Native American tribes can operate CSE programs with federal funding. Families with children living apart from one parent are eligible for CSE services. Families receiving TANF benefits, Title IV-E foster care payments, or Medicaid automatically qualify for free CSE services. Other families must apply and pay a fee not exceeding $25. Child support collected through the CSE system goes to the family or reimburses state and federal governments for TANF payments. The cash welfare program has shifted its focus from cost recovery to supporting families with children. Cash welfare payments have decreased significantly, leading to fewer costs to recoup. The number of families on cash welfare has also decreased, resulting in fewer families and dollars affected by the program. This decline is reflected in the changing composition of the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) caseload. The composition of the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) caseload is changing, with a decrease in TANF families. Child support collections increased overall, but collections for TANF families decreased. In FY2006, only 4% of CSE collections were made on behalf of TANF families, with most going to the state and federal governments for TANF benefits reimbursement. In FY2006, 91% of Child Support Enforcement (CSE) collections ($21.8 billion) went to families on the CSE rolls. The largest group of families in the CSE program were former TANF families (46%), followed by families who had never been on TANF (39%) and those currently receiving TANF benefits (15%). Most of the CSE caseload is composed of non-TANF families (85%), but the majority of them had received TANF/AFDC at some point in their lives (61%). The expectation is that as child support becomes a more stable income source, former TANF families will not have to return to the TANF rolls. Former TANF families may not need to return to the program if child support collections exceed TANF benefits. Recipients must cooperate with the Child Support Enforcement system and establish paternity. Rights to child support paid while on welfare are turned over to the state, which decides whether to pass it on to the family. The state decides whether to pay received child support to the family based on rules governing division of child support. Special rules apply in \"gap\" states. Different rules apply for current due support and past-due support. Current child support pass-through and disregard rules only apply to TANF families for current support payments. Arrearage payments are kept by the state and federal government. The focus is on collections of current support to increase economic independence of former TANF families. The DRA aims to enhance the economic independence of former TANF families by allowing states to provide them with all child support collected on their behalf. When applying for TANF, the custodial parent must assign the right to the state for child support. If child support collections are less than the TANF benefit, the state retains the collections. The CSE program's goal in 1975 was to recover the costs of providing cash welfare. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, enacted in 1975, aimed to recover costs of providing cash welfare by using child support collected for families on welfare to offset benefit expenses. The sharing arrangement between federal and state governments was based on the Medicaid matching rate, which varies with state per capita income. The Child Support Enforcement program, established in 1975, aimed to use child support collections to offset welfare expenses. The distribution of child support collections between federal and state governments was based on the Medicaid matching rate, with states keeping a smaller portion if they had a larger Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The matching rate ranged from 50% to a maximum of 83%. The TANF block grant replaced AFDC in 1996, maintaining the same matching rate procedure for CSE collections. The $50 pass-through was eliminated, and child support collected for cash welfare families is divided between federal and state governments based on the Medicaid matching rate. States have discretion over the state share of collections made on behalf of welfare families. States have discretion over the state share of child support collections made on behalf of welfare families. They decide whether to pass-through child support to families, which can affect TANF eligibility and benefits. When determining TANF eligibility and benefits, child support collections are not disregarded, leading to a reduction in the family's TANF grant by $1 for each $1 in child support received. A disregard of child support income allows families to keep a certain amount without affecting TANF benefits or eligibility. Before the CSE program, child support was paid directly to the custodial parent, counting as income for AFDC eligibility. After the enactment of the CSE program in 1975, all child support payments had to be paid to the CSE agency, resulting in a decrease in AFDC benefits for families. Some states allowed families to use their own income to make up the difference between the AFDC payment and the standard of need, increasing their disposable income. After the CSE program was implemented in 1975, child support payments had to be paid to the state, reducing AFDC benefits for families. This led to concerns about a decrease in total income for AFDC families in \"fill-the-gap\" states, where child support payments filled the income gap. P.L. 94-88 addressed this by requiring monthly supplemental payments to AFDC families. The gap payment provision required monthly supplemental payments to AFDC recipients in \"fill-the-gap\" states to ensure they received a certain level of income despite new child support rules. This provision was funded by TANF funds. Under pre-DRA policies, states have the option to not apply federal child support distribution rules to gap payments funded by TANF. If a state chooses to operate a pass-through policy, it must repay the federal government its share of collected child support, even if none is passed through to the custodial parent. Passing through and disregarding child support to TANF families counts towards the state's TANF spending requirement. States have the authority to determine TANF eligibility and benefit amounts based on financial need, with different rules for counting child support income. Table 1 outlines child support pass-through and disregard policies in the TANF program as of April 2007. The TANF program eligibility is determined by states based on financial need, with varying rules for counting child support income. States may choose to count all child support income, exclude up to $50 per month, or not count any at all. Additionally, states have different policies for passing through child support to TANF families and disregarding some of that amount in determining TANF cash payments. Among states, there are varying policies regarding child support collected on behalf of TANF families. Some states retain all child support to reimburse the federal government and states for cash welfare payments. Others allow a portion of child support to be passed through to the family without affecting TANF payments. As of April 2007, 27 states have no pass-through policy, 12 states pass through and disregard up to $50 per month, and 7 states pass through a supplement. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 aims to provide stable income for single-parent families with a noncustodial parent by simplifying CSE assignment and distribution rules. Some states pass through and disregard child support payments, while others pass through an added amount to TANF cash benefits. One state passes through all child support payments to custodial parents without disregarding any income. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 strengthens \"family-first\" policies by providing incentives to states to direct more child support to TANF families. States can now pay up to $100 per month (or $200 for families with two or more children) in child support directly to the family without reimbursing state or federal treasuries. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires states to exclude child support payments from TANF cash welfare eligibility calculations. The impact of this policy change varies depending on state TANF policies and family circumstances. Six states were examined to assess the effects on family and government budgets. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires states to exclude child support payments from TANF cash welfare eligibility calculations. Six states were chosen based on their child support policies and TANF benefit amounts. California and Illinois pass-through and disregard up to $50 in child support payments, while Maryland and Oklahoma do not have such policies. West Virginia provides a $25 \"incentive payment\" for families with child support collected. Maine is a \"gap payment\" state. The impact of the DRA on these states is examined next. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires states to exclude child support payments from TANF cash welfare eligibility calculations. California's maximum TANF cash welfare benefit is $723 for a family of three, representing only about half of the federal poverty guideline. Allowing a family to keep $200 per month in child support increases family income by 14% of the poverty threshold. The implementation of DRA's full pass-through and disregard provisions can increase family income for TANF welfare recipients. Families with child support income greater than the TANF benefit may become newly eligible for TANF if up to $200 in child support is disregarded in eligibility calculations. Families may be eligible for TANF if up to $200 in child support is disregarded in eligibility calculations. However, some families may not see an increase in income if their earnings exceed the state's income eligibility threshold. In January 2007, many families were ineligible for TANF even with 20 hours of work per week, except in California. The effects of implementing the new DRA pass-through and disregard rules on family incomes are illustrated in tables. Table 2 compares TANF and child support income for a mother of two under current state policies versus the maximum allowed under DRA. The table shows income for families with zero earnings and child support ranging from $0 to $500 per month. DRA policies could increase monthly income by up to $200 in states like Maryland and Oklahoma. The simulation assumes that adopting DRA policies could increase monthly income by up to $175 in West Virginia and $150 in Maine for families receiving TANF and child support. Maine is a \"gap\" state, resulting in an increase of up to $135 per month for the hypothetical family. The maximum increase in combined TANF payments and child support income would be less if the noncustodial parent paid less than $200 per month. The increase in income for TANF families under DRA policies varies by state and the amount of child support paid. In some cases, families may be newly eligible for TANF due to the greater disregard of child support. Table 3 details the impact on a hypothetical mother with zero earnings and two children, showing income under both pre-DRA and DRA policies. The DRA policies would increase income for a hypothetical family by $200 per month in Maryland and $150 in California and Illinois, significantly supplementing their income. In California, the combined income would rise to $923 per month, representing 65% of the poverty threshold. Child support plays a crucial role in lifting family income relative to the poverty level. The DRA policies would increase income for a hypothetical family by $175 in West Virginia, $115 in Maine, and $192 in Oklahoma. The interaction of child support disregard and TANF eligibility thresholds can result in a reduced impact on family income. A hypothetical family of three with $300 in child support income per month would be ineligible for TANF cash welfare in Oklahoma due to the income exceeding the maximum TANF grant. However, if Oklahoma adopted a $200 child support pass-through and disregard, the family would become eligible for TANF cash welfare. This would result in the family receiving $292 TANF cash grant plus $200 in child support, with the state and federal government keeping the remaining $100 in child support. The net gain to the family would be $192. The DRA child support policies impact eligibility for TANF cash welfare. Tables illustrate the impact on a mother with earnings and two children, showing combined income for different work hours. Not all families with earnings benefit from the policies, as eligibility for TANF determines the benefit. Table 4 illustrates how a family with two children and a mother working part-time at minimum wage would receive the maximum income increase in California and Maine. However, they would be ineligible for TANF in Oklahoma and West Virginia due to high earnings and child support. In Illinois and Maryland, the family is ineligible for TANF under pre-DRA rules, but could qualify if child support is disregarded. Illinois would see a net income increase of $80, while Maryland would see an increase of $101. The net income increase for a family with two children and a mother working full-time at minimum wage varies across states. In California, the DRA rules would result in a net income gain of $86, making the family eligible for TANF. However, in other states, such as Maryland, $300 in child support would make families ineligible for TANF. Increasing the child support pass-through and disregard could potentially increase the income of TANF welfare families. The DRA provides a financial incentive for states to pass-through and disregard more child support collected for TANF families, shifting some costs to the federal government. This cost shift is complex, with some families benefiting from lower state costs while others would bear the burden. The DRA policies would shift costs to the federal government by increasing TANF cash welfare expenditures for families eligible for child support pass-through and disregard. The cost burden would vary between the federal government and states, with some families benefiting from lower state costs while others bear the burden. Under DRA policies, a family with zero earnings can be eligible for TANF if the noncustodial parent pays $300 per month in child support. $200 of the child support would be passed-through and disregarded, resulting in a $292 TANF benefit for the family. The state retains $100 of the child support, sending $68 to the federal government and keeping $32. Cost-sharing arrangements vary among states based on their FMAP, with poorer states sending back a greater share of child support collections to the federal government. For example, West Virginia sends back 72.82% of its collections, while Maryland sends back 50.00%. In poorer states like West Virginia, a small share of child support collections is retained for cash welfare families. Under DRA policies, the federal government would cover a higher percentage of the pass-through and disregard for poorer states compared to better off states. For example, in West Virginia, the federal government would cover 72.82% of a $200 pass-through, while in Maryland, it would cover 50.00%. The relationship between state income and cost-sharing of the DRA pass-through and disregard changes when TANF covers the cost. The cost-sharing of the DRA pass-through and disregard varies based on TANF benefits and state per-capita income. Table 6 shows how states and the federal government would share the costs. Implementing the policy could result in reductions in federal and state shares of child support collections in some states. The DRA policy would allow a hypothetical family to gain $192 extra income per month through the TANF program by keeping $200 of child support income and receiving $292 in TANF payments. The state would cover the additional income with TANF dollars, while the federal government and state would share the remaining $100 in child support. The DRA policy would result in the state paying $292 in added TANF expenditures, partially offset by the state's share of child support collections for a total state cost of $260. The federal government would not incur any cost and would keep its $68 share of the child support collection. In West Virginia, the state would save $25 in TANF expenditures by eliminating a $25 incentive payment. In California and Maine, a mother with two children would receive $150 per month in additional income after the DRA policy implementation. After implementing a DRA pass-through and disregard provisions, states like Maine, Illinois, and Maryland would see an increase in additional income for families. Maine benefits from a higher FMAP and a $135 \"gap\" payment, while Illinois and Maryland's policies would allow a mother with two children to remain on TANF rolls with half-time earnings. Maine stands out as the only state where a family working at half-time minimum wage benefits more than a family with no earnings, aligning with policies to encourage work and cooperation in attaining child support. Maine's fill-the-gap policy benefits welfare recipients by providing additional income through a DRA pass-through and disregard policy. This policy allows a mother with two children to receive $86 per month in California, enabling them to remain on TANF rolls with full-time earnings. This results in the state paying $186 in added TANF expenditures, partially offsetting the cost. The state pays $186 in additional TANF expenditures, partially offset by child support collections, resulting in a total state cost of $136. The interests of individual families and state CSE programs may not always align, with families seeking maximum financial benefit and CSE programs needing funds for various activities. The ability to retain child support collections is crucial for CSE activities, as it serves the entire clientele. The simulations show the direct impacts of DRA policies on family income and government budgets. However, the potential changes in behavior, like noncustodial parents' willingness to pay child support, are not captured. The costs of implementing DRA policies include reduced child support collections retained by federal and state governments. The child support pass-through and disregard policy aims to encourage cooperation with the CSE program and compliance with child support orders. Noncustodial parents want to see their payments benefit their children directly, rather than viewing welfare benefits as sufficient support. Compliance with child support orders is crucial for financial support for children. Child support analysts argue that compliance with child support orders can lead to increased involvement of noncustodial parents in their child's life. Negative perceptions of the pass-through and disregard policy in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to its elimination in 1996, allowing states to recover more cash welfare payments. Retention of child support payments by governments can impact noncustodial parents' attitudes towards child support. Retention of child support payments affects noncustodial parents' attitudes. In a study of a program for low-income noncustodial parents behind on child support, reasons for not paying included money going to welfare, high support orders, unemployment, and disagreements over spending. Studies on child support policies in the 1990s focused on custodial parents. The 1990s child support reform experiments focused on custodial parents' receipt of child support income. Evaluations showed increased income due to pass-through and disregard policies. The Wisconsin Child Support Demonstration Evaluation provided direct evidence of changes in parental behavior with larger pass-through and disregards. The evaluation compared full pass-through and disregard of child support with a $50 pass-through and disregard. It found that the full pass-through and disregard increased paternity establishment and noncustodial parents' payment of child support in some cases. However, this effect was not observed over the longer term. Studies in 2002 and 2005 showed a small positive effect on paternity establishment and collections from child support disregard policies. The child support pass-through and disregard policy did not have a significant impact on the percentage of TANF cases with child support collections. The average amount of child support owed by noncustodial parents to custodial parents with incomes below the poverty level was $3,713 per year. Establishing paternity and child support orders can be encouraged by implementing a pass-through and disregard policy, increasing cooperation with Child Support Enforcement agencies. Child support pass-through and disregard policy can increase income for families receiving TANF payments and help them transition out of poverty by combining child support with earnings. It also prepares families for life without regular public assistance grants. Recognizing the importance of regular child support payments for families transitioning out of welfare, pass-through policies can help improve financial stability and parent-child relationships. This can lead to increased involvement of noncustodial parents in their children's lives and better outcomes for the child. States can also benefit from Maintenance of Effort credits for implementing these policies. A child support pass-through and disregard policy can lead to positive outcomes for families receiving TANF cash assistance. States can claim Maintenance of Effort credit for implementing these policies, which can help meet their TANF program requirements. However, there are some disadvantages, such as potential revenue loss and costs associated with system changes. Some argue that child support disregard policies can lead to inequities in TANF eligibility and benefits. Disagreement exists over the costs involved, including revenue loss for the federal government. Families with disregarded child support may receive higher total income compared to those with other types of unearned income. Some argue that child support disregard policies can lead to inequities in TANF eligibility and benefits. Concerns arise over the impact on total income, with debates on how child support should be treated differently from public benefits. The premise of promoting cooperation by custodial parents may not be as crucial today, given the penalties for noncooperation under the 1996 welfare reform law. Some analysts suggest that co-locating CSE offices with welfare offices and educating families on paternity and child support can improve cooperation. Implementing a Deficit Reduction Act pass-through and disregard policy could financially benefit all involved parties. Implementing a Deficit Reduction Act pass-through and disregard policy would financially benefit 3-person families, especially those with mothers in high TANF benefit states. States without this policy, particularly high FMAP states, would see an increase in monthly income for mothers with no earnings. The federal government would waive its share of child support collections under the DRA rules. Many analysts and family advocates suggest that states should pass child support dollars to TANF families instead of the federal government. States could increase the pass-through and disregard to $200 per month, using state funds as the federal share of child support collections. Federal law mandates an incentive payment to states for effective CSE programs, capped at $471 million in FY2007. The curr_chunk discusses measures related to paternity establishment, child support orders, and funding incentives for states. Advocacy groups suggest that adopting a generous pass-through and disregard policy could increase federal child support performance incentive payments. This could lead to improved paternity establishment and child support collection rates, resulting in increased funding for the state. When all DRA rules are fully implemented, CSE federal funding will decrease. The matching of incentive payments will end on September 30, 2007, potentially affecting TANF families. A child support pass-through and disregard policy could lead to more child support payments, benefiting the majority of the CSE caseload. The concept of welfare \"cost avoidance\" aims to reduce government spending by ensuring families have sufficient income to be ineligible for programs like TANF, food stamps, and Medicaid. Child support advocates emphasize the importance of considering the financial impact of welfare cost avoidance in discussions about the benefits of child support enforcement. The CSE program's focus has shifted towards family self-sufficiency, making child support a reliable source of income. Implementing a child support pass-through and disregard policy at the state level may further this goal. According to a 2005 report, implementing a more generous pass-through and disregard policy for child support collections could increase family income and self-sufficiency, reducing poverty. However, many states may struggle to adopt this policy due to limited resources. The impact of Child Support Pass-Through and Disregard Policy on families in selected states is analyzed in relation to TANF cash benefits, earnings, and child support payments. The analysis focuses on the effects of the Deficit Reduction Act provisions on families with different income statuses in California, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. In six states, the analysis examines a mother's earnings at different levels of minimum wage. Monthly earnings are calculated based on hourly wage rates. Some states use different factors for TANF eligibility calculations. The comparison looks at total monthly income under current state policies on earnings and child support treatment. The analysis focuses on California's policy on child support pass-through and disregard, assuming a $200 monthly limit with federal cost-sharing. Currently, California provides a $50 pass-through to TANF recipients receiving at least $50 in child support. The maximum TANF benefit for a 3-person family is $723, with a disregard of $225 plus 50% of remaining earnings. The analysis assumes California will adopt the new policy, but it's uncertain if they will do so in reality. California has initiatives to eliminate the $50 child support pass-through and disregard policy, which opponents argue diverts resources from basic CSE activities. A mother with two children and no earnings in California is eligible for the maximum TANF benefit of $723 per month until child support exceeds this amount. If the noncustodial parent pays at least $50 per month, the family receives a $50 child support pass-through, bringing total income to $773 per month. If child support exceeds $773, the family stops receiving TANF benefits. Assuming California adopts the new federally matched pass-through and disregard policy, a mother with two children and no earnings would receive a total monthly income of $923 ($723 from TANF and $200 from child support) if the noncustodial parent paid at least $200 per month in child support. With half-time earnings at the state minimum wage of $7.50 per hour, working 20 hours per week would result in $649.50 per month. $225 plus 50% of remaining earnings are disregarded in determining TANF benefits for a mother with two children in California. A mother with two children working half-time at the California state minimum wage level is eligible for a TANF cash benefit payment of $511 per month. If the noncustodial parent pays at least $50 per month in child support, the family also receives a $50 child support pass-through and disregard payment, bringing the total monthly income to $1,211. With the new federally matched pass-through and disregard policy, the total monthly income would increase to $1,361. A mother with two children working full-time at the California minimum wage earns $1,299 per month. If the noncustodial parent pays less than $236 per month in child support, the total monthly income is $1,535 ($186 from TANF, $50 from child support pass-through, and $1,299 from earnings). If the noncustodial parent pays $300 per month in child support, the total monthly income is $1,599 ($300 from child support and $1,299 from earnings). With the new federally matched pass-through and disregard policy, the total monthly income would be higher. In Illinois, a mother with two children and full-time earnings could receive a TANF cash benefit of $186 per month if the noncustodial parent paid less than $386 per month in child support. With the child support pass-through and disregard, the total monthly income could be $1,685 ($186 from TANF, $200 from child support, and $1,299 from earnings). If the noncustodial parent paid $400 per month in child support, the family's total monthly income would be $1,699 ($400 from child support and $1,299 from earnings). Illinois provides a $50 child support pass-through and disregard to TANF recipients who receive at least $50 per month in child support payments. The maximum monthly cash TANF benefit for a 3-person family in Illinois is $396. In Illinois, a mother with two children and no earnings can receive the maximum TANF benefit of $396 per month until child support payments exceed this amount. If the noncustodial parent pays at least $50 per month, the family receives a $50 child support pass-through, bringing the total income to $446 per month. If child support payments reach $446 or more, the family stops receiving TANF benefits and only receives the child support payments. This analysis focuses on child support payments up to $500 per month. If the noncustodial parent pays child support of $200 per month, a mother with two children in Illinois would receive a total monthly income of $596 ($396 from TANF and $200 from child support pass-through). If child support payments exceed $500, the family would only receive the child support payment. A person working half-time at the Illinois state minimum wage of $7.50 per hour earns $650 per month. Two-thirds of gross earnings are disregarded in determining TANF benefits. A mother in this situation with two children is eligible for a TANF cash benefit of $180 per month until the noncustodial parent pays $230 or more in child support. If the noncustodial parent pays at least $50 but less than $230, the family also receives a $50 child support pass-through payment. Total monthly income for the family would be $880. If Illinois adopts the new federally matched pass-through and disregard policy, a mother with two children and half-time earnings would receive a total monthly income of $1,030 ($180 from TANF, $200 from child support pass-through, and $650 from earnings). If the noncustodial parent pays more than $380 per month in child support, the family would not be eligible for TANF benefits. If the family received $400 in child support payments, their total monthly income would be $1,050 ($400 from child support and $650 from earnings). A mother with two children working full-time at the state minimum wage in Illinois would not be eligible for TANF benefits. With $400 in child support, the family's total monthly income would be $1,699 ($400 from child support and $1,299 from earnings). If Illinois adopts the new federally matched pass-through and disregard policy, a mother with full-time earnings and two children would not be eligible for TANF benefits. In Illinois, a family with a mother working full-time and receiving $400 in child support would have a total monthly income of $1,699 ($400 from child support and $1,299 from earnings). Maine currently offers a $50 child support pass-through and disregard, along with a \"gap\" payment for TANF recipients. The maximum monthly cash TANF benefit payment for a 3-person family in Maine is $535 per month. In Maine, TANF benefits for a 3-person family are determined by the state's standard of need, which is $670 per month, with a maximum payment of $535. Earnings or child support income can fill the $135 gap between the standard of need and the maximum payment. Up to $135 per month in earnings or child support income is disregarded in calculating TANF benefits. A mother with two children and no earnings in Maine is eligible for the maximum TANF benefit of $535 per month. In Maine, TANF benefits are determined by the state's standard of need, with a maximum payment of $535 per month. Child support payments can fill the gap between the standard of need and the maximum payment, with up to $135 disregarded. If the noncustodial parent pays at least $50 per month in child support, the family receives a $50 pass-through and disregard payment. If $200 is paid, the family can benefit from the disregard and gap payment provision, totaling $720 per month. If the custodial parent's income exceeds the state's TANF need standard, the family is no longer eligible for benefits. In Maine, TANF benefits are determined by the state's standard of need, with a maximum payment of $535 per month. Child support payments can fill the gap between the standard of need and the maximum payment, with up to $135 disregarded. If the noncustodial parent pays at least $50 per month in child support, the family receives a $50 pass-through and disregard payment. If $200 is paid, the family can benefit from the disregard and gap payment provision, totaling $720 per month. With two children, the family's total monthly income consists entirely of child support if the noncustodial parent pays $855 or more per month. Assuming Maine adopts the new policy, a mother with two children and no earnings would receive $735 monthly income ($535 from TANF and $200 from child support pass-through and disregard if at least $200 is paid). The family can maximize benefits if the noncustodial parent pays at least $335 per month. In Maine, a mother with two children who works half-time at the federal minimum wage can receive a TANF cash benefit payment of $410 per month until the noncustodial parent pays $460 per month or more in child support. Once this threshold is met, the family no longer receives TANF cash benefits. The \"fill-the-gap\" policy in Maine subtracts countable income to determine TANF eligibility. In Maine, the \"fill-the-gap\" policy subtracts countable income to determine TANF eligibility. A mother with two children and half-time earnings at the federal minimum wage can receive a TANF cash benefit payment of $410 per month until the noncustodial parent pays $610 per month in child support. In Maine, a mother with two children can receive a TANF cash benefit payment of $410 per month until the noncustodial parent pays $610 per month in child support. If the noncustodial parent pays between $200 and $610 per month in child support, the family's total monthly income would be $1,238, including $410 from TANF, $200 from child support, and $628 from earnings. If the mother works full-time at the federal minimum wage, she would earn $1,256 per month and not be eligible for a TANF cash benefit payment. In Maryland, a mother with two children and no earnings is eligible for the maximum TANF benefit until the child support paid by the noncustodial parent exceeds the monthly TANF maximum of $549. If the noncustodial parent pays $549 a month or more in child support, the family stops receiving TANF benefits and only receives the child support. In Maryland, a mother with two children and no earnings can receive both child support paid by the noncustodial parent and maximum TANF benefits up to a monthly total of $749 if the noncustodial parent pays at least $200 per month in child support. The analysis uses the new federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for a person working 20 hours per week, earning $628 per month. 40% of gross earnings is not counted in Maryland. In Maryland, a mother with two children working half-time at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour earns $628 per month. 40% of gross earnings is disregarded in determining TANF benefits. The mother is eligible for a TANF cash benefit payment of $201 per month until the noncustodial parent pays $191 per month in child support. Total monthly income for the family is $829 if child support payments are less than $191 per month, and $928 if child support exceeds $191 per month. In Maryland, a mother with two children working half-time at the federal minimum wage earns $628 per month. With $300 in child support, the family's total monthly income is $928. Under the new policy, the family could receive a TANF cash benefit payment of $201 per month until the noncustodial parent pays $391 per month in child support. If child support is between $200 and $391 per month, the family would also receive a $200 child support pass-through payment. If the noncustodial parent pays $400 or more per month, the family's total income would consist of the entire child support amount. In Oklahoma, a mother with two children and no earnings is eligible for the maximum cash TANF benefit of $292 per month until the child support paid by the noncustodial parent exceeds this amount. Oklahoma does not provide a child support pass-through and disregard. The maximum monthly TANF benefit for a 3-person family in Oklahoma is $292. In Oklahoma, a mother with two children and no earnings can receive a maximum TANF benefit of $292 per month until the child support paid by the noncustodial parent exceeds this amount. If the noncustodial parent pays $300 or more in child support, the family will only receive the child support amount. With a pass-through and disregard policy, the mother could receive both child support and maximum TANF benefits, totaling $492 per month. In Oklahoma, a family can receive $492 per month ($292 from TANF and $200 from child support pass-through and disregard) until the noncustodial parent pays $492 or more in child support. If a person works 20 hours per week at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, they can earn $628 per month with $240 plus 50% of remaining earnings disregarded in determining TANF benefits. In Oklahoma, a mother with two children working half-time at minimum wage can receive a TANF cash benefit payment of $98 per month until the noncustodial parent pays $98 or more in child support. Total monthly income for the family amounts to $726 if child support payments are less than $98, and $928 if child support is $300. If child support exceeds $98, the family's total monthly income includes the child support payment and earnings. Assuming Oklahoma adopts the new federally matched pass-through and disregard policy, a mother with two children and half-time earnings at the federal minimum wage could receive a TANF cash benefit payment of $98 per month until the noncustodial parent pays $298 or more in child support. If the noncustodial parent pays at least $200 but less than $298 per month, the family would also receive a $200 child support pass-through and disregard payment, resulting in a total monthly income of $926 ($98 from TANF, $200 from child support, and $628 from earnings). If the noncustodial parent pays $300 or more in child support, the family's monthly income would consist of the entire child support payment plus earnings. In Oklahoma, a mother with two children working full-time at the federal minimum wage is not eligible for TANF cash benefits but receives monthly earnings and child support. In West Virginia, there is no child support pass-through; instead, a $25 incentive payment is added to the $340 maximum monthly TANF benefit for a 3-person family. If a mother in West Virginia has no earnings, she is eligible for the maximum TANF benefit plus a $25 child support incentive payment if the noncustodial parent pays any child support. In West Virginia, a mother with two children and no earnings could receive up to $540 per month in total income, consisting of $340 from TANF and $200 from child support pass-through and disregard income if the noncustodial parent paid at least $200 in child support. Once the family reached the maximum child support disregard income of $200 per month, their total monthly income would remain at $540 until they were no longer eligible for a cash TANF payment. In West Virginia, a mother with two children who works half-time or full-time at the federal minimum wage is not eligible for a TANF cash benefit payment under current state rules or DRA policy. Instead, the family receives monthly earnings plus the child support payment. The impact of Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) policy on child support collections is discussed in six states: California, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. States must follow child support assignment and distribution rules to calculate the federal and state share of collections based on the state's federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). The policy assumes states would pass-through and disregard up to $200 per month of child support based on family income status. In six states, the impact of the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) policy on child support collections is examined. States would pass-through and disregard up to $200 per month of child support payments made by noncustodial parents, with the federal government sharing the cost. The analysis looks at different scenarios for a mother with two children and varying levels of earnings. Child support payments between $0 and $500 per month are considered, with distribution rules for TANF families outlined. Child support distribution rules for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) families changed under welfare reform laws. The rules determine who receives child support arrearage payments based on assignment rules and payment order. Federal and state laws dictate legal claims on noncustodial parent payments. The order of child support collections is determined by distribution rules, which are important as many obligations are not fully paid. TANF recipients must assign the right to collect current and past-due child support, including arrearage payments. The state can keep collected support and arrearages up to the total TANF benefits received. P.L. 104-193 repealed the $50 required pass-through for child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families, giving states the choice to decide how much to send to the family. States also determine if child support payments are treated as income. P.L. 109-171 stipulates that child support accrued during TANF enrollment belongs to the state and federal governments, while support owed before or after belongs to the family. This provision took effect in 2009 or 2008 at the state level. P.L. 109-171 requires the federal government to waive its share of child support collections passed through to TANF families by the state, up to $100 per month for a family with one child and up to $200 per month for a family with two or more children. This provision took effect on October 1, 2008. The Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) is crucial in determining the federal and state share of child support collected for TANF families. The Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) determined the federal matching rate for AFDC benefits, varying inversely with state per capita income. States with low incomes received higher federal funding shares. For example, a state with a 50% matching rate would receive $50 for every $100 collected in child support for AFDC families, while a state with a 70% matching rate would receive $70 for every $100 collected. The Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) determined the federal matching rate for AFDC benefits, varying inversely with state per capita income. States with low incomes received higher federal funding shares. The FMAP currently is used to determine the amount of federal matching for various programs including Medicaid, TANF Contingency Funds, Child Care Mandatory funding, Title IV-E Foster Care Maintenance payments, and Adoption Assistance payments. The Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) is calculated annually by the HHS Secretary using formulas from the Social Security Act. The FMAP determines the federal matching rate for AFDC benefits based on state per capita income. California has an FMAP of 50%, meaning the state reimburses the federal government $0.50 for every $1 collected in child support for TANF families. Tables focus on current child support payments for families receiving TANF cash benefits. Table B-1 shows child support payments received by custodial parents based on the noncustodial parent's payments. In California, a mother with no earnings and two children can receive TANF cash benefits until child support exceeds $723 per month. If the noncustodial parent pays $100, the family receives $50, with the state paying the federal government the remaining $50. If the noncustodial parent pays $200 per month in child support, the California family would receive a $200 child support pass-through and disregard payment. If the noncustodial parent paid $300 per month, the family would still receive a $200 payment. If the noncustodial parent pays child support, the California family receives a pass-through payment. The state pays a portion to the federal government and keeps the rest. Even with half-time earnings at the state minimum wage, the family remains eligible for TANF benefits. If the noncustodial parent pays child support in California, the family receives a pass-through payment. The state pays a portion to the federal government and keeps the rest. The distribution of child support among the family, federal government, and state remains the same regardless of the custodial parent's earnings if the family receives TANF benefits. If the noncustodial parent pays child support in California, the family receives a pass-through payment. The state pays a portion to the federal government and keeps the rest. A California mother with two children working full-time at the state minimum wage is eligible for a TANF cash benefit payment of $186 per month if the noncustodial parent pays less than $236 per month in child support. If the noncustodial parent pays child support in California, the family receives a pass-through payment. The state pays a portion to the federal government and keeps the rest. If the noncustodial parent pays $200 per month, the family receives a $50 child support pass-through and disregard payment. If the noncustodial parent pays $300 per month, the family no longer receives a TANF cash benefit payment. Assuming California adopts the new federally matched pass-through and disregard policy, a mother with two children and full-time earnings would receive TANF. If the noncustodial parent pays child support in California, the family receives a pass-through payment. The state pays a portion to the federal government and keeps the rest. If the noncustodial parent pays $200 per month, the family receives a $50 child support pass-through and disregard payment. If the noncustodial parent pays $300 per month, the family no longer receives a TANF cash benefit payment. The distribution of child support among the family, the federal government, and the state would not change based on the earnings of the custodial parent as long as the family received TANF cash benefits. Illinois has a FMAP of 50%, meaning the state reimburses the federal government $0.50 for every $1 collected in child support for TANF families. A table displays child support payments to families, state retention, and federal reimbursement based on noncustodial parent payments. The analysis uses Illinois' minimum wage of $7.50 per hour. A mother with two children and no earnings in Illinois is eligible for the maximum TANF benefit until child support exceeds a certain amount. If the noncustodial parent pays child support exceeding the maximum cash benefit of $396 per month in Illinois, the state reimburses the federal government a percentage of the amount paid. For example, if the noncustodial parent pays $100 per month, the family receives a $50 pass-through payment. If the payment is $400, the family receives $50 and the state keeps $150. With the new policy, a mother with two children and no earnings could receive a $200 pass-through payment if the noncustodial parent pays at least $200 per month. If the noncustodial parent pays child support exceeding $200 per month in Illinois, the family receives a $200 pass-through payment. If the payment is $300, the state pays $50 to the federal government and keeps $50. For $500, the state pays $150 to the federal government and keeps $150. A mother working half-time at the Illinois state minimum wage can receive a TANF cash benefit of $180 per month if child support payments are below $230. Earnings do not affect the distribution of child support, with the family receiving a pass-through payment. If child support exceeds $300, the family no longer receives the TANF benefit. If an Illinois family receives TANF cash benefits, they would still get the full $300 child support payment without reimbursement to the government. The distribution of child support would remain the same regardless of the custodial parent's earnings. For example, a mother with two children and half-time earnings could still receive a TANF cash benefit of $180 if child support payments are below $380. If the noncustodial parent pays $300 in child support, the family would receive a $200 pass-through payment, with the state paying $50 to the federal government and keeping $50. If the noncustodial parent paid $400 per month in child support, the Illinois family would no longer receive a TANF cash benefit payment. An Illinois mother with two children working full-time at the state minimum wage is not eligible for a TANF cash benefit payment. Assuming Illinois adopts the new federally matched pass-through and disregard policy, a mother with two children and full-time earnings would still not be eligible for a TANF cash benefit payment. In Maine, TANF families receive monthly earnings and the full child support payment without reimbursement to the government. The state reimburses the federal government $63.27 for every $100 collected in child support. Maine provides a $50 child support pass-through and disregard payment, along with a \"gap\" payment to TANF recipients. Families can use earnings or child support to fill the gap between the standard of need and the maximum TANF payment. The gap for a 3-person family is $135 per month. In Maine, TANF families receive monthly earnings and full child support payment without reimbursement to the government. The state reimburses the federal government $63.27 for every $100 collected in child support. A $50 child support pass-through and disregard payment is provided, along with a \"gap\" payment to TANF recipients. The gap for a 3-person family is $135 per month, with up to $135 per month in earnings or child support income disregarded in determining the family's TANF benefit. Table B-3 displays child support payments based on noncustodial parent earnings. In Maine, TANF families receive child support payments up to $535 per month. If the noncustodial parent pays $200, the family gets a $50 pass-through, $135 \"gap\" payment, and the state pays $41 to the federal government. If $400 is paid, the family gets the same pass-through and gap payment, with the state paying $168. For $500, the family receives the pass-through and gap payment, with the state paying $231. In Maine, TANF families receive child support payments up to $535 per month. If the noncustodial parent pays $200, the family gets a $50 pass-through, $135 \"gap\" payment, and the state pays $41 to the federal government. If $400 is paid, the family gets the same pass-through and gap payment, with the state paying $168. For $500, the family receives the pass-through and gap payment, with the state paying $231. Assuming Maine adopts the new federally matched pass-through and disregard policy, a mother with two children and no earnings would receive a $200 child support pass-through and disregard payment if the noncustodial parent paid at least $200 per month in child support. If the noncustodial parent paid $200 per month, the Maine family would receive $200, the federal government $0, and the state $0. If the noncustodial parent paid $300 per month, the family would receive $200 plus $100 of the $135 \"gap\" payment, with the state paying $127 to the federal government. If the noncustodial parent pays $500 per month in child support, the Maine family would receive a $200 child support pass-through and disregard payment plus a $135 \"gap\" payment. The state would pay $231 to the federal government and lose $66. A Maine mother working half-time at the federal minimum wage level could still receive a TANF cash benefit payment of $410 per month if the noncustodial parent pays no more than $460 per month in child support. If the noncustodial parent pays $100 per month, the family receives a $50 pass-through and disregard payment, with the state paying $63 to the federal government and losing $13. If the noncustodial parent pays $400 per month in child support, the Maine family receives a $50 child support pass-through and disregard payment. The state pays $253 to the federal government and keeps $97. If the noncustodial parent pays $460 or more, the family no longer receives TANF cash benefit payment. Instead, they receive the full child support payment with no reimbursement to the state or federal government. Assuming Maine adopts the new policy, a mother with two children and half-time earnings would continue to receive TANF cash benefit until the noncustodial parent pays $610 or more in child support. If a noncustodial parent pays $200 per month in child support, the Maine family receives a $200 child support pass-through and disregard payment. If the payment is $300, the family receives $200 pass-through, the state pays $63 to the federal government, and keeps $37. For a $500 payment, the family gets $200 pass-through, the state pays $190 to the federal government, and keeps $110. Maine mother with two children working full-time at federal minimum wage not eligible for TANF cash benefit payment. Family receives monthly earnings and full child support payment with no reimbursement to government. Maryland has 50% FMAP, no child support pass-through policy. In Maryland, a mother with two children and no earnings is eligible for the maximum TANF benefit until the child support paid by the noncustodial parent exceeds the maximum cash benefit of $549 per month. If the noncustodial parent pays $100 per month in child support, the Maryland family does not receive any child support income. In Maryland, if the noncustodial parent pays $500 per month in child support, the state keeps $250 and the family receives no child support income. With the new policy, a mother with two children would get a $200 child support pass-through if the noncustodial parent pays at least $200 per month. If the noncustodial parent pays $300 per month, the family receives a $200 pass-through payment. In Maryland, if the noncustodial parent pays child support, the state keeps a portion and the family receives a pass-through payment. For example, if the parent pays $300 per month, the family gets $200. If the parent pays $500, the family gets $200. A mother with two children working half-time at minimum wage can still receive a TANF cash benefit if child support is below a certain amount. If the noncustodial parent pays child support in Maryland, the state retains a portion and the family receives a pass-through payment. The distribution of child support among the family, the federal government, and the state remains the same regardless of earnings. If the parent pays $100, the family receives no child support income, with the state paying $50 to the federal government and keeping $50. If the parent pays $400, the family no longer receives TANF cash benefits and receives the full $400 child support payment. If Maryland adopts a new policy, the distribution of child support would not change. If the noncustodial parent pays child support in Maryland, the state retains a portion and the family receives a pass-through payment. The distribution of child support among the family, the federal government, and the state would not change based on the earnings of the custodial parent as long as the family received TANF cash benefits. If the noncustodial parent paid $300 per month, the Maryland family would receive a $200 child support pass-through. If the parent paid $500, the family would no longer receive TANF cash benefits and would receive the full $500 child support payment. A Maryland mother working full-time at the federal minimum wage is not eligible for a TANF cash benefit payment. In Maryland, a mother working full-time at the federal minimum wage is not eligible for a TANF cash benefit payment. If the noncustodial parent pays child support, the state retains a portion and the family receives a pass-through payment. Oklahoma does not have a child support pass-through and disregard payment. The table shows data on child support payments for custodial parents with different earnings levels in Oklahoma. A mother with no earnings is eligible for the maximum TANF benefit until child support exceeds $292 per month. If the noncustodial parent pays $100, the family does not receive child support income, but the state pays the federal government $68.14. If a noncustodial parent pays $200 or more in child support for an Oklahoma mother with two children and no earnings, the family receives the full amount without reimbursement to the state or federal government. With the new policy, the mother would receive a $200 child support pass-through and disregard payment if the noncustodial parent paid at least $200 per month. If the noncustodial parent pays $200 per month in child support, the Oklahoma family receives a $200 child support pass-through and disregard payment. If the payment is $400, the state pays $136.28 to the federal government and keeps $63.72. Payments of $492 or more result in no TANF benefit for the family. If child support payments exceed $98 per month, a family with two children and half-time earnings in Oklahoma would not be eligible for a TANF cash benefit payment. They would receive monthly earnings plus the entire child support payment with no reimbursement to the government. In Oklahoma, a family with two children and full-time earnings would not be eligible for a TANF cash benefit payment even with the new pass-through and disregard policy. West Virginia does not currently have a child support pass-through and disregard payment, reimbursing the federal government $72.82 for every $100 collected in child support. In West Virginia, custodial parents with zero earnings may receive TANF benefits until child support payments exceed $340 per month. If the noncustodial parent pays $100 in child support, the state retains $27.18 and pays $72.82 to the federal government. In West Virginia, if a noncustodial parent pays $300 in child support, the state keeps $27.18 and pays $72.82 to the federal government. If the parent pays $400, the family receives the full amount with no reimbursement. With the new policy, a mother with two children and no earnings could receive a $200 child support pass-through and disregard payment if the parent pays at least $200 per month. If a noncustodial parent in West Virginia pays $500 in child support, the family would receive a $200 pass-through payment. If the parent pays $540 or more, the family gets the full child support amount without TANF benefits. A mother with two children working half-time at federal minimum wage is not eligible for TANF cash benefits. A West Virginia mother with two children working full-time at the federal minimum wage is not eligible for TANF cash benefits. Instead, the family receives monthly earnings and the full child support payment without reimbursement to the state or federal government. A mother in West Virginia working full-time at the federal minimum wage is not eligible for TANF cash benefits. Instead, the family receives monthly earnings and the full child support payment without reimbursement to the state or federal government. The 1996 welfare reform law aimed to prioritize families once they leave the TANF rolls, focusing on arrearages owed to the family. The custodial parent applying for TANF must assign the state the right to collect current and past-due child support payments while on TANF. This includes permanently-assigned arrearages and pre-assistance arrearages, which are temporarily assigned to the state during TANF assistance. After leaving TANF, the family regains claim on pre-assistance arrearages. The DRA specifies that only child support accruing during TANF benefits is assigned to the state, exempting pre-TANF arrearages. The DRA allows states to distribute full child support amounts to former TANF families, simplifying the CSE distribution process by eliminating special treatment of arrearages collected through the Federal Income Tax Refund Offset program. States can pay child support collected through this procedure to families before repaying the state, with the federal government waiving its share of arrearages collected via this method. The full federal share of federal tax offset collections will be waived if the money is paid to former TANF families, with nearly all arrearage payments collected for them via the Federal Income Tax Refund Offset program. In 2005, $1.5 billion in child support payment was collected through this program, accounting for 56% of the child support retained by the state. States are required to pay a higher fraction of child support collections on arrearages to families that have left welfare due to the 1996 welfare reform law. The Deficit Reduction Act (P.L. 109-171) aims to implement a \"family first\" policy for former TANF families, ensuring that child support payments go directly to families before the state and federal government. This additional income is expected to reduce welfare dependence by promoting exit from TANF and preventing re-entry. Custodial parents support the provision that requires the federal government to share costs with states for paying child support arrearages to former TANF families. They argue that these payments rightfully belong to them. Former TANF families viewed child support arrearages as belonging to them, not the state. They had to rely on family and friends for financial assistance when the noncustodial parent failed to pay child support before they went on welfare. The complexity of distribution rules was due to gradual implementation and federal/state receipt of arrearage payments. Implementation of rules was completed on October 1, 2000. States may find it easier to distribute child support if they adopt the \"family first\" approach authorized by P.L. 109-171. Under P.L. 104-193, child support arrearages are now paid to families first when leaving TANF, with priority given to federal and state governments for collections from tax refunds. If a custodial parent assigns support rights to the state after October 1, 2000, all support rights accrued during TANF receipt must be assigned. The \"family first\" approach may simplify child support distribution for states. Since October 1, 2000, states must prioritize distributing child support collections to former TANF families, including current support, never-assigned arrearages, and temporarily assigned arrearages. However, federal income tax refund intercepts are exempt from this rule, with those collections retained by the state and federal government. The 1996 law mandates that state and federal governments retain child support collections. Any remaining funds after distribution can be used to pay arrearages owed to states. States can then distribute the remaining child support to the custodial parent, with a share going to the federal government. Any leftover funds are given to the family. A law from October 1, 2009, allows states to give full child support collections to families who have left TANF. P.L. 109-171 requires states to pay current child support payments to former TANF families, with any excess going towards non-assigned child support arrearages. The state can choose to keep their share of the money or pay it to the family, without having to reimburse the federal government. Any remaining child support collection must be paid to the family, including arrearages accrued during TANF participation. The state has the option to retain or pay child support arrearages collected from former TANF families. The federal government shares the costs of paying arrearages to the family first, effective October 1, 2009, or October 1, 2008, at state discretion."
