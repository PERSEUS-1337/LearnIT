    "content": "On July 13, 2000, the U.S. and Vietnam signed a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) after years of negotiations. President Bush submitted the agreement to Congress on June 8, 2001. The House approved it on September 6, 2001, and the Senate passed it on October 3, 2001. President Bush signed the agreement into law on October 16, 2001. Vietnam ratified the BTA on November 28, 2001, and it entered into force on December 10, 2001. The Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) between the U.S. and Vietnam was signed in 2000 and formally accepted in 2001. This agreement restored most-favored-nation treatment between the two countries and required Vietnam to implement market-oriented economic reforms. The extension of MFN treatment to Vietnam led to a significant reduction in U.S. tariffs on imports from Vietnam. After the Vietnam War, the U.S. had imposed various commercial restrictions on Vietnam, including a halt to bilateral humanitarian aid, opposition to financial aid from international institutions, a ban on U.S. travel to Vietnam, and an embargo on bilateral trade. In the early 1990s, Washington and Hanoi began to normalize relations following improvements on issues related to Vietnam's activities in Cambodia and American POWs and MIAs. President Clinton lifted the trade embargo against Vietnam in 1994 and established ambassadorial-level diplomatic relations the following year. Presidential waivers were granted to Vietnam from 1998 to 2002 to normalize commercial relations. In 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002, waivers were granted to Vietnam. Congress can reject the waiver by passing a joint disapproval resolution, but it has been defeated each time. The Jackson-Vanik waiver granted Vietnam MFN status after the BTA went into effect in December 2001, allowing support for U.S. businesses in Vietnam. MFN status was denied to communist-controlled areas of Vietnam in 1951, and suspended for all Sino-Soviet bloc countries. When communist North Vietnamese forces unified the country in 1975, MFN status was suspended. The U.S. issued strict conditions for restoring MFN status to non-market economies, including Vietnam. Under the Trade Act of 1974, MFN treatment can be restored to NME countries if they meet certain requirements related to freedom-of-emigration. Vietnam has not fully complied with these requirements, but waivers have been granted by Presidents Clinton and Bush since 1998. Jackson-Vanik waivers must be renewed annually, and Congress has not rejected them. The completion of a bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam requires approval by Congress and the Vietnamese National Assembly. Approval of the agreement allows the President to extend temporary MFN tariff treatment to Vietnam, contingent upon meeting certain requirements. Congressional procedures for considering a U.S.-Vietnam BTA involve approval by a joint resolution of Congress. The U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement requires approval by Congress through a joint resolution with expedited procedures and specific deadlines for committee consideration and floor debate. The agreement will be in effect for a 3-year period and can be extended. The U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement will remain in effect for a 3-year period and can be extended automatically. The next step is to restore permanent MFN status to Vietnam, which requires Congress to terminate relevant provisions. Vietnam's goal is to join the WTO, but it may take several years to meet the requirements. Vietnam aims to join the WTO by 2004 and must negotiate bilateral agreements with current WTO members. These agreements are consolidated into the acceding country's protocol of accession and apply to all WTO members due to the mandatory MFN requirement. Bilateral negotiations focus on tariff concessions and market access issues. Future negotiations between Vietnam and the U.S. will address changes needed in Vietnam's trade regime for U.S. support in WTO membership. Vietnam is seeking WTO membership and may receive permanent MFN treatment from the U.S. U.S.-Vietnam trade is low despite Vietnam's large population. Major U.S. exports to Vietnam include aircraft, fertilizer, telecommunications equipment, and machinery. Foreign direct investment by U.S. companies in Vietnam is also limited. U.S. negotiators demanded more concessions from Vietnam in services, investment, and market access to boost exports and investment. The BTA is expected to benefit U.S. exporters and investors in the medium to long-term as Vietnam undergoes market-oriented reforms and integration. In the medium to long-term, Vietnam's market-oriented reforms and integration into the global economy, along with commitments to reduce trade barriers by ASEAN members, are expected to increase exports and investment opportunities. The implementation of the BTA, progress towards a market-oriented economy, and economic growth rate will determine future U.S. trade and investment prospects in Vietnam. The Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) between the U.S. and Vietnam aims to improve the climate for foreign investors by providing legal protections, opening more sectors to U.S. multinationals, and making the business environment more predictable and transparent. It addresses complaints of lengthy delays and lack of awareness of regulatory requirements for investment licenses. Proponents believe the BTA will push Vietnam towards a more democratic society through market-oriented reforms, weakening political controls, and integrating Vietnamese enterprises into the global economy. Critics of the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) argue that Vietnam's government may not fully implement the agreement and could create new barriers to imports and foreign investment. They also fear that low-cost Vietnamese exports, especially textiles, will flood the U.S. market. Critics of the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) are concerned about the lack of provisions on minimum labor standards and environmental protection. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney vowed to fight the agreement in Congress, citing the absence of core labor standards and human rights. Textile manufacturers and other groups plan to lobby for changes to protect their industries from low-priced Vietnamese imports. Many observers, including labor groups, oppose the pact on human rights grounds, arguing that human rights considerations should take priority over trade ties. The Rights Act, H.R. 2833, would ban aid increases to Vietnam if human rights progress is not certified by the President. Vietnam's economy slowed after the 1997-99 Asian financial crisis, with growth declining from 9.5% in 1995 to 6% in 2000. Foreign direct investment has been a major stimulus for the country's economy. Vietnam's economy slowed after the 1997-99 Asian financial crisis, with growth declining from 9.5% in 1995 to 6% in 2000. Foreign direct investment dwindled from over $8 billion in 1996 to $600 million in 1999. The BTA talks with the U.S. were jump-started in 1999 to reverse declining growth rates. The bilateral trade agreement is expected to increase U.S. investment and MFN access for Vietnam, with exports estimated to rise to $1.3 billion. Vietnam's exports to the U.S. are expected to increase to $1.3 billion in the first year of MFN status, with tariff rates falling significantly. The product mix of Vietnam's exports to the U.S. is likely to change, focusing on labor-intensive manufacturing items with large tariff rate differences. Key export items expected to increase include garments, leather products, footwear, household plastic products, and processed foods. Vietnam's clothing exports are expected to increase dramatically, with garment exports to Japan and the European Union totaling over $500 million and $640 million respectively in 1999. The World Bank estimates Vietnamese apparel exports will increase nearly tenfold to $384 million in the first year after receiving MFN status. The BTA agreement does not address Vietnamese textile exports to the U.S., but the safeguard provision allows for quotas on textile imports in case of a surge. The U.S. plans to impose quotas on textile imports in case of a surge. Negotiations for a bilateral textile agreement with Vietnam are expected to start after a Congressional vote on the BTA. Some Members of Congress want the Bush Administration to commit to including labor rights provisions in the agreement. Passing the trade agreement would bring Vietnam closer to receiving U.S. trade benefits under the GSP. Vietnamese officials view the bilateral trade agreement as a key step towards joining the WTO. Vietnam sees the bilateral trade agreement as crucial for gaining U.S. support for WTO membership. The agreement covers market access, trade in services, intellectual property rights, and investment. Vietnam has committed to opening its markets by providing MFN treatment to U.S. goods, ensuring national treatment for imports, eliminating quotas over 3 to 7 years, enhancing government procurement transparency, and allowing all Vietnamese enterprises to trade all products. The U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement allows U.S. companies to import and export most products over a 3-6 year period. Vietnam commits to reducing tariffs on about 250 products, mainly agricultural goods, by 33% to 50% over three years. This agreement aims to ensure compliance with WTO rules and increase market access for both countries. Vietnam's tariffs are not extremely high for a developing country, with an average tariff line of 15%-20%. The agreement includes a safeguard provision for temporary tariff increases in case of import surges. Vietnam will phase in the WTO Agreement on TRIPs over 18 months and has additional commitments to protect satellite signals within 30 months. In services, Vietnam will uphold WTO rules and allow U.S. companies to invest in various sectors like accounting, banking, and education. Vietnam's commitments in various service sectors under the BTA include liberalization measures for banking, insurance, and telecommunications. U.S. banks can form joint ventures with Vietnamese partners with specific equity limits, gradually increasing to 100% subsidiaries after a certain period. In the insurance sector, U.S. companies can establish joint ventures with no equity limit in mandatory sectors, with the option for 100% subsidiaries after six years. In the insurance sector, joint ventures are permitted with no equity limit in mandatory sectors, with the option for 100% subsidiaries after six years. For telecommunications services, joint ventures are allowed with specific equity limits, gradually increasing to 100% subsidiaries after a certain period. The U.S.-Vietnam trade agreement includes guarantees for investment such as MFN treatment, national treatment, transparency, and protection against expropriation. Vietnam will phase out investment screening for most sectors within two, six, or nine years. Foreign multinationals will have the same rights for profit repatriation as Vietnamese enterprises under the agreement. Under the BTA, foreign multinationals in Vietnam will have equal rights for profit repatriation as local firms. The currency is not fully convertible yet. The U.S. stake requirement in joint ventures will be removed in three years. Personnel requirements will change to allow U.S. multinationals to select top executives without nationality restrictions. Vietnam will eliminate trade-related investment measures inconsistent with the WTO within five years. The country will adopt a transparent commercial regime allowing comments on draft laws and regulations. Under the BTA, Vietnam will adopt a transparent commercial regime by allowing comments on draft laws and regulations, ensuring advance public notice, and granting the right to appeal rulings. Implementation of the agreement may face challenges due to weak central control, rampant corruption, and pressure from state-owned enterprises and the Vietnamese People's Army. Cooperation at the local government level and among governmental ministries will be crucial for successful implementation. Under the BTA, Vietnam has implemented reforms to promote fair competition and transparency in business activities. These reforms include granting national treatment, allowing all enterprises to import and export, eliminating non-tariff barriers, streamlining licensing processes for foreign investors, and publicizing relevant laws and regulations. Hanoi has made progress in fulfilling these commitments, with the establishment of a Joint Committee on Economic and Trade Relations with the U.S. in 2002. The U.S. and Vietnam reached an \"agreement in principle\" on a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) in July 1999, with delays due to divisions within the Vietnamese Communist Party. The final BTA differed from the 1999 agreement in trade in services, particularly in telecommunications. The agreement would have allowed U.S. companies to have a majority stake in certain Vietnamese telecommunications sectors after a phase-in period. The U.S. and Vietnam agreed on a Bilateral Trade Agreement in 1999, with U.S. companies having equity caps in Vietnamese telecommunications sectors. Vietnam agreed to shorter phase-in periods in exchange for equity limits. Differences between the 1999 and 2000 agreements include U.S. companies being allowed to set up joint ventures in wireless telecommunications after two years with a 50% maximum stake. Under the 2000 Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), Vietnam agreed to allow U.S. companies to set up joint ventures in wireless and insurance sectors with equity caps. U.S. companies can invest in telecommunications after two years with a 50% stake, while in the insurance sector, joint ventures can be established after three years with a 50-50 ownership and wholly owned ventures after five years. The 2000 Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) between Vietnam and the U.S. allows for joint ventures in wireless and insurance sectors with equity caps. U.S. companies can invest in telecommunications after two years with a 50% stake, and in the insurance sector, joint ventures can be established after three years with a 50-50 ownership and wholly owned ventures after five years. The final BTA includes commitments by Vietnam to reduce tariffs on approximately 250 products, mostly agricultural goods. The agreement also goes beyond past agreements with more detailed commitments in the areas of services. The 2000 Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) between Vietnam and the U.S. includes detailed commitments in services and investment, with Vietnam offering new tariff concessions. Despite reaching an agreement in principle in July 1999, Vietnam delayed signing the deal for nearly a year due to consensus-based decision-making and the need to vet the agreement among decision-makers. The 2000 Bilateral Trade Agreement between Vietnam and the U.S. faced challenges in implementation due to the need for consensus among officials, including top leaders who were divided on the issue. Disagreements between reformers and conservatives in Vietnam's Politburo hindered economic decision-making, with conservatives fearing that economic reform would undermine socialism. The conservatives in Vietnam fear that economic reform will erode the country's socialist foundations, sovereignty, and increase vulnerability to economic downturns. They worry that a shift to a market-oriented economy will lead to unemployment and heighten social and political pressures on the Party. High level U.S. pressure on Vietnam for its human rights record during Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's 1999 trip may have further rankled conservative forces opposed to the trade agreement. In January 2000, reform-minded leaders were transferred to key posts, signaling a potential breakthrough in Hanoi's policy logjam. Opposition from vested interests, including military leaders, has been a significant hurdle in Vietnam's deliberations on the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA). The People's Army of Vietnam, a staunch opponent of the BTA, is concerned about potential threats to its commercial interests. They generated over $600 million in revenue in 1998, equivalent to 60% of the military budget. The military's influence was evident in Vietnam's bargaining position on telecommunications liberalization during the BTA negotiations. Hanoi demanded an eleven-year phase-in period for FDI liberalization in cable communications, where the military has heavy investments. This contrasts with a four-year phase-in for cellular communications, an area with fewer military investments. Another concern was that a trade deal with the U.S. could antagonize China. Hanoi's concerns about a trade deal with the United States potentially antagonizing China were influenced by the strengthening ties between Beijing and Hanoi. Conservative elements in Hanoi were cautious about aligning too closely with the U.S. to avoid upsetting Beijing, especially during negotiations over a land-border treaty. Chinese leaders reportedly warned Vietnam not to finalize the trade deal before Beijing's own WTO accession negotiations with the U.S. were completed. However, some analysts believe this was a stalling tactic by Vietnam, using China as an excuse for delaying uncertain foreign policy moves. The Chinese opposition did not stop Vietnam from joining ASEAN in 1995. The China factor positively motivated Vietnam to progress due to fears of economic competition with Beijing after China joined the WTO."
