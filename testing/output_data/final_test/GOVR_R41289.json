    "content": "Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) provides earnings replacement for eligible workers unable to work due to illness or injury, funded by FICA and SECA taxes. Veterans Disability Compensation (VDC) offers payments to veterans for service-related illnesses or injuries, funded through the VA budget without direct contributions from veterans or active military personnel. SSDI and VDC are federal disability programs administered by SSA and the VA. In December 2013, over 8.9 million disabled workers received SSDI payments totaling $10.3 billion per month, while VDC had 3.5 million recipients receiving $3.7 billion monthly in FY2012. SSDI requires inability to work for eligibility, unlike VDC where employability is not a factor. The report compares SSDI and VDC disability programs, highlighting differences in eligibility criteria. Veterans with a VA disability rating may not qualify for SSDI unless their condition hinders civilian work. Challenges include processing delays for claims and appeals, impacting both programs. The SSDI program was established in 1956 to provide benefits to insured workers who are unable to work due to a medically determinable illness or injury. Eligibility requires a sufficient work history and the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a long-term medical condition. After a disability onset, workers are evaluated for long-term disability or death. Retroactive benefits up to 12 months are possible. Monthly payments are based on past earnings and can include dependents. Medicare eligibility starts 24 months after SSDI eligibility. Benefits continue until death, retirement age, or medical improvement. In December 2013, over 8.9 million disabled workers were receiving benefits. In December 2013, over 8.9 million disabled workers were receiving an average of $1,146.43 per month in SSDI cash benefits. Disability determinations for SSDI benefits involve a five-step process, starting with the applicant filing for benefits with the SSA. The responsibility then shifts to medical and vocational experts at state-level Disability Determination Services agencies. If the claimant's income falls below the SGA threshold, condition is expected to last longer than 12 months, and meets the SSA medical listings, they are eligible for SSDI benefits. If a disability examiner decides that an individual meets the requirements for a particular step in the SSDI evaluation process, the application proceeds to the next step for further review. If an individual does not meet the requirements at any step, their application is denied. If an SSDI claimant reaches Step 3, a DDS official has already determined that the claimant's earnings do not exceed the SGA threshold and that the condition is both long-term and limits the claimant's ability to work. The disability determination process for SSDI benefits involves meeting the SSA's Medical Listings or proving inability to work. If denied, claimants can appeal the decision. The appeals process for SSDI benefits involves four possible levels: reconsideration by the state DDS office, a hearing by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), a review by the Social Security Appeals Council (SSAC), and filing suit against SSA in U.S. district court. Claimants must request an appeal within 60 days of a denial and can submit additional evidence at any step. U.S. district court is typically the final level of appeal in SSDI cases. The SSDI appeals process involves reconsideration by the state DDS office, where a disability examiner not involved in the initial application reviews the case. Claimants can request a reconsideration by submitting a Request for Reconsideration and an Appeal Disability Report to SSA. The DDS office then reviews the medical records and any additional evidence before making a new determination on the claimant's disability. The SSDI appeals process involves a reconsideration by the state DDS office, where a disability examiner reviews the case. If the claimant disagrees with the reconsideration decision, they can request a formal hearing with an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) by submitting a Request for Hearing and an Appeal Disability Report to SSA. The ALJ's decision can be further appealed to the Social Security Appeals Council (SSAC). The ALJ ruled in the claimant's favor. A Request for Review of Decision/Order of ALJ can be submitted to SSA, who forwards it to the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review. The SSAC will review medical records and may remand the case, deny the request, or make a new determination. If the claimant disagrees, they can file a civil suit in U.S. district court for further review. Disability compensation was part of a pension system before World War I. The current disability ratings system, established in the 1940s, determines compensation based on the percentage of disabling injuries or illnesses related to military service. Veterans must prove their status and show a connection between their medical conditions and service. Time restrictions apply for various VA benefits. The VA disability assessment focuses on determining if a condition was caused by military service. Veterans are given the benefit of the doubt in VDC evaluations. Disabilities are rated on a scale from 0% to 100% based on the VASRD. The VA disability rating ranges from 0% to 100%, with 100% indicating total disability. Claimants need at least a 10% rating to be eligible for compensation. Special Monthly Compensation is available for severely disabled veterans. Ratings can change over time due to new conditions or worsening of existing ones. Veterans can receive a total disability rating through two methods. To receive a total disability rating, a veteran can qualify based on the severity of a service-connected condition or through Individual Unemployability (IU) benefits. For IU, a veteran must be unable to work and have one disability rated at least 60%, or two disabilities with one rated at least 40% and a combined rating of at least 70%. The VA also offers presumptive conditions for certain diseases related to military service. Presumptive disability benefits are available for veterans with certain diseases or conditions related to conflicts or military service. Eligibility varies based on active-duty service and diagnosis type. Groups eligible include former POWs, Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange, Atomic veterans exposed to ionizing radiation, Gulf War veterans with undiagnosed illnesses, veterans diagnosed with chronic diseases within a year of release from active duty, and veterans with 90 days or more of continuous service diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease post-discharge. Disability compensation provides monthly cash benefits to disabled veterans at least 10% disabled due to military service, with payment amounts based on disability level determined by the VA. Marital status, dependents, and certain disabilities also impact benefits. At the end of FY2012, over 3.5 million veterans were receiving VDC benefits. There are four levels of appeals for claimants, starting with regional VA offices and potentially ending at the Supreme Court. The appeals process usually involves disputes over service-connected conditions or rating determinations. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court were appealed to regarding differences in goals between SSA and VA disability compensation programs. SSDI serves a larger population than VDC, with recipients receiving less cash. Most VDC recipients are men, while SSDI recipients have mental disorders and musculoskeletal impairments. The most prevalent conditions for SSDI recipients are mental disorders and musculoskeletal impairments, while VDC recipients commonly have auditory-related issues. Both programs cater to individuals over the age of 55, with separate funding sources and different definitions of disability. SSDI benefits are based on earnings history, while VDC benefits depend on the severity of service-connected conditions. Recipients of SSDI must wait 24 months to be eligible for Medicare, while veterans receive VA health care based on various factors including service-connected conditions. Veterans do not pay premiums for VA health care and can receive treatment for service-connected conditions without copayments. Veterans with a service-connected rating of 50% or more in the VA health care system do not pay copayments for nonservice-connected care. SSDI and VDC have similar restrictions on earnings for eligibility. SSDI recipients can earn $1,070 per month ($1,800 for blind recipients) and still qualify for benefits. Impairment-related expenses can be deducted under SSDI's SGA regulations. Under the VDC program, gainful employment determinations are only made for recipients of IU compensation, with no earnings restrictions for other VDC recipients. Gainful employment is indexed against the census poverty threshold for a single person, adjusted annually. Differences exist in standards for SSDI and VDC disability determinations, with military servicemembers undergoing evaluations through DOD and VA before Social Security benefits consideration. Service-connected conditions result in VA compensation based on assigned rating percentage. The VA compensates servicemembers based on their disability rating, but adaptive technologies like TRS can help veterans with hearing loss work effectively. SSDI benefits may be denied to a 100% disabled veteran due to differences in evaluation systems. SSDI payments are based on past earnings and do not cover temporary disabilities, while VDC considers age, education, and work experience to determine eligibility for gainful employment. The VDC compensates veterans based on the severity of their service-connected condition(s) without considering employability, while SSDI benefits may be taxable. VDC benefits do not offset SSDI payments, and VASRD ratings determine compensation levels for veterans with disabilities. The VASRD ratings for veterans with service-connected disabilities reflect the impact on earnings capacity. VDC compensates veterans for conditions that do not affect employment, providing payments for noneconomic loss. Recommendations have been made to compensate veterans for their inability to participate in usual life activities and the impact of disabilities on quality of life. The methodology for recommending compensation for veterans' noneconomic loss has not been widely studied. Both the SSA and VA have faced challenges in administering disability benefits, including criticism for not updating disability evaluation standards to reflect changes in the labor market and medical technology. The GAO has designated federal disability programs as \"high-risk\" due to issues with adjudicating applications and high levels of pending claims and appeals. SSA aims to modernize disability processes. The SSA is working to modernize disability evaluation systems and revise ratings. They have conducted outreach to wounded warriors for SSDI benefits and expanded streamlined medical records services. In 2007, SSA developed a plan to reduce backlogs in hearings due to economic decline and baby-boomer claims. The SSA implemented new fast-track programs to reduce backlogs in disability claims. The Quick Disability Determination (QDD) process uses predictive models, while the Compassionate Allowances (CAL) process expedites severe cases. Despite a decrease in initial claims, pending redetermination claims increased. Additionally, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act provides vouchers for vocational rehabilitation to disability beneficiaries. SSA offers vocational rehabilitation and employment support services through the Employment Network. SSDI recipients can work and still receive benefits through a work incentive policy. A \"trial work\" period allows recipients to test their ability to work without losing benefits. The disability is only considered ended after working for at least nine months over a 60-month period. The Accelerated Benefits Demonstration project tested health and employment outcomes for SSDI recipients who received benefits sooner. Participants made extensive use of program services. The results showed that participants utilized program services, had fewer unmet medical needs, and were encouraged to seek work, although employment levels did not increase compared to a control group. Continued tracking of participants' employment gains is crucial to understand the long-term impacts of providing early health benefits to SSDI beneficiaries. The VA has a high number of veterans' claims pending for disability compensation, with concerns raised by veterans, VSOs, and Members of Congress. Additional resources have been allocated to reduce the backlog of claims and appeals. The VA has reduced the average processing time for rating-related claims to 175.3 days as of January 2014 through increased personnel and technology use. The GAO has cited inconsistencies in the ratings systems across VA regional offices. The VA asserts that disability ratings consider noneconomic factors like pain and suffering, and a new advisory committee will review the ratings system."
