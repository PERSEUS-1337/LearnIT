    "content": "The \"Anti-Gunrunning Act of 2001\" restricts handgun transfers to one per month to prevent gun trafficking. The Congress acknowledges that crime involving drugs and guns is a widespread issue, exacerbated by the interstate movement of firearms. Handguns are often unlawfully transported across state lines by traffickers, contributing to the problem. The illegal movement of handguns across state lines significantly impacts the national firearms market, enabling gun traffickers to acquire firearms from states with fewer restrictions and transport them to jurisdictions with stricter regulations. This unlawful sale of firearms allows for anonymous transactions without background checks or record-keeping, facilitating gun trafficking. Handguns sold by traffickers are often untraceable and used by criminals in various crimes. The availability of handguns through traffickers contributes to widespread handgun violence. Firearms obtained from traffickers are linked to drug offenses, violence, property crimes, and illegal possession by prohibited individuals. Interstate gun trafficking hinders efforts by states and localities to combat illegal handgun purchases. The Congress has the power to enact measures to prevent criminals from obtaining firearms through gun traffickers. It is unlawful for licensed dealers to sell more than 2 handguns to a single person within a 30-day period. It is illegal for individuals, other than licensed dealers, to receive more than one handgun within a 30-day period. Exceptions may apply for loaning or renting a single handgun for target shooting purposes. Exceptions to the 30-day handgun limit include transfers to licensed private security companies, handgun repairs or customizing, and loaning or renting a single handgun from a licensed individual. Exceptions to the 30-day handgun limit include possessing no more than one loaned or rented handgun at a time, redemption of pawned handguns, receipt of curio or relic handguns by a licensed collector, receiving a single handgun to replace a lost or stolen one with a police report, transfer of handguns by bequest, transfer to family members, and transfer of personal firearms. The text chunk discusses amendments to penalties related to the transfer of personal firearms, including handguns, through licensed importers, manufacturers, or dealers. Penalties for licensees making false statements in required records have also been increased from one year to five years. Amendments to penalties for licensed dealers, importers, manufacturers, or collectors violating firearm transfer laws include fines and imprisonment up to 1 year. Conforming changes to the Brady Law involve expanding the scope of violations to include section (z). The section outlines requirements for licensees to notify the national instant criminal background check system of any background checks conducted within the previous 30 days that did not result in a handgun transfer. Information retained under Public Law 103-159 can be used for section 922(z) enforcement. Effective date to be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. Deadlines for destruction of records related to certain firearms transfers are specified. Section 922(s)(6)(B)(i) is amended to extend the time frame from \"20 business days\" to \"35 calendar days\". Section 922(t)(2)(C) is also amended to require firearms transfers subject to instant check to be completed within 35 calendar days after the system provides the licensee with the number."
