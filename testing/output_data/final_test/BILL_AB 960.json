    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7613 of the Family Code in California is amended regarding assisted reproduction. If a woman conceives using donated semen or ova with the consent of another intended parent, that parent is legally recognized as the child's natural parent. The donor of semen is not considered the natural parent unless agreed upon in writing before conception. If semen is not provided to a licensed physician or sperm bank, the donor is not considered the natural parent of a child conceived through assisted reproduction, unless there is a written agreement before conception stating otherwise. This does not apply if there is a written agreement between the man and woman stating their intention for the man to be a parent. An intended parent may use specific forms to demonstrate their intent to be a legal parent of a child conceived through assisted reproduction. These forms clarify the intentions of intended parents at the time of conception and do not affect parentage presumptions under California law. The California Statutory Forms for Assisted Reproduction are specific forms that intended parents can use to establish their legal parentage of a child conceived through assisted reproduction. These forms are optional and clarify the intentions of intended parents at the time of conception. They do not apply to gestational carriers or surrogacy agreements. Signing this form does not terminate a sperm donor's parentage claim unless the sperm is provided to a licensed physician or sperm bank before insemination.
