    "content": "On May 13, 2005, the Department of Defense (DOD) recommended closing or realigning several U.S. military bases to consolidate forces and save funds as part of the 2005 round of the base realignment and closure (BRAC) process authorized by Congress in 2001. The recommendations aimed to eliminate around 18,000 civilian support positions and restructure support functions, potentially affecting civilian employees. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld sent the recommendations to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission for review. The BRAC Commission later transmitted its recommendations in a report on September 8, 2005. The BRAC Commission accepted most of DOD's recommendations for base closure and realignment, with some modifications and additional recommendations. Appendix O of the report detailed the employment impact by states, showing a net decrease of 15,874 federal civilian jobs. Maryland saw the largest increase in civilian jobs (7,773), while Virginia had the largest decrease (-10,838). On September 15, 2005, the President approved the BRAC Commission's recommendations, which were then transmitted to Congress. Despite Congress rejecting a resolution of disapproval on October 27, 2005, the recommendations took effect on November 9, 2005. DOD instructed military departments to create \"Business Plans\" for each recommendation, with plans for implementation developed in early 2006. Over 240 specific implementation plans were to be developed thereafter. The BRAC Commission's recommendations were approved by the President in 2005 and transmitted to Congress. Despite Congress rejecting a resolution of disapproval, the recommendations took effect. DOD was instructed to create \"Business Plans\" for each recommendation, with over 240 specific implementation plans to be developed thereafter. Congress provided nearly $2.5 billion for BRAC in FY2007, $3.1 billion less than requested by the President. Unless vetoed, BRAC would be fully funded. DOD worked diligently to assist military and civilian personnel during past BRAC rounds. The Department of Defense (DOD) has implemented programs to minimize involuntary separations of Defense civilians at closing or realigning installations. Despite a 40% reduction in the civilian workforce since 1988, less than 10% of affected employees were involuntarily separated. Managing human resources at installations subject to BRAC decisions is a challenge, as closures can cause stress among employees affecting productivity. The Department of Defense has programs to minimize job separations for Defense civilians during closures or realignments. DOD established a \"BRAC Transition\" website and brochure to assist civil service employees with transitions, offering job placement programs and separation incentives. When BRAC closures occur, there will be implications and options for affected DOD civil service employees. The Department of Defense has programs to assist civil service employees during closures or realignments, offering job placement programs and separation incentives. Implications and options for affected employees will emerge over time, with potential effects including a reduction in force (RIF) under delegated authority from the Secretary of Defense. When fewer than 50 employees are involuntarily separated through RIF or due to BRAC, authorization is required. RIFs within DOD must wait 45 days after Congress receives information. Employees must receive a 60-day notice before a RIF takes effect. Notifications must be sent to various entities when 50 or more employees are separated. RIF or termination notices cannot be issued between December 15 and January 3, except in specific cases. DOD's final regulations for RIF under NSPS differ from government-wide rules. Performance precedes length of service in NSPS installations. Higher-standing employees can displace lower-standing ones. DOD is ensuring consistent application of RIF rules across components. An employee may appeal a RIF action to the Merit Systems Protection Board within 30 days. If covered by a negotiated grievance procedure, the employee must use it for appeals. The collective bargaining agreement sets time limits for filing grievances. Various authorities aim to reduce involuntary separations, such as VERA and VSIP. Employees may or may not be offered the opportunity to move with their organization if it is realigned to a different location. The employee's right of assignment depends on whether the organization is being moved due to a \"transfer of function.\" If it is a transfer of function, non-temporary employees have the right to move with their work to avoid separation or demotion. If it is not a transfer of function, employees may be given the opportunity to volunteer to relocate. If they do not volunteer or are not selected, they may be subject to a resulting RIF action and eligible for transition assistance. Employees who are at least 50 years old with 20 years of service may qualify for early retirement under CSRS or FERS. Annuities for CSRS employees are reduced by 2% for each year under age 55. VERA may be offered to employees meeting specific criteria during a reduction or restructuring, but not to those involuntarily separated for misconduct or poor performance. Employees who accept a Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment (VSIP) agree to leave the workforce voluntarily through retirement, early retirement, or resignation. Eligibility criteria include being a U.S. citizen, having a permanent appointment, and at least 12 months of continuous employment with DOD. VSIPs are taxable and capped at $25,000 or the amount of severance pay. Repayment is required if returning to DOD within 12 months or any federal agency within five years. VSIP Phase II offers cash incentives for employees to resign or retire, creating vacancies for Priority registrants. The Priority Placement Program and other assistance programs help displaced civilian employees find new federal agency positions. NAF employees have a separate Reemployment Priority List. DOD employees affected by base closures or outsourcing must be given opportunities for placement. Employees affected by base closures or outsourcing must be given the right of first refusal for vacant positions by contractors. Retraining and assistance programs are available for displaced federal employees under the Workforce Investment Act. DOD commanders can use funds to provide career transition training and outplacement subsidies for affected employees. Employees affected by base closures or outsourcing must be given the right of first refusal for vacant positions by contractors. Retraining and assistance programs are available for displaced federal employees under the Workforce Investment Act. DOD commanders can use funds to provide career transition training and outplacement subsidies for affected employees. Outplacement subsidies could also be offered to other federal agencies to hire displaced DOD employees through reimbursement for moving expenses. Involuntarily separated employees may be entitled to severance pay, extended employment for retirement or health benefits, or temporary continuation of health insurance coverage. Implementation of DOD's NSPS could have implications for how employees are affected by the BRAC process, but benefits such as health and life insurance, retirement, thrift savings plan, annual and sick leave, severance pay, and moving expenses remain untouched. Transition assistance tools such as outplacement services, priority placement, and separation incentives will still be available to employees under NSPS. Eligibility for these programs and services is not affected. NSPS implementation may impact collective bargaining agreements and RIFs, but eligibility for programs and services remains unaffected. It is uncertain if NSPS will apply to employees affected by BRAC. DOD employees are represented by 43 unions, and decisions on including BRAC sites in NSPS will be based on factors like closure timeframe and workforce impact. The Secretary of Defense has broad authority to make changes for agency efficiency, including transferring functions. Collective bargaining agreements between DOD and unions may impact how employees are affected by the BRAC process, such as allowing unions to request bargaining within 10 days of a change in working conditions. The NSPS regulations may nullify provisions in collective bargaining agreements related to the BRAC process. Management is not obligated to bargain over changes unless they are foreseeable, substantial, and significant. In 2006, a federal court halted the regulations for not protecting collective bargaining rights. The NSPS regulations failed to ensure collective bargaining rights, independent third-party review, and fair appeal processes. The case is under appeal, pending a decision from the court of appeals. The role of unions in the BRAC process hinges on the validity of NSPS regulations and existing agreements."
