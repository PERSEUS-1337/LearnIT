    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Strategy for Success in Iraq Act.\" The Senate findings highlight the importance of a sustainable political solution in Iraq, acknowledging the support for the insurgency from disaffected Iraqi Sunnis. It emphasizes the need for stability through the embrace of all Iraqi factions, including Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds. Senior military commanders and Administration officials agree that a political solution is essential for defeating the insurgency. General George Casey, commander of Multinational Forces-Iraq, stated to the Senate Armed Services Committee that increased coalition presence hinders Iraqi security forces' self-reliance and prolongs their dependency. He emphasized the importance of reducing coalition visibility to transition to Iraqi security self-reliance. The US Armed Forces' training program for Iraqi security forces supports their assumption of security responsibilities. The United States Armed Forces have increased their presence in Iraq to over 160,000 troops to provide security for the recent constitutional referendum and upcoming December elections. The success of these elections will mark a significant milestone in transferring political responsibilities to the Iraqi people, with a phased redeployment of US forces planned based on achieving key benchmarks for security and political transfer. To complete the mission in Iraq and bring troops home, the President must implement a new strategy for success that pursues a sustainable political solution and the redeployment of US forces tied to specific benchmarks. To implement the strategy for success in Iraq, the President must take aggressive diplomatic, political, military, and economic measures, including reducing the sense of US occupation by committing to no permanent military bases, drawing down troops after the 2005 elections, and reducing the visibility of US forces. To give Sunnis a real stake in the future of Iraq, it is important to address their concerns about regional autonomy and oil revenues. Hosting a conference with key stakeholders after the December elections to develop a collective strategy for a sustainable political compromise and mutual security guarantees among the people of Iraq is crucial. Additionally, urging Sunni neighbors to play a role in the process is essential. To address Sunni concerns in Iraq, it is proposed to set up a reconstruction fund for Sunni areas, appoint a presidential envoy for diplomatic efforts, establish a new regional security structure with US involvement, accelerate reconstruction efforts by providing civilian personnel, and expand job creation programs. The plan involves strengthening Iraqi government ministries and creating military conditions for the redeployment of US forces by intensifying training of Iraqi security forces, transferring responsibilities to Iraqi forces, and securing international support for a multinational force to protect Iraq's borders. The President must submit reports to Congress every six months detailing the implementation of the strategy outlined in section 3, including actions specified in section 4. The term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
