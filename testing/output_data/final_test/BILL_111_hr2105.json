    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Personal Health Investment Today Act of 2009\" or the \"PHIT Act of 2009\". The purpose of the Act is outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that almost 20 percent of American children aged 2 to 19 are overweight or obese, leading to increased healthcare costs. Research shows that investing in physical activity can significantly reduce medical expenses, and offering financial incentives can motivate more Americans to be physically active. The purpose of this Act is to promote health and prevent disease, particularly related to obesity, by encouraging healthier lifestyles, providing financial incentives for healthy behavior, and increasing access to physical fitness activities. Certain amounts paid for physical activity, fitness, and exercise are treated as amounts paid for medical care under SEC. 3. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes adding qualified sports and fitness expenses as eligible for tax deductions. Qualified sports and fitness expenses cover membership at a fitness center and participation in physical exercise programs. The amendment allows for tax deductions on qualified sports and fitness expenses, including equipment for physical exercise programs. The overall limit is $1,000 per taxpayer ($2,000 for joint returns or heads of household). A fitness facility is defined as a place offering physical exercise programs. The amendment allows tax deductions for qualified sports and fitness expenses, excluding private clubs and facilities offering golf, hunting, sailing, or riding. The fitness facility must comply with state and federal anti-discrimination laws. Amounts paid for equipment described in subparagraph (A)(iii) as a qualified sports and fitness expense must be exclusively used for fitness, exercise, sport, or physical activity programs. The equipment cannot be apparel or footwear, and for sports equipment (excluding exercise equipment), the amount paid must not exceed $250. The amendment applies rules for physical exercise and activity programs, including travel and accommodations as other components. Health Savings Accounts are exempt from certain code sections. The amendment is effective for taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
