    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Guard State Partnership Program Enhancement Act\" and codifies the National Guard State Partnership Program. The National Guard State Partnership Program, established by the National Guard State Partnership Program Enhancement Act, aims to support the objectives of combatant commanders, chief of mission of partner nations, build international partnerships, and strengthen cooperation between US government agencies. The National Guard State Partnership Program, established by the National Guard State Partnership Program Enhancement Act, aims to support building defense and security capacity, facilitate intergovernmental collaboration, and enhance information exchange between the United States Government and foreign governments. Appropriated funds from the Department of Defense are available for the National Guard to conduct program activities both domestically and internationally. The National Guard State Partnership Program allows for costs incurred by the National Guard outside the US, including pay, allowances, travel expenses for US personnel, and foreign participants. Funds cannot be used for activities in a foreign country without approval from the combatant command and chief of mission, with the Secretary of State's concurrence. Funds under subsection (b) cannot be used for National Guard participation in foreign activities unless on active duty. Funds also cannot be used for interagency activities involving US or foreign civilian personnel unless it contributes to responsible defense resource management, civilian control of the military, cooperation between military and civilian agencies, or improves international partnerships. The section discusses reimbursement for costs associated with the participation of US Government personnel in defense and security activities. Amounts received for reimbursement are deposited back into the appropriate account for the same purposes. Definitions are provided for clarity. The curr_chunk defines the State Partnership Program as a defense and security relationship between the National Guard of a State or territory and foreign military and security forces. It also defines activities as military-to-military or interagency activities for specific purposes. Interagency activities involve contacts between National Guard members and foreign civilian personnel outside the foreign country's ministry of defense. The curr_chunk explains that the term 'matter within the core competencies of the National Guard' includes disaster response, defense support to civil authorities, consequence management, and response to CBRNE events. The curr_chunk provides a list of activities falling under the term 'United States civilian personnel,' including border security, search and rescue, medicine, counter-drug activities, public affairs, and support for reserve forces. The curr_chunk amends the definition of 'foreign civilian personnel' to include civilian personnel of a foreign government and non-governmental individuals of a foreign country. The State Partnership Program is established, and the superseded authority under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 is repealed."
