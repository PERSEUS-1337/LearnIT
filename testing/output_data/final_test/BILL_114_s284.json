The subsection details the consequences for foreign individuals, such as property blocking under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, with exceptions for importation of goods in the United States. In determining sanctions, the President considers information from congressional committees and other countries or organizations monitoring human rights violations. The President must respond to requests from congressional committees regarding foreign persons engaging in human rights violations within 120 days. The response includes a determination if sanctions will be imposed and a report to the committee. Sanctions imposed by the President must be described, with exceptions for individuals furthering law enforcement objectives or complying with international agreements. Violations of sanctions may result in enforcement actions. Sanctions imposed by the President under subsection (b)(2) or related regulations are subject to penalties under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The President can lift sanctions if credible information shows the person did not engage in sanctioned activity, was prosecuted for it, or demonstrated significant change. The President can lift sanctions if the person shows a significant change in behavior, pays appropriate consequences, and commits to not engaging in sanctioned activities in the future. Sanctions can also be terminated if it is in the vital national security interests of the United States.
