    "content": "Appraisers provide property value estimates for real estate transactions, serving as collateral for loans. Buyers and sellers may request appraisals to ensure fair pricing. Regulation of property appraisals has evolved following real estate crises, with legislation like Title XI in place. Legislation like FIRREA and Dodd-Frank Act regulate property appraisals after real estate crises. FIRREA established the Appraisal Subcommittee to oversee state licensing of appraisers. Dodd-Frank Act and HERA also introduced requirements for appraiser independence. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred regulation of residential mortgages to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, established specific criteria for property appraisals, mandated independence for appraisers, and required property visits for high-risk residential mortgages. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred regulation of residential mortgages to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, established criteria for property appraisals, mandated independence for appraisers, and prohibited improper influence on real estate appraisals in federally related transactions. Federal regulation of appraisals applies to most of the mortgage market, including loans from federally chartered or insured banks, FHA or HUD programs, and loans intended for sale to GSEs. Appraisers are licensed at the state level, with certified appraisers required for complex real estate transactions. Residential appraisals are generally less complex than commercial real estate. The Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) oversees state licensing and certification of appraisers and appraisal management companies. It is part of the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council (FFIEC) and its board members are appointed by heads of related agencies. The ASC has regulatory responsibilities and must report annually. The Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) oversees state licensing and certification of appraisers and appraisal management companies, reporting annually to Congress. It monitors state boards' requirements, maintains national registries, and reviews state appraiser boards for compliance in various federal regulations. The ASC rates each state based on compliance with enforcement and application areas. \"Not in substantial compliance\" is a common rating, decreasing from 26 states in 2007 to 11 in 2011. In 2009, the number of states not in substantial compliance decreased from 18 to 11 by 2011. Illinois was found not in compliance in 2011, leading to a shift to a one-year review cycle. Florida is also on a one-year review cycle. The ASC maintains a registry of licensed and certified appraisers, with public information on their status and nonpublic data accessible only to certain officials. The ASC's funding primarily comes from registration fees, as it does not receive an annual appropriation. The Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) primarily relies on registration, certification, and licensing fees from appraisers for funding. In FY2011, the ASC received $2.6 million in fees, with most of the operating expenses allocated to personnel. Depreciation and contracted expenses saw significant increases from FY2010 to FY2011. Grants for appraisal-related activities, mandated by FIRREA, accounted for $1.4 million of the ASC's expenditures in FY2011. The ASC's expenditures in FY2011 totaled $1.4 million, with grants mainly going to the Appraisal Foundation to support appraisal standards and qualifications. The Foundation, an independent non-profit organization, establishes appraisal standards and receives funding from the ASC for its core activities. The Appraisal Standards Board (ASB) issues and amends professional appraisal standards known as the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), which appraisers must follow for federally related transactions. The USPAP are industry standards similar to accounting standards and are not federal statutes. The Foundation also oversees the Appraiser Qualification Board (AQB) and the Appraisal Practices Board (APB), which focus on professional requirements and technical issues in valuation methods. The Dodd-Frank Act made changes to property appraisal regulations, setting new federal guidelines. The Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) implemented new federal standards for property appraisals, focusing on independence of appraisers for higher risk loans. It eliminated the Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC) and included provisions such as property visit requirements, second appraisals at no cost, appraiser independence, portability of residential property appraisals, rules for fees, education standards, and annual reporting to Congress by the ASC. Title XIV of the DFA, also known as the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, aimed to combat predatory lending. The Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) implemented new federal standards for property appraisals, focusing on independence of appraisers for higher risk loans. The Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act in the DFA requires a written appraisal for high-risk residential mortgage loans, with a physical visit to the property being appraised. If the property has been sold within the previous 180 days and the new price is lower than the previous sale price, a second appraisal is required. The Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) mandates a second appraisal if a property is sold within 180 days at a lower price. The cost of the second appraisal cannot be charged to the loan applicant. Regulators are directed to establish reasonable fees for fee appraisers, excluding employees of banks and appraisal management companies. Fee appraisers should receive customary and reasonable payment for services, based on objective third-party information. The Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC) was eliminated by Section 1472 (j) of the DFA, which was created during the subprime mortgage crisis. The HVCC resulted from a legal investigation into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by the attorney general of New York. Despite the sunset of HVCC agreements in the DFA, some of its principles were integrated into subsequent federal regulations on appraisals. The settlement that established the HVCC was controversial due to concerns about state officials influencing federal regulatory policy. The New York attorney general reached an agreement with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to end a state investigation. The agreement required the GSEs to only purchase mortgages from banks that did not conduct in-house appraisals. This was seen as de facto banking regulation, as banks conducting in-house appraisals would lose access to funds. Federal financial regulators challenged the agreement and the authority of a state official to set rules for federally chartered banks. The DFA transferred authority for regulating consumer-related issues to the CFPB from banking regulators. It requires joint rules for residential property appraisals and appoints a CFPB member to the ASC board. Courts are instructed to defer to CFPB rulemaking in appraisal regulation. Regulatory standards for appraisal management companies are set, requiring registration with state boards and oversight by the ASC. The Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) mandates oversight of state appraisal boards by the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) and requires joint rules for the registration of Appraisal Management Companies (AMCs). Registered AMCs must comply with four requirements at the state level, including using licensed appraisers, following professional appraisal standards, and ensuring independence in appraisals. Regulators issue rules within the statutory framework established by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule for appraisal independence in October 2010, following the Dodd-Frank Act's requirements. The rule prohibits coercion of appraisers and financial interests in appraisal management companies. The October 2010 rule prohibits appraisers and appraisal management companies from having financial interests in transactions. It also prohibits lenders from providing credit if they know of appraiser coercion or conflicts of interest. Lenders must report appraiser misconduct to state licensing authorities. The rule sets standards for reasonable compensation to appraisers as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. It applies to transactions secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, including home equity lines of credit, and extends to anyone making a valuation of real estate for covered transactions. Regulators issued FIL-82-2010, \"Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines,\" on December 2, 2010, applying to lenders regulated by FFIEC members. The FIL prohibits nonbank lenders funded by securitization from using automated valuation models in place of appraisals. It also prohibits reliance on valuation methods that do not provide a property's market value and requires reporting appraiser misconduct to state regulatory officials. The FIL-82-2010 issued by regulators in December 2010 prohibits nonbank lenders funded by securitization from using automated valuation models instead of appraisals. It also requires reporting appraiser misconduct and prohibits reliance on valuation methods that do not provide a property's market value. The CFPB issued an appraisal rule in December 2011, transferring regulatory authority under TILA from the Federal Reserve to the CFPB. The rule requires banks to separate loan officers from staff that selects appraisers and applies to all lenders. The FHA insures residential mortgages and requires appraisers to be certified at the state level. Only appraisers listed on HUD's FHA Appraiser Roster can perform appraisals for FHA loans. The 2011 rule updated the roster and set additional standards for appraisers, such as not being listed on certain government suspension lists."
