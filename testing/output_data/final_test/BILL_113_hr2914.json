    "content": "The Act titled \"Promoting Integrity in Medicare Act of 2013\" is established for the purpose of promoting integrity in Medicare. Congress finds that financial incentives were the main cause of increased self-referrals in advanced diagnostic imaging and anatomic pathology, leading to significant additional costs for Medicare in 2010. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) highlighted the rapid growth of in-office ancillary services (IOAS) and the inappropriate furnishing of these services by referring physicians. Physician self-referral of ancillary services creates incentives to increase volume under Medicare's fee-for-service payment systems, contributing to the program's financial burden. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services stated that the IOAS exception allows physicians to provide ancillary services in their offices to aid in diagnosis and treatment decisions during the initial office visit. According to studies, only a small percentage of advanced scans are done on the same day as the initial office visit. Urologists' self-referrals for biopsy services have been linked to increased volume billed and lower detection of prostate cancer. According to reports, there has been a rise in anatomic pathology specimen units billed to Medicare for CPT Code 88305 from 2006 to 2010. Splitting technical and professional components of pathology services among different providers could jeopardize patient safety. Bloomberg News investigated challenges faced in the industry in November 2012. An investigative report revealed that California prostate cancer patients treated by a urology clinic with self-referral practices faced compromised care and increased healthcare costs. Urology groups owning radiation therapy machines have high utilization rates for prostate cancer treatment, exceeding national norms. The legislation aims to maintain the in-office ancillary services exception by removing certain complex services like advanced imaging, anatomic pathology, radiation therapy, and physical therapy. This is to protect patients from misaligned provider financial interests. The exception for rural providers in the \"Stark\" rule remains unaffected. The legislation aims to protect patients from misaligned provider financial incentives and save billions of dollars in Medicare resources. It also ensures that the purposes described in previous paragraphs are achieved without altering the ownership or investment prohibition exception for rural providers. The legislation aims to protect patients and save Medicare resources by limiting the application of physicians' services and in-office ancillary services exceptions. The legislation amends Section 1877 of the Social Security Act to include specified non-ancillary services and increase civil money penalties for violations related to these services. The legislation amends Section 1877 of the Social Security Act to include enhanced screening of claims for specified non-ancillary services, with compliance reviews conducted by the Secretary and Inspector General within 180 days. The legislation amends Section 1877 of the Social Security Act to include procedures for compliance reviews targeting high-risk entities for noncompliance with billing for specified non-ancillary services. This may involve prepayment reviews, claims audits, focused medical reviews, and computer algorithms to identify anomalies. The legislation includes procedures for compliance reviews targeting high-risk entities for noncompliance with billing for specified non-ancillary services, such as anatomic pathology and radiation therapy services. The legislation outlines compliance reviews for high-risk entities regarding billing for non-ancillary services like anatomic pathology and radiation therapy. It also specifies items and services affected by the amendments, including advanced diagnostic imaging studies and physical therapy services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services retains the authority to waive requirements under certain provisions. The amendments will apply to items and services provided more than 12 months after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4 amends the Social Security Act to clarify that a physician's practice is considered an entity subject to the anti-markup rule when billing for certain services. SEC. 5 clarifies supervision requirements for the technical component of anatomic pathology services. Section 1861(s)(17) of the Social Security Act is amended to include supervision requirements for the technical component of anatomic pathology services. This amendment exempts certain services from budget neutrality under the physician fee schedule. Section 1848(c)(2)(B)(v) of the Social Security Act is amended to exempt reduced expenditures from the Promoting Integrity in Medicare Act of 2013 from budget neutrality under the physician fee schedule starting in 2014."
