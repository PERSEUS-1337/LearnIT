    "content": "The \"Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area Improvement Act\" defines terms like Corporation, Pipeline, Recreation Area, Secretary, and Superintendent. It also includes an easement for an expanded natural gas pipeline. The Secretary may grant an easement to the Corporation to enlarge the pipeline diameter from 14 to 20 inches in the Recreation Area. The easement must consider recreational values, resource protection, minimal disturbance during construction, compliance with National Park System laws, and any other necessary terms and conditions. The Superintendent may issue a permit to the Corporation for temporary construction in the Recreation Area, subject to consultation, identification of resources, and submission of a restoration plan for approval. The Corporation must maintain the land subject to the easement and carry out specific activities to mitigate damages or restore natural resources in the Recreation Area. The pipeline enlargement authorized must meet replacement requirements, and the Corporation must comply with FERC certification for the increase in pipeline size. The Secretary cannot allow any further pipeline size increases or easements within the Recreation Area after this Act's enactment. Any violations may result in penalties and civil actions by the Attorney General. Failure to submit or implement an approved restoration and mitigation plan, resulting in harm to park system resources, may lead to penalties and civil actions by the Attorney General. SEC. 4. USE OF CERTAIN ROADS WITHIN DELAWARE WATER GAP.
