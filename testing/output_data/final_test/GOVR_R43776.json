    "content": "Congress uses an annual appropriations process through 12 subcommittees to provide discretionary spending for federal agencies. If regular appropriations are not enacted by the fiscal year deadline, continuing resolutions (CRs) may be used. Supplemental appropriations can also be enacted during the fiscal year. The FY2015 appropriations process was influenced by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which set spending limits and provided alternative budget enforcement measures. Observers believed that the early funding levels could lead to the enactment of appropriations bills before the fiscal year began. The FY2015 appropriations process was influenced by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which set spending limits and provided alternative budget enforcement measures. Observers believed that the debate over FY2015 appropriations would focus on funding various agencies and programs rather than overall budgetary resources. Delays in enacting FY2014 appropriations and the President's budget submission also impacted the start of the FY2015 appropriations process. The FY2015 appropriations process faced delays, with the OCO/GWOT portion submitted late. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees held hearings on a condensed schedule to start committee action on draft bills in April and May. No FY2015 regular appropriations bills were enacted by the fiscal year's start. A FY2015 CR (P.L. 113-164) was enacted on September 19, 2014, providing temporary funding through December 11, 2014, due to the delays in passing regular bills. The FY2015 appropriations process faced delays, with temporary funding provided through various Continuing Resolutions (CRs) until full year appropriations were signed into law on March 4, 2015. The FY2015 appropriations process faced delays, with temporary funding provided through Continuing Resolutions (CRs) until full year appropriations were signed into law on March 4, 2015 (H.R. 240). This report provides background and analysis on congressional action related to the FY2015 appropriations process, including discretionary budget enforcement, regular appropriations, and budget enforcement considerations. The budget process includes statutory elements from the Budget Control Act of 2011, setting discretionary spending limits, and procedural elements related to the budget resolution. Separate limits are imposed on defense and nondefense discretionary spending for each fiscal year. Enacted discretionary spending must not exceed these limits, enforceable through sequestration by the Office of Management and Budget. The Budget Control Act of 2011 sets discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense spending each fiscal year. Sequestration may be necessary to enforce these limits. The FY2015 limits are $521.272 billion for defense and $492.356 billion for nondefense spending. Procedural elements of budget enforcement are based on Congressional requirements. Procedural elements of budget enforcement under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 involve the allocation of discretionary budget authority through a 302(a) allocation and subsequent 302(b) suballocations to Appropriations Committee subcommittees. Enforcement is done through points of order, with no FY2015 budget resolution adopted by Congress as of the report date. Congress has not adopted a FY2015 budget resolution. The House passed a budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 96) in April 2014, but no further action was taken. The Senate did not consider a budget resolution for FY2015. Instead, both chambers used an alternative mechanism for procedural budget enforcement under the Bipartisan Budget Act. This allowed the House and Senate Budget Committee chairs to allocate funds within specified limits without a formal budget resolution. The House and Senate used an alternative mechanism for budget enforcement under the Bipartisan Budget Act for FY2015. This allowed for the allocation of funds without a formal budget resolution. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported 302(b) suballocations to their subcommittees before considering the regular appropriations bills. Annual appropriations are provided in 12 separate bills, which can be considered and enacted individually or combined. The FY2015 regular appropriations bills were not enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year, October 1, 2014. Final action for 11 out of the 12 regular appropriations bills occurred during the 113th Congress with the enactment of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act on December 16, 2014. The FY2015 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act was considered and enacted during the first months of the 114th Congress, on March 4, 2015. The House Appropriations Committee approved and reported 11 regular appropriations bills over a 16-week period, starting with the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill and the Legislative Branch bill on April 3, 2014. This was the earliest approval in decades. Three bills were approved by subcommittees during this time. During April to July, several regular appropriations bills were approved by subcommittees and the House Appropriations Committee. The final bill reported to the House was the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill (H.R. 5171) on July 23. Out of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2015, only one was not reported to the House. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies appropriations bill was not approved by the subcommittee or considered by the full committee. Table 2 shows the eight regular appropriations bills considered on the House floor during the 113th Congress. During an 11-week period from April to July, several regular appropriations bills were considered and passed by the House. The first bill, H.R. 4486, was passed on April 30 by a vote of 416-1. Two bills were passed in May, two in June, and the final two in July. The last bill, the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill, was passed on July 16 by a vote of 228-195. The House passed the Government appropriations bill by a vote of 228-195, with defense discretionary spending projected at $521.261 billion and nondefense discretionary spending projected at $487.724 billion. When accounting for designated spending, total defense discretionary spending was projected at $579.835 billion and total nondefense discretionary spending at $504.260 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved 11 regular appropriations bills, with 8 reported to the Senate. Subcommittee and full committee actions took place over an eight-week period. The first bills approved were for Agriculture and Military Construction on May 20, 2014. In total, 2 bills were approved in May, 8 in June, and 1 in July. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved 11 regular appropriations bills, with 8 reported to the Senate. Subcommittee and full committee actions took place over an eight-week period. The final bill approved and reported to the Senate was the Department of Defense appropriations bill (H.R. 4870) on July 17, 2014. Four of the 12 regular appropriations bills were not reported to the Senate. During the 113th Congress, the Senate considered the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill (H.R. 4660). Senator Mikulski proposed adding two additional appropriations bills to the legislation for initial floor consideration. The motion to proceed was made on June 12, with cloture invoked on June 17 and the motion agreed to on June 19. However, no further action occurred after that. OMB projected the budgetary levels of the Senate regular appropriations bills on August 20, 2014. Defense discretionary spending was projected to be about $521.306 billion, slightly exceeding the limit. When accounting for defense spending designated under Section 251(b) of the BBEDCA for OCO/GWOT, the total defense discretionary spending subject to the BCA limits was projected to be about $579.880 billion. Nondefense discretionary spending was projected to be about $488.603 billion, slightly below the limit. When accounting for nondefense spending designated for various purposes, the total nondefense discretionary spending was projected to be about $505.139 billion. The FY2015 Consolidated Act combined 11 appropriations bills into one package, excluding funding for the Department of Homeland Security due to disagreements over immigration actions. Critics suggested using DHS funding as a response, leading to a temporary extension in the omnibus package. The omnibus package included a temporary extension of DHS funding through February 27, 2015. It was considered as a House amendment to an unrelated bill (H.R. 83) and was signed into law on December 16, 2014. CBO estimated the appropriations provided by the bill before it was passed. The enactment of H.R. 83, Divisions A-L, provided budgetary effects for annual regular appropriations acts and annualized budget authority for part-year CR for DHS. CBO estimated total appropriations to be about $1.1 billion, with adjustments to the spending limits. Congressional action for FY2015 DHS appropriations occurred in the first months of the 114th Congress, with H.R. 240 introduced by Representative Harold Rogers on January 9. The House passed H.R. 240 after considering amendments related to immigration executive actions. The Senate struggled to invoke cloture but eventually passed the measure after reaching a deal on an amendment. Differences between the House and Senate versions were resolved between February 27 and March 3, 2015. On March 3, 2015, the House and Senate reached a resolution on H.R. 240 after a series of votes and motions. The bill was signed into law on March 4, 2015, following the enactment of a continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 124; P.L. 113-164) on September 19, 2014, to extend funding at previous levels. The Continuing Resolution (CR) extended funding at last year's levels with some reductions and exceptions through December 11, 2014. Additional CRs were enacted to extend funding for all 12 regular appropriations bills through December 17, 2014. Another CR extended funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through February 27, 2015. Subsequent CRs further extended funding through March 3, 2015. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY2015 was introduced by Representative Harold Rogers on September 9, 2014. On September 16, the House adopted a special rule allowing the President to arm and train Syrian opposition groups. The Senate passed the Continuing Resolution (CR) on September 18 and the President signed it into law on September 19. The Congressional Budget Office reported a budget authority of $1,012.236 billion in the CR. The Continuing Resolution (CR) had a total annualized budget authority of $1,110.678 billion, with defense spending estimated at $517.689 billion and nondefense spending at $494.547 billion. The CR exceeded one of the statutory discretionary spending limits. However, the Budget Control Act (BCA) limits were superseded by the enactment of H.R. 83 before enforcement. Congressional action on H.R. 83 for annual appropriations revealed the need for additional time. Representative Harold was involved in the process on December 10, 2014. On December 10, 2014, Representative Harold Rogers introduced H.J.Res. 130 to extend the first FY2015 CR to December 13, 2014. It was signed into law on December 12, 2014 (P.L. 113-202). Another CR, H.J.Res. 131, extended the first CR to December 17, 2014, and was signed into law on December 13, 2014 (P.L. 113-203). These temporary appropriations laws were replaced by H.R. 83 on December 16, 2014. On December 16, 2014, H.R. 83 was enacted, extending DHS funding through February 27, 2015. A further extension was proposed through H.J.Res. 35 to March 19, 2015. The House initially rejected a temporary extension of DHS funding through March 19, 2015. The Senate later passed a one-week extension that was signed into law by the President. This funding was replaced by annual appropriations for DHS on March 4, 2015."
