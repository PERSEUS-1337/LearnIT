    "content": "The \"Farm to School Improvements Act of 2010\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to include a Farm to School Program under section 19A. The Secretary provides assistance for farm to school programs through grants and technical support to improve access to local foods in schools. Programs aim to enhance children's nutritional health by procuring healthy local foods. The farm to school program aims to procure healthy local foods from small and medium-sized farms for meals at eligible schools and institutions, support nutrition education activities, develop a sustained commitment to farm to school programs in the community, and increase farm income by facilitating farmers' involvement. The farm to school program aims to increase farm income by connecting farmers to institutional markets like schools. Eligible entities for grants include schools, nonprofit organizations, and other entities with unique abilities to provide farm-to-school programs. Grants may cover implementation costs and training assistance. The farm to school program grants provide support, information, and resources for successful implementation. Grants can also be used for collaboration between public and private entities or for conducting research and developing partnerships. Grant amounts range from $25,000 for planning grants to $100,000 for implementation or training grants. Grants are awarded for specific durations. The grant awarded for a period not to exceed 2 years for implementation or training grants and 1 year for planning grants. The grant amount shall not exceed 75% of the cost of activities, with the recipient required to provide at least 25% in cash or in-kind contributions. Recipients must undergo evaluation. The Secretary requires grant recipients to cooperate in evaluations of funded programs, ensure regional balance, provide technical assistance, and submit proposals for grants. The Secretary will form review panels to evaluate proposals based on specific criteria, including representatives from schools, dietitians, small and medium-sized farms, public agencies, and community-based organizations with expertise in local food systems. The Secretary evaluates proposals based on improving children's nutritional health, incorporating local food products, benefiting small farms, providing nutrition education, serving schools with high free/reduced lunch eligibility, and promoting collaboration between schools. The Secretary evaluates proposals for collaboration between schools, organizations, and community partners, sustainability, evaluation plans, and funding transfer for program implementation. The School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1769(g)) is amended by redesignating paragraphs (3) and (4) as paragraphs (1) and (2), respectively."
