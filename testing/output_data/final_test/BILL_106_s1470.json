    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Chemical Security Act of 1999\". Congress finds that the possibility of terrorist and criminal attacks on chemical plants poses a serious threat to human health, safety, and the environment. Limiting public access to chemical accident information does not address the underlying problem of plant vulnerability. Employing safer technologies in chemical manufacturing can prevent criminal attacks and offer industry cost savings. Safer technologies in chemical manufacturing can reduce the need for security measures and insurance, while chemical plants must ensure safe facilities to prevent criminal activity. If deemed necessary, the Attorney General will establish a program to enforce protective actions. SEC. 3. PREVENTION OF CRIMINAL RELEASES. The Clean Air Act is amended to include a general duty for owners and operators of stationary sources to identify and prevent hazards from accidental or criminal releases, as well as minimize the consequences of any releases. The Clean Air Act is amended to include definitions for \"criminal release\" and \"design and maintenance of safe facilities\" related to regulated substance releases from stationary sources. The term `design and maintenance of safe facilities' refers to practices at stationary sources to prevent or reduce vulnerability to regulated substance releases through safer technology and containment measures. The term 'design and maintenance of safe facilities' involves making stationary sources impregnable to intruders, improving site security and employee training, and reducing potential consequences through buffer zones. The term 'use of inherently safer technology' refers to utilizing technology, products, raw materials, or practices that reduce or eliminate the possibility of toxic releases compared to current methods. The term 'use of inherently safer technology' involves reducing or eliminating the release of toxic, volatile, corrosive, or flammable substances to protect public health and the environment through various methods like input substitution, process redesign, and technology modification. The term 'use of inherently safer technology' involves technology modification to use less hazardous substances, moderate pressures or temperatures, reduce human error, improve inventory control, and eliminate storage of hazardous chemicals. This is aimed at preventing criminal releases under the Clean Air Act. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Administrator, will determine if owners or operators of stationary sources have taken adequate actions to prevent criminal releases that may harm public health, safety, and the environment. If not, chemical security regulations will be implemented. The General, in consultation with the Administrator, will establish requirements within 2 years to ensure owners or operators of stationary sources prevent criminal releases that could harm public health, safety, and the environment. Regulations may be promulgated by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Attorney General to implement this Act and its amendments. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the Act and its amendments, with funds remaining available until expended."
