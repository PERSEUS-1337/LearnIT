    "content": "The \"Private Sector Preparedness Act of 2004\" may be cited as the short title. The findings of the Act are also outlined. Congress finds that private sector organizations, owning 85% of the nation's infrastructure and employing the majority of its workforce, can coordinate resources more efficiently in emergencies. However, these organizations are often unprepared for disasters, as highlighted by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks. The lack of emergency preparedness and evacuation planning in private sector organizations may have led to additional casualties at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. There is uncertainty and confusion regarding the definition of appropriate preparedness and necessary actions for these organizations. Identifying standards and best practices, along with educational activities, is crucial to promote emergency preparedness in the private sector. Private Sector Emergency Preparedness Program established under Title V of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to promote emergency preparedness in private sector organizations. The Secretary shall develop a program to enhance private sector preparedness for emergencies and disasters, including acts of terrorism. This program will include guidance on identifying hazards, assessing risks, mitigating impacts, managing resources, developing mutual aid agreements, and maintaining emergency preparedness plans. The Secretary is responsible for developing and maintaining emergency preparedness plans, communication systems, training programs, and procedures for responding to media and public inquiries. Additionally, the Secretary will support the development of national voluntary consensus standards for private sector emergency preparedness.
