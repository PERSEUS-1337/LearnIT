This method avoids the complexities of reinforcement learning but requires expert demonstrations. The paper explores using imitation learning without expert demonstrations by leveraging suboptimal policy trajectories as optimal examples for other tasks in a multi-task setting. The proposed algorithm for learning behaviors without demonstrations or complex reinforcement learning methods maximizes the likelihood of actions taken in previous rollouts to reach a specific state. This self-supervised imitation learning approach shows competitive performance on challenging goal-reaching problems compared to traditional reinforcement learning methods. Reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly deep RL, face optimization challenges and lack convergence guarantees. Commonly used methods are sensitive to hyperparameters and require a large number of samples. Additionally, designing reward functions poses usability challenges in RL. Imitation learning offers a simpler approach to training control policies compared to deep RL algorithms. By maximizing the likelihood of expert-provided actions, imitation learning can produce effective policies without the complexities of RL. Deep learning algorithms for supervised learning have matured, making imitation learning a reliable method for acquiring behaviors from high-dimensional sensory data. In this paper, the focus is on training effective policies without expert demonstrations, using ideas from imitation learning to learn goal-directed behavior autonomously from scratch. The key observation is that trajectories generated by a suboptimal policy can serve as optimal examples for other tasks in a multi-task setting. The algorithm discussed leverages the idea of using trajectories from suboptimal policies as examples for training goal-conditioned policies without reinforcement learning or reward functions. This self-supervised approach combines imitation learning with supervised learning to achieve near-optimal policies. This algorithm combines imitation learning with self-supervised training to learn goal-conditioned policies without expert demonstrations. It avoids the complexity of Q functions and value functions, allowing for off-policy data re-use. The algorithm can be bootstrapped with a few expert demonstrations and continues to improve behavior without the challenges of combining imitation learning with off-policy reinforcement learning. Our work presents a novel algorithm for learning goal-conditioned policies through imitation learning, optimizing the agent's probability of reaching the desired goal. This approach eliminates the need for explicit rewards or expert demonstrations, addressing the challenges of goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. Learning goal-conditioned policies is challenging with sparse rewards. Hindsight relabeling can help, but off-policy RL methods remain unstable. A new approach leverages supervised learning and data relabeling to build off-policy goal reaching algorithms without explicit RL, inheriting benefits of supervised learning. On-policy algorithms are inefficient for real-world settings. The algorithm is based on imitation learning, optimizing the agent's probability of reaching the goal without explicit rewards or expert demonstrations. The algorithm discussed is based on imitation learning but is not an imitation learning method. It can learn to reach goals from scratch without explicit rewards and can incorporate expert demonstrations for reinforcement learning. Recent imitation learning algorithms propose methods closely related to GCSL, but our method iteratively performs goal-conditioned behavioral cloning without the need for expert demonstrations. This approach optimizes a lower bound on the probability of successfully reaching goals using the policy's own sampled data. Reward-weighted regression, path-integral policy improvement, reward-augmented maximum likelihood, and proportional cross-entropy method selectively weight policies or trajectories based on performance. Unlike GCSL, our self-supervised method does not require a reward function and is effective in goal-conditioned settings. It performs well in the off-policy setting without collecting new data, distinguishing it from other algorithms. The curr_chunk discusses the use of an inverse model with forward consistency for learning from novelty seeking behavior in goal reaching tasks. It compares semi-parametric methods that build a connectivity graph over visited states, highlighting the complexity and memory requirements. The goal is to find a time-varying goal-conditioned policy in an environment defined by state and action spaces, transition kernel, initial state distribution, horizon length, and distribution over goal states. The curr_chunk discusses the formulation of an optimal policy in a goal-reaching task by maximizing the probability of reaching the goal within a specified time horizon. The problem is framed in reinforcement learning with a modified state space including current state, goal, and remaining horizon. The reward function depends on achieving the goal and time step, allowing off-policy RL methods to relabel transitions for different goals and horizons. In goal-reaching tasks, algorithms use behavior cloning to predict expert actions for reaching target goals. Goal-conditioned imitation learning assumes expert demonstrations are optimal for reaching all preceding states, not just the final one. In goal-reaching tasks, behavior cloning is used to predict expert actions for reaching target goals. Goal-conditioned imitation learning assumes expert demonstrations are optimal for reaching all preceding states, not just the final one. This procedure optimizes the objective without relying on expert demonstrations, showing that expert demonstrations can provide supervision for reaching any state along the expert's trajectory. In goal-reaching tasks, behavior cloning is used to predict expert actions for reaching target goals. The idea of imitation learning with data relabeling can be repurposed to construct a learning algorithm that can learn how to reach goals from scratch without expert demonstrations. This algorithm optimizes a lower bound on a reinforcement learning objective and offers benefits over standard RL algorithms. It leverages ideas from imitation learning to build a goal-reaching algorithm. To learn how to reach goals from scratch without expert demonstrations, goal-conditioned behavior cloning is used. By sampling trajectories, relabeling them, and treating them as expert data, supervised learning is performed. This approach leverages insights from imitation learning to optimize a reinforcement learning objective for goal-reaching tasks. In goal-reaching formalism, an optimal policy maximizes the probability of reaching the goal at the last timestep of an episode. A data relabeling scheme can construct an expert dataset from trajectories, even if actions are suboptimal for reaching the goal. Actions at a timestep are likely good for reaching states later in the trajectory, providing supervision for the policy. Autonomous relabeling converts suboptimal trajectories into optimal goal-reaching trajectories without human intervention. By relabeling timesteps and horizons in a trajectory, an expert dataset can be created for goal-conditioned behavioral cloning to update the policy. This process optimizes a lower bound on a reinforcement learning objective. The GCSL algorithm optimizes a reinforcement learning objective by sampling trajectories, relabeling them, and training a policy until convergence. It involves sampling a goal, executing the current policy in the environment, relabeling the trajectory, and performing supervised learning to update the policy. The GCSL algorithm learns to reach goals from the target distribution using iterated behavioral cloning. It is off-policy, has low variance gradients, and is easy to implement without explicit reward function engineering. This algorithm maximizes a lower bound on the probability for a policy to reach commanded goals. The GCSL algorithm uses iterated behavioral cloning to reach goals from a target distribution. It is off-policy, with low variance gradients, and easy to implement without explicit reward function engineering. The algorithm maximizes a lower bound on the probability for a policy to reach commanded goals by optimizing a multi-task problem where the reward is an indicator of goal achievement. The GCSL algorithm optimizes a lower bound on the desired objective by maximizing the probability of reaching goals. The tightness of this bound is controlled by the error in the GCSL objective. In scenarios where the probability of reaching a goal is nonzero, GCSL improves expected reward. Experimental evaluation aims to determine if GCSL effectively learns goal-conditioned policies and if performance improves over time. The GCSL algorithm aims to learn goal-conditioned policies from scratch and improve performance over successive iterations. It can incorporate demonstration data effectively and handle high-dimensional image observations. Various simulated control environments are used to evaluate the method's performance, with tasks including 2-D room navigation, object pushing with a robotic arm, and the Lunar Lander game. Performance is measured by the distance of the agent to the goal at the last timestep. The GCSL algorithm parametrizes the policy as a neural network taking state, goal, and horizon as input, yielding competitive results in goal-reaching tasks. The optimal policy is speculated to be non-Markovian, but omitting the horizon from the input still provides good outcomes. The GCSL algorithm evaluates its effectiveness for reaching goals in various domains using sensory observations. It is compared to off-policy TD3-HER and on-policy TRPO reinforcement learning algorithms, highlighting the simplicity of GCSL's procedure compared to the more complex machinery required by TD3-HER. The GCSL algorithm outperforms both TD3 and TRPO in reaching goals consistently across different domains, especially in tasks requiring more challenging control behavior. Videos and additional details can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/gcsl/. The GCSL algorithm outperforms TD3 and TRPO in reaching goals, especially in challenging control behavior tasks. GCSL shows competitive performance in learning goal-reaching behaviors, even in image-based domains, reaching within 80% of desired goals and learning at a comparable or better rate than off-policy RL methods. The algorithm scales well with state dimensionality and behavior complexity. In investigating the performance of the GCSL algorithm, the study explores how varying data quality, quantity, policy class, and relabelling technique impact its behaviors. Varying policy classes can significantly affect performance, with time-varying policies speeding up training on small domains but being ineffective on domains with active exploration challenges. The quality of data used to train the policy also influences the learned policy, with different variations of GCSL being considered. The study explores how varying data quality, quantity, policy class, and relabelling technique impact the performance of the GCSL algorithm. Two variations of GCSL are considered: one collects data using a fixed policy, while the other limits the dataset size, forcing all data to be on-policy. The iterative loop of collecting data and training the policy is crucial for convergence to a performant solution. The on-policy process is effective on simple domains but leads to slower learning progress on more challenging control tasks. GCSL can perform self-imitation from arbitrary data sources, making it amenable to initialization from prior exploration or demonstrations. The GCSL algorithm can incorporate expert demonstrations for initialization without requiring modifications. In contrast, off-policy TD-based methods need algorithmic changes to integrate expert data. GCSL's performance is compared to TD3-HER variant in incorporating expert demonstrations. GCSL outperforms TD3-HER in incorporating expert demonstrations in the robotic pushing environment. TD3 initially drops in performance when using demonstrations, while GCSL learns faster and effectively integrates expert data without the need for an explicit critic. This advantage is attributed to the instability of training critics with off-policy data like demonstrations. In this work, GCSL is proposed as a simple algorithm for learning goal-conditioned policies using imitation learning and autonomous learning from scratch. It can utilize off-policy data, incorporate expert demonstrations, and learn from image observations. This method optimizes a lower bound on a reinforcement learning objective, a unique approach compared to prior works. The proposed method optimizes a lower bound on a reinforcement learning objective. It has limitations in exploration methods but future work could focus on incorporating novelty-seeking exploration procedures and studying scalability for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning on larger datasets. The proposed method optimizes a lower bound on a reinforcement learning objective, focusing on goal-conditioned reinforcement learning on larger datasets. GCSL iteratively performs maximum likelihood estimation using relabelled trajectories collected by the agent. The policy is parametrized using a neural network for state and goal inputs, returning probabilities for actions in the action space. The method involves preprocessing images through convolutional layers, sampling data with an exploratory policy, and storing trajectories in a replay buffer. Experimental comparisons are made with TD3-HER, and transitions are relabelled based on probabilities. The agent receives rewards based on relabelling outcomes, aiming to optimize the Q-function. The optimal Q-function for TD3 is based on the minimum expected time to reach a goal from a given state. The actor and Q-function are neural networks with similar architectures to GCSL. TRPO is compared as an on-policy RL algorithm with a surrogate reward function. Hyperparameter sweeps were conducted to maximize data efficiency. For image-based experiments, resolution was set at 84 \u00d7 84 \u00d7 3. 2D Room Navigation involves navigating between four connected rooms. The agent's state space has two dimensions for cartesian coordinates. Robotic Pushing requires moving a block in a play area with 4-dimensional state space. Sawyer manipulator is controlled via end-effector position with a three-dimensional action space. The agent in the robotic pushing task controls the Sawyer manipulator with a three-dimensional action space. Goals are uniformly distributed in the state space, and the agent starts with the block and end-effector in the bottom-left corner. In the Lunar Lander environment, a rocket must land in a specified region with goals sampled uniformly along the landing region. Variants of GCSL were analyzed, including an Inverse Model, On-Policy training with limited transitions, and Fixed Data Collection with a uniform policy over actions. In the robotic pushing task, a policy is conditioned on the remaining horizon and receives a reverse temperature encoding as input. An expert policy is trained using TRPO with a dense reward function, and a dataset of 200 trajectories is collected. GCSL is trained using these trajectories to warm-start the algorithm. Initializing a value function method involves goal-conditioned behavior cloning and collecting 200 new trajectories using a uniform data collection scheme. In the robotic pushing task, a policy is conditioned on the remaining horizon and receives a reverse temperature encoding as input. An expert policy is trained using TRPO with a dense reward function, and a dataset of 200 trajectories is collected. GCSL is trained using these trajectories to warm-start the algorithm. Policy evaluation on \u03c0 BC is performed using 400 trajectories, learning Q \u03c0 BC via bootstrapping. The Q-function estimate is used to initialize the policy and Q-function for the value function RL algorithm. The goal of GCSL is to optimize the probability of reaching a commanded goal, with a pre-specified distribution over tasks. The objective involves analyzing the relationship between J(\u03c0) and a surrogate objective, with the final goal-relabeling objective being to train the policy to reach goals that were reached before. The proof shows that J(\u03c0) \u2265 J GCSL (\u03c0) + C 1 + C 2, with a focus on the probability of reaching a goal under the old policy \u03c0 old. This analysis is important for understanding the gap introduced by Equation 3. The gap introduced by Equation 3 can be controlled by the probability of making a mistake and the difference between distributions of trajectories that must be relabelled and those that do not. The Radon-Nikodym derivative is defined to understand the error in the GCSL loss. The gap between J surr and J GCSL can be controlled by the probability of reaching the wrong goal and the divergence between conditional distributions of good and relabelled trajectories. Optimizing the GCSL objective tightly bounds this gap by minimizing the probability of reaching the wrong goal. The conditional distribution of actions for a given state is defined when the goal is reached at the end of the trajectory. If not defined, it is uniform. In an environment with deterministic dynamics and reachable goals, optimizing the GCSL objective minimizes the probability of making mistakes. The text discusses a coupling argument to show the relationship between policies in reaching goals. It highlights the probability of different actions and trajectories, emphasizing the importance of deterministic dynamics in achieving goals. The policy \u03c0 is shown to reach the goal with a high probability. Figure 8 displays trajectories in GCSL, capturing the rocket's or agent's position in different tasks. These trajectories often take direct paths to the goal, avoiding roundabout routes."
