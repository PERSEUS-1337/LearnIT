    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The State of California enacts Part 4.5 of Division 34 of the Public Resources Code, establishing the Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resiliency Program. The program aims to address the challenges posed by a changing climate by investing in building resiliency and strengthening adaptation efforts at the state, regional, and local levels using the best-available science. The state's adaptation strategy document, Safeguarding California, prioritizes actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for climate change impacts. Integrated planning and coordinated strategies across state, regional, and local governments are essential for a cohesive response to climate change impacts. The office is established as the state planning agency for long-range goals shaping statewide development patterns and assisting in research and planning efforts. It is intended that adaptation strategies for climate change be integrated into state policies and projects, with the office coordinating adaptation projects and goals across California. The Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resiliency Program is established to coordinate regional and local efforts with state climate adaptation strategies to adapt to climate change impacts. The program will focus on climate equity considerations and developing holistic strategies for both greenhouse gas emissions reductions and adaptation efforts. It will include working with local and regional efforts, developing tools, and providing guidance. The Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resiliency Program aims to develop tools, coordinate state agency support, and inform state-led programs to reflect local and regional adaptation, preparedness, and resilience efforts. This involves collaboration with various state agencies and entities to address climate change impacts. The Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resiliency Program involves coordinating regular reviews and updates to the Adaptation Planning Guide, maintaining a clearinghouse for climate adaptation information, and conducting meetings with an advisory council for technical support and expertise in climate adaptation. The Office of Emergency Services, in coordination with relevant entities, will review and update the Adaptation Planning Guide within one year of Safeguarding California Plan updates. The guide will provide tools for creating climate adaptation and community resiliency plans, considering the nexus between adaptation, resiliency, public safety, and security. The Adaptation Planning Guide will be reviewed and updated to address vulnerabilities across impact sectors and regions, developing tailored adaptation strategies. The Adaptation Planning Guide will be updated to include guidance on coordinating adaptation planning activities, strategies for natural hazards exacerbated by climate change, conducting vulnerability assessments, identifying risk reduction strategies, and interpreting climate science for local and regional impacts. Public meetings will be held in different regions of the state to gather input from the public and leaders in climate preparedness. An advisory council is established to provide scientific and technical support for coordinating state, regional, and local agency efforts to adapt to climate change impacts. Council members have expertise in various areas such as public health, environmental quality, agriculture, transportation, energy, and emergency services. The office coordinates with state, regional, and local agencies to establish a clearinghouse for climate adaptation information. The clearinghouse provides climate data to guide decision-makers in planning and implementing projects for climate resilience. The clearinghouse for climate adaptation information provides resources such as projections, vulnerability assessments, downscaled data, visualization tools, white papers, case studies, research articles, best practices, and funding opportunities for adaptation research and projects. The clearinghouse for climate adaptation information offers funding opportunities for adaptation research and projects, regionally prioritized best-practice projects, and encourages informal discussion among agency secretaries and their staff. Section 75123 of the Public Resources Code is amended to subject council meetings to the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act, except for specific exceptions such as meetings of the Governor's cabinet and discussions on state agency coordination for various priorities. The council provides policy recommendations and investment strategies to promote sustainable communities. They also develop grant guidelines and host public forums to gather advice on local planning, sustainable development, and climate change mitigation."
