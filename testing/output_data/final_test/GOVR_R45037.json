    "content": "FARA, enacted in 1938 to promote transparency regarding foreign propaganda, has evolved over time. It requires public disclosure of activities representing foreign interests or distributing foreign propaganda. Congress believed disclosure would combat foreign influence by informing the public. The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was enacted in 1938 to promote transparency regarding foreign propaganda. It was a response to concerns about Nazi and communist propaganda being distributed in the United States by foreign entities. The impetus for FARA was the global political dynamics of the 1930s, with Congress perceiving a need to oversee efforts to influence the American government by foreign sources. The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was amended by Congress to focus on promoting transparency of lobbying activities for foreign clients. The amendments aimed to target lawyer-lobbyists and public relations counselors influencing US policies for their clients. In the 1990s, FARA was further amended as part of lobbying disclosure laws under the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA), limiting registration requirements to agents of foreign governments. The amendments to FARA focused on registration requirements for agents of foreign governments and political parties, allowing other foreign entities to register under the LDA. The central issue is determining if a person qualifies as an agent of a foreign principal under FARA, which defines \"person\" broadly to include individuals, partnerships, corporations, and organizations. Identifying these agents involves assessing if they are acting on behalf of a foreign principal. The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) focuses on determining if a person is acting as an agent for a foreign principal. The definition of an agent under FARA is broad and does not necessarily require a formal contract. Financial support alone is not enough to establish a relationship subject to FARA. Courts have disagreed on the standard for establishing an agent-foreign principal relationship under FARA. The Third Circuit in 1945 applied a common law standard based on consent, while the Second Circuit in 1981 rejected this in favor of a standard considering the nature of the agency relationship intended for regulation under FARA. The Second Circuit emphasized that the key factor in determining the need for registration under FARA is whether a specific person has been asked to take a specific action on behalf of a foreign principal. Simply acting at the \"request\" of a foreign principal does not automatically establish an agency relationship. The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) requires registration if a specific action is requested by a foreign government, even if the individual is not yet acting as an agent. Compensation is not a factor in determining the need for registration under FARA. FARA requires registration for individuals or entities acting as agents of a foreign principal, regardless of compensation or threshold requirements. Agents must register if they engage in specified actions within the United States. Agents acting on behalf of a foreign principal in the United States must comply with the Foreign Agents Registration Act by engaging in political activities, representing the foreign principal before federal agencies, and soliciting or disbursing contributions. Congress has defined terms to establish the broad scope of activities requiring registration, including activities related to maintaining existing domestic or foreign policies. Routine inquiries to government officials are not considered political activities. DOJ has clarified that routine inquiries to government officials are not considered \"political activities\" under FARA if they do not involve questioning existing domestic or foreign policy. FARA requires registration for agents representing individuals or entities supervised or financed by a foreign principal. The definition of foreign principal includes foreign governments, political parties, non-U.S. citizens residing in the U.S., and entities based in foreign countries. FARA regulates the influence of foreign principals in the US, applying to agents of foreign private entities. It includes registration, disclosure, and recordkeeping requirements. Agents must register with the DOJ within 10 days of becoming an agent, providing information about themselves and their business. The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) requires agents of foreign private entities to register with the DOJ within 10 days of becoming an agent. The registration statement must include details about the agent's business, agreement with the foreign principal, income, and expenditures related to their activities. This includes providing names, contact information, nationality of the agent, descriptions of the agent's business, copies of agreements with foreign principals, income received, and expenditures made in connection with their activities. Agents of foreign principals covered by FARA must submit supplemental information at six-month intervals, with updates filed within 30 days. Retroactive registration under the Act has been reported. Any agent distributing \"informational materials\" must file copies with DOJ within 48 hours. FARA requires agents representing foreign principals to disclose distributed materials and include a statement identifying themselves as agents of a foreign principal when transmitting political propaganda or soliciting information from U.S. agencies. Agents must also maintain records of their activities and make them available for government inspection to ensure compliance. Certain categories of individuals or entities exempt from FARA include news organizations with at least 80% ownership stake by U.S. citizens. Failure to maintain required records under FARA is a violation, with agents required to keep records for three years after representation ends. To qualify for exemption under FARA, a news organization must have at least 80% ownership by U.S. citizens and have U.S. citizens as officers and directors. The organization cannot be influenced or financed by foreign entities. Foreign government officials may be exempt if they are acting within their official capacities and their government is recognized by the United States. To qualify for exemption under FARA, individuals and entities must engage in private and nonpolitical activities that further bona fide commercial interests of a foreign principal. Additionally, diplomatic and consular officers, as well as their staff, may be exempt if they are not acting as public-relations counsel, publicity agents, or information-service employees. Agents of foreign principals may be exempt from the registration requirement under FARA if they engage in activities that further bona fide interests in religion, academia, science, or the fine arts. The scope of these exemptions is unclear and lacks further definition in administrative guidance, leading to uncertainty among commentators. Additionally, agents representing foreign countries with defense interests vital to the United States are exempt from registration during their engagement. Individuals or entities engaged in activities that serve the joint interests of countries and do not conflict with U.S. policies may be exempt from FARA registration. This exemption applies to practicing attorneys representing foreign principals in legal proceedings but does not cover attempts to influence agency personnel outside of judicial proceedings. The court has examined the tension between FARA's disclosure requirement and attorney-client privilege, highlighting that the legal representation exemption likely protects confidential communications related to the representation. FARA includes an exemption for agents of certain foreign principals who register under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA). To qualify for this exemption, agents must represent foreign principals other than foreign governments or political parties, engage in lobbying activities under the LDA, and register under that statute. Failure to register under FARA is a violation of the law. Failure to comply with FARA, such as failure to register as a foreign agent or providing false information, can lead to civil and criminal penalties. Violations may result in fines up to $10,000 or imprisonment for up to five years. The Attorney General can also seek injunctive relief to stop violations. Destruction or concealment of agent records is illegal. Enforcement actions are at the discretion of the Attorney General, as there is no private right of action. In 2016, a report found that the DOJ lacked a comprehensive strategy for FARA enforcement. The 2016 report criticized the lack of enforcement actions by the DOJ under FARA and highlighted a decline in registrations. Proposed amendments in the 115th Congress include barring political appointees from representing foreign principals. The proposed amendments in the 115th Congress include expanding the disclosure requirement of FARA, requiring agents to provide additional information when filing distributed materials, and repealing the exemption for agents registering under the LDA. The proposed amendments in the 115th Congress include expanding the disclosure requirement of FARA, requiring agents to provide additional information when filing distributed materials, and repealing the exemption for agents representing foreign principals in the private sector under the LDA. H.R. 4170 / S. 2039 would align filing deadlines for FARA with the LDA and grant the Attorney General Civil Investigative Demand Authority. The proposed amendments in the 115th Congress aim to expand the disclosure requirements of FARA, authorize the Attorney General to compel production of documents for FARA investigations, enforce violations with civil fines, and expand reporting requirements to Congress. Under H.R. 2811 / S. 625, DOJ would report investigations of potential violations involving officers and directors of foreign principals, with referrals for prosecution. H.R. 4170 / S. 2039 mandates the Attorney General to develop a strategy to enhance FARA enforcement, subject to review by the Inspector General and Congress. The Comptroller General would assess FARA enforcement and administration within three years of the legislation's enactment."
