    "content": "The Pendleton Act of 1883, signed into law after President Garfield's assassination, established the merit system for government jobs to prevent the spoils system. This led to the revolving door phenomenon, where individuals move between public and private sectors for career opportunities and knowledge exchange. The revolving door phenomenon involves government employees moving between public and private sectors, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. While laws regulate this practice in the executive branch, data on the phenomenon is limited. This report analyzes the movement of executive branch personnel in the Bush and Obama Administrations. This report presents empirical data on the use of the revolving door by federal officials, focusing on those who were registered lobbyists before or after their government service. It includes an overview of existing laws and regulations, discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the revolving door, and analyzes data collected in partnership with the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University. The report also highlights select issues for potential congressional consideration. Revolving door provisions, including laws, regulations, and executive orders, govern the interaction between government and nongovernmental individuals. These conflict-of-interest laws have existed since the late 19th century, with the first provision enacted in 1872. Restrictions were placed on procurement officials leaving government service in 1919. Revolving door provisions, including laws, regulations, and executive orders, govern the interaction between government and nongovernmental individuals. Restrictions were placed on procurement officials leaving government service in 1919 to prevent them from soliciting employment or aiding in claims against the United States related to contracts they were involved in. The Contract Settlement Act of 1944 also made it unlawful for government employees to prosecute claims against the United States while in service or within two years after leaving. Since the 1960s, postemployment restriction laws have been amended multiple times to add \"cooling off\" periods for high-level executive branch personnel and limit postemployment advocacy activities. The laws were designed to protect government interests against former officials using proprietary information. The government has implemented postemployment restriction laws to protect against former officials using proprietary information and to prevent current officials from inappropriate dealings. These laws also aim to limit potential private arrangements for federal officials while still employed. The decision to adopt or amend revolving door and conflict-of-interest provisions has historically been balanced against the need to prevent the movement of individuals between the public and private sectors. The committee emphasized the importance of balancing the appearance of impropriety with the need to attract skilled government workers. Conflict of interest statutes aim to prevent public office from being used for personal gain and maintain public confidence in government integrity. It is crucial to avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest and favoritism while also attracting experienced individuals to public service. Overly stringent restrictions can hinder the government's objective of attracting qualified personnel. The revolving door between government and the private sector can impact the ability to attract skilled individuals to federal office. Past research suggests that individuals with industry experience may support regulated industries while in government. The potential benefits of transitioning individuals between sectors must be weighed against the risk of conflicts of interest. The revolving door between government and the private sector can lead to conflicts of interest. Studies show both positive and negative aspects of this relationship. Laws and regulations govern the movement of federal employees between sectors, but these provisions may not apply to all instances of employees leaving government service. The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) enforces postemployment restrictions to prevent former government employees from leveraging relationships for personal gain. These restrictions include a lifetime ban on switching sides on specific matters and a two-year ban on broader issues. The Office of Government Ethics enforces postemployment restrictions to prevent former government employees from leveraging relationships for personal gain. These restrictions include bans on \"switching sides\" on certain matters, assisting others on trade or treaty negotiations, and engaging in representational activities before their former departments or agencies. There are also cooling-off periods for senior and very senior officials, as well as a ban on certain officials performing activities for foreign governments or political parties. The Office of Government Ethics enforces postemployment restrictions to prevent former government employees from leveraging relationships for personal gain. These restrictions aim to protect against improper influence and limit potential influence on current federal officials. Revolving door restrictions apply to former officials moving to regulated industries, in addition to broader statutes like the Foreign Agents Registration Act and the Lobbying Disclosure Act. The Office of Government Ethics enforces postemployment restrictions to prevent former government employees from leveraging relationships for personal gain. These regulations require registration as a foreign agent or lobbyist and periodic disclosure of information about influence activities. OGE issues regulations for revolving door provisions, focusing on postemployment conflict-of-interest restrictions for executive branch employees. Additional agency regulations may supplement OGE's rules, such as guidance from the Office of Management and Budget on postemployment restrictions for all government employees. The Office of Government Ethics enforces postemployment restrictions to prevent former government employees from leveraging relationships for personal gain. OGE issues regulations for revolving door provisions, focusing on conflict-of-interest restrictions for executive branch employees. President Kennedy and subsequent Presidents issued executive orders to address postgovernment revolving door restrictions. Three Presidents - Clinton, Obama, and Trump - issued executive orders with additional revolving door restrictions for certain Administration appointees. These orders included ethics pledges with conflict-of-interest requirements for personnel entering and leaving the government, extended revolving door provisions, and imposed restrictions on lobbyists entering or leaving government. Clinton and Trump also included restrictions on former appointees representing foreign principals. For more details, refer to CRS Report R44974. The discussion on revolving door restrictions in government focuses on conflicts of interest when former employees switch jobs. While legislation often views this trend negatively, there are potential benefits such as attracting high-quality candidates for government positions. Close relationships with government officials are important, but not always driven by post-employment activities. Some argue that the promise of private-sector employment can improve candidate quality. Critics of the revolving door between the public and private sectors advocate for longer \"cooling off\" periods and stronger conflict of interest restrictions. They believe this movement of employees can lead to bias, transparency issues, and inefficiency in government. The revolving door between the public and private sectors raises concerns about conflicts of interest and bias. Studies show that lobbying revenues are often driven by former government employees. Movement between government and private sectors occurs in various industries, potentially leading to conflicts of interest. Data on executive branch employees transitioning between sectors is challenging to compile. In partnership with graduate students at the Bush School of Government, CRS collected and analyzed data on former executive branch officials listed in the Plum Book, which includes over 7,000 Federal civil service leadership positions subject to noncompetitive appointment. This report focuses on individuals who have worked in these political appointments within the executive branch. The Plum Book is a snapshot of executive branch appointees published every four years. Data from four Plum Books were used to create a dataset of 6,665 federal appointees from the George W. Bush and Barack Obama Administrations. The dataset includes appointees from 15 Cabinet departments at the GS-13 pay level or higher. Appointees who served in multiple Administrations are only counted once, and those who left before the Plum Book's publication are not included. The dataset includes appointees from 15 Cabinet departments at the GS-13 pay level or higher. The report uses Lobbying Disclosure Act data to study the revolving door phenomenon among former executive branch officials. The LDA database includes registration and disclosure statements for lobbyists. The Plum Book provides names of former executive branch officials. The LDA database was searched to match individuals registered as lobbyists before or after government service. Approximately 8% of Bush and Obama Administration appointees were registered as lobbyists. Of those, 36.5% registered before joining the government, 55.1% registered after leaving, and 8.3% registered both before and after. Overall, most high-level federal appointees in the Bush and Obama Administrations were not employed as lobbyists before or after their government service. The Obama Administration had more appointees registered as lobbyists before their government service, while the Bush Administration had more registered lobbyists after their government service. During the Bush Administration, there were 340 registered lobbyists in the dataset, higher than the 166 in the Obama Administration. President Obama implemented restrictions on lobbyists entering his Administration, unlike the Bush Administration. The number of lobbyists entering government was higher in Obama's second term. The dataset collected by the Bush School of Government and Public Service and CRS shows that the number of registered lobbyists is lower in the Obama Administration compared to the Bush Administration. Cabinet departments varied in the percentage of officials who were registered lobbyists before or after their government service. The Department of Commerce had the highest percentage at 18%, while the Department of Justice had the lowest at 1%. Other agencies ranged between 2% and 17%. The dataset collected by the Bush School of Government and Public Service and CRS shows that Cabinet department officials have varying percentages of registered lobbyists, ranging from 2% to 17%. This raises questions about the connections between government agencies and regulated industries, such as the impact of lobbyists on government-industry relationships and the revolving door between government and lobbying. Figure 2 illustrates the percentage of LDA-registered officials at different agencies over time. Figure 2 displays the percentage of LDA-registered officials at various agencies before, after, or both before and after their government service. Each Cabinet department had officials listed in the Plum Book who registered as lobbyists. The percentage of registered lobbyists varied across departments, with different mixes of officials registering before, after, or both before and after their government service. The percentage of registered lobbyists before government service ranged from 10% to 61% across different agencies. The percentage of lobbyists who worked at different agencies before their government service varied, ranging from 10% to 61%. After their government service, the percentage of registered lobbyists ranged from 39% to 82%. Most departments had individuals who were lobbyists both before and after their government service, except for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Movement between the public and private sectors is common in every Administration, with recent focus on potential restrictions. In recent years, there has been a focus on potential additional restrictions for individuals entering and exiting government, including legislation to amend revolving door restrictions and executive orders to increase the \"cooling off\" period for appointees. Current law has different postemployment restrictions for various types of government employees, such as those engaged in contracting versus nonprocurement or noncontracting roles. This complexity is necessary due to the size and structure of Executive departments. Legislation has been proposed to extend \"cooling off\" periods for government officials, potentially up to a lifetime ban. This could reduce interactions between former officials and government agencies, prevent favoritism in lobbying, and stop financial benefits from confidential information. Extending or eliminating the \"cooling off\" period for government officials could impact post-employment rights and increase the talent pool. Codifying ethics pledges may make changes permanent and improve enforcement of revolving door provisions. Consolidating the administration and enforcement of conflict of interest and revolving door provisions could streamline compliance efforts. This consolidation may add an extra layer to document collection and evaluation processes. Each agency currently collects financial disclosure forms from employees, which would still need to be transmitted to a central location for enforcement. Ethics enforcement, including financial disclosure form reviews for conflicts of interest, is typically done at the agency level. Congress may decide to maintain current revolving door laws or make changes through executive branch regulations as needed."
