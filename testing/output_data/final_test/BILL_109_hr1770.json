    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. REQUIRING CERTAIN EMPLOYERS TO PARTICIPATE IN PILOT PROGRAM.\" is a condensed summary of a section that mandates specific employers to take part in a pilot program. The text chunk discusses an amendment to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, requiring certain employers at critical infrastructure sites to participate in a pilot program. The text chunk outlines regulations for employers at critical infrastructure sites to determine their eligibility for a pilot program. The Secretary of Homeland Security will issue regulations to assist employers in this process. Employers hiring aliens for critical infrastructure must not allow access if notified of nonconfirmation by the Commissioner of Social Security. Employers must not fail to notify any entity issuing documentation authorizing alien access if they receive notification of nonconfirmation by the Commissioner of Social Security. Violation of this rule is treated as a violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The text discusses the requirements for employers to verify the status of aliens for compliance with immigration laws. It mentions the procedures for investigating and enforcing compliance, including the verification of an alien's status to determine if they are unauthorized. The amendment to section 274A(h)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act requires employers to verify employment eligibility. The effective date of this amendment is one year after the enactment of the Act. AUTHORIZING ADDITIONAL USES OF EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY CONFIRMATION SYSTEM. Section 404(h) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 is amended to restrict the use of employment eligibility confirmation system for specific purposes, including enforcement of immigration laws, Social Security Act, and protection of critical infrastructure. The Secretary of Homeland Security may authorize or require entities responsible for critical infrastructure to use the confirmation system to verify citizenship or immigration status for protection purposes. Enforcement procedures for non-compliance with infrastructure protection requirements include treating failures as violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act."
