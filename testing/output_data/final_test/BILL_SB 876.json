    "title": "SB 876",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature finds that in 2014, 115,738 people were estimated to be homeless in California, following an economic recession and a shortage of safe housing. Additionally, 284,086 schoolchildren experienced homelessness in the 2013-14 school year. Homelessness in California is a significant issue, with local ordinances making it illegal to rest or receive nourishment in public spaces. Being homeless is an independent risk factor for various illnesses, leading to increased health problems and premature death for chronically homeless individuals. Passing this act will not reduce homelessness, but neither will local ordinances that criminalize homelessness. Criminalization policies further marginalize individuals experiencing homelessness, fuel inflammatory attitudes, and may unduly restrict constitutionally protected liberties. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Justice took steps in 2015 to address the criminalization of homelessness, awarding additional points for reducing criminalization in funding competitions and opposing it in court as cruel and a violation of constitutional rights. Sleep deprivation among homeless individuals is a significant issue, leading to various health problems. Ordinances disproportionately affect the homeless population, depriving them of a safe place to rest and seek nourishment, impacting their well-being. Homeless individuals often lack adequate legal representation, leading to denial of relief or damages in court. The federal government and the United Nations recognize that discrimination and criminalization violate homeless people's human rights. Homelessness and discrimination against the homeless are widespread in California. The California Constitution guarantees inalienable rights to all individuals, including the right to life, liberty, and property without discrimination based on homelessness. The California Legislature aims to protect the rights of all Californians, regardless of housing status, and address the adverse effects of criminalizing homelessness. Decriminalization of rest allows resources to be redirected towards tackling the root causes of homelessness and poverty. Part 2.2 is added to the Civil Code to define terms related to homeless persons. \"Part 2.2 defines 'homeless persons' as individuals lacking fixed nighttime residence. 'Public space' includes government-owned areas open to the public. Resting in public spaces is not allowed when closed or requiring a fee.\" Persons experiencing homelessness are allowed to use public space for resting without discrimination based on their housing status. This includes free movement without restraint and sleeping or resting in a nonobstructive manner to protect themselves from the elements. The intent is to broadly interpret this section to prohibit discriminatory policies or practices. Persons experiencing homelessness are allowed to use public space for resting without discrimination based on their housing status. This includes activities like eating, praying, and practicing religion. Law enforcement can still enforce laws to protect sidewalk use under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Penal Code, except for prohibiting rest in public spaces. Violations of rights can be enforced through civil action. The court can award various forms of relief to a prevailing plaintiff, including damages, attorney's fees, and costs. Additionally, a new section is added to the Government Code regarding these provisions. Section 11139.2 of the Government Code is added to address discrimination based on housing status and violations of housing laws. Applicants for the HUD's Continuum of Care Homeless Assistance Program must provide their application to the Department of Housing and Community Development, including steps taken to reduce criminalization of homelessness. The Department of Housing and Community Development will compile information on community actions to reduce criminalization of homelessness and provide an annual report to specified committees. Reimbursement for costs mandated by the state will be made to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
