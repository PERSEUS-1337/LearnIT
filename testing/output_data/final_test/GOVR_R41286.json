    "content": "The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security is responsible for preventing terrorists from entering the US and enforcing immigration laws. U.S. Customs and Border Protection secures the borders and enforces trade and immigration laws. The U.S. Border Patrol detects and prevents illegal entry across borders. The Department of Defense provides support to DHS and other law enforcement agencies when requested. Since the 1980s, the Department of Defense, including the National Guard, has conducted various counterdrug support missions along the US borders. While not responsible for stopping terrorists at the borders, DOD's role in counterdrug and counterterrorism efforts has increased its profile in border security. In 2006, President George W. Bush deployed up to 6,000 National Guard troops to support Border Patrol in enforcing federal immigration laws, with over 30,000 individuals participating in \"Operation Jump Start\" providing various types of support. Operation Jump Start, which involved deploying National Guard troops to support Border Patrol in enforcing federal immigration laws, officially concluded on July 15, 2008. Despite this, illegal drug activities and crime persist along the border, leading to calls for increased security. Following the conclusion of Operation Jump Start in 2008, calls for increased border security persisted. California, New Mexico, and Texas requested a new federal border mission similar to Operation Jump Start. Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico ordered the National Guard to patrol the border for safety. Governor Jan Brewer of Arizona requested federal troops but cited financial constraints. President Obama announced the deployment of up to 1,200 National Guard troops to support Border Patrol in May 2010. Members of Congress also called for National Guard deployment to combat illegal activities along the southern border. President Obama announced the deployment of National Guard troops to assist in border protection and law enforcement activities targeting illicit networks trafficking in people, drugs, illegal weapons, and money. The troops will also support intelligence work, drug and human trafficking interdiction, and relieve border guards for more law enforcement tasks. The Department of Defense and Homeland Security briefed Congress on reducing troops at the border from 1,200 to 300 for aerial surveillance. Military lacks direct mandate for border patrol but can support law enforcement agencies in counterdrug and counterterrorism efforts. Military personnel are drawn from active, reserve forces, and National Guard for these operations. The Posse Comitatus Act restricts military participation in civilian law enforcement activities, prohibiting the use of Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps for executing domestic laws unless authorized by the Constitution or Congress. DOD Directive 5525.5 outlines policies for supporting law enforcement agencies, prohibiting direct assistance in certain activities. The Posse Comitatus Act restricts military involvement in civilian law enforcement, prohibiting activities like interdiction, search and seizure, and arrests. National Guard regulations also limit direct participation in law enforcement, except in specific circumstances. The PCA does not apply in cases authorized by the Constitution or Congress. The Constitution does not explicitly authorize the President to use the military to enforce laws, leaving the question of implied powers unanswered. However, DOD regulations cite exceptions for sudden emergencies and protection of federal property. The PCA does not apply when Congress authorizes military involvement in law enforcement, which can be done through civilian law enforcement authority, specific legislation, or general rules for assistance. Military support for border security and immigration control falls under these provisions. The military supports border security and immigration control efforts through legislation allowing them to assist federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. Congress has periodically expanded the military's role in providing support to law enforcement since the 1980s. The basic authority for Department of Defense (DOD) assistance was established in 1981 under Chapter 18 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which authorizes sharing information, loaning equipment, providing expert advice and training, and maintaining and operating equipment for federal law enforcement agencies. DOD personnel can also assist in counterterrorism operations, counterdrug laws enforcement, immigration laws enforcement, and customs enforcement. The military can provide assistance to civilian law enforcement agencies for various purposes, including aerial reconnaissance and monitoring of air and sea traffic. Congress has placed stipulations on this assistance, requiring reimbursement unless it is provided in the normal course of military training or operations. Assistance must not adversely affect the military preparedness of the United States. In 1989, Congress expanded the military's support role by directing DOD to conduct training exercises in drug-interdiction areas and making DOD the lead agency for detecting illegal drug transit. Additional authorities were provided for military support to LEAs for counterdrug purposes in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1991. Section 1004 authorized DOD to provide support to federal, state, and local LEAs for counterdrug assistance, including maintaining, upgrading, and repairing military equipment. Section 1004 authorizes the military to maintain, upgrade, and repair military equipment; transport law enforcement personnel and equipment; establish bases for operations or training; train law enforcement personnel in counterdrug activities; detect, monitor, and communicate movements of traffic; construct border infrastructure; provide linguists and intelligence analysis services; conduct reconnaissance; and establish communication networks for improved integration of activities. The National Guard, consisting of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, is a military force shared by states and the federal government. They assist in counterdrug and counterterrorism efforts and are organized, armed, and equipped at federal expense. When in federal status, they are known as the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States, serving as reserve components of the Army and Air Force. The National Guard, including the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, operates as state or territorial organizations most of the time. Members can be called to active duty in federal or state status, with different levels of control and benefits. They typically operate under state governors' control, but can also be under federal control with federal pay and benefits. Some states seek federal funding for National Guard activities, which operate under Title 32 of the U.S. Code. This allows for federal pay and benefits while maintaining command under the governor. For example, National Guard troops deployed for Operation Jump Start were under 32 U.S.C. Section 502(a) authority. Federal funding can also support drug interdiction programs under 32 U.S.C. Section 112. The Secretary of Defense may grant funding to states for drug interdiction and counterdrug activities under 32 U.S.C. Section 112. Arizona's plan includes border security measures approved by the Secretary of Defense. The Joint Counter Narcotics Task Force (JCNTF) in Arizona requests federal funding for National Guard personnel to address the negative impacts of illegal drug trade and immigration on the southwestern border states. Section 502(f) of Title 32 allows National Guard members to be ordered for additional duties with federal pay and benefits. This provision was used for airport security after 9/11 and disaster relief operations. In 2004, Congress passed a law potentially providing federal funding for National Guard personnel in border security operations under Title 32. The Secretary of Defense can provide federal funding for National Guard personnel for border security operations under Title 32 if deemed necessary for homeland defense activities. The definition of a \"homeland defense activity\" includes military protection against threats or aggression towards the United States, but it remains unclear if border security falls under this category. The Secretary of Defense can provide federal funding for National Guard personnel for border security operations under Title 32 if deemed necessary for homeland defense activities, which includes military protection against threats or aggression towards the United States. The type of threat or aggression that would be necessary and appropriate for National Guard troops is unclear."
