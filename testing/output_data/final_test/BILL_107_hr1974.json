    "content": "The Act titled \"Western States Energy Consumer Protection Act of 2001\" aims to address the dysfunctional energy market in California by promoting the use of long-term contracts over spot market purchases. It also emphasizes the importance of not creating a statewide power authority. The Act defines key terms such as Commission, public utility, wholesale electric utility, western energy market, and spot market. The curr_chunk defines \"market\" as the market for electric energy to be delivered within the next 24-hour period, and \"re-marketer\" as any person who purchases electric energy at wholesale for resale at wholesale. The curr_chunk focuses on the establishment of a Market Monitoring and Mitigation Plan. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will expand the market monitoring and mitigation plan to the WSCC region for all public utility sales of electric energy in interstate commerce. The plan will be based on competitive bids to ensure competitive pricing and will apply to all sales in the spot market at all times. The market mitigation plan will not apply to wholesale electric energy sales in states that prohibit passing costs to retail consumers or impose price limits on retail sales, hindering payments to entities in the western energy market. The Secretary of Energy has the authority to terminate the market mitigation plan if it negatively impacts the supply or demand for electric energy in the Western States Coordinating Council. Nonjurisdictional utilities are encouraged to comply with the plan, and the requirements of this section will end on September 30, 2002. SEC. 5. NATURAL GAS RATES. Inapplicability of Waiver of Maximum Rate Ceiling Provision to Transportation of Natural Gas Into California. Effective for new contracts, the waiver provision does not apply to gas transportation into California. Disclosure of Commodity and Transportation Costs in Bundled Gas Transactions. Defines bundled transactions and requires disclosure of costs under the Natural Gas Act. The Natural Gas Act requires sellers transporting natural gas into California to disclose the sale price breakdown for gas and transportation costs within a specified timeframe. SEC. 6. No orders to sell gas or electricity without reasonable assurance of payment. The Secretary of Energy and the Commission are prohibited from issuing orders that require sellers of electric energy or natural gas in the western region to sell without reasonable assurance of payment. This assurance includes the full purchase price being paid on time as agreed upon by the buyer and seller, or a fair and equitable price determined by the President if no agreement is reached. The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and the Federal Power Act allow for the determination of just and reasonable prices for electric energy by the Secretary of Energy or the Commission. SEC. 7. REQUIREMENT TO MEET IN-STATE DEMAND. A State public utility commission in the western energy market may prohibit a utility from selling electric energy outside its service area if it would impair meeting in-state demand. SEC. 8. WHOLESALE RATE REFUND AUTHORITY. Section 206(b) of the Federal Power Act is amended to change the timeline for filing complaints and initiating proceedings by the Commission. Amendments to Section 206(b) of the Federal Power Act include changing the timeline for filing complaints and initiating proceedings by the Commission. The amendment also includes adjustments to the refund effective date and the addition of penalties deemed appropriate by the Commission. Within 180 days of this Act's enactment, the Commission will study ways to improve oversight of scheduled outages at powerplants and submit a report to Congress. The Act does not impact energy production not online before enactment, contracts for electric energy purchase (except spot market purchases), states appearing in Federal court for alleged Federal Power Act violations, or state regulatory authority to regulate rates for electric energy sale. The Act does not affect energy production already online, contracts for electric energy purchase (except spot market purchases), or state regulatory authority to regulate rates for electric energy sale. The authority to determine wholesale rates passed through to consumers is included, such as setting tiered pricing, real-time pricing, and baseline rates."
