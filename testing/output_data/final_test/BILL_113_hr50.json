    "content": "The \"Streamlined and Improved Methods at Polling Locations and Early (SIMPLE) Voting Act of 2013\" establishes minimum requirements for early voting and reducing waiting times for voters in federal elections. It amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to include new sections on early voting. The \"Streamlined and Improved Methods at Polling Locations and Early (SIMPLE) Voting Act of 2013\" mandates that each State must allow individuals to vote in a Federal election during the 15-day period before the election day, with a minimum of 10 hours of voting each day at polling places near public transportation. The \"Streamlined and Improved Methods at Polling Locations and Early (SIMPLE) Voting Act of 2013\" requires standards for the administration of voting prior to Federal elections, including the geographic placement of polling places. States can deviate from these standards in unforeseen circumstances. Effective from January 1, 2014. SEC. 305. PREVENTING UNREASONABLE WAITING TIMES FOR VOTERS. SEC. 305 requires each State to provide enough voting systems, poll workers, and resources at polling places to ensure fair waiting times for voters, with a maximum wait time of one hour. Factors like the number of voters and resources must be considered in determining the necessary provisions. Factors to consider when determining voting provisions include the voting age population, voter turnout in past elections, number of registered voters, new voter registrations, census data for the population served, needs of voters with disabilities and limited English proficiency, type of voting systems used, and ballot complexity. The Commission will establish guidelines for States to meet voting place requirements, without allowing closure or voter suppression. Each State must develop and implement a contingency plan to provide additional resources to polling places with long wait times on election day, approved by the Commission. The Commission may establish procedures for individuals involved in elections. This section applies to elections from January 1, 2014 onwards. Amendments are made to the table of contents of the Act. The Election Assistance Commission must submit a report to Congress every odd-numbered year assessing the impact of early voting and preventing waiting times on federal elections. States are not prohibited from offering longer early voting periods for federal elections. The Election Assistance Commission can provide longer early voting periods and more election resources at polling places than the minimum required by law. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS FOR COUNTING PROVISIONAL BALLOTS; ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIFORM AND NONDISCRIMINATORY STANDARDS. Section 302 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 is amended to include statewide counting of provisional ballots and uniform, nondiscriminatory standards for elections. Provisional ballots must be counted regardless of the precinct or polling place, effective for elections from January 1, 2014 onwards. Each State must establish uniform and nondiscriminatory standards for provisional ballots, effective for elections from January 1, 2014 onwards. A conforming amendment specifies exceptions to this requirement in certain subsections. SEC. 4. Availability of civil penalties and private rights of action to enforce Help America Vote Act of 2002. Amendment to Section 401 regarding enforcement. The Attorney General can take legal action against a State for violating subtitle A of title III, with the possibility of imposing a civil penalty of up to $110,000 for each violation. The Attorney General can impose a civil penalty of up to $220,000 for each violation of subtitle A of title III. A person aggrieved by a violation can intervene in the action and obtain appropriate relief, along with costs and attorney fees. The Attorney General must submit an annual report to Congress on civil actions brought under this provision. A person aggrieved by a State or jurisdiction's violation of subtitle A of title III may bring a civil action in a United States District Court for necessary relief. The court may award costs and attorney fees to the prevailing party. The table of contents of the Act is amended accordingly. Enforcement of violations alleged to have occurred on or after the enactment date of this Act."
