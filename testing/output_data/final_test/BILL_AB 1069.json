    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 150204 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to allow counties in California to establish a repository and distribution program for medication. Only eligible entities can participate in this program to dispense donated medication. An eligible entity must notify the county health department and the California State Board of Pharmacy in writing of its intent to participate in the medication donation program. Participation is contingent upon receiving confirmation from the county health department. Participating entities must report the source of all donated medication quarterly to the county health department. (A) A participating primary care clinic must disclose the name of the licensed physician accountable to the California State Board of Pharmacy for program operations. The county board of supervisors or public health officer must provide this information to the Board upon request. The county board of supervisors, public health officer, and California State Board of Pharmacy have the authority to prohibit entities from participating in the program if they do not comply. Written notice must be provided within 15 days. Counties establishing a repository program must have written procedures in place. The program aims to establish eligibility for medically indigent patients, provide medications free of charge, develop a formulary, ensure safety and management of collected medications, and maintain privacy. Donated medications must meet specific criteria, including not being controlled substances. The medication must meet specific criteria: it cannot be a controlled substance, must not be adulterated or misbranded, and must have been stored properly. Additionally, it should not have been in the possession of a patient or the public, and if donated by a health facility, it must have been under the control of a licensed staff member. Only medication donated in unopened, tamper-evident packaging meeting USP standards is eligible for donation to the repository and distribution program. Opened containers are not dispensed and must be handled according to the Medical Waste Management Act. Medication subject to FDA risk evaluation strategies or requiring manufacturer authorization cannot be donated. The donation of medication subject to FDA risk evaluation strategies must be managed according to specific requirements. Pharmacists and physicians must use professional judgment to determine if donated medication meets standards before dispensing. Medications donated to the program can be dispensed to eligible patients, destroyed, or returned to a licensed waste hauler. Medication donated under this division can be dispensed to eligible patients, destroyed, or returned to a reverse distributor or licensed waste hauler. Transfers between participating entities within the county are allowed, with restrictions on multiple transfers. Medication transferred must be documented with drug details and origin, and cannot be transferred again. Copies of the documentation must be kept by both the transferring and receiving entities. Donated medication that does not meet requirements shall not be distributed, sold, or transferred. Medication in the program must be in donated packaging until dispensed to an eligible patient with a valid prescription. Expired medication cannot be dispensed. The pharmacy operating the repository program can repackage donated medicine for dispensing, with repackaging policies in place. Donated medication must be segregated from other drug stock. A participating entity in the repository program must maintain separate records for donated medication transactions, following Pharmacy Law guidelines. Local protocols must also adhere to Pharmacy Law for handling medications. County protocols for handling refrigerated medications must comply with USP standards and Pharmacy Law. Participating entities must follow procedural drug pedigree requirements for donated drugs as they would for purchased drugs."
