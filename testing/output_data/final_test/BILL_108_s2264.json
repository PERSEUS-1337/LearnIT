The Act titled the \"Northern Uganda Crisis Response Act\" includes findings about the strong bilateral relationship between the United States and Uganda, the conflict with the Lord's Resistance Army, and the brutal tactics used by the Army. The Lord's Resistance Army has been designated as a terrorist organization and placed on the Terrorist Exclusion list. The conflict in Uganda has displaced over 1,000,000 people, leading to a lack of security and causing more than 18,000 children to become \"night commuters\" seeking safety in town centers. In northern Uganda, displaced children face exploitation and abuse, with high mortality rates due to malnutrition. Humanitarian organizations report increased violence, including child abductions. The government's military efforts have not ensured civilian security, hindering organizations' ability to operate effectively. The conflict in northern Uganda has hindered organizations from providing humanitarian assistance to displaced individuals. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is to support peaceful resolution efforts in northern and eastern Uganda, provide resources for relief and development, urge protection of civilians and economic development, and prioritize security, economic development, and humanitarian assistance in Uganda. The international community, along with the Government of Uganda and civil society, should develop a plan for displaced individuals to return home or become economically productive. Efforts should be made to stop the abduction of children and the use of child soldiers in Uganda. Resources should be increased for assistance to those affected by the conflict, and support should be provided for demobilization efforts. The international community should support the demobilization and reintegration of rebel combatants and abductees in Uganda, cooperate with civil society organizations, urge the Ugandan government to improve military professionalism and human rights accountability, and assist in monitoring and raising awareness of human rights abuses in northern Uganda. The text chunk urges the Government of Uganda to allow international human rights monitors in northern and eastern Uganda, monitor civilian militia forces, and emphasize that the relationship between Sudan and the US cannot improve if Sudan is supporting the Lord's Resistance Army. The text chunk emphasizes the need for international human rights monitors in northern and eastern Uganda to monitor civilian militia forces and highlights the importance of Sudan not supporting the Lord's Resistance Army for the relationship between Sudan and the US to improve. The Secretary of State must submit a report on the conflict in Uganda within 6 months, detailing support for the Lord's Resistance Army, obstacles to humanitarian aid, and the protection of civilians by the Ugandan People's Defense Forces.

The report will be submitted in unclassified form, with a possible classified annex, to the appropriate congressional committees. The report will be submitted to the appropriate congressional committees on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
