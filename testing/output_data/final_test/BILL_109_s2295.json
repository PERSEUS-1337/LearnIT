    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hawaiian Waters Chemical Munitions Safety Act of 2006\". Congress finds that until 1970, the US Armed Forces dumped military chemical munitions in ocean waters, including cyanogen chloride bombs, hydrogen cyanide bombs, mustard gas bombs, and mortar shells near the Hawaiian Islands. The US Armed Forces dumped various chemical munitions in ocean waters, including mustard gas, lewisite agent, hydrogen cyanide, and bombs off the coasts of multiple states. Concerns about the long-term effects on the environment and public health have arisen, especially in Hawaii. The dumping of chemical munitions in the ocean is now prohibited by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972. The United States is a signatory of the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. SEC. 3. RESPONSE TO DISPOSAL OF CHEMICAL MUNITIONS WITHIN HAWAIIAN WATERS. The Secretary of the Army will conduct a survey of underwater disposal sites near the Hawaiian Islands to identify chemical munitions disposed of between 1941 and 1972. The survey aims to characterize the sites, types of munitions, and their condition, with a report due to Congress by September 30, 2009. Additionally, the Army will work with the Secretary of Commerce to address navigational hazards. The Army will cooperate with the Secretary of Commerce to ensure that nautical charts for Hawaiian coastal waters include hazards to private activities and commercial shipping. Within one year of the survey completion, the Army will monitor potential release of hazardous chemical agents into the marine environment from disposal sites, including sampling and testing for contamination. The Secretary of the Army will establish a research program to study the long-term effects of seawater exposure on chemical munitions and potential public health risks associated with ocean disposal. Additionally, a report analyzing the feasibility of implementing multiple remediation measures at disposal sites will be submitted to Congress within one year. The feasibility analysis for implementing remediation measures at disposal sites will consider cost estimates, public health, and environmental safety risks. Special considerations include the cost and risks associated with remediation measures. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the Act."
