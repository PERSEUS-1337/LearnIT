    "content": "In September 2012, an investigation began into a rare outbreak of fungal meningitis linked to contaminated injections from the New England Compounding Center. By June 2013, 745 infections and 58 deaths were reported across 20 states. NECC, a compounding pharmacy, produced drugs without individual prescriptions, leading to serious adverse events and congressional hearings. Serious adverse events related to compounded drugs (CDs) led to six congressional hearings in 2012-2013 to address safety concerns and prevent future incidents. The hearings focused on understanding CDs, their production, role in healthcare, oversight, safety, and prevention of adverse events. This report provides background information on CDs and compounding pharmacies to inform policy discussions for potential legislation. This report focuses on background information on compounded drugs (CDs) and compounding pharmacies, changes in the role of CDs in healthcare delivery, factors leading to an increase in compounding, safety concerns of CDs, and policy issues raised. It includes information on federal, state, and professional efforts to increase CD safety, tied to regulation and oversight. Compounding is the process where pharmacists or physicians mix ingredients to create personalized medications for patients. Compounded drugs provide alternatives when commercially-manufactured drugs do not meet a patient's unique needs. Shortages of sterile generic drugs and hospital outsourcing have led to increased reliance on compounding drugs. Some suggest expanding the definition of compounding to include large-scale production to address drug shortages, meet hospital outsourcing needs, and supply physician-administered drugs. This non-traditional compounding may involve producing drugs in large volumes across state lines, creating copies of FDA-approved drugs, producing drugs without a personal patient relationship or prescription, and supplying products to third parties like hospitals and clinics. The 2012 fungal meningitis outbreak was triggered by contaminated sterile compounded drugs, specifically injectable methylprednisolone, leading to the worst recorded adverse event involving compounded drugs. Up to 14,000 individuals were exposed to the contaminated product, highlighting the serious health risks posed by such incidents. The safety of compounded drugs has been a concern for Congress due to potential risks such as potency, purity, and contamination. FDA surveys in 2001 and 2006 found that one-third of compounded drugs failed analytic testing, mostly due to potency issues. This failure rate was higher than that of commercially-available drugs. The safety of compounded drugs has raised concerns due to potency, purity, and contamination issues. While federal and state requirements do not mandate testing for potency, purity, and sterility, some compounders voluntarily conduct such tests. State pharmacy boards have identified safety issues with compounded drugs, with some states testing a percentage of them. For example, the State of Missouri Board of Pharmacy found that 15% - 25% of compounded drugs had potency problems, ranging from sub-potent to super-potent, posing risks of harm to patients. The lack of resources for testing compounded drugs poses risks of harm to patients due to inaccurate dosages. Concerns about potency, purity, and contamination have been ongoing for almost two decades, with reports of sub-potent, super-potent, and contaminated products. Despite some states conducting testing, there is no federal requirement for producers to report adverse events, making the actual number of individuals harmed by compounded drugs unknown. Table C-1 provides a compilation of adverse events involving compounded medical products, including CDs. These events include details such as the date, states affected, number of people affected, mortality, drug involved, and condition treated. Most incidents involve sterile compounded products like injectable drugs and IV-delivered drugs. The information is selective as there is no federal requirement for reporting adverse events with CDs, so it cannot be used to determine overall risks. Reports of incidents that do not result in adverse events are not included in the table. The 2012 fungal meningitis outbreak caused by compounded generic preservative-free methylprednisolone led to increased scrutiny of sterile compounded drugs by federal and state authorities. In 2013, inspections revealed safety concerns at certain facilities producing sterile compounded drugs, resulting in some compounders issuing product recalls due to sterility concerns. In 2013, safety concerns at non-traditional compounding pharmacies led to recalls of contaminated sterile injectables. Traditional compounding involves tailoring medications to individual patient needs. This process provides personalized drugs with different formulations, doses, and ingredients. The benefits of traditional compounding include providing individualized drugs when commercially-produced drugs do not meet the health requirements of a patient and maintaining access to certain prescription drugs not commercially available. The number of compounded drugs made is unknown due to lack of public information, with no federal reporting requirement for compounding activities. Estimates suggest 1-5% of all prescriptions filled annually are for compounded drugs, but the accuracy of this information is uncertain. The lack of publicly available information on the types and scope of compounded drugs presents challenges for public health authorities and policy makers. Compounding is part of standard pharmacy practice and is within the scope of state licensure for pharmacists and pharmacies. The number of pharmacists regularly engaged in compounding is difficult to evaluate. The majority of compounded prescriptions are filled by a small number of pharmacies. According to various sources, there are differing estimates on the number of pharmacies specializing in compounding in the United States. Janet Woodcock from the FDA mentioned 28,000 pharmacies nationwide, while the American Pharmacists Association reports 7,500 pharmacies specializing in compounding. The International Academy of Compounding Pharmacies has 2,700 members, and as of January 2013, there were 163 accredited pharmacies by the Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board. Publicly available information on specific compounded drugs can be found on compounding pharmacies' websites. Compounded drugs include products for pain management, hormone replacement therapies, men's and women's health, sports medicine, weight-loss, dental care, veterinary care, pediatric patients, and hospice care. Some products are advertised for Autism/ADHD, \"adrenal fatigue,\" or fat-elimination, with questions raised by the FDA. Some pharmacies engage in non-traditional compounding activities. Non-traditional compounders produce a variety of products, including sterile injectables like epidurals, nerve-blocking agents, and antibiotics. Some compounders have a large customer base, with examples like PharMedium having 2,300 hospital customers. NECC, involved in a fungal meningitis outbreak, had over 20,000 customers listed on the FDA website. The FDA website listed NECC as having over 20,000 customers, including physicians, clinics, and hospitals. Questions have arisen about federal regulation of compounding practices through the FFDCA, which grants federal authority over compounding. Litigation over Section 503A's advertising provisions has raised doubts about the legal effect of FDAMA's compounding provisions. The federal authority to regulate drug compounding under FDAMA remains uncertain, with courts agreeing that the FDA can regulate non-traditional compounding activities resembling manufacturing. However, there is ambiguity in distinguishing traditional compounding practices from manufacturing-like behaviors, leading to uncertainty in the FDA's regulatory limits. The FDA has generally deferred to state governments for regulating traditional compounding practices, which are typically overseen by state boards of pharmacy. States have been updating laws and regulations for compounding pharmacies, with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacies tracking these changes. State boards of pharmacy evaluate pharmacists and pharmacies on compounding practices, with some states requiring all licensed pharmacies to offer compounding services. Some states permit pharmacists to compound drugs with a valid prescription, while others require a special license for compounding sterile medications. Certain states also license separate pharmacy facilities for producing drugs for pharmacies or other providers. Additionally, some states allow pharmacies to make exact copies of commercial products in response to discontinued products or drug shortages. Pharmacists can participate in a voluntary accreditation process for compounding established by professional pharmacy organizations and the USP. USP Standard 797 includes standards for facilities, procedures, and staff to produce safe sterile drugs. Some pharmacies and compounders may not adhere to USP standards for compounding, which are voluntary unless required by state law. 20 states mandate full adherence to USP Standard 797 for compounding. USP standards are not suitable for large-scale production of compounded drugs, as commercial production is governed by cGMP required by the FFDCA. The demand for compounded products like CDs is increasing due to factors such as hospital outsourcing, drug shortages, and discontinuation of FDA-approved drugs. The FDA inspected 39 non-traditional compounding facilities in 2013, including centralized compounding facilities that provide outsourcing services to pharmacies and hospitals. Some states permit consolidated services like \"shared services\" in compounding pharmacies. Some states allow consolidated services in compounding pharmacies, such as central fill IV pharmacies. Hospitals also compound drugs, IV solutions, and IV nutrition, especially for specialized dosages or products not commercially available. Hospital-based compounding is growing due to the use of weight-based dosing and personalized treatments. The trend in healthcare is towards hospital consolidation and centralized production, including the production of CDs. The Cleveland Clinic Health System reported that in 2012, approximately 870,000 doses were compounded at its central facility, with 56% of products made for specific patients and 44% for hospital needs like syringes and narcotic infusions. Smaller rural facilities may outsource compounding due to lack of resources. Factors for outsourcing include staff reductions, workflow streamlining, and cost savings. Outsourcing of compounded products by hospitals is influenced by factors like drug shortages, lack of capacity for stable products with long shelf-life, and the need for extended shelf-life to store products for patient needs. A 2013 report by the Office of the Inspector General found that 25% of hospitals used \"high-risk\" sterile products, while 92% used non-\"high-risk\" compounded sterile products. Outsourcing of compounded products by hospitals is driven by factors like drug shortages, stability, and extended shelf-life. Shortages of commercially-available drugs, especially generic sterile products, lead to increased demand for compounded products. Various reasons for drug shortages include voluntary discontinuation, supply chain issues, and safety problems at manufacturers. Compounders offer back-ordered or scarce drugs. The demand for compounded products is expected to rise due to ongoing drug shortages. Physicians and hospitals may rely on compounders for time-sensitive needs when specific drugs are unavailable. The 2013 OIG report found that hospitals often use compounding pharmacies for drugs due to shortages of FDA-approved drugs. Concerns arise as 73% of shortages are for sterile injectable generics, difficult to compound safely. Manufacturing issues have led to interruptions in drug supply, with Hospira recalling eight sterile injectable drugs. In 2012-2013, there were shortages of sterile injectable drugs, leading to reliance on brand-name sterile injectables which are less likely to have supply issues but cost more. Compounding pharmacy recalls exacerbated drug shortages, with some drugs already in short supply. CD shortages impact patient access to generic drugs. Table 1 shows hospitals' perceptions of disruptions in sterile product supply from compounding pharmacies. Nearly 50% believe healthcare delivery would be significantly affected, with 11.5% seeing potential life-threatening impacts on patients. Increased interest in customized products like allergen-free drugs and individualized formulations may drive demand for CDs. Marketing of CDs for common disorders is on the rise, offering pharmacists opportunities for business growth. Compounding pharmacists can expand business growth by providing individualized services and engaging with patients. This shift in business models allows pharmacists to go beyond distributing commercially-manufactured products. Business Week highlighted drug compounding as a growing sector, offering community pharmacies a new market niche. Some pharmacies are exploring new models due to competition with chain pharmacies, focusing on compounded products for business development. Demand for compounded products, including prescription drugs and dietary supplements, is increasing due to off-label prescribing by physicians. This practice allows for flexibility in prescribing medications, but also poses unknown risks. For example, compounded Avastin has been linked to adverse events despite its lower cost compared to FDA-approved drugs. Compounded drugs, like preservative-free methylprednisolone, have been linked to safety concerns, such as the 2012 fungal meningitis outbreak caused by NECC. The process of creating sterile compounded drugs requires special equipment and training to maintain sterility. Regulators and industry experts agree that the highest risk to patient safety comes from sterile products made from non-sterile ingredients. Various stakeholders, including consumers, pharmacists, and regulators, have a vested interest in ensuring access to safe compounded products. The demand for compounded drugs has increased, leading to changes in health delivery and potential risks to public health. Balancing patient access with safety has become more complex, with stakeholders calling for consideration of business trends in professional standards and oversight. Three key issues in congressional hearings and legislation include adverse event reporting, labeling, and modifying federal oversight of compounded drugs. Adverse event reporting for compounded drugs lacks public information and federal oversight, hindering the assessment of their safety and risks. FDA inspections, state licensing board records, and professional journals document adverse events related to compounded drugs. Reporting to the FDA MedWatch database is voluntary, leading to incomplete information. Labeling for compounded drugs is not always required, causing confusion for patients and providers. Non-traditional compounded drugs may not be recognized as such, impacting informed consent for medical treatment. Providing patients with information on compounded drugs could help balance their potential benefits and risks. Informed consent for treatment is essential to ensure patients understand the risks and benefits of medical procedures, including compounded solutions. Policymakers are exploring ways to improve the safety of compounded drugs while maintaining patient access to necessary medications. FDA administrators have expressed concerns about non-traditional compounding activities and their potential risks. The FDA recommends increased federal oversight of sterile compounding and high-risk activities, including non-traditional compounding. Bipartisan legislation aims to clarify federal authority over compounding drugs, with proposals for new FDA oversight of \"compounding manufacturers.\" Some Members of Congress argue for better implementation of existing authorities before granting new FDA powers. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce report questions FDA and state authorities' lack of enforcement regarding safety violations at NECC. Compounding industry stakeholders have mixed views on FDA oversight, with some supporting increased regulation. The complexity of compounded healthcare products and delivery systems is acknowledged by many. The Association of Health-System Pharmacists and American Hospital Association support FDA oversight of certain non-traditional compounding pharmacies. Improved communication between state and federal regulators, a list of \"do-not-compound\" CDs, and improved access to USP compounding monographs are key recommendations for non-traditional compounding pharmacies. Legislation introduced in the 113th Congress addresses drug compounding issues, with provisions discussed in congressional hearings on CDs from 2012-2013. In the 113th Congress, legislation addressing drug compounding issues was discussed in congressional hearings from 2012-2013, including topics such as the fungal meningitis outbreak and proposed legislative solutions. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of Representatives, held a hearing on November 14, 2012, titled \"Could It Have Been Prevented?\" Source: House Committee on Energy and Commerce and Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Appendix C highlights selected adverse events involving compounded drugs and solutions."
