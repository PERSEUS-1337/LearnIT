Congress is concerned about the implications for border security and U.S. immigration policy. Various explanations have been proposed for this surge, with limited data available to accurately measure the characteristics and motives of these children. The report discusses major contributing factors widely cited in published reports, without aiming to cover all potential reasons for the recent increase. The surge in unaccompanied alien children (UAC) seeking to enter the United States has increased significantly in recent years, mainly from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Factors contributing to this surge include push factors from migrant origin countries and pull factors from the United States. The distinction between push and pull factors can blur in actual circumstances, such as family reunification leading to increased vulnerability to criminal gangs. Migration of unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to the United States is influenced by various factors, including push factors like violence and economic hardship, as well as personal circumstances. The recent surge in child apprehensions highlights the complex interplay of motives driving migration. The recent surge of unaccompanied child migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to the United States is influenced by economic conditions, poverty, crime, and violence in their home countries. Factors attracting migrants to the U.S. include economic opportunities, family reunification, and U.S. immigration policies. Unaccompanied alien children are defined as under 18, lack lawful immigration status, and arrive at U.S. ports of entry or are apprehended at the southwestern border with Mexico. The number of unaccompanied children apprehended at the Mexico-U.S. border has increased significantly in recent years, with a surge in the current year. In FY2008, 8,041 children were apprehended, while in the first 8\u00bd months of FY2014, this number climbed to 52,000. Most of these children are aged 14 or older, with nationals of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Mexico accounting for the majority of apprehensions. Apprehensions of Mexican unaccompanied children have varied between 12,000 and 17,000 in the past three years, while apprehensions from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador have increased considerably during this period. In FY2009, Mexicans accounted for 82% of unaccompanied child apprehensions, while Central American countries accounted for 17%. By FY2014, Mexican apprehensions comprised only 23% of the total, with UAC from Central American countries making up 75%. The surge in apprehensions is mainly from children in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, indicating specific factors in Central America's \"northern triangle\" driving the increase. The surge in unaccompanied child apprehensions from Central America's \"northern triangle\" is driven by factors such as high violent crime rates, poor economic conditions, and the presence of transnational gangs in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The surge in unaccompanied child migrants from the northern triangle countries is influenced by factors like high violent crime rates, poor economic conditions, and the presence of transnational gangs. Unaccompanied minors have various reasons for leaving their countries, including reuniting with family, seeking economic opportunities, and escaping violence. Many children mentioned joining family members, economic opportunities, and education as their motives for migrating. Violence, including threats from criminal groups or state actors, also played a significant role in their decision to emigrate. The surge in unaccompanied child migrants from the northern triangle countries is influenced by factors like high violent crime rates, poor economic conditions, and the presence of transnational gangs. Many children mentioned joining family members, economic opportunities, and education as their motives for migrating. Violence, including threats from criminal groups or state actors, also played a significant role in their decision to emigrate. More than 20% of child migrants had been subject to domestic abuse, and societal violence was a reason for fleeing for some. Economic deprivation was cited as a motive by 16% of those interviewed, with variations depending on the country of origin. The GDP in 2014 for El Salvador was $4,014, Guatemala $3,684, and Honduras $2,368. Despite sound macroeconomic policies, the countries faced economic challenges after the 2009 global financial crisis. El Salvador had the lowest growth rate in Central America at 1.6% in 2013. Slow growth was influenced by external factors like markets in Europe, China, and the United States, as well as domestic issues. The coffee sector in Central American countries has been negatively impacted by natural disasters and low productivity rates. The coffee rust epidemic in 2013 led to significant job losses and decreased employment and wages in the region. Additionally, countries like El Salvador have suffered from damage caused by tropical storms, further affecting their economy. These challenges have deprived many households of a vital source of income. Tariff preferences under CAFTA-DR help apparel producers in East Asia stay competitive in the U.S. market. Despite economic growth, poverty remains widespread in the region, with high income disparities in Guatemala and Honduras. Crime and violence are persistent challenges in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Crime and violence have worsened in Guatemala and Honduras over the past decade due to pressure on drug traffickers in Colombia and Mexico. This has led to increased violence, corruption, and the influence of gangs like MS-13 and the 18th Street gang in the region. MS-13 and 18th Street gangs were formed in the 1980s by Salvadorans in Los Angeles. They later expanded to Central America, especially after the US began deporting criminal immigrants back to the region in the 1990s. These gangs engage in activities like kidnapping and extortion, impacting the daily lives of Salvadorans, Guatemalans, and Hondurans. The MS-13 gang was designated as a significant transnational criminal organization by the Treasury Department in 2012. There are an estimated 85,000 members of MS-13 and M-18 in the northern triangle countries, with the highest concentration in El Salvador. Homicide rates have increased significantly in Honduras and remained high in El Salvador and Guatemala. In 2012, the homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants was 90.4 in Honduras, 41.2 in El Salvador, and 39.9 in Guatemala. Despite a slight decline in 2013, these rates remain among the highest in the world. The homicide rates in the three countries remain high, with indications of a rise in El Salvador due to the unraveling gang truce. Other crimes like theft and extortion also persist at elevated levels. A significant percentage of the population in each country reported being victims of crime in the previous year. Domestic abuse, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, is believed to be widespread, with cultural norms in Central America legitimizing violence in interpersonal relationships. Children left behind by migrating parents, especially mothers, are more vulnerable to abuse. Conditions during migration influence their decision to emigrate to the United States. Economic stagnation, poverty, and criminal violence contribute to increased flows of unaccompanied minors. The journey through Central America and Mexico has become more dangerous and costly, with unauthorized migrants facing risks of human trafficking, kidnapping, and abuse. Corrupt Mexican officials are complicit in criminal activities, including robbery and abuse of authority. Mexico has increased immigration enforcement in some areas. Mexico has increased immigration enforcement in some areas, but enforcement along train routes used by Central American child migrants is lacking. Unauthorized migrants are turning to smugglers, who pay transnational criminal organizations like Los Zetas to lead them through Mexico and across the border. Many unaccompanied child migrants are now traveling with smugglers, leading to situations of forced labor or prostitution. Some smugglers have failed to pay Los Zetas, resulting in massacres of migrants. Mass grave sites have been recovered where migrants have been executed by criminal organizations. Mexico has implemented new migration laws and policies to address enforcement and humanitarian concerns. The government has faced criticism from both those advocating for stricter enforcement and those advocating for migrants' rights. Previously, Mexico's immigration laws were restrictive, but reforms in 2008 decriminalized simple migration offenses. The country has also passed laws to combat human trafficking and smuggling, with a comprehensive migration reform law enacted in 2011. Mexico's 2011 migration law decriminalized simple migration offenses, imposing fines and deportation instead of imprisonment. However, it did not create a transit visa for migrants passing through Mexico. Implementation of the law has been uneven due to the government's failure to fully overhaul the National Migration Institute. Mexico lacks funding and institutions to address traditional migration flows and the increasing numbers of U.S.-bound unaccompanied children. It has only two shelters for migrant children and no foster care system for those granted asylum. Despite provisions in the 2011 migration law to improve migrants' rights, the Mexican government continues to detain and remove large numbers of Central American migrants, including unaccompanied children. In 2013, Mexico detained 86,929 foreigners, with 80,079 being removed, mostly from the northern triangle countries of Central America. In the first four months of 2014, Mexico removed around 24,000 people from the northern triangle countries, a 9% increase from the previous year. The Mexican government, with U.S. support, implemented a southern border security plan in 2013, including naval bases and security cordons. The perception of economic opportunity and the chance to obtain legal authorization to live in the United States may attract unaccompanied children, conflicting with forces that cause them to leave their home countries. Several reports suggest that migrant smugglers prey on potential migrants' desperation by misleading them with false information about possibilities of living in the United States. Immigration observers have conflicting assertions on the motivations driving unaccompanied children to migrate, including economic and educational opportunities, family reunification, and recent U.S. immigration policies. Unaccompanied children often cite economic opportunity as a reason for their migration, but the interpretation of this aspiration remains unclear. The extent to which economic conditions in the United States affect children's migration decisions remains unclear. Current employment levels for minority youth in the U.S. are low, limiting unaccompanied children's participation in the labor market due to language barriers, educational limitations, and legal restrictions. If they do find work, they are likely to be confined to low-skilled, low-wage sectors of the economy. Labor market conditions in the U.S. impact children's migration decisions. Improving employment prospects could help parents afford their children's migration and lead to family reunification. Despite overall economic improvement, labor market slack remains, especially for low-skilled workers. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows challenges for low-skilled workers. The demand for low-skill workers has not recovered despite overall economic improvement. Government reporting on unauthorized workers is hindered by data limitations, making it difficult to assess their impact on the U.S. labor force. Research from the Pew Hispanic Center shows that unauthorized workers are concentrated in low-skilled sectors like farming, construction, and food preparation. Despite the economic downturn, these sectors are projected to grow at or above the national average, offering mixed economic prospects for low-skilled, low-wage workers. Unaccompanied children cite educational opportunities in the United States as a reason for their migration north. The Supreme Court's 1982 decision in Plyler v. Doe allowed unauthorized aliens to receive free public education through high school. However, access to higher education is restricted by federal and state measures. Family reunification is a primary reason for recent immigration. Family reunification is a key reason for the recent large-scale migration of unaccompanied children to the United States. Prior to the mid-1990s, migrants often returned home regularly, but increased border enforcement made unauthorized entry more difficult, leading to a \"caging effect\" where migrants settled permanently in the US. The recent spike in unaccompanied child apprehensions in the United States is linked to sizable foreign-born populations from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Data shows that many children in these countries have at least one parent living in the US, driving the desire for family reunification. Upon apprehension, unaccompanied children are given a Notice to Appear before an immigration judge to adjudicate their case. Children from countries other than Mexico and Canada are turned over to the care of Health and Human Services while awaiting their removal hearing. ORR is responsible for placing these children with family members. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) places unaccompanied children with family members in the United States, prioritizing the child's best interests. Many of these family members are unauthorized aliens, with significant populations from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The length of time unaccompanied children from Central America can expect to wait for their removal hearing in the United States varies widely, with an average wait time of 19 months nationwide. Surges in caseloads due to the influx of children can further extend wait times, potentially incentivizing migration. Rumors of backlogs and the possibility of reuniting with family have reached emigrant-sending communities in Central America. The surge in arrivals of unaccompanied children from Central America has sparked debates on the possible link between U.S. immigration policies and the increase. Reports suggest that perceptions of U.S. policies towards alien minors may have influenced decisions to enter the country unlawfully. Parents have been inspired to hire guides associated with organized crime to bring their children north due to a perceived shift in how the U.S. treats minors. The surge in arrivals of unaccompanied children from Central America has prompted parents to make the trip with toddlers in tow, influenced by a growing perception of softened U.S. government treatment towards minors. Recent changes in the treatment of unaccompanied children in the United States have sparked debates on the role of U.S. immigration policy in the increase. Reports suggest that parents have hired guides associated with organized crime to bring their children north. The surge in arrivals of unaccompanied children from Central America has prompted parents to make the trip with toddlers in tow, influenced by a growing perception of softened U.S. government treatment towards minors. Many children are fleeing gang violence, while others are sent by families hoping for immigration reform or DACA eligibility. The Obama Administration attributes the surge to conditions in the children's home countries and misinformation about U.S. policies. White House Director Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz blames criminal networks for spreading misinformation about immigration laws. The surge in unaccompanied child arrivals from Central America is attributed to factors such as gang violence, immigration reform hopes, and misinformation about U.S. policies. Some observers point to Obama's deportation policy as a contributing factor. U.S. immigration policies providing humanitarian relief to those fleeing violence are debated for potentially attracting foreign nationals. These policies include asylum and relief for trafficking victims. The surge in unaccompanied child arrivals from Central America is attributed to factors such as gang violence, immigration reform hopes, and misinformation about U.S. policies. U.S. immigration policies providing humanitarian relief to those fleeing violence include asylum, relief for trafficking victims, and special immigrant status for juveniles. It is difficult to directly link these policies to the recent increase in unaccompanied children. The principle of not returning a foreign national to a country where their life or freedom is threatened is a long-held belief in the United States, as reflected in various provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the Refugee Act of 1980. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2008 made notable revisions to policies on humanitarian relief for unaccompanied children. The TVPRA of 2008 revised procedures for unaccompanied children seeking asylum, requiring screening for possible claims. DHS now screens all unaccompanied children for asylum claims, with USCIS asylum officers having initial jurisdiction. To qualify for asylum, foreign nationals must show a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. Credibility of the claim plays a significant role in assessing asylum cases. The credibility of an asylum case is crucial, as it depends on the likelihood of persecution if the individual is returned home. Uncertainty surrounds asylum claims for unaccompanied children, especially regarding gang-related violence. These children may also have valid claims as trafficking victims, making them eligible for T nonimmigrant status and lawful permanent residence under certain conditions. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2008 defines forms of trafficking as sex trafficking involving force, fraud, or coercion, and labor trafficking through force or coercion. Unaccompanied children from contiguous countries must be screened for possible asylum claims and trafficking victim status. DHS policy extends trafficking screening to all unaccompanied children. Congress created a pathway for unauthorized children under court dependency to gain lawful status. The TVPRA of 2008 created a pathway for unauthorized children under court dependency to become lawful permanent residents (LPRs) through the special immigrant juvenile (SIJ) classification. The amendment removed the requirement for long-term foster care eligibility and replaced it with the need for the juvenile court to find reunification with parents not viable. Eligible SIJs are children declared dependent by a juvenile court or placed under state custody. SIJ status allows unauthorized children under court dependency to become lawful permanent residents. The process involves juvenile court orders legally committing a juvenile to an individual or entity appointed by the court. ORR must consent to any custody decisions for juveniles in their care. The number of children obtaining SIJ status is unknown. The surge of unaccompanied child arrivals may be influenced by the DACA initiative and provisions in proposed comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Some argue that new arrivals believe they would be covered by DACA, despite being ineligible. Recent CIR bills have included provisions for unauthorized aliens to become lawful permanent residents. S. 744 proposes a legalization program for unauthorized aliens present in the US since December 31, 2011. Dependent spouses and children must have been present since December 31, 2012. A special pathway to LPR status is provided for applicants under 16 who meet requirements. Unaccompanied children arriving newly are not eligible. Factors contributing to the increase in unaccompanied children include poverty, lack of economic opportunity, gangs, and drug trafficking organizations. The surge in unaccompanied children at the US border is influenced by various factors such as poverty, lack of economic opportunity, gangs, and drug trafficking organizations in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The importance of these factors is difficult to accurately measure due to limited information and rapidly changing circumstances. Surveys may emphasize certain factors over others, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about the main drivers of the surge. The division between push and pull factors blurs as multiple factors influence individuals' decisions to migrate."
