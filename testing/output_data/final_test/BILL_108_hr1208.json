Congress finds that the United States has been actively involved in the Northern Ireland peace process by participating in negotiations and supporting economic development. The governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom, along with their people, are long-standing friends of the United States. In 1986, the US began annual contributions to the International Fund for Ireland to aid economic development and peace-building programs. The United States has contributed over $386 million to the International Fund for Ireland to support peace and reconciliation efforts in Northern Ireland and border areas of the Republic of Ireland. The Fund focuses on creating jobs, providing job training programs, and promoting dialogue in disadvantaged communities. The United States supports community-building and leadership programs in Northern Ireland to promote reconciliation and peace, as outlined in the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986. The Good Friday Agreement further solidifies efforts towards a peaceful and prosperous future in the region. The Good Friday Agreement of 1998 established the Northern Ireland Executive Assembly and Executive Committee, aiming for a democratically elected and inclusive Assembly capable of exercising executive and legislative authority. It also called for police reform to create an effective, accountable, and fair police service based on human rights principles. In 1999, the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland made recommendations for policing reform, some of which have been implemented. In 2002, a report highlighted concerns about the lack of a new police training facility and increased funding for training programs. United States assistance for the International Fund has supported economic development in Northern Ireland. The Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 emphasized the importance of economic development and reconciliation for achieving peace in Northern Ireland. International Fund contributions are crucial for projects in economically-depressed areas. Policing reform is essential for public confidence in the new government. The International Fund supports programs to enhance community relations, provide human rights training for police, and promote peaceful mediation in conflict-ridden neighborhoods in Northern Ireland. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE ANGLO-IRISH AGREEMENT SUPPORT ACT OF 1986. The Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 is amended to encourage the International Fund to support programs that enhance community relations, human rights training for police, peaceful mediation in conflict areas, training for new district partnership police boards, and the transition of former British military sites into community-supported activities. United States contributions to the International Fund are specified for fiscal years 2004 and 2005. In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, $25,000,000 is authorized for United States contributions to the International Fund under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. At least 20 percent of this amount should be used for specific purposes outlined in the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986. Annual reports will detail the utilization of these funds for improving local initiatives. The curr_chunk discusses improving local community relations and relations between the police and the people they serve. The House of Representatives passed the bill on March 31, 2003."
