    "content": "The federal executive branch manages a large real property portfolio with over a quarter of a million buildings for various agency missions. The cost of operating and maintaining these properties exceeded $21 billion in FY2014. Congressional oversight has focused on improving the management of federal buildings, with four key issues identified by the Government Accountability Office. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified key challenges agencies face in managing their real property portfolios, including maintaining more property than needed, relying on costly leasing, and using unreliable data for decision-making. This report focuses on the lack of accurate real property data, particularly in disposing of unneeded buildings and overreliance on expensive leases. The report discusses weaknesses in data available to Congress on unutilized and underutilized buildings, government reliance on costly leases, and options for policymakers to address data issues. Federal agencies have over 250,000 buildings with changing real property needs based on mission shifts. For example, the VA has transitioned from hospital-based care to outpatient care, impacting space requirements. The Department of Defense and other federal agencies have reduced their workforce and realigned their facilities, leading to many vacant or underutilized buildings. To cut costs, agencies must identify and report excess properties to the General Services Administration for disposal. The General Services Administration (GSA) manages the disposal of unneeded space for executive branch agencies. GSA looks for federal and nonfederal tenants to fill empty space in underutilized federal buildings. Excess properties are first offered to other federal agencies at market value. If no agency wants the property, it is declared surplus and made available to state and local governments and nonprofits at a discount for public benefit use. Surplus properties must be used for public benefit purposes such as homeless services, corrections, law enforcement, public health, drug rehabilitation, education, parks and recreation, and more. The Department of Housing and Urban Development determines if surplus properties are suitable for homeless use before making them available for other public uses. Properties not conveyed for public benefit are sold at fair market value or demolished. The government disposes of surplus properties by selling them at fair market value or demolishing them if they cannot be sold. Congressional oversight of this process is crucial due to the significant costs involved. The Federal Real Property Report provides data to Congress for assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the disposal process. The Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) publishes a report based on data from the General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) database. The data collected by GSA on executive branch agency properties is unreliable and incomplete, limiting its usefulness for congressional oversight. This has led to real property management being on the high-risk list for 12 years. The GSA collects important data on unutilized and underutilized buildings, but Congress lacks direct access to their database. Policymakers only see data that GSA chooses to publish, leading to concerns about the reliability of the information available for congressional oversight. Aggregate data on these buildings is crucial for policymakers to understand the scale of the issue and its costs, but the data's reliability has been criticized. The FRPR, the main source of information on unutilized and underutilized buildings, has limitations due to inaccurate data from GSA's FRPP database. GAO criticized the database for providing inconsistent information, making it unreliable for decision-making. Changes in building utilization definitions have further reduced the usefulness of reported data. The FRPR, the main source of information on unutilized and underutilized buildings, has limitations due to inaccurate data from GSA's FRPP database. Changes in building utilization definitions have also limited the usefulness of reported real property data. In FY2013, agencies reported 3,100 buildings as unutilized and 2,400 as underutilized, with significant decreases in both categories under the latest space utilization definitions. The accuracy of the scale of the problem remains unclear due to the varying definitions used in different fiscal years. The scale of the problem of unutilized and underutilized building space may be described in terms of cost. Cost data can help policymakers determine priorities and evaluate policy alternatives for potential savings. The FRPR data from FY2010 showed $112 million spent on operating unutilized buildings and $1.6 billion on underutilized buildings, but this information has not been reported since. The FRPR data from FY2010 showed $112 million spent on operating unutilized buildings and $1.6 billion on underutilized buildings. However, the data on the cost of operating unutilized and underutilized buildings have been omitted since then, limiting policymakers' understanding of the problem's impact on government finances. Accurate data on the disposal process efficiency, including the number of unutilized buildings each agency has and disposes of, could help identify agencies managing their space effectively. Data on net proceeds from disposing of unneeded federal buildings could assist Congress in evaluating potential revenue and planning its use. The FRPR provides some data on buildings disposed of by agencies, but lacks specifics on savings from reduced operating costs. This hinders the ability to determine the fiscal benefits of enhanced disposition. The FRPR lacks data on net proceeds from selling unneeded buildings, hindering the ability to determine fiscal benefits. Lawmakers are concerned about the government's increasing reliance on leased space, with square footage growing by 67% from FY2003 to FY2011. The government's increasing reliance on leased space is driven by how leases are scored, with only the first year's lease payment needed to be recorded in the budget. This makes it easier to obtain funding for rent compared to the full cost of a building. Leased space is generally less cost-efficient than owned space, leading to increased operating costs. The government's reliance on leased space is costly, with leased space costing over four times as much per square foot as owned space. In FY2014, owned space cost $5.77 per square foot, while leased space cost $24.04. Despite owning 2.51 billion square feet at a cost of $14 billion, leased space of 294 million square feet at $7 billion consumed 33% of total funding. The data used for these calculations is of questionable quality. The FRPR, the primary source for government-wide information on leased space, may not provide accurate data on the amount and cost of leased space. It lacks data on high-value and long-term leases, which pose the greatest fiscal risk. The FY2014 data showed a significant decrease in leased space and cost compared to previous years, raising concerns about the accuracy and consistency of the reporting. The FY2014 FRPR reported a decrease in leased space and a $2.1 billion reduction in operating costs compared to previous years. The government's largest lease-holder is GSA, controlling two-thirds of the leased space in the executive branch. The accuracy and consistency of the reported data have raised concerns. In FY2014, GSA controls two-thirds of the leased space in the executive branch. GSA must seek congressional authorization for leases exceeding the prospectus threshold of $2.85 million. Congressional approval is required for leases above this threshold. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that high-value leases, representing 3% of GSA's total lease portfolio, accounted for 36% of its operating costs, totaling $1.5 billion. Oversight of these leases is limited due to lack of specific information in the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPR). GSA reports lease data in monthly spreadsheets, which could be aggregated in the FRPR for increased transparency. Including similar data on high-value leases from agencies with independent leasing authority may further enhance transparency. Research has shown that long-term operating leases, especially high-value ones, can lead to unnecessary costs for the government. For example, a 30-year lease for the FBI building in Chicago will cost $40 million more than owning the same space. Analysis of 89 GSA leases revealed potential savings of almost $1 billion if the government had constructed rather than leased the space. The prevalence of long-term leases in an agency's real property portfolio is considered a management weakness by the GAO, indicating a lack of prioritization in capital planning. The FRPR lacks data on agency lease lengths, hindering policymakers from considering cost-saving potential in construction projects. Providing information on long-term leases held by GSA, including annual rent and total cost, could enhance oversight and reveal opportunities for savings by funding construction projects instead of operating leases. This data would allow Congress to understand the scale of agency reliance on long-term leases and the potential for cost-savings. Expanding data reported in agency real property portfolios could enhance oversight and policymaking. The FRPR omits valuable data such as annual operating costs of unutilized and underutilized buildings, providing only the costs of disposed assets. Repair needs estimates are folded into a formula for a \"condition index\" for each building, which is not reported, limiting transparency. The FRPR omits key data such as repair needs estimates and lease information. Congress may benefit from separate reporting of repair estimates to inform funding decisions. Improving real property data quality at GSA could enhance oversight, with potential GAO audit recommendations on building definitions and lease data validity. Direct access to the FRPP could enhance congressional oversight of agency real property activities. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) contains data on excess and surplus properties, maintenance costs, and agency disposition actions. However, access to the FRPP is restricted by GSA, limiting public and congressional staff access. While some data is made public through annual reports, it is highly aggregated and lacks agency-specific details, hindering Congress's ability to monitor individual agency performance. Without access to agency-level data, Congress is unable to monitor individual agency performance, compare agencies, study successful policies, or hold poorly performing agencies accountable. This lack of data hinders policymakers from asking important questions about unneeded space distribution and root causes of issues within agencies. The FRPP provides some data on individual properties, but access is restricted, limiting transparency and oversight. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) offers data on individual properties, including operating costs, condition, and needed repairs. GAO has identified federal real property management as a high-risk area due to the government's reliance on leasing rather than owning buildings. Congressional oversight of the General Services Administration's (GSA) lease decisions is crucial given its role in procuring space for multiple agencies. Congressional oversight of GSA's lease proposals is important due to its role in providing space for multiple agencies. However, the oversight process lacks comparative cost data, making it difficult for Congress to determine the most cost-effective option. Mandating GSA to include such data in its prospectuses could improve oversight. The GSA did not report comparative cost data in the mid-1990s due to limited funding, making it unrealistic to consider other alternatives. Requiring GSA to resume reporting such data would not impose a significant administrative burden on the agency."
