    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature in California acknowledges the need for safe and supportive school environments for all pupils, especially LGBTQ students who often face harassment. A survey found that a high percentage of LGBTQ pupils in California experience anti-LGBTQ remarks, name-calling, threats, physical harassment, and cyberbullying. Research shows that LGBTQ students who experience harassment have lower grades and are more likely to skip class due to feeling unsafe. Despite this, many students do not report incidents to school staff out of fear that nothing will be done. Creating supportive environments, such as peer support clubs, can improve student performance by reducing harassment and increasing reporting of incidents. The federal CDC monitors and funds local efforts to support LGBTQ pupils in schools, promoting safe environments and access to resources. Data shows that only half of California schools provide access to health resources for LGBTQ students. The Legislature encourages schools to educate staff on supporting LGBTQ students and provide information on available resources. Section 234.1 of the Education Code is amended to require the department to monitor adherence to regulations for local educational agencies as part of the Categorical Program Monitoring process. The policy adopted prohibits discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying based on various characteristics. It applies to all acts related to school activity or attendance within the school district. The policy adopted includes a process for receiving and investigating complaints of discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying based on various characteristics. It requires immediate intervention by school personnel if they witness such acts and establishes a timeline for resolving complaints. An appeal process is available for complainants who disagree with the resolution of a filed complaint. Forms related to this process must be translated. Antidiscrimination policies, including complaint filing information, must be publicized and translated for pupils, parents, employees, and the general public. Provided to certificated schoolsite employees serving grades 7-12, information on resources for LGBTQ pupils, including peer support clubs, safe spaces, counseling services, trained staff, inclusive curriculum materials, online training, and related policies and complaint procedures. Community resources may include community-based organizations. Community resources for LGBTQ pupils and their families may include community-based organizations and health providers with experience in supporting these individuals. The policy established pursuant to subdivision (a) must be posted in all schools and offices, complaints and their resolution must be documented, complainants must be protected from retaliation, and a responsible officer must ensure compliance with regulations."
