    "content": "Immigration reform has been a contentious issue, with a focus on legalizing unauthorized immigrants in the US. The DREAM Act aims to provide a pathway to legal status for certain unauthorized students. Unauthorized alien children can receive free public education through high school, but many face challenges if they want to attend college. Unauthorized immigrants graduating from high school and seeking college face obstacles due to a 1996 provision discouraging postsecondary education benefits. Bills introduced aim to provide relief for unauthorized alien students, including adjusting to legal permanent resident status. In the 111th Congress, a different DREAM Act measure was approved by the House as an amendment to an unrelated bill. In the 111th Congress, the DREAM Act language was added to H.R. 5281, granting eligible individuals interim legal status before adjusting to LPR status. Bills to legalize unauthorized alien students' status were reintroduced in the 112th and 113th Congresses, with provisions integrated into comprehensive immigration reform bills. The Senate passed S. 744 in the 113th Congress, but it was not considered in the House and did not progress further. Currently, no DREAM Act bills have been introduced in the 114th Congress. Unauthorized aliens may face varying state laws regarding enrollment in public postsecondary institutions, where they must meet standard admission requirements. Social Security numbers are typically not required for college admission, but unauthorized alien students may still face challenges even if admitted. Unauthorized alien students face challenges in paying for higher education as they are ineligible for federal and state financial aid. Section 505 of IIRIRA restricts state provision of educational benefits to aliens not lawfully present in the US. This includes in-state tuition rates. Section 505 of IIRIRA restricts state provision of educational benefits to unauthorized aliens, particularly in-state tuition rates. There is disagreement and confusion surrounding the interpretation of this provision, with no clear guidance available. The focus has been on whether granting in-state tuition to unauthorized aliens is permissible under Section 505. Various states have attempted to grant in-state tuition to unauthorized aliens without violating Section 505 of IIRIRA. For example, California allows unauthorized aliens to qualify for in-state tuition at state colleges based on specific criteria, including attending a California high school for at least three years and filing an affidavit to legalize their status. In November 2010, the California Supreme Court upheld the state law allowing unauthorized students to receive in-state tuition. The Department of Homeland Security announced DACA in 2012, offering deferred action for certain individuals brought to the US as children. The DACA initiative, introduced in 2012, provides relief for individuals meeting specific criteria, such as being under age 31 on June 15, 2012, having continuous residence in the US since June 15, 2007, and meeting education or military requirements. Those granted deferred action can apply for employment authorization, but the program does not offer a pathway to legal immigration status. The DACA program, administered by DHS's USCIS, has expanded eligibility criteria and extended grant and renewal periods. DHS directed USCIS to start accepting applications under the new parameters in 90 days. Traditional DREAM Act bills aim to provide LPR status to unauthorized alien students through a two-stage process, with requirements including at least five years of residence in the US. The DREAM Act aims to provide LPR status to unauthorized alien students through a two-stage process, with requirements including residence in the US and educational qualifications. The Migration Policy Institute published estimates of the population potentially eligible for legal status under a Senate DREAM Act bill introduced in the 111th Congress. The DREAM Act aimed to provide LPR status to unauthorized alien students through a two-stage process, including educational qualifications. The MPI analysis estimated that about 2.150 million individuals could have attempted to become LPRs under the provisions of the bill, with 43% being children. The MPI report estimated that 43% of the 2.150 million potential beneficiaries of the DREAM Act were children under 18 in school. Approximately 38% of these beneficiaries, or 825,000 individuals, were projected to achieve lawful permanent status under the legislation. The Center for Immigration Studies also estimated the number of potential beneficiaries using 2009 and 2010 CPS data. The DREAM Act legislation aimed to provide conditional LPR status to unauthorized aliens meeting residency, age, and education requirements. CIS estimated 1.998 million potential beneficiaries, with 1.426 million meeting the education requirement. MPI estimated 2.1 million unauthorized aliens eligible for DACA relief. As of September 30, 2014, 610,375 DACA requests were approved. Senate and House DREAM Act bills were introduced in the 112th Congress, with differences in provisions. S. 952, the DREAM Act of 2011, aimed to repeal IIRIRA Section 505 to allow state provision of educational benefits to unlawfully present aliens. S. 952, the DREAM Act of 2011, aimed to enable eligible unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal, without being placed in removal proceedings first. It would have allowed aliens to apply for cancellation of removal without limits on the number granted. The DREAM Act of 2011, S. 952, proposed eligibility criteria for cancellation of removal/adjustment of status for unauthorized students. To qualify, individuals had to demonstrate continuous physical presence in the US for five years, be under 35 years old, have good moral character, and meet education requirements. Special inadmissibility rules applied. Aliens ineligible for visas or entry to the US on specified grounds. S. 952 outlined inadmissibility criteria for relief seekers, including criminal, security, and other grounds. Applicants had to meet various requirements, submit biometric data, and register under the Military Selective Service Act if applicable. S. 952 would have required applications for cancellation of removal/adjustment of status to be filed within one year of earning a high school diploma or equivalent. The bill would have protected aliens with pending applications who met eligibility requirements. Those granted cancellation of removal would initially become conditional permanent residents for six years. To become a full-fledged LPR, an alien needed to meet requirements such as demonstrating good moral character, not abandoning U.S. residence, earning a degree or serving in the military for two years. Other conditions included meeting English and civics requirements, submitting biometric data, and passing background checks. S. 952 would have restricted federal student financial aid eligibility for aliens with conditional LPR status, allowing only student loans, work-study programs, and services. Time spent as a conditional LPR would count towards naturalization under the bill, but the condition would need to be removed before applying for naturalization. H.R. 1842, the DREAM Act of 2011, introduced by Representative Howard Berman, aimed to repeal IIRIRA Section 505 to allow unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status and apply for cancellation of removal without limit on the number of aliens granted. Unlike S. 952, it did not provide for adjustment to LPR status for aliens in temporary protected status. H.R. 1842, the DREAM Act of 2011, introduced by Representative Howard Berman, included requirements for cancellation of removal/adjustment of status for aliens. The bill required aliens to demonstrate continuous physical presence in the U.S. for at least five years, good moral character, and either admission to an institution of higher education or earning a high school diploma. The age requirement was set at 32 or younger on the date of enactment. The DREAM Act of 2011, H.R. 1842, required aliens to show continuous presence in the U.S., good moral character, and education qualifications. Applicants needed to prove they were not inadmissible on various grounds and submit biometric data. The bill also included provisions for protection from removal for potential beneficiaries. The House bill, similar to S. 952, required applications to be filed within one year of earning a high school diploma. The Secretary of Homeland Security or Attorney General couldn't remove an alien with a pending application who showed eligibility. Aliens granted cancellation of removal under H.R. 1842 would have been adjusted to conditional permanent resident status. The House bill required applications to be filed within one year of earning a high school diploma. Aliens granted cancellation of removal would be adjusted to conditional permanent resident status for six years, subject to termination. To become a full-fledged LPR, an alien had to demonstrate good moral character, not abandon U.S. residence, and meet education or military service requirements. Other conditions included English language and civics requirements, biometric data submission. H.R. 1842 introduced requirements for naturalization, including biometric data submission and background checks. Conditional LPR status would count towards naturalization, but conditions had to be removed first. The bill also placed restrictions on federal student financial aid eligibility for aliens adjusting to LPR status. H.R. 3823, the ARMS Act, introduced by Representative David Rivera, focused on adjusted residency for military service. H.R. 3823, the ARMS Act introduced by Representative David Rivera, differed from other immigration bills by requiring unauthorized alien students to perform military service to obtain LPR status. It did not repeal IIRIRA Section 505 and did not eliminate the restriction on state provision of postsecondary educational benefits to unlawfully present aliens. Eligible aliens could go through the cancellation of removal procedure and be granted conditional nonimmigrant status under H.R. 3823. H.R. 3823, the ARMS Act, required unauthorized alien students to perform military service for LPR status. It allowed aliens to apply for cancellation of removal without being in removal proceedings, set a deadline for applications, and prevented removal of eligible applicants. Unlike other DREAM Act bills, H.R. 3823 did not include provisions for alien children in school without high school graduation. To be eligible for cancellation of removal/conditional nonimmigrant status under H.R. 3823, an alien needed to demonstrate physical presence in the US for at least five years, good moral character, age requirements, and education attainment. H.R. 3823 specified grounds for inadmissibility and deportability for aliens seeking relief, requiring them to demonstrate eligibility and meet various criteria, including physical presence, good moral character, age requirements, education attainment, and not being inadmissible or deportable on specific grounds. Applicants also needed to satisfy requirements concerning convictions for offenses under federal or state law and submit biometric and biographic data for background checks. Under H.R. 3823, aliens seeking relief needed to provide biometric and biographic data for background checks and register under the Military Selective Service Act if applicable. Conditional nonimmigrant status granted under this bill would be valid for 10 years, with the possibility of extension for a second five-year period if certain requirements were met, including demonstrating good moral character and enlisting in the Armed Forces within nine months. Under H.R. 3823, aliens seeking relief must demonstrate good moral character, comply with inadmissibility and deportability provisions, maintain U.S. residence, and serve in the Armed Forces for at least two years. The House-approved measure in the 111th Congress had similar conditional nonimmigrant status periods but included different military service requirements and the option of completing two years of higher education instead of military service. H.R. 3823 would establish surcharges on applications for relief, including $525 for cancellation of removal/conditional nonimmigrant status and $2,000 for an extension of conditional nonimmigrant status. Aliens could apply for adjustment to LPR status after the second period of conditional nonimmigrant status, meeting requirements such as good moral character, compliance with inadmissibility and deportability provisions, and maintaining U.S. residence. Applicants for adjustment of status under H.R. 3823 would need to meet English language and civic requirements, federal tax liability, submit biometric data, and pass background checks. There would be no limit on the number of eligible individuals. Aliens could apply for naturalization after three years in LPR status, with no credit for time spent in conditional status. H.R. 3823 also addressed the treatment of aliens granted conditional nonimmigrant or LPR status for other purposes. H.R. 3823, similar to the DREAM Act, allowed conditional nonimmigrants to be considered lawfully present except for certain provisions. It also deemed aliens adjusting to LPR status to have completed the required five-year period for federal public assistance eligibility. The bill did not address federal student financial aid eligibility. The Studying Towards Adjusted Residency Status (STARS) Act, introduced by Representative Rivera, aimed to provide a pathway to LPR status through higher education, similar to the DREAM Act. It did not repeal IIRIRA Section 505, maintaining restrictions on state provision of educational benefits to unlawfully present aliens. Eligible aliens could have pursued LPR status under H.R. 5869. In the 111th Congress, the DREAM Act allowed eligible aliens to obtain conditional nonimmigrant status through cancellation of removal. Unlike other DREAM Act bills, H.R. 5869 did not adjust the alien's status to conditional LPR. It enabled aliens to apply for cancellation of removal without being in removal proceedings and prevented removal of those with pending applications. H.R. 5869 did not include provisions for alien children in school without high school graduation. H.R. 5869 required eligible aliens to demonstrate physical presence in the U.S. for at least five years, good moral character, and age requirements. It also included provisions for applicants to be younger than 19 at the time of application and not have a history of deportation orders. H.R. 5869 set educational requirements for conditional status, including a high school diploma or equivalent and admission to a four-year institution. Applicants had to demonstrate eligibility by not being inadmissible or deportable on various grounds. Applicants for conditional nonimmigrant status under H.R. 5869 needed to meet educational requirements, demonstrate eligibility by not being inadmissible or deportable on various grounds, submit biometric and biographic data for background checks, and register under the Military Selective Service Act if applicable. This status would be valid for five years and subject to termination for various reasons, including failure to enroll in a four-year institution within one year. Under H.R. 5869, conditional nonimmigrant status could be extended for a total of 10 years if the alien demonstrated good moral character, complied with inadmissibility and deportability provisions, maintained U.S. residence, and graduated from a four-year institution. Surcharges of $525 for cancellation of removal/conditional nonimmigrant status and $2,000 for an extension of conditional nonimmigrant status would be established. The bill H.R. 5869 allowed for an extension of conditional nonimmigrant status with a surcharge of $2,000 per application. Adjustment to LPR status was possible after the second period of conditional nonimmigrant status, with requirements including good moral character, compliance with inadmissibility and deportability provisions, and no abandonment of U.S. residence. Additional requirements for adjustment of status included English language proficiency, tax liability satisfaction, biometric data submission, background checks, and no limit on eligible individuals. Naturalization eligibility was possible after five years in LPR status for those who met the requirements. H.R. 5869, similar to the DREAM Act, allowed conditional nonimmigrants to be considered lawfully present for most purposes. It also allowed aliens adjusting to LPR status under the bill to be eligible for federal public assistance after completing the required five-year period. Unlike other DREAM Act bills, H.R. 5869 did not offer a higher education route to LPR status. H.R. 5869, unlike other DREAM Act bills, did not include provisions for federal student financial aid eligibility. In the 113th Congress, DREAM Act provisions were included in larger immigration reform bills like S. 744 and H.R. 15, which proposed a pathway to lawful permanent residence for certain unauthorized aliens who entered the U.S. as children. Both bills outlined a multi-step process for transitioning to provisional legal status and ultimately to lawful permanent residence. The proposed bills, S. 744 and H.R. 15, introduced a new section (245B) to the INA for adjustment to a registered provisional immigrant (RPI) status. The Secretary of Homeland Security could grant RPI status to foreign nationals who met eligibility requirements, submitted an application, and paid fees. The initial period of RPI status would be six years, extendable if requirements were met. Eligibility criteria included physical presence in the U.S. on specified dates and continuous physical presence. Foreign nationals could be granted RPI status under S. 744 and H.R. 15 if they met eligibility requirements, including physical presence in the U.S. on specified dates and continuous physical presence. Dependents could also qualify if they met certain criteria. Ineligibility factors included criminal convictions, terrorist activity, and specified INA grounds. Under specified INA grounds, aliens with certain immigration statuses would have been ineligible for RPI status under S. 744 or H.R. 15. Applicants would have needed to pay a processing fee and penalty, except for those meeting DREAM Act criteria. Additionally, applicants would have had to address federal tax liability, undergo background checks, and potentially face additional security screening at DHS discretion. The RPI applicant could have faced additional security screening at the discretion of the DHS Secretary. An alien granted RPI status or who appeared eligible for it would have been protected from removal under S. 744 and H.R. 15. These bills aimed to provide a special pathway to LPR status for RPIs who entered the US as children and met specific requirements, such as being under 16 at entry, having a high school diploma or equivalent, and completing higher education. The DREAM Act provisions in S. 744 and H.R. 15 would have allowed certain aliens to adjust to LPR status if they met specific criteria, such as having a degree or completing two years of higher education in the US, or serving in the military for at least four years. These aliens would have been subject to English language and civics requirements, as well as national security screening. RPIs adjusting status under the DREAM Act provisions would have been exempt from a $1,000 penalty and there would have been no limit on the number of aliens who could adjust status. Additionally, federal student assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act would have been available for RPIs who entered the US before age 16. The DREAM Act provisions in S. 744 and H.R. 15 would have allowed certain aliens to adjust to LPR status if they met specific criteria, such as having a degree or completing two years of higher education in the US, or serving in the military for at least four years. These aliens would have been subject to English language and civics requirements, as well as national security screening. RPIs adjusting status under the DREAM Act provisions would have been exempt from a $1,000 penalty and there would have been no limit on the number of aliens who could adjust status. Additionally, federal student assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act would have been available for RPIs who entered the US before age 16. The bills specified that these aliens would only be eligible for student loans, federal work-study programs, and services. In addition, S. 744 and H.R. 15 would have repealed Section 505 of IIRIRA, which places certain restrictions on state provision of postsecondary educational benefits to unlawfully present aliens. Advocates for granting LPR status to unauthorized alien students argue that it is fair and in the national interest to allow them to continue their education, especially by offering in-state tuition rates. They believe many of these students were brought to the US at a young age and should not be penalized for their illegal entry. These advocates stress the students' ties to the US and argue for humanitarian relief through LPR status, citing potential economic benefits for the country. Advocates for the DREAM Act argue that it would benefit the US economy and create new jobs. Opponents believe that unauthorized alien students should not receive in-state tuition or legal status, as they are in the US illegally. They argue that funding their education should be the responsibility of their parents or home countries, and granting benefits rewards lawbreakers. Critics argue that granting benefits to unauthorized alien students rewards lawbreakers and undermines the U.S. immigration system. They believe the DREAM Act would cost money, take jobs and college spots from legal residents, and encourage more unlawful immigration. Senator Durbin and Representative Berman introduced various versions of the DREAM Act in Congress. Berman and Djou introduced bills related to the DREAM Act in 2010. The House approved DREAM Act language as part of an unrelated bill, but the Senate failed to pass it. The House-approved DREAM Act language was similar to the original bill introduced by Berman and Durbin. The House-approved DREAM Act in the 111th Congress would have allowed eligible unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status through a different pathway than other bills. It did not repeal IIRIRA Section 505 and would have granted conditional nonimmigrant status, not LPR status. The House-approved DREAM Act in the 111th Congress offered a pathway for eligible unauthorized students to obtain conditional nonimmigrant status. To qualify, the individual needed to meet specific criteria such as continuous presence in the US for at least five years, good moral character, and being under the age of 30 at the time of enactment. The House-approved DREAM Act in the 111th Congress provided a pathway for eligible unauthorized students to obtain conditional nonimmigrant status by meeting specific criteria, including continuous presence in the US for at least five years, good moral character, and being under the age of 30 at the time of enactment. Applicants had to demonstrate they had not been under a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal, and meet various grounds of inadmissibility and deportability. The House-approved DREAM Act in the 111th Congress provided a pathway for eligible unauthorized students to obtain conditional nonimmigrant status by meeting specific criteria, including continuous presence in the US for at least five years, good moral character, and being under the age of 30 at the time of enactment. Applicants also needed to satisfy requirements concerning convictions for offenses under federal or state law, submit biometric and biographic data for background checks, and register under the Military Selective Service Act if applicable. Conditional nonimmigrant status would be granted for an initial five-year period, extendable for a second five-year period if certain requirements were met. The House-approved DREAM Act in the 111th Congress established criteria for eligible unauthorized students to obtain conditional nonimmigrant status, including continuous presence in the US for at least five years, good moral character, and being under 30. The amendment to H.R. 5281 included surcharges on relief applications and requirements for adjustment to LPR status after two periods of conditional nonimmigrant status. The House-approved DREAM Act in the 111th Congress set criteria for eligible unauthorized students to obtain conditional nonimmigrant status, including good moral character, compliance with inadmissibility provisions, and maintaining U.S. residence. Applicants needed to meet English and civic requirements, pay federal taxes, provide biometric data, and pass background checks. There was no limit on the number of eligible individuals. Those who adjusted status could apply for naturalization after three years in LPR status. Unlike previous bills, the House-approved version did not grant conditional LPR status. The House-approved DREAM Act in the 111th Congress set criteria for eligible unauthorized students to obtain conditional nonimmigrant status, including good moral character, compliance with inadmissibility provisions, and maintaining U.S. residence. Those who adjusted status under the Act would not have counted for naturalization purposes and would have been eligible for student loans, federal work-study programs, and services, but not federal Pell Grants or federal supplemental educational opportunity grants. The House-approved DREAM Act in the 111th Congress set criteria for eligible unauthorized students to obtain conditional nonimmigrant status. The Act allowed for lawful presence for most purposes, except for certain provisions related to healthcare. It also deemed aliens adjusting to LPR status eligible for federal public assistance after five years. Representative Berman's American Dream Act aimed to repeal restrictions on state provision of postsecondary educational benefits to unlawfully present individuals. H.R. 1751 aimed to eliminate restrictions on state provision of postsecondary educational benefits to unlawfully present aliens and allow eligible unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal. Aliens could apply for cancellation of removal without being placed in removal proceedings, with no limit on the number granted. Eligibility criteria included being physically present in the US for at least five years, good moral character, and not being inadmissible or deportable on criminal, security, or INA grounds. H.R. 1751 aimed to allow unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal. It did not require a specific age at enactment and provided expedited processing without extra fees. Conditional permanent resident status would be granted for six years, counting towards naturalization. Under H.R. 1751, unauthorized students could adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal. Conditional permanent resident status would be granted for six years, with requirements such as demonstrating good moral character, maintaining U.S. residence, and meeting education or military service criteria. Temporary restrictions on federal student financial aid eligibility would apply to aliens under this provision. Under H.R. 1751, unauthorized students could adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal, with temporary restrictions on federal student financial aid eligibility. Aliens adjusting status under the bill would have been eligible for student loans, federal work-study programs, and services, but not for federal Pell Grants and federal supplemental educational opportunity grants while in conditional permanent resident status. Once the conditional basis was removed and they became full-fledged LPRs, these restrictions would no longer have applied. In contrast to the House-approved version of the DREAM Act and various Senate bills, aliens who obtained full-fledged LPR status would have remained ineligible for grants. H.R. 6327 The Citizenship and Service Act of 2010 (H.R. 6327), introduced by Representative Charles Djou, was similar to H.R. 1751 in many respects but notably different in others. H.R. 6327, similar to H.R. 1751, would enable unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal. However, it would require eligible aliens to serve in the uniformed services for at least two years to become full-fledged LPRs, with no alternative for higher education. There would be no limit on the number of aliens granted cancellation of removal/adjustment of status under H.R. 6327. To be eligible for cancellation of removal/adjustment of status under H.R. 6327, an alien must have been physically present in the US for at least five years, not yet reached age 16 at initial entry, shown good moral character, and met education requirements. They must also demonstrate they are not inadmissible or deportable on criminal, security, or smuggling grounds. Expedited processing without an additional fee is provided. H.R. 1751 and H.R. 6327 allowed expedited processing of applications without extra fees. Aliens granted cancellation of removal would initially become conditional permanent residents for six years. This status could be terminated and had to be removed for naturalization. To become a full-fledged LPR, aliens had to demonstrate good moral character, maintain U.S. residence, and serve in the military for at least two years. H.R. 6327, similar to H.R. 1751, imposed temporary restrictions on aliens adjusting to LPR status, making them ineligible for federal student financial aid. Conditional residents under the bill would not have the option of higher education instead of serving in the military for at least two years. Once the conditional basis was removed, these restrictions no longer applied. The DREAM Act bills introduced by Senator Durbin aimed to repeal restrictions on state provision of educational benefits to unauthorized students and allow them to adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal. The bills enabled aliens to apply for cancellation of removal without being placed in removal proceedings and placed no limit on the number of aliens granted this status adjustment. The DREAM Act bills introduced by Senator Durbin aimed to allow unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal. Eligibility required physical presence in the US for at least five years, good moral character, and meeting education criteria. Inadmissibility and deportability on certain grounds were disqualifying factors. The DREAM Act bills introduced by Senator Durbin aimed to allow unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal. Eligibility required physical presence in the US for at least five years, good moral character, and meeting education criteria. S. 729 and S. 3827 included provisions for expedited application processing and establishing deadlines for submission. Aliens granted cancellation of removal would initially be adjusted to conditional permanent resident status, valid for six years and subject to termination. To become a full-fledged LPR under the DREAM Act bills introduced by Senator Durbin, an alien had to meet various requirements, including demonstrating good moral character, maintaining U.S. residence, and either earning a degree or serving in the military. The time spent as a conditional LPR would count towards naturalization, but the condition had to be removed before applying for naturalization. Aliens adjusting status under S. 729 or S. 3827 would have been eligible only for student loans, federal work-study programs, and services, but ineligible for federal Pell Grants or federal supplemental educational opportunity grants. S. 3962 and S. 3963, both titled the DREAM Act of 2010, differed in the cutoff age for eligibility for cancellation of removal/adjustment of status. S. 3962 and S. 3963, similar to S. 3827, would have allowed unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status through cancellation of removal. They differed from S. 3827 by not repealing IIRIRA Section 505, which restricted state provision of educational benefits to unlawfully present aliens. These bills would have allowed aliens to apply for cancellation of removal without being in removal proceedings, with no limit on the number of approvals. There would have been a deadline for initial applications. The eligibility requirements for cancellation of removal/adjustment of status under S. 3962 and S. 3963 included being physically present in the US for at least five years, not reaching age 16 at initial entry, and demonstrating good moral character. Age requirements at enactment were under 35 for S. 3962 and under 30 for S. 3963. Under bills S. 3962 and S. 3963, aliens applying for relief had to demonstrate admission to a US institution of higher education or a high school diploma. They needed to show they were not inadmissible on criminal, security, smuggling, polygamy, or child abduction grounds, and not deportable on criminal, security, or smuggling grounds. Conditional permanent resident status was granted for six years, subject to termination, after which aliens could apply for adjustment of status. Under bills S. 3962 and S. 3963, aliens applying for relief had to demonstrate admission to a US institution of higher education or a high school diploma. Conditional permanent resident status was granted for six years, subject to termination. To become a full-fledged LPR, an alien had to meet additional requirements such as demonstrating good moral character, not abandoning U.S. residence, and either earning a degree from a US institution of higher education or serving in the uniformed services for at least two years. S. 3962 and S. 3963 placed restrictions on the eligibility of aliens who adjusted to LPR status. Under bills S. 3962 and S. 3963, aliens applying for relief had to demonstrate admission to a US institution of higher education or a high school diploma. Conditional permanent resident status was granted for six years, subject to termination. Aliens adjusting status under these bills would only be eligible for student loans, federal work-study programs, and services, but not federal Pell Grants or federal supplemental educational opportunity grants. S. 3992, another version of the DREAM Act, also allowed eligible unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status in the US, with similar legalization provisions to the House-approved DREAM Act amendment. S. 3992, a version of the DREAM Act, allowed eligible unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status in the US through cancellation of removal procedure. There was no limit on the number of aliens who could be granted cancellation of removal under S. 3992. Under S. 3992, aliens eligible for cancellation of removal/conditional nonimmigrant status had to meet requirements similar to the House-approved version of the DREAM Act. This included demonstrating continuous presence in the US for at least five years, good moral character, being under 16 at initial entry, and under 30 at enactment. They also had to show admission to higher education or a high school diploma in the US, and no previous deportation orders, with some exceptions. Under S. 3992, applicants for relief had to meet requirements similar to the House-approved DREAM Act, including demonstrating continuous presence in the US, good moral character, education qualifications, and no previous deportation orders. There were no surcharges on applications, and grounds of inadmissibility and deportability applied. Applicants also needed to satisfy requirements concerning convictions, submit biometric data for background checks, and register under the Military Selective Service Act. Aliens granted conditional nonimmigrant status under S. 3992 would have had to meet requirements similar to the DREAM Act, including demonstrating good moral character, maintaining U.S. residence, and meeting education qualifications. The conditional status would have been valid for 10 years and could be terminated. Adjustment to LPR status would require submitting an application and meeting specified criteria. The eligibility requirements for aliens under S. 3992 included completion of higher education or two years in a bachelor's program, service in the Armed Forces for two years, English language and civic requirements, payment of federal taxes, submission of biometric data, and background checks. There was no limit on the number of eligible individuals. Those who adjusted status could apply for naturalization after three years in LPR status, excluding time spent in conditional status. S. 3992, similar to the House-approved DREAM Act amendment, placed restrictions on aliens adjusting status for federal student financial aid. Aliens under S. 3992 could access student loans and work-study programs but not Pell Grants or educational opportunity grants. Conditional nonimmigrants under S. 3992 would have specific provisions for other purposes. The bill allowed conditional nonimmigrants to be considered lawfully present for most purposes, except for certain provisions related to healthcare subsidies. It also deemed aliens who adjusted to LPR status under the bill to have met the five-year eligibility period for federal public assistance."
