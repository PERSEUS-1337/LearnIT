    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fair Pay Restoration Act\". The Fair Pay Restoration Act addresses the Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., which undermines statutory protections against discrimination in compensation established by Congress. The Court's limitation on filing discriminatory compensation claims goes against the intent of Congress and ignores the reality of wage discrimination. The Fair Pay Restoration Act clarifies that it does not limit an aggrieved person's right to introduce evidence of discrimination outside the time for filing a charge. It also does not change the law regarding pension benefits as of May 28, 2007. SEC. 3. DISCRIMINATION IN COMPENSATION BASED ON RACE, COLOR, RELIGION, SEX, OR NATIONAL ORIGIN. Section 706(e) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include provisions regarding unlawful employment practices related to discrimination in compensation. Liability may accrue for discriminatory compensation decisions, and aggrieved individuals may seek relief, including back pay for up to 2 years preceding the filing.

SEC. 4. DISCRIMINATION IN COMPENSATION BECAUSE OF AGE. Section 7(d) of the Age Discrimination Act of 1967 is amended to clarify that discriminatory compensation decisions or practices are considered unlawful under the Act. This includes instances when a discriminatory decision is made, when a person is affected by it, or when compensation is paid. Discriminatory compensation decisions or practices are considered unlawful under the Age Discrimination Act of 1967, including instances when wages, benefits, or other compensation is paid as a result of such decisions. SEC. 5. APPLICATION TO OTHER LAWS. The amendments made by section 102 apply to claims of discrimination in compensation under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The amendments made in 1990 determine violations in employment discrimination complaints and make conforming amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 were amended in 1990 to address discrimination in compensation claims. The Act and its amendments are effective as of May 28, 2007, applying to pending discrimination claims in compensation under various acts."
