    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Internet Tax Moratorium and Equity Act\". The Congress finds that the Internet Tax Freedom Act moratorium should be extended, states should simplify sales tax systems, and equal taxation for all sales transactions is essential. Congress may facilitate equal taxation in line with the Quill Corp. v. North Dakota Supreme Court decision. States simplifying tax systems should be allowed to address current inequities. The Congress supports extending the Internet Tax Freedom Act moratorium and believes states should simplify sales tax systems to achieve equal taxation for all sales transactions. States should lead in developing fair and efficient sales and use tax collection systems to address current inequities. Online consumer privacy is crucial for electronic commerce growth and must be safeguarded. The Internet Tax Freedom Act moratorium is extended through December 31, 2005. Additionally, there is a call for states to streamline sales and use tax systems for fair taxation. Development of Streamlined System: States and localities should collaborate to create a centralized, multi-state registration system for sellers, uniform definitions for taxable goods/services, rules for attributing transactions to taxing jurisdictions, and procedures for exempt purchasers and seller liability. The streamlined system should include uniform procedures for software certification, bad debt rules, tax return formats, electronic filing methods, state administration of sales taxes, audit procedures, seller compensation, and exemption from use tax collection requirements. The Congress proposes an exemption from use tax collection for remote sellers below a $5,000,000 threshold in annual sales, along with protections for consumer privacy and other features deemed necessary by states to promote simplicity, uniformity, neutrality, efficiency, and fairness. This system is not expected to burden interstate commerce or hinder the growth of electronic commerce. SEC. 5. INTERSTATE SALES AND USE TAX COMPACT. Authorization and Consent: States can enter into an Interstate Sales and Use Tax Compact with Congress's consent. The Compact must establish a uniform tax system and states joining must adopt it. The authorization expires if the Compact is not formed by January 1, 2006. Congressional consent can be withdrawn if the Compact is disapproved by Congress. The Compact can be withdrawn if Congress disapproves it within 120 days after adoption by the States. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION TO SIMPLIFY STATE USE-TAX RATES THROUGH AVERAGING. State use tax rates can be simplified through averaging, with a single, uniform State-wide use-tax rate imposed on all remote sales. The rate must not exceed the weighted average of sales tax rates from the prior calendar year. Annual option for remote sellers to collect actual State and local use taxes, ensuring that the total taxes assessed do not exceed the amount collected during the calendar year. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION TO REQUIRE COLLECTION OF USE TAXES. States that adopt the Compact system may require sellers to collect and remit sales taxes on remote sales to purchasers in the state. States not adopting the system cannot enforce this requirement. The authority granted does not affect the determination of nexus for sellers. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement allows states to require sellers to collect sales taxes on remote sales. This authority does not impact the determination of nexus for sellers in other tax matters. SEC. 8. LIMITATION: This Act does not subject sellers to certain taxes or licensing requirements of states or political subdivisions. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"State\" refers to any State in the United States, including the District of Columbia. \"Goods or services\" encompass tangible and intangible items. A \"remote sale\" is a sale in interstate commerce attributed to a specific taxing jurisdiction. The \"locus of remote sale\" refers to the location of a remote sale of goods or services. A remote sale is a sale of goods or services attributed to a specific taxing jurisdiction under the rules established in this Act."
