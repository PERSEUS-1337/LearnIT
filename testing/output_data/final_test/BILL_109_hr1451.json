    "content": "The \"Clean Smokestacks Act of 2005\" is a legislation aimed at reducing emissions from power plants under the Clean Air Act. The Clean Smokestacks Act of 2005 aims to reduce emissions from power plants by setting emission reduction objectives for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon dioxide, and mercury emissions by specific percentages from certain baseline levels. The Act also requires the Administrator to establish regulations within two years of enactment. The Administrator must promulgate regulations to achieve emission reduction objectives for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon dioxide, and mercury emissions in a manner that allocates required reductions equitably, considering previous reductions and other relevant factors. Market-oriented mechanisms may be included, except for mercury. The Administrator must promulgate regulations for emission reduction objectives, including market-oriented mechanisms, to achieve significant emission reductions in both Eastern and Western regions of the United States. Coordination between agencies is required to minimize costs. Incentives for renewable energy must be included in the regulations. The Administrator must coordinate with other government agencies to minimize costs and maximize gains in achieving emission reduction objectives. Additional reductions in emissions from powerplants may be required if necessary. The Administrator may require additional emission reductions from powerplants if necessary to protect public health or welfare. Powerplants must comply with new source performance standards and other requirements after a certain period of operation. The requirements of this section apply to powerplants with a capacity of 15 megawatts or more using combustion to generate electricity for sale, in addition to other Act requirements."
