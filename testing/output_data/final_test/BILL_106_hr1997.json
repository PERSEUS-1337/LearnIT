    "content": "The \"Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act of 1999\" is cited as the short title. It excludes amounts received due to unlawful discrimination from gross income. This amendment adds a new section, SEC. 139, to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act of 1999\" excludes amounts received on account of unlawful discrimination from gross income. Unlawful discrimination is defined as acts prohibited under specific laws. The curr_chunk lists various laws related to employment rights, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Rehabilitation Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, Title IX, Employee Polygraph Protection Act, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, and laws under Chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code. The curr_chunk lists specific sections of various laws related to employment rights, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Fair Housing Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, Violence Against Women Act, and whistleblower protection provisions. The curr_chunk discusses provisions of State or local laws and common law claims related to civil rights enforcement and employment relationships. It also addresses protection against discharge, discrimination, and retaliation for asserting rights under Federal, State, or local law. The curr_chunk discusses limitations on tax based on income averaging for backpay and frontpay received on account of certain unlawful employment discrimination. The effective date for the amendment is after December 31, 1998. The curr_chunk explains that if a taxpayer receives employment discrimination backpay or frontpay during a taxable year, the tax imposed for that year should not exceed a certain amount. This includes calculating the tax as if the backpay or frontpay were not included in gross income and no deduction was allowed for expenses related to the discrimination claim. The curr_chunk defines employment discrimination backpay or frontpay as amounts received due to unlawful employment discrimination. It also specifies that the tax imposed on such payments should be calculated as if they were the taxpayer's only income for the year, with no deductions allowed. The terms 'backpay' and 'frontpay' refer to gross income amounts attributable to compensation for services performed or would have been performed in relation to a claimed violation of law as an employee, former employee, or prospective employee. The terms 'backpay period' and 'frontpay period' define the duration of services performed or foregone employment related to a claimed violation of law. The backpay period is the time for which backpay is owed, while the frontpay period is the period of lost employment opportunities. If these periods do not align with whole taxable years, they are rounded up to the next highest whole number of taxable years. The term 'average annual net backpay and frontpay amount' is defined as the excess of employment discrimination backpay and frontpay over the deductions that would have been allowable, divided by the number of years in the backpay and frontpay period. The amendments made by this section apply to income from backpay or frontpay received on account of certain unlawful employment discrimination starting from taxable years after December 31, 1998. Additionally, income averaging for backpay and frontpay received on account of certain unlawful employment discrimination will not increase alternative minimum tax liability. The amendment to Section 55(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 excludes income averaging for backpay or frontpay received due to unlawful employment discrimination when calculating regular tax. This amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1998."
