    "content": "Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) are crucial for the Army's ability to rapidly deploy forces overseas. However, they face limitations in transport, reconnaissance, and firepower. To address these issues, the Army is implementing programs like the Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV)/Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV), Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV), and Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) using commercially available vehicles to reduce costs and deployment time. Congress may have concerns about the effectiveness of these programs. The Army is implementing programs like the Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV)/Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV), Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV), and Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) to address limitations faced by Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs). Congress may have concerns about the effectiveness of these programs and their impact on deployability, sustainability, and affordability of IBCTs. Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) are the basic combined-arms formations of the Army, consisting of Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs), Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs), and IBCTs. The Army is establishing Security Force Assistance Brigades (SFABs) in both the Active Component and the Army National Guard. SFABs are capable of conducting security force assistance operations at the tactical level and can be expanded into fully operational ABCTs or IBCTs if needed. Light IBCTs are foot-mobile forces that can move by foot, vehicle, or air. Airborne IBCTs are trained for parachute assaults. The Army's Field Manual on Brigade Combat Teams describes how IBCTs are employed to close with the enemy using fire and movement to destroy or capture enemy forces, or to repel enemy attacks by fire, close combat, and counterattack. Airborne IBCTs are specially trained and equipped to conduct parachute assaults, while Air Assault IBCTs are trained for helicopter assaults with additional specialized training and organic helicopter assets. The IBCT employs fire and movement to suppress, neutralize, or destroy the enemy at all echelons. It performs complementary missions such as controlling land areas, populations, and resources, optimizing for offense against various threats in restrictive terrain, and conducting stability operations. IBCTs are versatile and can easily configure for different mission requirements. The IBCT is versatile and easily configures for different mission requirements, including area defense and mobile defense. Its lack of heavy combat vehicles reduces logistic requirements and provides greater flexibility for higher commanders. General Mark A. Milley describes a changing operational environment with technology, geopolitics, and demographics shaping the future of warfare. The future of warfare will be characterized by unprecedented effects on forces and how they fight, with advancements in long-range radars, air defense systems, precision weapons, electronic warfare, and cyber capabilities enabling adversaries to threaten allies. Conflict will require rapid decision-making, assembly, and action, with ambiguous actors, information wars, and advanced technologies blurring the lines between war and peace, combatant and noncombatant, and friend and foe. Warfare in the future will involve transporting, fighting, and sustaining geographically dispersed forces over long distances in contested environments. Air and maritime superiority, previously American advantages, will no longer be guaranteed. Close combat on sensor-rich battlefields will be faster, more violent, and lethal. Operations will likely occur in complex urban terrain, presenting challenges for IBCTs. In the evolving operational environment, IBCTs face challenges due to advancements in Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) technology and weapons, making traditional insertion methods less feasible. An \"off set insertion\" may be necessary, requiring ground forces to move by land to the objective. This concept mirrors tactics used by special operations and reconnaissance units, utilizing light vehicles for mobility. The Army describes IBCT critical capability gaps as lacking the ability to decisively close with and destroy the enemy under restricted terrains such as mountains, littorals, jungles, subterranean areas, and urban areas. They also lack the ability to maneuver and survive in close combat against hardened enemy fortifications, light armored vehicles, and dismounted personnel. IBCTs lack mobile protected firepower capability for engaging hardened enemy bunkers, light armored vehicles, and dismounted personnel. The Army's Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) lack the mobility and protected firepower needed to overcome enemy fortifications, armored vehicles, and dismounted personnel in various terrains. To address this, the Army is developing Ground Mobility Vehicles (GMV) and Infantry Squad Vehicles (ISV) to increase tactical mobility, allow rapid deployment into contested areas, and limit the impact on strategic mobility of the IBCT. The GMV/ISV, LRV, and MPF are intended to provide mobility, protection, and lethality to the Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT). The GMV/ISV can transport nine soldiers with a 3,200-pound capacity, while the LRV offers protection with scouts, sensors, and medium-caliber weapons. The MPF enhances the IBCT's capability to engage and destroy fortifications, bunkers, buildings, and light to medium armored vehicles. The vehicles are designed for 75% cross-country mobility, 10% primary roads, 10% secondary roads, and 5% urban rubble environments, with protection provided by high mobility and Personal Protection Equipment (PPE). The Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) require a vehicle with capability for crew-served weapons, communication equipment, and Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) organic equipment. It should be transportable by CH-47 and C-130, have a range of over 300 miles, and provide mobility in various terrains. The vehicle should have medium-caliber weapons for precision lethality, protection from small arms, and capacity for six scouts. Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) should be sufficient for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Reconnaissance, and Surveillance (C4ISR) operations. The Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) require a vehicle with sufficient Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) for current and future communications integration. It should support scout sensor packages, have a 300-kilometer range, and be capable of operating in various terrains. The vehicle should have lethality to defeat defensive fortifications and armored vehicles, protection with scalable armor, and communication network support. The Army plans to acquire vehicles as modified Non-Developmental Item (NDI) platforms, skipping the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase. Existing vehicles with minor modifications can meet Army requirements, chosen based on a survey of potential candidates. The MPF underwent an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) due to being less developed than the GMV. The MPF underwent an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) as part of the Material Solution Analysis phase, completed on September 7, 2017. The NDI approach for all three vehicles could lead to a shorter acquisition timeline and less expensive overall acquisition. The Army established the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) program in June 2018 to replace the M-2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle. The NGCV Program, established in June 2018, includes the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV), Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV), Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF), Robotic Combat Vehicles (RCVs), and the Decisive Lethality Platform (DLP) as replacements for various military vehicles. The NGCV Program is overseen by the Army Futures Command (AFC) NGCV Cross Functional Team (CFT), with the MPF program still under the Program Executive Office (PEO) Ground Combat Systems. The Army's Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) acquisition objective is 2,065 vehicles for the Army and 317 vehicles for US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC). The Army's FY2018 budget request modified the acquisition strategy, splitting it into two phases. The first phase involves procuring GMVs for the five Airborne IBCTs through a USSOCOM contract for the Flyer 72 vehicle from General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems. The specific near-term requirement is 295 vehicles for the Airborne IBCTs and 317 vehicles for USASOC. The Army's Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) acquisition objective is 2,065 vehicles for the Army and 317 vehicles for US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC). The first phase involves procuring 295 GMV 1.1 vehicles for the five Airborne IBCTs through a USSOCOM contract. The Army plans to spend $194.8 million for 718 vehicles from FY2018 to FY2022, with a contract award expected in FY2020. Additionally, the Army established the Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV) program to equip other types of IBCTs. The ISV program is planned to be a larger competitive program with similar operational requirements as the GMV program. The Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV) program is planned to field 2,065 vehicles to Active and Reserve Components. The projected production quantities for the next five fiscal years are: FY2020: 17 vehicles, FY2021: 118 vehicles, FY2022: 177 vehicles, FY2023: 177 vehicles, FY2024: 162 vehicles. The acquisition timeline includes a Draft RFP in March 2019, Prototype Contract Awards in August 2019, and Production Contract Award in March 2020. Army officials initially considered using the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) as an interim Light Reconnaissance Vehicle (LRV). The Army's interim LRV solution is the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle-Reconnaissance Vehicle (JLTV-RV). The standard JLTV does not meet the weight and crew requirements for the LRV as envisioned. The Army planned for the LRV to be fielded in IBCT Cavalry Squadrons and Infantry Battalion Scout Platoons. The future of the JLTV-RV effort is uncertain as funds were not requested in the FY2020 budget. The Army began an Analysis of Alternatives for MPF candidates in October 2016. The EMD phase for MPF is planned to start in FY2019 and last through FY2022. The Army's Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) development phase is set to begin in FY2019 and last through FY2022, with an anticipated Milestone C by FY2022. The Army plans to procure 504 MPF vehicles at a unit manufacturing cost target of $6.4 million per vehicle. Contracts were awarded to BAE Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) to build MPF prototypes, with a total program cost estimated at $3 billion to $3.5 billion. The Marine Corps is also monitoring MPF development for possible use in its tank battalions, potentially increasing procurement to around 600 vehicles. The Army awarded contracts to BAE Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems to build MPF prototypes for testing before selecting one company to deliver up to 28 LRIP vehicles. BAE proposed a modified version of the Army's M-8 Armored Gun System, while GDLS integrated an M-1 Abrams turret onto the British Ajax Scout Vehicle hull, creating the Griffin III. The FY2020 Army GMV budget request includes procurement funding for 69 GMVs for the U.S. Army Special Operations Command and 15 ISVs for the Army, with additional RDT&E funding for operational testing. The Army's interim LRV solution is referred to as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle-Reconnaissance Vehicle (JLTV-RV). The FY2020 Army MPF budget request supports the procurement of MPF vehicles. The FY2020 Army MPF budget request for $310.152 million in RDT&E funding supports rapid prototyping efforts for the Light Tactical Vehicle-Reconnaissance Vehicle (JLTV-RV). The Army did not request funding for the LRV, raising concerns about its future. The Army's plan to establish Security Force Assistance Brigades (SFABs) may address reconnaissance needs in IBCTs. The Army plans to expand SFABs into fully operational ABCTs or IBCTs for major combat operations, potentially impacting the need for additional vehicles. Congress may want to know the number of extra vehicles required and how they will be procured and maintained. Little is known about the Army's fielding plan for these vehicles, including when they will arrive at units and if active or National Guard IBCTs will receive them first. The Army's fielding plan for new vehicles is unclear, including the timing of their arrival at units and whether active or National Guard units will receive them first. Questions remain about the concurrent receipt of vehicles, the overall fielding timeline, and challenges associated with fielding different vehicles with varying production and delivery dates."
