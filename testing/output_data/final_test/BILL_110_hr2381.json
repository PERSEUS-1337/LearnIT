Additionally, it addresses computer modeling and research in the region. The \"Upper Mississippi River Basin Protection Act\" includes provisions for sediment and nutrient monitoring, data collection, collaboration, reporting, and a National Research Council assessment. It also covers computer modeling and research in the region, authorization of appropriations, and cost-sharing requirements. The Act defines the Upper Mississippi River Basin as the watershed portion of the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois River basins, including the Kaskaskia and Meramec watersheds. It establishes the Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative for monitoring nutrient and sediment loss in the Basin using sound science methods. The Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative aims to quantify nutrient and sediment sources, transport, and fate, as well as the impact of treatment methods on nutrient and sediment loss. Sound science methods, including documented protocols and peer review, are essential for data collection and analysis. The Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative emphasizes the importance of sound science in Federal investments in the region. This includes establishing a monitoring network for sediment and nutrient levels. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a sediment and nutrient monitoring network for the Upper Mississippi River Basin to identify sources, quantify processes, record changes over time, provide data for computer modeling, and identify major sources of sediment and nutrients. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a sediment and nutrient monitoring network for the Upper Mississippi River Basin to identify sources and quantify processes. The United States Geological Survey will assist in carrying out this task. SEC. 102. DATA COLLECTION AND STORAGE RESPONSIBILITIES. The Secretary of the Interior will establish guidelines for sediment and nutrient monitoring data collection, storage, and reporting. Data from the Upper Mississippi River Basin monitoring will be released to the public with generic identifiers. Privacy protection measures are in place for data collected in the Basin. The data collected in the Upper Mississippi River Basin will be subject to disclosure provisions under section 552 of title 5, United States Code, but can only be released as specified in subsection (b). SEC. 103. RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT MONITORING. The Secretary of the Interior will inventory existing sediment and nutrient monitoring efforts to understand overlap, data gaps, and redundancies. They will integrate these efforts into the monitoring network required by section 101, making maximum use of existing data and ongoing programs. The Secretary of the Interior will coordinate with the long-term estuary assessment project while developing the sediment and nutrient monitoring network required by section 101. The Secretary of the Interior will collaborate with other monitoring programs to establish the sediment and nutrient monitoring network. Reporting to Congress on the network's development is required within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The National Research Council will assess water resources in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. TITLE II--COMPUTER MODELING AND RESEARCH\n\nSEC. 201. COMPUTER MODELING AND RESEARCH OF SEDIMENT AND NUTRIENT SOURCES. The Upper Mississippi River Stewardship Initiative requires the establishment of a modeling program by the Director of the United States Geological Survey to identify significant sources of sediment and nutrients in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Computer modeling will be used to pinpoint subwatersheds contributing to sediment and nutrient loss for targeted reduction efforts. The program includes models relating nutrient and sediment loss to landscape, land use, and management practices, as well as defining river channel nutrient transformation processes. Models will define river channel nutrient transformation processes by collecting ancillary information in GIS format, including land use, soils, elevation, sediment and nutrient reduction actions, and remotely sensed data. The Director of the US Geological Survey will establish an Internet system within 90 days to provide information on programs, sediment/nutrient levels, and successful projects in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. SEC. 203. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Director of the US Geological Survey will provide annual reports on monitoring activities in the Upper Mississippi River Basin and progress reports on modeling activities to Congress and the public. SEC. 301. Authorization of Appropriations: $6,250,000 annually for US Geological Survey activities, with one-third for Cooperative Water Program and the rest for Hydrologic Networks and Analysis Program. $650,000 for National Research Council assessment. SEC. 302. Cost-sharing requirements. SEC. 302. Funds for the US Geological Survey Cooperative Water Program must adhere to cost-sharing requirements outlined in the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act of 2006."
