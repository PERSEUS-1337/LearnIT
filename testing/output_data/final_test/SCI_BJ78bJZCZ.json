    "content": "The Recurrent Weighted Average (RWA) unit outperforms LSTM in capturing long term dependencies but struggles with changing requirements. The Recurrent Discounted Attention (RDA) unit improves on RWA by allowing the discounting of the past. Empirical comparisons show RDA, RWA, and GRU units learn quicker and perform better than LSTM on single output tasks. RDA excels on the multiple sequence copy task. Our RDA unit outperforms LSTM and GRU on the multiple sequence copy task, learning three times faster than them. On the Wikipedia character prediction task, LSTM performs the best, closely followed by our RDA unit. Overall, our RDA unit excels in performance. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, are effective at capturing long term dependencies in sequential data such as language, music, and video. LSTMs store information from the past in a hidden state that is combined with the latest input at each timestep, allowing them to learn difficult sequential tasks effectively. The attention mechanism in neural networks allows for accessing information from anywhere in the input sequence, providing flexibility in choosing where to focus during translation tasks. Introduced to RNNs by BID2 for neural machine translation, it calculates a weighted average of different locations within the encoded state for each translated word. The Recurrent Weighted Average (RWA) unit, introduced by BID17, allows for attention to sequences of any length by computing attention for each input once and maintaining a running average. It performs well when information is needed from any point in the input sequence but struggles with multiple tasks in the same sequence or predicting the next character in text samples. The Recurrent Discounted Attention (RDA) unit extends the RWA by discounting attention to previous timesteps, making it efficient for tasks where new information is crucial. It outperforms the RWA in tasks requiring equal weighting over all information seen and tasks where new information is more important. The main contributions include analyzing the RWA, introducing the RDA, and showing that RDA, RWA, and GRU units are suitable for tasks with a single output. The RDA unit extends the RWA by discounting attention to previous timesteps, making it efficient for tasks where new information is crucial. It outperforms the RWA in tasks requiring equal weighting over all information seen and tasks where new information is more important. The experimental results, discussion, and conclusion of the paper follow the analysis of the RWA and proposal of the RDA. Various architectures and regularization techniques have achieved impressive performance in predicting the next character in a text corpus using RNNs, with the GRU being a simpler design compared to other complex architectures. The GRU is a simpler design compared to complex architectures like LSTM, but achieves similar performance. Attention mechanisms have been used in neural machine translation, with hard-attention selecting a single location from a distribution. Global and local attention refer to attention applied to the whole input and a local subset. Providing additional computation time for difficult inputs yields insight into the input data distribution. RNN architectures store information in external memory to deal with long term dependencies. The Recurrent Weighted Average model uses current hidden state and input to calculate features and attention weights, resulting in superior performance compared to LSTM on certain tasks. The LSTM excels at tasks requiring combining inputs into a single output, such as classifying sequences and adding numbers. However, it may not work effectively for tasks like copying input sequences or predicting the next character in a text, where recent inputs are more important. The Recurrent Weighted Average (RWA) may not be Turing Complete as a t must grow geometrically with time to output the sequence h t = \u22121 t c for 0 < c < 1. If a t is bounded, it cannot grow geometrically for all time, indicating limitations of the RWA. The Recurrent Weighted Average (RWA) may not be Turing Complete due to limitations in handling sequences with multiple results or tasks that require forgetting. The Recurrent Discounted Average (RDA) uses the current hidden state and input to calculate features, attention, and a discount factor for a moving average, addressing the RWA's inability to forget the past. The mechanism of the Recurrent Weighted Average (RWA) is improved by allowing different functions for attention and hidden state transformation. Choices for the attention function include exponential, ReLU, softplus, and sigmoid functions. The hidden activation function is determined by the average of nt dt values, with options like linear and exponential functions. The Recurrent Weighted Average (RWA) uses linear domain of tanh for nt dt values. The identity function is chosen for hidden state transformation in the RDA. Output function choices include identity and tanh functions. Training process details include Xavier initialization for weights, mini-batches of 100 examples, and backpropagation over full sequence length. For the Wikipedia task, character embedding of 64 dimensions is used with a single layer of 1800 recurrent units. Truncated backpropagation is applied every 250 timesteps, and TensorFlow is used for all experiments. Exponential attention performs well with the tanh output function. Using Softplus for attention function is more stable than ReLU. The RDA-exp-tanh and RDA-sigmoid-id attention mechanisms perform well in various tasks. RDA-exp-tanh trains faster but may diverge with NaN errors, while RDA-sigmoid-id is more stable with better loss. The study investigates if RDA can perform single-task sequences as effectively as RWA. Four tasks require the RNN to retain input sequences before outputting a result later. The study explores the performance of RNN architectures in various tasks, including sequence classification, MNIST digit classification, and addition of two numbers. Different RNN architectures are evaluated based on their ability to learn long-range dependencies and initial hidden state learning. The study evaluates different RNN architectures in tasks like sequence classification and addition of two numbers. It compares models like GF-LSTM, Grid-LSTM, MI-LSTM, Recurrent Memory Array Structures, HyperNetworks, LayerNorm HyperNetworks, and Recurrent Highway Networks. The study also explores tasks like permuted image pixels and multiple sequence copy tasks.

It compares models like GF-LSTM, Grid-LSTM, MI-LSTM, Recurrent Memory Array Structures, HyperNetworks, LayerNorm HyperNetworks, and Recurrent Highway Networks. The study also explores tasks like permuted image pixels and multiple sequence copy tasks. In the evaluation of RNN models, the recall symbol consistently appears a couple of steps after the memorized sequence, allowing for 50 consecutive copying tasks in a 1000-character input sequence. The models are tested on the Hutter Prize Wikipedia dataset enwik8, split into training, validation, and test sets. The RWA unit performs well on single task sequences but struggles with multiple sequence copy tasks. The RDA unit performs well on various tasks, including single sequence tasks, multiple sequence copy tasks, and Wikipedia character prediction tasks. It shows better generalization on the MNIST test sets compared to RWA. The ability to forget effectively allows the RDA unit to compress information and vary attention on previous inputs based on later inputs. It outperforms LSTM and GRU units on the multiple sequence copy task and achieves a better compression rate than GRU on the Wikipedia character prediction task. The LSTM unit learns single task sequences slower than other units and often fails to learn. It performs best on the Wikipedia character prediction task, achieving better compression than other units. The GRU unit works well on single task sequences, learning the fastest and achieving excellent generalization on the MNIST test sets. It has equal performance to the LSTM on multiple sequence copy tasks. Our results show that different neural network architectures are suited for different tasks. For single output tasks, RWA, RDA, and GRU units work best. RDA unit should be used for sequences with an unknown number of independent tasks. LSTM performs best on the Wikipedia character prediction task. RWA unit's weakness is the inability to forget the past, which is addressed in the RDA unit. Discounted Attention (RDA) is recommended over RWA for various tasks, as it is a flexible RNN unit that performs well. Different RNN units excel in different tasks: RWA, RDA, and GRU are best for single output tasks, RDA is optimal for multiple sequence copy tasks, and LSTM is best for the Wikipedia character prediction task. Consider these results when choosing a unit for real-world applications. Discounted Attention (RDA) is recommended over RWA for various tasks due to its flexibility and performance. RWA, RDA, and GRU excel in single output tasks, while RDA is optimal for multiple sequence copy tasks. LSTM is best for the Wikipedia character prediction task. In the context of RWA, if activation grows geometrically, it cannot be bounded, leading to contradictions in the output sequence. The experiments show that the two versions of the RDA unit consistently perform well across various tasks, with figures illustrating the loss function learning curves and validation accuracy for MNIST."
