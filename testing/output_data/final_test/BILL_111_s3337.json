    "content": "The \"Oil Spill Claims Assistance and Recovery Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends Title II of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 by adding a new section 208 for oil spill claims assistance and recovery. The Secretary will establish a grant program to provide technical assistance grants to eligible organizations helping individuals and businesses affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Organizations must submit an application to receive a grant and can use the funds for education, outreach, intake, and language services. The grant program will provide technical assistance for individuals and businesses affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, including intake, language services, accounting, legal services, damage assessments, economic loss analysis, documentation preparation, and claims filing assistance. Assistance can be sought from responsible parties, the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, or insurance policies. The grant program can be used to pay for salaries, training, expenses related to property purchase, equipment, and travel. It can also assist organizations in various ways and establish an advisory board of service providers and technical experts. The Oil Spill Claims Assistance and Recovery Act establishes a grant program to monitor the claims process and provide recommendations for improvement. Funds from the grant cannot be used for compensation related to the oil spill. The Secretary must provide grants within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary is encouraged to consider grant applications from organizations with networks in affected business sectors such as fishery, aquaculture, restaurant, grocery, food processing, food delivery, hotel, and tourism industries. Eligible organizations receiving grants must receive training on the rules and procedures for the claims process related to the oil spill within 30 days. The procedures for the claims process related to the oil spill include availability of funds for up to 6 years after the spill and authorization of $20,000,000 for the Secretary to carry out this section. A conforming amendment is made to the Public Works and Economic Development Administration Act of 1965. Oil spill claims assistance and recovery is provided under Sec. 208, with $20,000,000 authorized for the Secretary to carry out this section."
