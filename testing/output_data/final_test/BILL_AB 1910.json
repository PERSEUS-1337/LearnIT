    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Fix Our Roads Act, also known as the Fix Our Roads Act, addresses the significant funding shortfalls for state highway maintenance and local street repairs in California. The state's neglect of roads and highways has led to a substantial need for rehabilitation and reconstruction work on a large portion of the highway system. California ranks 45th in the US for highway condition and performance, with congestion costing motorists $20.4 billion annually. Los Angeles and the Bay Area see an average of 61 hours lost to congestion, costing $1,300 per motorist. The commercial sector ships $1.34 trillion in goods from California, with traffic congestion adding $1.7 billion in operational costs for the trucking industry. Californians pay the fourth highest gas tax in the nation. In 2015, California expanded its cap-and-trade program to include transportation fuels, adding 10 cents to the cost of a gallon of gas. This \"hidden tax\" is expected to increase to between 13 and 20 cents per gallon over the next five years, making Californians pay the highest gas tax in the nation. This tax will generate $1-3 billion annually but does not support road maintenance. Additionally, during the last recession, the Legislature diverted $1 billion per year in truck weight fees from road maintenance to the state's General Fund. General Fund spending increased by over $15 billion from 2013-14 to 2015-16, with none of the new spending directly supporting road maintenance. The state is projected to have an $11.5 billion surplus in the 2016-17 fiscal year. The Legislature borrowed $482 million from the Traffic Congestion Relief Program in 2001, which has not been repaid. Construction of a $68 billion high-speed rail project is being funded, with taxpayers facing $650 million per year in bond debt service over the next 30 years. California's highway maintenance costs have tripled over 10 years, while gas tax revenue remains steady. A review found Caltrans is overstaffed by 3,500 employees costing over $500 million annually. Gas taxes and vehicle fees disproportionately affect low-income families. Californians already pay the highest gas prices in the nation. The Governor proposes increasing gas tax and vehicle registration fees to fund road maintenance due to the rising costs and stagnant gas tax revenue. Electric vehicle owners, who are mostly wealthy, do not pay gas tax, shifting the burden to lower-income Californians. A special election is called to be held on November 8, 2016, consolidated with the statewide general election. The Secretary of State will include an advisory question for voters at the election. The California Legislature is proposing a tax increase on gasoline and vehicle registrations to fund road maintenance. The Secretary of State will submit this measure to voters in the November 8, 2016, statewide general election. The California Legislature is proposing a tax increase on gasoline and vehicle registrations to fund road maintenance. Any measures placed on the ballot after the 131-day deadline for the November 8, 2016, election will be included in the order they qualified. The Secretary of State will provide information on the ballot measure in the election pamphlets. This act calls for an immediate election."
