    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Separation of Powers Restoration Act\" and includes findings. The Separation of Powers Restoration Act includes findings that emphasize the importance of limiting governmental power through the division of powers among three coequal branches of government. This division aims to prevent the exercise of arbitrary power and protect the people from autocracy. James Madison emphasized the importance of separating legislative and executive powers to preserve liberty. The Constitution vests legislative powers in Congress, and presidential proclamations are only binding when based on constitutional or statutory authority. The Supreme Court has affirmed that Congress retains its exclusive authority to make laws necessary to carry out constitutional powers, even if Presidents take actions without congressional approval. Treaties or Executive Agreements cannot assign powers not granted by the Constitution and are non-binding. The effect of presidential orders is outlined in Section 3. Presidential orders have limited effect and do not have the force of law, applying only to the executive branch. Exceptions include pardons, military orders related to the Commander in Chief's duties, and orders citing specific congressional authority. Presidential orders do not have the force of law, except for specific cases like pardons and military orders related to the Commander in Chief's duties. Orders must not violate the ninth or tenth amendments to the Constitution or delegate power to a foreign government without constitutional authority. The President must include a statement of authority for each Presidential order, specifying the legal basis for the action. Orders issued without this statement are invalid if based on congressional authority. Individuals have standing to challenge orders impacting separation of powers integrity. The Congress, House of Representatives, Senate, State and local governments, and individuals have the right to challenge Presidential orders that exceed authorized powers or violate the Constitution. The President must provide a statement of authority for each order, and orders without this statement are invalid if based on congressional authority. State and local governments or their representatives can challenge a Presidential order if it infringes on their powers. Aggrieved individuals affected by the order can also challenge it. National emergency power is divested to Congress. The Act divests the President and executive branch of the power to declare a national emergency, transferring it to Congress. It also terminates all powers and authorities resulting from existing national emergency declarations 90 days after the Act's enactment. The Act transfers the power to declare a national emergency from the President to Congress and terminates all powers and authorities resulting from existing national emergency declarations 90 days after the Act's enactment. Any pending actions, proceedings, or rights and duties that matured before the termination date are not affected by the Act. The term \"national emergency\" is defined as a general declaration of emergency made by the President or any other executive branch officer. In this Act, a \"Presidential order\" refers to any Executive order, Presidential proclamation, or directive with normative effect outside the executive branch issued by the President or another executive branch officer."
