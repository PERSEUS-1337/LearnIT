Recent methods in reinforcement learning, such as inverse RL and GAIL, address distribution shift issues by training an RL agent to match demonstrations without learning a reward function. The key idea of soft Q imitation learning (SQIL) is to incentivize the agent to match demonstrations over a long horizon by giving rewards for matching demonstrated actions in demonstrated states. SQIL outperforms behavior cloning (BC) and competes with GAIL in various tasks, showing its effectiveness in encouraging long-horizon imitation. This paper presents a proof of concept showing that a simple imitation method based on RL with constant rewards can be as effective as more complex methods. It focuses on training an agent to imitate an expert without observing a reward signal or querying the expert. Standard approaches based on behavioral cloning can cause the agent to drift away from demonstrated states due to compounding errors. Recent methods in reinforcement learning address the issue of agents drifting away from demonstrated states by training them to visit these states as well. This is achieved through inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), which construct reward signals from demonstrations. However, implementing these methods can be challenging in practice. The paper proposes a simpler approach to achieve the effectiveness of adversarial imitation methods without the need for adversarial training or learning a reward function. It aims to incentivize the agent to imitate demonstrated actions in demonstrated states and to return to these states when encountering new, out-of-distribution states by using constant rewards instead of learned rewards. This approach combines the benefits of both greedy methods like behavioral cloning (BC) and adversarial methods like GAIL. The approach proposed in the paper aims to incentivize the agent to imitate demonstrated actions in demonstrated states by providing constant rewards, without the need for adversarial training or learning a reward function. This method combines the benefits of behavioral cloning (BC) and adversarial methods like GAIL, implementing a regularized variant of BC that learns long-horizon imitation through sparse reward functions and reinforcement learning. The method proposed in the paper, called soft Q imitation learning (SQIL), initializes the agent's experience replay buffer with expert demonstrations and sets rewards to a constant value in both demonstration and new experiences. This allows the agent to learn in environments with stochastic dynamics and continuous states, even if the demonstrated states are not reachable. SQIL is effective in MDPs with high-dimensional, continuous observations and unknown dynamics. SQIL outperforms BC and achieves competitive results compared to GAIL in various environments. It overcomes the state distribution shift problem of BC without adversarial training or learning a reward function, making it easier to use with images. SQIL is simple to implement using existing Q-learning or off-policy actor-critic algorithms. The Soft Q Imitation Learning (SQIL) algorithm sets rewards to incentivize the agent to imitate the expert and stay close to demonstrated states. It balances demonstration experiences and new experiences in the replay buffer. The algorithm samples transitions with an imitation policy and updates the demonstration buffer until convergence. Soft Q Imitation Learning (SQIL) algorithm uses a soft Q function to replay demonstrations for off-policy learning. It can be applied in stochastic environments with high-dimensional states, even if the agent never encounters the demonstrated states. The algorithm utilizes a convolutional neural network or multi-layer perceptron to model the soft Q function. Additional implementation details are provided in the appendix. The SQIL algorithm uses a soft Q function to replay demonstrations for off-policy learning, with a default value of \u03bb samp = 1. Balancing demonstration and new experiences ensures effective reward remains at least 1/(1 + \u03bb samp) to prevent decay. SQIL performance is maintained by halting once the squared soft Bellman error loss converges. Other methods like GAIL and AIRL also use similar techniques.

SQIL performance is maintained by halting once the squared soft Bellman error loss converges. Other methods like GAIL and AIRL also use similar techniques. Adversarial IRL (AIRL) balance the number of positive and negative examples in the training set of the discriminator, and AIRL tends to require early stopping to avoid overfitting. SQIL is equivalent to a variant of behavioral cloning (BC) that uses regularization to overcome state distribution shift. SQIL is equivalent to augmenting BC with a regularization term that incorporates information about state transition dynamics into the imitation policy, enabling long-horizon imitation in an infinite-horizon MDP. The expert follows a policy \u03c0 that maximizes reward R(s, a) forming a Boltzmann distribution over actions. Soft Q values are a function of rewards and dynamics, given by the soft Bellman equation. In the imitation setting, rewards and dynamics are unknown, and the expert generates a fixed set of demonstrations D demo by rolling out their policy \u03c0 in the environment. Training an imitation policy with standard Behavioral Cloning (BC) involves fitting a parametric model that minimizes negative log-likelihood loss. Instead of explicitly modeling the policy, it can be represented in terms of a soft Q function. However, optimizing the BC loss does not always yield a valid soft Q function that satisfies the soft Bellman equation due to the lack of information about dynamics in the learning objective. Q \u03b8 learns to assign high values to demonstrated actions without considering state transitions. A regularized BC algorithm ensures Q \u03b8 is a valid soft Q function with implicit rewards. This approach recovers an algorithm similar to SQIL. Expert behavior is driven by a reward function, soft Q function, and policy. The imitation policy is represented in terms of the soft Q function Q \u03b8. In this section, SQIL is derived as a variant of BC by imposing a sparsity prior on implicitly-represented rewards. The penalty on the magnitude of rewards implied by Q \u03b8 helps address the issue of arbitrary values in out-of-distribution states. The method directly minimizes the magnitude of the rewards, promoting sparsity in the reward function. The penalty on |R q (s, a)| serves two purposes: imposing a sparsity prior and incorporating state transition dynamics into imitation learning. Continuous state spaces are approximated by estimating penalties from samples in demonstrations and rollouts. The penalty in imitation learning covers the state distribution encountered by the agent, not just the demonstrations. To ensure differentiability, the penalty penalizes the squared value of R q (s, a). This approach is equivalent to the squared soft Bellman error Regularized BC algorithm, encouraging high values for demonstrated actions at demonstrated states. The BC loss encourages high values for demonstrated actions at states, with a penalty term propagating values to nearby states. RBC algorithm follows similar steps as SQIL, but uses a different loss function. SQIL and RBC have connections in their optimization problems and reward functions. SQIL is a practical way to implement regularization ideas for behavioral cloning. It uses a sparse reward function and is easy to implement, making it more practical than RBC. SQIL can be extended to MDPs with a continuous action space by using an off-policy actor-critic method. This flexibility makes SQIL a more practical choice for deep RL algorithms. SQIL is compared to existing imitation learning methods on various tasks with high-dimensional observations. The study shows SQIL outperforms RBC and is benchmarked against BC and GAIL on image-based and state-based games. An ablation study on Lunar Lander identifies key components contributing to SQIL's performance. The goal is to evaluate how well each method mimics expert demonstrations and generalizes to new states. The study evaluates SQIL's performance compared to other imitation learning methods on tasks with high-dimensional observations. It focuses on how well the agents can generalize to new states not seen in expert demonstrations, using a different initial state distribution in the training environment. Experiments are conducted on the Car Racing game from OpenAI Gym, where the car starts perpendicular to the track instead of parallel, presenting a significant generalization challenge for the imitation learner. The study evaluates SQIL's performance compared to other imitation learning methods on tasks with high-dimensional observations. Results show that SQIL outperforms BC and GAIL in generalizing to new initial state distributions, demonstrating its capability to adapt to new scenarios. The study compares SQIL's performance with other imitation learning methods on tasks with high-dimensional observations. GAIL-DQL is used instead of TRPO for image-based tasks, allowing for a comparison of SQIL and GAIL. GAIL-TRPO is used as a baseline for low-dimensional tasks. In the study, SQIL outperforms GAIL in experiments using deep Q-learning for RL. SQIL benefits from a constant reward, while GAIL struggles to train a discriminator for learned rewards from images. Results show SQIL outperforms BC on various games like Pong, Breakout, and Space Invaders. SQIL outperforms BC and GAIL on Pong, Breakout, and Space Invaders, showing its superiority in handling compounding errors. The adaptation of SQIL to continuous actions using soft actor-critic (SAC) is also discussed, where expert demonstrations are used to fill the agent's experience replay buffer. SQIL outperforms BC and GAIL on Humanoid and HalfCheetah tasks in MuJoCo, showing its effectiveness with continuous actions and a small number of demonstrations. It can be combined with SAC or other off-policy RL algorithms, leveraging expert demonstrations and environment dynamics for improved performance. To test hypotheses about the performance of SQIL, an ablation study was conducted using the Lunar Lander game from OpenAI Gym. Different conditions were set to analyze if SQIL needs to interact with the environment or can rely solely on demonstrations. The ablation study on SQIL in the Lunar Lander game tested different conditions to determine the importance of sampling from the environment. SQIL outperformed BC, GAIL, and ablated variants when the initial state varied, confirming the need for environment sampling. SQIL outperforms RBC in the Lunar Lander game, confirming the importance of sampling from the environment. The penalty on the soft value of the initial state degrades performance in RBC but is not present in SQIL. This study contributes additional evidence to support the core idea of using constant rewards in imitation learning algorithms. SQIL algorithm outperforms BC and GAIL in tasks with image observations and significant shift in state distribution. It is a promising direction for future work, showing potential in high-dimensional, continuous observation tasks with unknown dynamics. Future work for the SQIL algorithm includes proving its convergence to the expert's state occupancy measure with infinite demonstrations and extending it to recover the expert's reward function. This could offer a simpler alternative to existing adversarial IRL algorithms. In GAIL, changes are made to correct biased reward handling at absorbing states by adding transitions and self-loops. The original biased GAIL method is referred to as GAIL-DQL-B and GAIL-TRPO-B, while the unbiased version is GAIL-DQL-U and GAIL-TRPO-U. SQIL does not learn a reward function and assumes a reward of zero at absorbing states in demonstrations. SQIL assumes a reward of zero at absorbing states in demonstrations. Results show that SQIL outperforms both biased and unbiased versions of GAIL in certain environments. GAIL-DQL-B and GAIL-DQL-U perform equally poorly in Car Racing, while SQIL outperforms GAIL on Pong and Breakout. In Breakout and Space Invaders, the agent experiences more episode terminations than in Pong, exacerbating bias in GAIL's reward handling at absorbing states. GAIL-DQL-B provides a learned reward that inadvertently encourages the agent to avoid terminating the episode. GAIL-DQL-B outperforms SQIL in Breakout and Space Invaders due to accidental bias in the learned reward, which encourages the agent to avoid terminating the episode. SQIL performs better than GAIL-TRPO-U but worse than GAIL-TRPO-B in Lunar Lander, likely because of the negative learned reward provided by GAIL-TRPO-B. In Lunar Lander, GAIL-TRPO-B outperforms SQIL due to accidental bias in the learned reward, which incentivizes the agent to terminate the episode quickly. The same network architectures were used for fair comparisons in evaluating SQIL, GAIL, and BC. In Lunar Lander, GAIL-TRPO-B outperforms SQIL due to reward bias, using the same network architectures for fair comparisons in evaluating SQIL, GAIL, and BC. Expert demonstrations were collected for various environments, generated from scratch or from pretrained policies. In various environments, expert policies were trained using TRPO. GAIL was implemented using open-source code for Lunar Lander and MuJoCo. Soft Q-learning was used for Car Racing and Atari. Expert demonstrations were created for Atari with DQN. Different \u03bb samp values were set for different environments. SQIL was not pre-trained in any experiments. GAIL was pre-trained with BC for HalfCheetah. In SQIL, demonstration experiences were not deleted from the replay buffer. The implementation uses Adam for gradient steps and references performance metrics from previous work. GAIL and SQIL policies are deterministic during evaluation rollouts."
