    "content": "BSE, also known as \"mad cow disease,\" is a fatal neurological disease in cattle transmitted through infected cattle parts. Over 187,000 cases have been reported worldwide, with the majority in the UK since 1986. Humans can develop vCJD from consuming contaminated beef, with about 160 cases reported. BSE has been found in 11 North American-born cattle, including cases in Canada and the US. The first US case was in a Canadian-born dairy cow. The first U.S. cases of BSE were in Canadian-born dairy cows in 2003 and 2006, with additional cases in Texas and Alabama. Despite a beef recall, only some meat from the first U.S. BSE cow may have been consumed, but the highest-risk tissues were not in the food supply. No materials from the other two U.S. cows entered the food supply. Authorities were unable to determine the origin herd of the recent Alabama case. The USDA believes that the two native-born U.S. cattle with \"atypical\" BSE may have had spontaneous cases, impacting future control strategies. An international review team recommended an intensive surveillance program to measure the extent of the BSE issue in North America. The team also suggested that infected animals were likely imported, rendered into cattle feed ingredients, and spread within the cattle herd. The USDA responded to recommendations regarding BSE, emphasizing the low risk of the disease becoming established in the United States. APHIS implemented strict import controls on ruminants and meat products from BSE-affected countries since 1989. The USDA implemented strict import controls on ruminants and meat products from BSE-affected countries since 1989. In 2003, the agency allowed imports of lower risk products from BSE countries with effective controls. APHIS tested high-risk cattle for BSE, with about 20,000 cattle tested annually in FY2002 and FY2003. Following the first U.S. case, USDA launched an enhanced surveillance program in June 2004, testing nearly 788,000 higher-risk cattle by August 2006. By August 2006, nearly 788,000 cattle had been tested for BSE, with most testing negative. USDA transitioned to testing 40,000 cattle yearly and implemented regulations to ban specified risk materials from the meat supply. The FDA has implemented regulations to ban specified risk materials from the meat supply, including prohibiting the slaughter of \"downer\" cattle and restricting certain meat plant procedures. BSE is believed to have spread through feeding infected cattle by-products to other cattle. The FDA has banned most mammalian proteins from cattle feed since 1997 and promised to tighten regulations by banning poultry litter, plate waste, and bovine blood from cattle feed. In 2005, a proposed rule was published to ban some specified risk materials from all animal feeds, including pet food. The FDA proposed a rule in 2005 to ban specified risk materials (previously banned for human food) from all animal feeds, including pet food, to reduce BSE infectivity. Criticisms have been raised regarding the adequacy and enforcement of government safeguards, with concerns about the slow implementation of stricter animal feed rules. The USDA's BSE surveillance program has also faced scrutiny, with criticisms of efforts to reopen the U.S. border to Canadian beef. Some cattle and meat industry leaders support USDA and FDA safeguards, but have concerns about newer safeguards like the ban on \"downer\" cattle and FDA's proposal on animal feed controls. Cattle production is a significant part of U.S. agriculture, accounting for 20% of farm sales. Beef and cattle product exports are crucial for market growth, with exports valued at over $3 billion in 2003, mainly to Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Canada. The U.S. beef and cattle industry faced challenges after the 2003 BSE announcement, with key export markets like Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Canada halting imports. Despite some countries resuming imports, the U.S. market share declined significantly. In 2005, U.S. beef and veal exports reached 689 million pounds, down from 2.523 billion pounds in 2003. Domestic cattle and beef prices initially dropped but later recovered due to tight supply-demand conditions. The 2006 export estimate was around 1.1-1.2 billion pounds, representing 7% of the world market share. The decline in U.S. cattle supplies, caused by drought conditions and strong domestic demand for beef, kept farm prices high in 2004 and 2005. Annual average prices for fed steers were $84.75 in 2004 and $87.28 in 2005. The U.S. beef industry suffered losses of $3.2 billion to $4.7 billion in 2004 due to the loss of exports. The U.S. and Japan announced a framework for restarting beef trade in October 2004. In October 2004, the U.S. and Japan announced a framework for restarting beef trade. Japan promised to ease its BSE testing policy and allow lower risk U.S. beef if certain conditions were met. The market reopened in December 2005 but was halted in January 2006 due to prohibited materials found in U.S. veal. After U.S. apologies and promises of stronger oversight, Japan reopened its market in July 2006. The United States made new concessions in beef trade with Japan and Korea. Japanese consumers are turning to other beef sources like Australia and New Zealand. Korea lifted its ban on U.S. beef in 2006 but strict quarantine inspections have led to rejections of shipments. USDA banned Canadian cattle imports in 2003 but later allowed some lower-risk products. In 2003, USDA banned Canadian cattle imports but later permitted lower-risk products. USDA faced legal challenges for expanding beef imports without proper rulemaking. Despite initial setbacks, Canadian cattle under 30 months started entering the US in 2005. Plans were underway in 2006 to allow imports of Canadian cattle over 30 months. The Department's actions on Canada were criticized for being arbitrary and poorly documented, with inadequate controls over the regulatory process. USDA defenders argued that Canada's safeguards are equivalent to the US, and restoring cross-border trade is crucial. Congress is debating how to regain lost markets like Japan and Korea, the need for federal actions to protect the public and cattle herd, and the costs and benefits of such actions. Additionally, Congress is examining issues such as improved labeling and traceability of livestock. The beef industry and lawmakers are frustrated by the slow progress on reopening markets in Japan and Korea. Proposed retaliatory actions include trade sanctions against Japan. In 2005, a Senate amendment to block Japanese beef imports was removed from the final agreement. Lawmakers in 2006 called for a suspension of trade negotiations with Korea until the beef situation was resolved. Mandatory country of origin labeling for fresh beef is required under the 2002 farm bill. In the 109th Congress, bills were offered to replace mandatory country of origin labeling (COOL) for fresh beef with a voluntary program, or to reinstate an earlier implementation date for mandatory COOL. Progress on a nationwide animal ID system has been hindered by disagreements over issues like public vs. private management, privacy of producer records, and funding. In the 109th Congress, bills were proposed for a nationwide electronic animal identification system overseen by a Livestock Identification Board. USDA spent $123 million in FY2005 on BSE, with $69 million for testing, $49 million for the animal ID effort, and $3 million for research. The Administration requested $66 million for BSE-related activities in FY2006, including $33 million for the animal ID program, $21 million for testing/surveillance, and $12 million for research. FDA requested nearly $30 million for BSE in FY2006. The FY2006 USDA appropriation covered these requests.
