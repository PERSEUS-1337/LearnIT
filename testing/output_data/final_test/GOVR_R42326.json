    "content": "Federal policymakers and state administrators have long been concerned about the \"moral character\" of beneficiaries of governmental assistance programs like TANF, SNAP, and Section 8. Restrictions on benefits for individuals convicted of drug-related crimes were imposed in the 1980s as part of the \"War on Drugs.\" The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 made those with multiple drug-related convictions permanently ineligible for federal benefits, and the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act allowed states to test TANF beneficiaries. The Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 allows states to test TANF beneficiaries for drug use and sanction those who test positive. Some policymakers are interested in linking governmental benefits to passing drug tests, with some states enacting legislation for drug testing beneficiaries of assistance programs. At least 12 state governments have enacted legislation requiring drug tests for governmental benefits. Laws that mandate drug testing without individualized suspicion may face constitutional challenges, focusing on privacy and Fourth Amendment rights. Two state laws have faced litigation for suspicionless drug testing for benefits. The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on such laws but has issued decisions guiding lower courts. These decisions will likely influence future judicial rulings on the topic. The report provides an overview of the Fourth Amendment in relation to laws requiring suspicionless drug tests for governmental benefits. It reviews Supreme Court decisions on government-administered drug testing programs and lower court opinions on the topic. The analysis concludes with factors important for assessing the constitutionality of these laws and guiding policymaking. The Fourth Amendment protects against \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" by the government, applying to all levels of government action. The Fourth Amendment protects against \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" by the government, applying to all levels of government action. Government-administered drug tests are considered searches under the Fourth Amendment, and the constitutionality of requiring drug tests for federal benefits depends on whether it is reasonable under the circumstances. The reasonableness of a search is determined by its nature and governmental purpose, often requiring individualized suspicion or a warrant based on probable cause. However, there are exceptions to these requirements for special needs beyond normal law enforcement. The government can conduct suspicionless searches when special needs outweigh privacy concerns, as determined by assessing competing interests. The Supreme Court has evaluated the constitutionality of drug testing programs in various contexts, including whether mandatory drug tests for receiving government benefits violate the Fourth Amendment. In Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association, the Supreme Court ruled that drug testing for railroad workers after accidents was a search that needed to meet constitutional standards, despite the intrusion on privacy. The special safety needs of the railroad industry made traditional Fourth Amendment requirements impracticable in this context. The Supreme Court ruled in Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association that drug testing for railroad workers after accidents was constitutional, even without a warrant or individualized suspicion. The Court held that the special safety needs of the railroad industry made traditional Fourth Amendment requirements impracticable in this context. In a related decision on the same day, the Court upheld suspicionless drug testing of U.S. Customs Service personnel seeking transfer or promotion to sensitive positions. The Supreme Court upheld suspicionless drug testing of U.S. Customs Service personnel seeking transfer or promotion to sensitive positions, citing the government's compelling interests in preventing drug users from endangering national security. In Vernonia, the Court upheld a school district program for random drug testing of high school student athletes to prevent drug activity, with positive tests leading to participation in a drug assistance program or suspension from athletics. The Court upheld a school program for random drug testing of student athletes to prevent drug activity, citing the special needs in the public school context and the diminished expectations of privacy for students. The Court upheld a school program for random drug testing of student athletes to prevent drug activity, citing the special needs in the public school context and the diminished expectations of privacy for students in sports' locker rooms. Student athletes had lower privacy expectations due to the nature of the intrusion and the importance of deterring drug use among students. The school district implemented procedures to minimize intrusion, only testing for illegal drugs, and not sharing results with law enforcement. School officials had a special responsibility to care for students, which justified the drug testing program. In Vernonia, a school district's drug testing policy was approved by the Court due to a state of rebellion fueled by alcohol and drug abuse among students, particularly athletes. The Fourth Amendment only requires reasonable policies, not the least invasive ones. The Earls case involved suspicionless drug testing for students in extracurricular activities like sports, academic teams, and cheerleading. The Tecumseh school district's drug testing program for students in extracurricular activities like sports, academic teams, and cheerleading was upheld by the Court as a \"reasonable means\" to prevent drug use, citing the state's responsibility for student discipline, health, and safety. Lindsay Earls challenged the policy but the Court ruled in favor of the district. The Supreme Court upheld the Tecumseh school district's drug testing program for students in extracurricular activities, stating that students have limited privacy expectations and the testing procedure was minimally intrusive. The decision was based on the school's custodial responsibility and authority, which applied to both athletic and nonathletic activities. The Supreme Court upheld a school district's drug testing program for students in extracurricular activities, stating that privacy invasion was not significant due to limited uses of test results. Individualized suspicion or demonstrated drug abuse was not required, and testing was deemed effective in preventing drug use. The Court in Chandler struck down a Georgia statute requiring drug testing for state elected officials, citing lack of special need or credible means for detection or deterrence of drug use. The Court in Chandler struck down a Georgia statute requiring drug testing for state elected officials, citing lack of special need or credible means for detection or deterrence of drug use. The timing of the test was controlled by the candidate, making legal compliance achievable through temporary abstinence. Candidates for public office are under relentless scrutiny, making suspicionless testing less necessary compared to safety-sensitive positions. The Court emphasized that where there is a substantial risk to public safety, blanket suspicionless searches may be considered reasonable. The Court emphasized that suspicionless searches must be linked to public safety to be considered reasonable. Compelling governmental interests in public safety or national security may override constitutional objections in certain circumstances. In the context of public schools, the Court recognizes special needs for student safety. The government acts as a guardian and tutor to minor students, with diminished privacy expectations compared to adults, especially in drug testing situations. Drug testing programs targeting a population with a known drug abuse issue may favor the government, especially if designed effectively. The confidentiality of drug test results is also a factor in balancing public and private interests. Two state laws mandating suspicionless drug testing for TANF benefits have been challenged on Fourth Amendment grounds. The Michigan program in Marchwinski v. Howard was ruled unconstitutional by the Sixth Circuit due to lack of evidence. Lebron v. Secretary, Florida is another case under scrutiny. In Marchwinski v. Howard, the Sixth Circuit ruled Michigan's drug testing law for TANF benefits unconstitutional due to lack of evidence. In Lebron v. Secretary, Florida, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the unconstitutionality of Florida's mandatory drug testing law. Future courts and lawmakers may refer to these decisions for guidance on similar drug testing programs. Individuals applying for TANF benefits were required to submit a urine sample for drug testing. Refusal to test or testing positive for drugs would result in denial of benefits or participation in a substance abuse assessment and treatment plan. Those already receiving benefits would be subject to random drug tests, with non-compliance leading to benefit reduction or termination. A group of individuals subject to the drug testing program sought an injunction, citing Fourth Amendment rights violations. The court granted the injunction, halting the program's implementation. The court granted a preliminary injunction against mandatory drug testing for TANF benefits, stating that it violated Fourth Amendment rights. The state's justification for the testing did not meet the criteria of a special need grounded in public safety, as required by the court. The court found that TANF and FIP were not designed to address child abuse and neglect, so using financial assistance to regulate parents erodes privacy rights. Allowing suspicionless drug tests could set a dangerous precedent for all parents receiving governmental benefits. The court granted a preliminary injunction based on Fourth Amendment claims. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals split evenly on the Fourth Amendment claim, resulting in the affirmation of the lower court's ruling. The case did not progress further due to a settlement with the ACLU, modifying the drug testing program for TANF applicants. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals split evenly on the Fourth Amendment claim, resulting in the affirmation of the lower court's ruling. The case did not progress further due to a settlement with the ACLU, modifying the drug testing program for TANF applicants. Applicants must pay for drug tests and treatment programs, with costs not reimbursed by the state. Positive results lead to a one-year benefit ban unless individuals complete substance abuse treatment and pass another test. Children of failed applicants may receive benefits through a \"protective payee\" who passes a drug test. The Florida law requires TANF applicants to undergo drug testing, with benefits being provided through a \"protective payee\" who passes the test. A federal district court granted a preliminary injunction against the drug testing requirements, citing Fourth Amendment violations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court's order. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court's preliminary injunction against the TANF drug testing program. The district court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, ruling Florida's drug testing statute unconstitutional and unenforceable. The district court ruled that the TANF drug testing statute is unconstitutional and cannot be enforced, citing Fourth Amendment searches and the lack of a valid \"special need\" for testing TANF recipients. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction against the program. The Florida TANF drug testing program was deemed unconstitutional by the district court and affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit due to lack of a valid \"special need\" for testing beneficiaries, violating the Fourth Amendment. The appellate panel concluded that the state lacked a substantial special need for suspicionless drug testing of TANF beneficiaries, as it did not show concrete danger or specific public interests. The court also found that the drug-testing program was not effective in identifying or deterring drug use that could impact employability, endanger children, or drain public funds. Additionally, conditioning TANF benefits on passing drug tests was deemed unconstitutional, despite the state's goals of promoting work, protecting families, and conserving resources. The Fourth Amendment prohibits blanket government searches, and laws requiring drug tests for receiving governmental benefits without individualized suspicion may be unconstitutional. Such tests are considered searches under the Fourth Amendment, which typically require individualized suspicion unless a special need is demonstrated. Government benefit programs like TANF, SNAP, and unemployment compensation do not naturally meet the special needs criteria recognized by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has recognized that governmental assistance programs do not raise public safety concerns like those in previous cases. Legislation requiring drug testing for individuals receiving benefits should be based on individualized suspicion to avoid Fourth Amendment issues. The implementation of drug testing programs for TANF applicants should be based on individualized suspicion to avoid constitutional issues. Florida's program previously shared positive drug test results with government officials outside of TANF, potentially leading to criminal investigations and loss of benefits. The sharing of positive drug test results for TANF applicants in Florida led to potential criminal investigations and loss of benefits, increasing privacy intrusion. In contrast, drug testing programs that limited access to test results and restricted consequences reduced privacy concerns and played a role in the Court's evaluation of governmental drug testing procedures. Governmental drug testing procedures that restrict sharing of test results and limit negative consequences likely have firmer constitutional ground."
