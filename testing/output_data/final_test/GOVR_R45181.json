    "content": "The federal government provides grants for family planning services through the Family Planning Program, Title X of the Public Health Service Act. Title X, enacted in 1970, is the only federal program solely dedicated to family planning and related preventive health services. Other programs that fund family planning services include Medicaid, the federal Health Center program, the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant, the Social Services Block Grant, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. In FY2015, Medicaid accounted for 75% of U.S. public family planning expenditures, while Title X accounted for 10%. Title X, administered by the Office of Population Affairs (OPA) under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), accounts for 10% of federal funding for family planning services. The program, funded through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), offers project grants for family planning services, personnel training, and service delivery improvement research. In FY2017, approximately 90% of Title X funds were used for clinical services. In FY2017, OPA used around 90% of Title X funds for clinical services, including family planning, contraceptive services, STD prevention, and reproductive health services for both males and females from low-income families. Services are provided with respect for individuals' beliefs and without coercion. Priority for services is given to individuals from low-income families, with fees based on income levels. Title X-funded clinics served 4.004 million clients in 2017, primarily low-income women and adolescents. 12% were male, 67% had incomes at or below the federal poverty guidelines, and 87% had incomes at or below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines. In 2017, 42% of Title X clients were uninsured. The number of clients served in 2017 was slightly lower than in 2016 and significantly lower than in 2010. Reasons for decreased capacity included clinic closures, staffing shortages, and increased costs for infrastructure improvements. In 2017, there were 89 Title X family planning services grantees, including state, local, and nonprofit organizations. Grantees suggested reasons for decreased demand, such as newly insured clients seeking care elsewhere, increased use of long-acting contraception, and changes in clinical guidelines. Title X grantees, including Planned Parenthood, provide family planning services through 3,858 clinics in the US and territories. Training grants improve staff skills and career development, covering topics like Zika virus and opioid use disorders. Research funded by family planning service delivery improvement grants aims to enhance the efficiency of Title X projects. These grants support studies on integrating family planning services into STD clinics, ensuring patient confidentiality, evaluating contraceptive services, and assessing the financial sustainability of Title X clinics. Title X is a discretionary program funded annually through appropriations acts, with guidelines mandating nondirective pregnancy counseling and prohibiting the use of funds for abortion. The Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019, provides $286.479 million for Title X in FY2019, maintaining the prohibition on using funds for abortions without exceptions. The Weldon amendment prohibits funds from being used by federal agencies or programs that discriminate against health care entities for not providing or referring for abortions. HHS published a final rule in 2011 to handle conflicts on a case-by-case basis. The Weldon amendment prohibits discrimination against health care entities for not providing or referring for abortions. HHS proposed a rule to remove abortion information and referral requirements for Title X projects. The FY2019 appropriations level for Title X remained at $286.479 million. The FY2019 budget proposed $286.479 million for Title X, maintaining previous funding levels. The funding would support family planning services for 4 million clients, with goals to prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce infertility. The program aims to screen 1.2 million young women for chlamydia, with a target cost per client served of $345.11. The FY2019 budget for Title X aims to maintain a cost per client served of $345.11 and increase financial sustainability through more contracts with insurance plans. The program also focuses on offering primary health services onsite or nearby and addressing conditions affecting non-pregnant individuals of child-bearing age. Additionally, the budget includes provisions to restrict certain abortion providers from receiving federal funds. The provision aims to prohibit certain abortion providers from receiving Federal funds from HHS, including those funded under Title X Family Planning program and Medicaid. It defines a prohibited entity as a nonprofit organization primarily engaged in family planning services and related medical care. The provision aims to prohibit certain abortion providers from receiving Federal funds from HHS, including those funded under Title X Family Planning program and Medicaid. A prohibited entity is defined as a nonprofit organization primarily engaged in family planning services and related medical care, which performs or funds abortions exceeding $23 million in FY2017. Entities can avoid being classified as prohibited by certifying they will no longer perform or fund abortions, with potential repayment of federal assistance for violations. Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) is not specifically mentioned, but may meet the criteria for a prohibited entity. In response to proposals to restrict federal funds, the White House informally suggested that Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) could retain funding if they stopped providing abortions, which PPFA rejected. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 6470, which would have provided no funding for Title X in FY2019. An amendment to fund Title X at the FY2018 level and prohibit funds from amending Title X regulations was rejected. Section 533 of H.R. 6470 would have restricted funds for certain entities. Section 533 of H.R. 6470 proposed blocking funds from being available to certain \"prohibited entities\" under Title X regulations, including nonprofit organizations engaged in family planning services that provide or fund abortions. The provision in Section 533 of H.R. 6470 aimed to block federal funds from going to entities that perform or fund abortions, with exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or when the woman's life is in danger. Entities could avoid being classified as prohibited by certifying they will no longer provide or fund abortions. If violated, the HHS Secretary would seek repayment of any federal assistance. PPFA was not explicitly mentioned, but it could have met the criteria as a prohibited entity. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed funding for Title X at the FY2018 enacted level, with provisions prohibiting the use of funds for abortion. The Senate also passed a bill prohibiting federal funds from going to Planned Parenthood and its affiliates. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed funding for Title X at the FY2018 enacted level, with provisions prohibiting the use of funds for abortion. During Senate floor consideration of H.R. 6157, two similar amendments were submitted but did not pass. Subsequent to Senate passage of H.R. 6157, Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019. The Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 was finalized by a conference committee and signed into law as P.L. 115-245. The bill funds Title X at $286.479 million, maintaining the same level as FY2018, with provisions prohibiting the use of funds for abortion. Table 1 and Figure 2 show historical appropriations amounts for Title X since its creation in FY1971. The Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 funds Title X at $286.479 million, maintaining the same level as FY2018. The law prohibits the use of Title X funds for abortion. A final rule in 2000 updated regulations regarding abortion services in family planning projects, allowing pregnant clients to receive information on prenatal care, delivery, infant care, foster care, adoption, and pregnancy termination. Family planning projects receiving Title X funds must provide neutral, factual information and counseling on options such as prenatal care, delivery, infant care, foster care, adoption, and pregnancy termination. The projects are closely monitored to ensure funds are used appropriately and not for abortion services. Abortion activities must be separate from Title X project activities to comply with regulations. The process for monitoring Title X grant recipients includes careful review of grant applications, independent financial audits, yearly financial status reviews, and periodic program reviews. A survey found that an estimated 10% of clinics receiving Title X funds offer abortions separately from their Title X project. In 2004, HHS surveyed Title X grantees on providing abortions with nonfederal funds. 46 out of 86 grantees responded, with 9 indicating some clinic sites offered abortions with nonfederal funds. Title X supporters argue that family planning reduces unintended pregnancies and abortions. HHS estimates Title X services helped prevent 901,838 unintended pregnancies in FY2016. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that Title X services helped avert 822,300 unintended pregnancies in 2015, including 277,800 abortions. Critics argue that federal funds should not support organizations like PPFA that perform abortions, as it may imply that abortion is a form of family planning. The HHS proposed a rule in June 2018 to prohibit abortion referrals and require separation between Title X projects and abortion activities. Critics argue that funding Title X implies sanctioning nonmarital sexual activity among teens. Supporters believe expanding Title X could reduce teen pregnancy rates. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that Title X family planning services helped prevent 188,700 unintended teen pregnancies in 2015. Supporters argue for expanding family planning services to reduce the high teen pregnancy rate in the U.S. compared to other countries like Sweden. Teen contraceptive use plays a significant role in the decline of teen birth rates. Confidentiality is crucial for minors seeking family planning services, as Title X projects cannot require parental consent or notify parents before or after services are provided. Providers must offer confidential services to adolescents and adhere to state laws regarding reporting of abuse or trafficking. This ensures adolescents feel comfortable accessing and using these services. Providers should encourage communication between adolescents and their parents or guardians about sexual and reproductive health. Educational materials can help parents talk about sex and share their values with their child. Joint discussions can address family values and expectations about dating and relationships. Title X providers must comply with state laws on reporting child abuse, molestation, sexual abuse, rape, or incest. Title X clinics commonly forgo billing health insurers to maintain confidentiality for minors seeking services related to sexual and reproductive health. A survey found that 75% of insured teen clients planned to use their health insurance, but 53% cited concerns about confidentiality as a reason for not using it. Additionally, 4% of family planning visits by clients with health insurance chose not to use it, with 44% citing confidentiality concerns, especially among those under 18 years old. Title X clinics commonly forgo billing health insurers to maintain confidentiality for minors seeking sexual and reproductive health services. Program requirements state that unemancipated minors can receive confidential services based on their own resources, with discounts based on the minor's income. Supporters argue that parental notification requirements could deter adolescents from seeking care, while critics believe it interferes with parental rights. Planned Parenthood operates through a national office and 56 affiliates, with over 600 local health clinics in the US. In 2015, Planned Parenthood clinics served 41% of female Title X clients. The Government Accountability Office reported that HHS disbursed $21.07 million to Planned Parenthood affiliates through the Title X program in FY2015. In FY2015, HHS disbursed $21.07 million to PPFA affiliates through the Title X program. The GAO report showed PPFA affiliates' expenditures of Title X funds, totaling $57.28 million. Planned Parenthood and its affiliates receive approximately $60 million annually through Title X. Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) and its affiliates receive around $60 million yearly from the Title X program. A proposed rule by HHS would make changes to Title X, including no longer requiring offering abortion information, counseling, or referrals, prohibiting referrals to abortion services, and mandating physical and financial separation between Title X projects and abortion-related activities. New definitions for terms like family planning and low-income family would be introduced, along with revised criteria for awarding grants and new reporting requirements for grant applicants and grantees. The proposed rule by HHS for Title X program includes new reporting requirements and restrictions on abortion-related services. There is debate on whether this rule is a \"gag rule\" limiting information for clients. Concerns were raised over a delay in the funding opportunity announcement for Title X grants. The FY2018 FOA for Title X grants addressed concerns about potential funding interruptions. Current grantees were invited to request grant extensions to avoid service gaps. Key differences from the previous year included new requirements for clients under the age of consent and emphasizing the benefits of avoiding sexual risk. The FY2018 FOA for Title X grants emphasized the importance of avoiding sexual risk, especially for adolescents, and returning to a \"sexually risk-free status.\" Projects were required to have written clinical protocols in accordance with CDC and the U.S. Office of Population Affairs recommendations. The FOA also highlighted the need for family participation in services for all clients, not just minors. Successful projects were expected to use counseling techniques that encourage risk reduction. The FY2018 FOA for Title X grants emphasized family participation in services for all clients, not just minors, and highlighted the importance of care coordination and primary health services onsite or nearby. The FY2017 FOA prioritized addressing comprehensive health care needs through linkages with primary care providers. Final award selections under the FY2017 FOA were made by the regional health administrator in consultation with the Deputy. The FY2018 FOA for Title X grants shifted final award selections to the regional health administrator, a change from previous practices since the 1980s. The Institute of Medicine's 2009 report highlighted the significance of this transfer of decision-making authority from the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs to maintain funding integrity. The report also noted concerns about the political appointee status of the DASPA affecting the Title X program. The FY2018 FOA for Title X grants emphasized innovative services and methods historically underrepresented in the program. It did not explicitly mention access to contraceptive options like the FY2017 FOA. The grant period for FY2018 projects was seven months, a departure from the typical three-year project periods. Within project periods of up to three years, HHS does not require recompetition for grant funds. Continuing awards are typically funded annually, contingent on factors like appropriations and compliance with federal requirements. OPA may approve shorter project periods for Title X grantees providing family planning services directly or through subrecipients. The final rule \"Compliance With Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting Subrecipients\" was nullified by P.L. 115-23 in April 2017. The rule would have applied to grantees making subawards under the Title X Family Planning Services grant program. The final rule regarding compliance with Title X requirements by project recipients in selecting subrecipients was nullified by P.L. 115-23. This means the rule is deemed to have never taken effect, and HHS is prohibited from reissuing a similar rule. Some states had enacted laws to limit Title X participation by certain providers. The final rule on Title X subaward allocation preferences was nullified by P.L. 115-23, causing uncertainty and reduced access to services for priority populations. The rule would have restricted grantee criteria for choosing subrecipients to ensure compliance with Title X services. The nullified final rule on Title X subaward allocation preferences aimed to restrict grantee criteria for choosing subrecipients, causing uncertainty and reduced access to services for priority populations. Supporters believed it would protect funding for specialized family planning providers, while critics argued for state discretion in administering Title X funds and protecting conscience rights."
