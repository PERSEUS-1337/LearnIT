    "content": "The Act titled \"Equitable Health Care for Severe Mental Illnesses Act of 1993\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that American families should have health insurance protection for treating severe mental illnesses equal to that provided for other illnesses. Currently, many insurance policies discriminate against persons with severe mental illnesses by offering more restrictive coverage compared to other medical problems. Health insurance plans often limit facility care and outpatient visits for mental illnesses while providing unlimited coverage for physical illnesses. Only 21 percent of health insurance policies offer adequate coverage. Only 21 percent of health insurance policies provide inpatient coverage for severe mental illnesses comparable to coverage for other illnesses, with only 2 percent offering comparable outpatient coverage. Additionally, only 2 percent of Americans with private health care coverage have policies that adequately cover severe mental illnesses. Over 60 percent of health maintenance and preferred provider organizations exclude treatment for severe mental illnesses, and private health insurance only covers 46 percent of the annual expenditures required for treatment. (8) Health care reform plans aim to improve accessibility and affordability but may still discriminate against individuals with severe mental illnesses found in private insurance plans. (9) Unequal insurance coverage contributes to the stigmatization of those with severe mental illnesses, which are comparable to physical health problems like cancer and diabetes. (10) Over 2.5 million Americans experience schizophrenia in their lifetime, with 30% of hospitalized psychiatric patients suffering from this debilitating disorder. (11) Untreated severe mental illnesses pose significant challenges. Severe mental illnesses, if left untreated, can be disabling and destructive, with up to 90% of suicide victims having a treatable mental illness like schizophrenia or depression. Approximately 10% of inmates in the US suffer from severe mental illnesses, leading to a high risk of homelessness for individuals with these conditions. Despite effective treatment options, ignorance and stigma persist. Many mentally ill individuals are prevented from seeking help due to ignorance and stigma. Treatment for depression and schizophrenia can be effective, with a high percentage of patients responding well. Despite significant advancements in understanding brain function, millions of severely mentally ill people have yet to benefit from research. Adequate health insurance coverage for severe mental illnesses can lead to significant cost savings annually. Legislation should support early intervention for severe mental illnesses to prevent costly interventions and help individuals remain productive members of society. Reforming the health care system should not perpetuate discrimination against those with severe mental illnesses. The policy of the United States is to ensure that persons with severe mental illnesses are not discriminated against in the health care system and that health care coverage must provide equitable treatment for severe mental illnesses similar to other major physical illnesses. This does not prevent laws or policies for equitable coverage of other mental health services. SEC. 4. NONDISCRIMINATORY AND EQUITABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. Health care coverage for severe mental illnesses should be on par with coverage for major physical illnesses in terms of non-restrictiveness, financial protection, and cost control methods. The Act commits Congress and the Executive Branch to implementing policies to improve access to and control the costs of healthcare. It defines \"severe mental illness\" as disorders with psychotic symptoms like schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and manic depressive disorder, as well as other severe forms of disorders like major depression and panic disorder."
