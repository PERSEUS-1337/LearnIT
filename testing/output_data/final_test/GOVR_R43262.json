Legislation was introduced to repeal this provision due to concerns over costs outweighing benefits. The SEC proposed rules to implement the pay ratio provision in 2013. The SEC proposed rules to implement the pay ratio provision, allowing firms flexibility in calculating worker median pay. The proposal sparked a public policy debate on the costs and benefits of the provision, inviting comments for 60 days. This report examines the debate over executive pay, the SEC's proposal, responses to the provision, and legislation aimed at repealing it. Public company CEOs are compensated through a combination of base pay, bonuses, stock grants, and other benefits set by the board of directors. Moody's highlights the importance of proper executive compensation for company performance. Effective executive compensation is crucial for shaping company policies and performance pressures. Boards offer substantial financial incentives to encourage desired behavior and attract talent. Disclosure on executive pay practices provides visibility into the relationship between the board and senior management. Excessive pay raises governance issues and can harm investor interests. High executive pay can indicate weak board oversight, potentially leading to increased credit risk. The debate on aligning pay with performance metrics, such as stock options, has been ongoing since the 1980s. Concerns have been raised about excessive CEO compensation not aligning with performance goals. The debate over excessive CEO compensation has been ongoing for years, with questions about fairness, incentives, and risk-taking. Forbes calculated the average CEO total pay for the largest public companies over the past two decades, showing an average of $3.57 million in 2012 dollars. Forbes found that CEO compensation increased from $3.57 million in 1991-1995 to $12.9 million in 2006-2010, then decreased to $9.4 million in 2011 before rising to $10.5 million in 2012. The market for public company CEOs is distorted by factors such as board directors being nominated by top management, leading to reluctance to negotiate pay. Relationships between executives and board members are seen as crucial for board functionality. The CEO market is influenced by factors like board directors nominated by top management, leading to reluctance in negotiating pay. Relationships between executives and board members are crucial for board functionality, with evidence suggesting some board \"capture\" by top management. The research found that CEOs with back door links to the company's board compensation committee received $453,688 more on average than those without. CEO compensation has increased significantly, but there are differing views on whether executive pay reflects performance. According to a study by the University of Chicago, CEO pay in the S&P 500 Index has not continuously increased. Average and median inflation-adjusted CEO pay peaked in 2000 and 2001. CEO pay levels today are comparable to the early 1990s, and the ratio of CEO pay to firm market value has remained constant since 1960. CEO turnover has increased due to shareholder demands for better performance-based pay. CEO turnover has been relatively flat in recent years, with average tenure at 8.1 years. Stakeholders are more vigilant, demanding action when things go wrong, often starting at the top. CEO performance is closely watched by shareholders, employees, and the public. The late Peter Drucker advocated for monitoring the CEO-to-average worker pay ratio to promote teamwork and trust in companies. He suggested a ratio of 25:1 or 20:1, but in 2012, the average ratio in the S&P 500 was 204:1, according to Bloomberg. In 2012, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio in S&P 500 firms was 204:1, a 20% increase from 2009. Historical estimates show ratios of 20:1 in the 1950s, 42:1 in 1980, and 120:1 in 2000. The Economic Policy Institute reported ratios of 18:1 in 1965, 27:1 in 1978, 137:1 in 1995, and 411:1 in 2000. Research on how these ratios affect worker and corporate performance is limited. Research on the impact of CEO-to-worker pay ratios on worker and corporate performance is limited. A study by Faleye, Reis, and Venkateswaran analyzed data from 450 firms to examine the relationship between CEO-employee pay ratios, employee productivity, and corporate performance. They found that for larger firms, the ratio did not significantly affect productivity, while for smaller firms with well-informed employees in merit-based environments, the ratio was positively related to gains. The CEO-employee pay ratio is positively related to firm productivity, stock valuation, and operating performance. It is influenced by factors like firm size, performance, and risk level. Unionization tends to lower CEO-employee pay ratios. Income inequality in the US has been growing, with potential economic costs such as increased financial crisis risks. The widening income inequality has been a topic of discussion, particularly in relation to CEO-worker pay ratios. Research suggests that higher CEO pay levels compared to stagnant worker pay have contributed to growing income inequality. This issue is outside the scope of the current report, but readers can find more information in other CRS reports. The widening income inequality in America has reached scandalous levels at many public companies, making it the number one problem in corporate law. Top corporate pay has grown significantly, raising questions about its role in the income gap. There are debates on whether redistributing CEOs' pay to other employees could impact national income statistics. The SEC's goal is to provide market participants with enough information for informed decisions, rather than limiting the riskiness of publicly traded firms. Since 1933, public companies have been required to disclose CEO pay information, and since 1938, the SEC has implemented additional regulations on executive pay disclosure. The SEC requires public companies to disclose executive compensation details, including amounts paid to top executives, criteria for compensation decisions, relationship between compensation and performance, risk-taking incentives, program objectives, performance rewarded, elements of compensation, selection rationale, determination process, and alignment with overall objectives. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the SEC's authority over executive pay disclosures. Through the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress expanded the SEC's executive pay-related mandatory corporate disclosures and governance requirements. This includes the composition of corporate board compensation committees with independent directors, the ability to retain advisors, disclosure of executive compensation and financial performance relationship, \"say-on-pay\" shareholder advisory votes, and disclosure of \"golden parachute\" arrangements in merger transactions. The SEC was required to direct national securities exchanges to implement policies for clawing back incentive-based compensation from executive officers in case of accounting restatements due to financial noncompliance. Federal financial regulators were to adopt guidance prohibiting excessive incentive-based pay arrangements for executives, employees, directors, or principal shareholders at financial institutions with over $1 billion in assets. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates executive pay-related and corporate governance-related disclosures. Section 953(b) requires the SEC to amend rules for financial disclosures. Public companies will need to disclose median employee compensation, CEO compensation, and the pay ratio. The SEC proposed a rule to disclose the CEO's total compensation ratio to the median employee's total compensation as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Companies have flexibility in determining the median employee's total compensation. The SEC proposed a rule for companies to disclose the CEO's total compensation ratio to the median employee's total compensation. One dissenting commissioner objected to the proposal, stating it harms investors and restricts capital formation. The SEC proposed a rule for companies to disclose the CEO's total compensation ratio to the median employee's total compensation, with one commissioner objecting to the proposal. Senator Menendez cautiously welcomed the SEC's step towards implementing the rule, emphasizing the need to address the disparity in pay between CEOs and average workers. Legislation in the 113th Congress aims to repeal the pay ratio provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires publicly traded companies to report median total compensation. The bill sponsor argues that this provision burdens companies without benefiting investors, as the data could be misleading due to varying geographic locations of businesses. The pay ratio provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, requiring companies to report median total compensation, is criticized for potentially misleading investors due to differing geographic locations. Chairman Hensarling suggests various other ratios companies could disclose, while Senator Menendez defends the provision citing excessive compensation as a factor in the financial crash. The Dodd-Frank Act's pay ratio provision aims to shed light on CEO pay disparities and their impact on workers and investors. Representative Barney Frank supported the provision during the House Financial Services Committee's markup of H.R. 1062 in the 112th Congress, emphasizing the issue of \"excessive inequality.\" During the committee's markup of H.R. 1062, Representative Frank introduced unsuccessful amendments to reduce corporate costs of complying with the pay ratio provision. The amendments included changing the data to be part of annual financial disclosures, covering only domestic workers, and basing the data on cash compensation. Representative Waters opposed the repeal legislation, stating that the pay ratio provision could provide valuable information to shareholders about CEO pay disparities. Representative Waters introduced an unsuccessful amendment to change the pay ratio provision to require annual disclosure of data for domestic workers based on cash compensation. Critics of the provision include business-related entities such as the American Benefits Council and the National Retail Federation. Support for the pay ratio provision has come from various organizations including unions, civil rights groups, consumer advocacy groups, and liberal think tanks. The SEC received over 20,000 letters from investors urging the agency to finalize the rules for the pay ratio. The SEC received over 20,000 letters from investors urging the agency to finalize the rules for the pay ratio provision, which supporters see as a way to address income inequality. However, there are arguments that redistributing CEO pay may not significantly narrow national income inequality. The discussion should focus on whether the provision will provide valuable information to investors and corporate stakeholders, as well as the costs and challenges of corporate compliance. The challenges associated with corporate compliance with the pay provision are examined in this section. Materiality in investor information is a key issue, with critics questioning the meaningfulness of the data provided by the pay ratio provision. Critics argue that the resulting data may not pass the materiality test, raising concerns about the provision's effectiveness in providing valuable information to investors. The pay ratio provision aims to provide investors with critical information on executive compensation packages and wage disparities within companies, as required by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Critics question the materiality of the data, suggesting it may not be valuable to investors. The pay ratio provision under Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act mandates public companies to hold \"say-on-pay\" votes for shareholders to assess executive compensation. Supporters argue that these votes allow shareholders to evaluate the reasonableness of compensation within a contextual framework. The SEC staff acknowledges the challenge of quantifying the usefulness of company-specific pay ratio information compared to publicly available statistics on average salaries. The pay ratio provision in the Dodd-Frank Act mandates public companies to hold \"say-on-pay\" votes for shareholders to assess executive compensation. Supporters argue that this data can help investors evaluate a company's pay structure and workforce performance. It may also assist economists and policymakers in detecting asset bubbles and economic crashes linked to widening income gaps. However, redistributing CEO pay to employees is unlikely to significantly impact national income inequality. Some investor groups support the importance of firms paying attention to CEO-worker pay. The Council of Institutional Investors and other groups emphasize the importance of firms considering CEO-worker pay ratios in executive compensation strategies. Disclosure of pay ratios may influence board decision-making and prevent excessive executive pay packages. However, the effectiveness of this provision in reducing income inequality is uncertain. Some researchers question the assumption that public companies overpay CEOs in inefficient markets. Critics of pay ratio disclosure argue it may not provide meaningful investor data due to lack of comparative context across different industries. Comparing CEO-worker pay ratios across firms with different labor and management mixes and wage levels may not be appropriate. Some argue that comparing pay ratios across companies of different sizes may not be valuable, as firms with higher sales tend to pay CEOs more. Additionally, comparing pay ratios of domestic companies with no overseas workers to those with a global worker presence could be problematic due to varying wage rates, costs of living, tax regimes, and government benefits in different countries. For example, comparing pay ratios of companies outsourcing jobs to lower-paying locations to those keeping jobs stateside could lead to inconsistencies. Proponents of the pay ratio provision suggest disclosing pay ratio data separately for full-time domestic employees and non-domestic workers to address inconsistencies. They also propose including a detailed narrative discussion on the composition of the ratios to make the disclosures more meaningful. Supporters argue that comparability issues with compensation levels across industries can be likened to criticisms against other financial ratios used by analysts and investors. The SEC does not mandate the disclosure of such information. The SEC does not require the disclosure of financial ratios, which are calculated using data from mandatory corporate financial disclosures. The benefits of the pay ratio provision are questioned by SEC staff, who note a lack of specificity on the usefulness of company-specific information and optimal pay ratios. The SEC staff questions the benefits of the pay ratio provision, as there is a lack of specificity on optimal pay ratios and the impact on employee morale and productivity. Critics argue that mandatory corporate disclosure requirements can overwhelm investors and limit the number of shareholder proposals for disclosing CEO and worker pay ratios. The SEC staff questions the benefits of the pay ratio provision, as there is a lack of specificity on optimal pay ratios and the impact on employee morale and productivity. Critics argue that mandatory corporate disclosure requirements can overwhelm investors and limit the number of shareholder proposals for disclosing CEO and worker pay ratios. Shareholder proposals are advisory and not mandatory, potentially underrepresenting shareholder interest in pay ratio disclosure. The SEC has not proposed or adopted executive pay-related mandatory disclosures for CEO and worker pay ratios since 1938. Senator Robert Menendez, a proponent of the pay provision, emphasizes the importance of disclosing CEO/worker pay ratios. Senator Robert Menendez, the original sponsor of the pay provision, believes it was a response to concerns about excessive CEO pay levels. Similar congressional worries led to executive pay disclosure requirements in the Securities Act of 1933. Compliance with the pay ratio provision will be costly for public companies, especially for those with decentralized payrolls. The required formulation of total annual worker compensation data for the pay ratio provision includes salaries, bonuses, stock compensation, defined compensation arrangements, and pension benefits. Many companies do not keep this information for all employees annually, leading to concerns about the complexity and cost of providing such data. Large global companies with decentralized systems may face challenges in reconciling data across countries. The SEC pay ratio provision proposal acknowledges the challenges in calculating median worker compensation for companies with multiple business units or subsidiaries. Smaller firms may struggle with the necessary personnel and high employee turnover, complicating the calculations. The SEC pay ratio provision poses challenges in calculating median worker pay for companies with multiple subsidiaries. The Center on Executive Compensation, affiliated with the HR Policy Association, has lobbied for the repeal of the provision and surveyed member companies on its potential implications. According to a survey by the Center on Executive Compensation, many companies with over 10,000 employees worldwide and operations in multiple countries may take months to calculate median employee compensation. Implementation costs for pay provisions could be in the millions. Supporters of the pay ratio provision argue that some domestic companies already disclose executive pay data alongside average or median employee pay figures. Some companies, like MBIA, Bank of South Carolina, and Whole Foods, disclose executive pay data alongside average or median employee pay figures in their SEC filings. Whole Foods maintains a pay cap to ensure no one earns more than 19 times the company's average pay. The SEC allows firms to choose their own method for calculating median worker pay to conduct pay ratio disclosures cost-efficiently. The estimated corporate compliance costs for implementing the pay ratio provision over three years would be about 545,792 hours of company personnel time. The SEC proposal estimates that implementing the pay ratio provision over three years would cost about $72,772,200 for outside professional services and 545,792 hours of company personnel time. The compliance burden could be lower with flexible worker pay identification methods, varying based on company size and employee locations. The SEC proposal suggests that identifying a median employee for pay ratio compliance would require an average of 95 additional hours of work annually over three years. Large firms with hundreds of thousands of employees may face even higher compliance burdens. Some in the business community, like law firm Sidley Austin, see potential cost savings in the proposal's flexibility, but overall concerns remain about the potential burden of compliance with the new rules. The SEC proposal for pay ratio compliance may be burdensome for large companies, leading to potential restructuring to show a more favorable CEO-to-worker pay ratio. This could involve replacing domestic employees with lower-paid foreign employees and outsourcing work. The SEC staff noted that these changes could diminish the value of the disclosure in assessing employee morale and productivity."
