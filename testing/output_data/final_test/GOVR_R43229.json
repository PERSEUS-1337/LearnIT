    "content": "Despite controversies in popular media, climate scientists agree that the Earth's climate has warmed significantly over the past century, with most warming over continents at high latitudes. Past climate changes have been abrupt at times, and research suggests that the past few decades were likely the warmest in the past 400 years. Global average temperatures today are among the highest since human civilizations began to flourish roughly 4,000 to 8,000 years ago due to the presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Human activities, such as fossil fuel burning and deforestation, have increased greenhouse gas concentrations, with carbon dioxide levels rising almost 40% over the past 150 years. This has led to increased surface water acidity and contributed to observed global warming. The enhanced levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have contributed to global warming in recent decades. Factors such as the Earth's orbit, solar variability, volcanoes, and land cover change have also influenced climate. Future projections indicate continued warming, with human-induced changes interacting with natural variability. Climate change impacts are wide-ranging, with some societies benefiting while others face adverse effects. The balance of projected impacts is expected to increasingly favor adverse outcomes. Scientists debate the influence of greenhouse gases on global warming. Climate models project significant changes with small likelihoods of catastrophic impacts. Decisions to reduce human contributions to climate change or prepare for future changes are crucial. Scientists have invested billions in research on climate change, finding little support for alternative causes than greenhouse gases. Solar changes have minimal impact on global temperatures since the 1970s. Since the 1930s, the 11-year solar cycle has been observed, with research attributing most global temperature increase since the 1970s to greenhouse gas concentrations. Scientists consider human-related greenhouse gas emissions a significant global risk, but uncertainty in climate change patterns and risks may persist for years. Decision-makers have response options including deferring choices, gathering more information, informing populations, preparing, containing, or experiencing consequences. Members of Congress may address climate-related decisions that affect authorizations and appropriations for federal programs, including research and technology development, tax incentives, regulatory authorities, and assistance for affected entities. Understanding mechanisms and debates over climate change involves concepts of forcings, feedbacks, and internal variability. Other CRS reports provide background and analysis on these options. There is broad agreement among scientists that factors like greenhouse gas concentrations and solar variability directly influence climate change. Human activities, such as fossil fuel burning and deforestation, have significantly increased greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere, with CO2 rising almost 40% in the past 150 years. Solar radiation reaching the Earth is influenced by its orbit, tilt, and wobble, as well as solar variability. Human-related greenhouse gas emissions, mainly carbon dioxide, come from energy production, deforestation, and cement manufacture. In 2010, carbon dioxide emissions accounted for 74% globally and 83% in the United States. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions are also significant, with agriculture being a main source. Emissions from low-income countries are a bigger share of their economies compared to the United States. China surpassed the US as the top GHG emitter in 2007, while the US has emitted the most cumulatively over the past century. Feedback mechanisms in the climate system are likely to amplify the effects of warming. Feedback mechanisms in the climate system, such as clouds, vegetation, snow and ice cover, and GHG uptake by soils and water bodies, can have both positive and negative impacts on warming. Once positive feedbacks start, they may lead to \"runaway warming,\" which could be irreversible. Forests, for example, can either dampen or enhance climate change depending on their growth conditions. If climate conditions change beyond certain bounds, forests may release stored carbon, contributing to climate change. The Earth's climate exhibits internal variability, such as the oscillation between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events. Climate experts project that without reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the climate will warm to unprecedented levels, leading to reconfiguration of current human and ecological systems. The Earth's climate is projected to warm to unprecedented levels due to greenhouse gas emissions, with estimates suggesting a global temperature increase of 2.5 to 3.2 o C by 2100. There is a possibility of temperatures rising above 6.4 o C by 2100, exceeding natural variability. This increase is significant compared to the Last Glacial Maximum, which was 3 to 5 o C cooler than present. Future climate change is expected to bring about significant warming, with regions experiencing fluctuations in temperature, precipitation, and extreme events. Sea levels could rise between 7 and 23 inches by 2100 due to ocean warming, with additional effects from melting ice sheets. Global average sea levels are projected to rise between 2 to 2.5 feet, with some estimates reaching up to 6.5 feet, depending on various factors. Continued warming could lead to additional sea level rise over subsequent centuries of several to many meters. Improving understanding of ice dynamics is a high priority for scientific research to improve sea level rise projections. Climate change models predict more heat waves, fewer extreme cold episodes, increased precipitation on average but more droughts in some regions, and increased summer warming and dryness in central continents. Regional changes may vary from global averages, with more intense precipitation leading to increased runoff and flooding risks. Recent climate modeling anticipates overall temperature increases in the contiguous United States. Different models show a wide range of precipitation changes, from net decreases to net increases, which poses challenges for agriculture, water supply, and other critical systems. Global average precipitation is expected to increase, with dry areas getting drier and wet regions getting wetter. Evapotranspiration is projected to exceed precipitation in many regions, leading to soil drying and increased drought risks. Intense precipitation events are expected, providing more energy for storms like hurricanes and thunderstorms. The Arctic is projected to continue its decline in sea ice cover, while Greenland is expected to lose more ice, contributing to sea level rise. Climate changes could impact nearly every human and natural system, with potential sea level rise of up to 2 meters by 2100 from melting land-based ice in Greenland and Antarctica. The U.S. Global Change Research Program has assessed the impacts of climate change on the United States. Climate changes have historically influenced societal changes, including migrations and technological advances. Investments in infrastructure were based on past climate patterns, assuming stability within historical bounds of variability. Climate changes can lead to increased risks of losses due to maladaptation as infrastructure may not be able to withstand more intense precipitation and runoff. The uncertainty surrounding projections of climate change impacts, especially critical thresholds for non-linear effects, poses challenges for adaptation. Some regions may experience beneficial impacts from climate change, such as increased agricultural productivity and reduced need for heating. Most impacts of climate change are expected to be adverse, including lower agricultural productivity, drought, rising sea levels, and spread of disease vectors. Risks of abrupt climate changes are expected to increase with global temperature rise, pushing natural and socioeconomic systems past tolerance thresholds. Efforts to reduce vulnerability and build resilience can help mitigate future climate change risks. Some populations may profit from new opportunities resulting from climate change. Climate change impacts will vary in different regions, posing challenges for predictions and preparations. Adaptations can help mitigate damage costs but may impose additional costs, especially on vulnerable populations. Effects may include shortages of clean water, higher food prices, increased allergies, erosion of beaches, and more frequent extreme weather events. Climate change will increase uncertainties for individuals and organizations, with some potentially benefiting from new opportunities while others may face livelihood and health risks. Climate change impacts such as erosion of beaches, extreme weather events, and economic losses are expected to prompt migration and increase stress and mental health challenges. Experts warn that climate changes could amplify instabilities in countries with weak governance, leading to security risks and implications for international political stability. Ecological disruptions and limitations on species' abilities to adapt are among the most compelling reasons for concern. Climate change is highly likely to create substantial changes in ecological systems and services, leading to risks of extinctions of species and ecological surprises. Some regions with disappearing climates overlap with biodiversity hotspots, posing challenges for conservation efforts. Conservation solutions like assisted migration and networked reserves may not be enough to protect biodiversity, as highlighted in various CRS reports on topics such as ocean acidification, changes in the Arctic, drought in the United States, energy-water nexus, oil sands, Keystone XL Pipeline, energy policy, and climate change legal issues.
