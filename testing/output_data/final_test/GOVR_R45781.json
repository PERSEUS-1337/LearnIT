Established in 2005, it receives funding from the Deficit Reduction Act and ACA to ensure families are partners in decision-making. The Family-to-Family Health Information Centers program, funded by HRSA, provides support and education to families of children with special health care needs. It has received funding from various legislative acts, including ACA, ATRA, PSRA, PAMA, MACRA, and BBA 2018, with funding amounts ranging from $2.5 million to $5 million for different fiscal years. The BBA 2018 expanded the Family-to-Family Health Information Centers program to include all territories and at least one Indian tribe, with $6 million funding for FY2018 and FY2019. No new funding will be available for FY2020 and beyond. The Title V SRAE program provides funding for abstinence education to adolescents aged 10 to 20 through formula grants to states, DC, and territories. Funds are requested as part of the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant. The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant funds are allocated based on low-income children's shares. The Abstinence Education Grants program was established by the PRWORA, providing $50 million annually from FY1998 to FY2002. Additional funding was provided through various acts until June 2004. The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant funds are allocated based on low-income children's shares. Various acts provided funding for the Abstinence Education Grants program until December 2007. The Abstinence Education Grants program received funding through various acts until FY2019, with no new funding available for FY2020 or subsequent years. The Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) targets adolescents aged 10 to 20 and pregnant and parenting youth under 21, providing education on abstinence and contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and STIs. PREP offers four types of grants: State PREP grants, Competitive PREP grants, Tribal PREP, and PREP-Innovative Strategies (PREIS). Funding is allocated to states and territories based on the proportion of youth aged 10 to 20 in each jurisdiction. PREP was established by ACA, Section 2953, with $75 million annually from FY2010 to FY2014, and continued funding through PAMA, Section 206, for FY2015. Under current law, funding for the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) has been enacted for FY2019, but no new funding will be available for FY2020 or subsequent fiscal years. Medicare pays Long-Term Care Hospitals (LTCHs) under the LTCH prospective payment system (LTCH PPS), which is higher than payments under the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS). LTCH PPS payments are now only available for discharges meeting specific clinical criteria. Patients qualify for Long-Term Care Hospitals (LTCHs) under the LTCH prospective payment system (LTCH PPS) if they had a prior hospital stay under the IPPS and received ventilator services for at least 96 hours. Discharges related to psychiatric or rehabilitation diagnoses do not qualify. Additional criteria may temporarily allow payment under the LTCH PPS for specific conditions. LTCH patients who do not meet specific criteria qualify for a site-neutral payment rate, phased in during FY2016 and FY2017. This rate is based on an IPPS-comparable per diem amount or estimated service costs. In FY2018, LTCHs received a blended payment amount combining the LTCH PPS rate and the site-neutral rate. LTCHs received a blended payment combining the LTCH PPS rate and the site-neutral rate. The transition period to site-neutral payments for LTCH patients not meeting specific criteria was extended by BBA 2018, Section 51005 for an additional two years. This extended period expires for discharges in cost-reporting periods starting in FY2020. LTCHs are paid the LTCH PPS rate for patients meeting specific criteria, such as prior ICU stay or ventilator services. Discharges with psychiatric or rehabilitation diagnoses do not qualify. A site-neutral payment rate is phased in for discharges that do not meet LTCH PPS criteria. The 21st Century Cures Act established temporary criteria for LTCH PPS payment related to spinal cord conditions for FY2018 and FY2019 discharges. Criteria include LTCH not-for-profit status in 2014 and at least 50% of CY2013 discharges classified under specific DRGs. The 21st Century Cures Act established temporary criteria for LTCH PPS payment related to spinal cord conditions for FY2018 and FY2019 discharges, including LTCH not-for-profit status in 2014 and specific DRG classifications for at least 50% of CY2013 discharges. Additionally, Section 101 of MACRA made fundamental changes to Medicare physician payments, authorizing the transfer of $80 million annually from the SMI Trust Fund for payment modifications from FY2015 to FY2019. The 21st Century Cures Act established temporary criteria for LTCH PPS payment related to spinal cord conditions for FY2018 and FY2019 discharges. MACRA Section 101 authorized the transfer of $80 million annually from the SMI Trust Fund for payment modifications from FY2015 to FY2019. SSA Section 1848(s) required the HHS Secretary to develop quality measures for the Merit-based Incentive Payment System program. The HHS Secretary reports annually on progress in developing quality measures under MACRA Section 102. Funds for these activities have not been appropriated for FY2020 and beyond, but funds from prior years are available until FY2022. The HHS Secretary must contract with a consensus-based entity like the National Quality Forum for performance improvement and measurement duties under SSA Section 1890. MIPPA Section 183 transferred funds from the Medicare Trust for these purposes. Congress allocated funding from various Acts such as MIPPA, ATRA, PSRA, PAMA, and MACRA to carry out activities under SSA Section 1890 and 1890A. The funding amounts ranged from $5 million to $30 million for different fiscal years, with funds remaining available until expended. MACRA funding for FY2015 replaced PAMA funding for that year. The funding under MACRA for FY2015 replaced PAMA funding, totaling $30 million. BBA 2018 transferred $7.5 million from Medicare Trust Funds for FY2018 and FY2019 for SSA Section 1890 activities. HHS reporting requirements were added, and unobligated balances from prior years were included. Appropriated funds for FY2020 and beyond are not enacted, but prior funds are available. SSA Section 1890A mandates the HHS Secretary to establish certain actions. SSA Section 1890A requires the HHS Secretary to establish a pre-rulemaking process to select quality measures for use in the Medicare program. The NQF gathers multi-stakeholder input and annually transmits that input to the Secretary through its Measure Applications Partnership (MAP). ACA, Section 3014(c), transferred $20 million from the Medicare HI for this purpose. MAP publishes annual reports with recommendations for selection of quality measures in February of each year. The ACA, PAMA, MACRA, and BBA 2018 allocated funds from various Trust Funds for fiscal years 2010 through 2019 to implement quality measures in the Medicare program as required by SSA Section 1890A. Section 50206 transferred $7.5 million for each of FY2018 and FY2019 to carry out Section 1890 and SSA Section 1890A(a)-(d), with added reporting requirements. Funds appropriated prior to FY2020 for measure selection activities are available until expended. Geographic adjustments under the Medicare physician fee schedule reflect differences in resource costs for physician services. The Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) are used in calculating payment rates under the MPFS, with a minimum value of 1.00 established by several laws. These laws increased the work geographic index to 1.0 for localities where it was less than 1.0 for services provided between 2004 and 2008. The floor for the work geographic index under the MPFS was extended multiple times through various laws, with different expiration dates set for each extension. The MPFS GPCI floor has been extended multiple times through various laws with different expiration dates. Currently, Medicare payments for physician services are based on a fee schedule using relative values units (RVUs) for over 7,000 service codes. The Medicare physician fee schedule is based on relative value units (RVUs) for over 7,000 service codes, which consider factors like time, skill, and intensity. The RVUs are adjusted for geographic input costs and converted into dollar amounts by a conversion factor. CMS continually refines the methodology for estimating RVUs and is required to review them every five years. The ACA added the requirement for the HHS Secretary to identify potentially misvalued physician services and make appropriate adjustments to their relative values under the fee schedule. The HHS Secretary has authority to adjust RVUs for Medicare physician reimbursement based on changes in medical practice, coding, or new data. Certain radiation therapy codes were identified as potentially misvalued in 2015, leading to the creation of new codes during the transition to an episodic payment model. The Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act required CMS to maintain code definitions and RVUs from 2016 in 2017 and 2018. The Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act (PAMPA) maintained the work RVUs and direct inputs for practice expense RVUs for radiation therapy and related imaging services in CY2017 and CY2018, keeping payments unchanged. PAMPA also exempted these services from being considered potentially misvalued under CMS's initiative. Additionally, BBA 2018 Section 51009 extended payment restrictions through CY2019, with the restrictions expiring after December 31, 2019. The Administration for Community Living (ACL) administers federal grant programs for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and caregivers to access health and social services. Funding for programs like State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs), Area Agencies on Aging (AAA), and Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) helps older adults, individuals with disabilities, and caregivers access health and social services. These programs provide outreach, counseling, information assistance, and a wide range of home and community-based services. The National Center for Benefits and Outreach Enrollment helps older adults, individuals with disabilities, and caregivers access long-term services and supports through public programs and private payment options. Funding from MIPPA provides outreach and assistance to low-income Medicare beneficiaries for programs like Medicare, Medicaid, SSI, SNAP, and others. The HHS Secretary is required to transfer specified amounts for MIPPA program activities from the Medicare Trust Funds. BBA 2018 also requires ACL to electronically post on its website the amount of federal funding provided to each state and entity receiving funds from the state for SHIP state grants. MIPPA, Section 119, authorized $25 million for FY2009 to fund outreach and education activities for low-income Medicare beneficiaries through various organizations. The ACA, ATRA, PSRA, and PAMA extended authority and provided funding for programs to inform older Americans about benefits available under federal and state programs. Total funding amounts were allocated to SHIPs, AAAs, ADRCs, and the National Center for Benefits and Outreach Enrollment. PAMA and MACRA extended funding for programs supporting older Americans through FY2017. PAMA allocated $25 million for FY2014 and FY2015, while MACRA provided $25 million for FY2015 and $37.5 million annually for FY2016 and FY2017. Funding was distributed to SHIPs, AAAs, ADRCs, and the National Center for Benefits and Outreach Enrollment. BBA 2018 extended funding for programs supporting older Americans through FY2019, with annual increases from FY2015 levels: SHIPs $13 million, AAAs $7.5 million, ADRCs $5 million, and National Center for Benefits and Outreach Enrollment $12 million. Funding authorized under BBA 2018 for low-income outreach programs will expire after September 30, 2019, but funds can be used until expended. SSA Section 1181 established PCORI for comparative clinical effectiveness research. PCORI is responsible for coordinating and supporting comparative clinical effectiveness research. It has contracts with federal agencies, academic, and private sector research entities for funding and research. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) supports PCORI's activities and is funded through annual appropriations, fees on health insurance plans, and transfers from Medicare Trust Funds. SSA Section 1183 allows for funds to be transferred from the Medicare Trust Funds to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) based on Medicare enrollment. IRC Sections 4375-4377 impose fees on health insurance policies and self-insured plans. 80% of PCORTF funds go to PCORI, with the remaining 20% transferred to the HHS Secretary for PHSA Section 937. ACA allocated $10 million for FY2010, $50 million for FY2011, and $150 million for FY2012 through FY2019 to the PCORTF. The ACA allocated funds to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) for FY2010 through FY2019, with additional revenue from a new fee on health insurance policies and self-insured plans. Transfers from Medicare Trust Funds were also provided for FY2013 through FY2019. No funds were appropriated for PCORTF for FY2020 or subsequent years. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) received funds from FY2010 to FY2019, including transfers from Medicare Trust Funds. However, no funds were allocated for FY2020 onwards. Spousal impoverishment rules under SSA Section 1924 aim to fairly distribute assets for Medicaid financial eligibility in cases where one spouse requires long-term care. Spousal impoverishment rules under SSA Section 1924 aim to fairly distribute assets for Medicaid financial eligibility, exempting income in the non-Medicaid spouse's name and dividing joint income and assets equally between spouses. These rules were expanded under the ACA to include home and community-based services participants. Beginning January 1, 2014, ACA Section 2404 temporarily expanded spousal impoverishment protections to all married individuals eligible for home and community-based services (HCBS) under specified authorities. This requirement lasted for five years until December 31, 2018. The 116th Congress extended these protections and allowed for state flexibility in applying income or asset disregards for married individuals receiving certain HCBS. The Medicaid Extenders Act of 2019 extended spousal impoverishment rules for HCBS beneficiaries until March 31, 2019. The Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act of 2019 further extended this provision until September 30, 2019. After this date, the authority for the extension will expire. Medicaid financing for territories differs from states, with territories receiving annual capped funding. The federal Medicaid funding for territories comes from various sources, including annual capped funding and additional funding provided through the ACA, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, and BBA 2018. Prior to these additional sources, territories often ran out of federal Medicaid funding before the end of the fiscal year. ACA allocated $6.3 billion and $1.0 billion in additional federal Medicaid funding to territories between July 1, 2011, and September 30, 2019. The federal Medicaid funding for territories has been increased through various acts such as ACA, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, and BBA 2018. Additional funding totaling $295.9 million for Puerto Rico and $106.9 million for U.S. Virgin Islands was provided through these acts. Furthermore, BBA 2018 increased funding by $3.6 billion for Puerto Rico and $106.9 million for U.S. Virgin Islands, with the potential for further increases based on certain conditions. The Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) provided mandatory funding for federal health centers authorized in PHSA Section 330, located in medically underserved areas, offering primary care, dental care, and other services regardless of ability to pay. The CHCF appropriations, established by ACA Section 10503, comprised over 70% of health center programs' funding in FY2019, with a total of $9.5 billion annually from FY2011 to FY2015. The ACA and other acts provided significant funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF), totaling $1.2 billion for FY2012, $1.5 billion for FY2013, $2.2 billion for FY2014, and $3.6 billion for FY2015. Additional funding was allocated for health center construction and renovation. Subsequent acts like MACRA and BBA 2018 continued to provide substantial funding, with $3.8 billion in FY2018 and $4.0 billion in FY2019. Funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) has been enacted for FY2019, with no new funding provided for FY2020 and beyond. The Special Diabetes Program for Type I Diabetes and the Special Diabetes Program for Indians provide funding for research and services related to diabetes prevention and treatment. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established these programs and allocated $30 million annually from CHIP funds. The funding for the Special Diabetes Program has been consistently increased over the years, starting from $30 million annually in FY1998 through various acts such as BIPA 2000, P.L. 107-360, MMSEA, MIPPA, MMEA, ATRA, PAMA, MACRA, and the Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2017. The funding was set at $150 million annually through FY2017, with additional funding provided for the first quarter of FY2018. The Special Diabetes Program funding has increased over the years, reaching $150 million annually through FY2017. In FY2018, funding was provided for the Special Diabetes Program for Indians and Type I Diabetes. BBA 2018 allocated $150 million for each program in FY2018 and FY2019. Funding for FY2019 has been enacted, but no new funding is provided for FY2020 and subsequent years. Unused grants prior to October 1, 2019, remain available. The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) provides scholarships and loan repayments to health professionals in shortage areas in exchange for care. Funding comes from the CHCF and discretionary appropriations, with ACA Section 10503 providing $1.5 billion annually from FY2011 to FY2015. The NHSC received funding of $1.5 billion annually from FY2011 to FY2015, with additional funding in subsequent years from various legislative acts. No new funding is provided for FY2020 and beyond. Unused grant funds prior to October 1, 2019, remain available. The Teaching Health Center program receives funding for direct and indirect GME payments to support medical and dental residents training at qualified teaching health centers. Various legislative acts, including ACA, MACRA, and P.L. 115-96, have provided funding for this program from FY2011 to FY2018. The BBA 2018 made changes to the Teaching Health Center program, providing $126.5 million for FY2018 and FY2019 for GME payments. No new funding is provided for FY2020 onwards. The Pregnancy Assistance Fund aims to support vulnerable expectant or new parents and their children through competitive grants to states, territories, and tribal entities. The Pregnancy Assistance Fund (PAF) program provides grants to tribal entities for services during prenatal and postnatal periods, including legal services for women experiencing domestic violence. ACA Section 10212 allocated $25 million annually from FY2010 to FY2019, with no new funding available from FY2020 onwards. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) subsidizes 72.5% of health insurance costs for eligible taxpayers. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) subsidizes 72.5% of qualified health insurance costs for eligible taxpayers who experienced job losses or had their pension plans taken over by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Eligible individuals must not be able to enroll in certain other health coverage or be eligible for specified coverage to claim the tax credit. The credit is financed through a permanent appropriation and requires qualified health insurance to be eligible. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) is not subject to annual appropriations and is authorized by various acts including the Trade Act of 2002, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act of 2011, and the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015. These acts expanded eligibility and subsidy for the HCTC, with sunset dates established for its reauthorization. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) was retroactively reauthorized with a new sunset date before January 1, 2020. An annual fee is imposed on certain health insurance issuers, starting at $8.0 billion in CY2014 and increasing annually. The fee is based on net health care premiums written by covered issuers, with exemptions for the first $25 million of net premiums written. The annual fee on certain health insurance issuers, established by ACA Section 9010, is based on net premiums written. The fee was suspended for CY2017 and CY2019 but is set to resume in CY2020. Additionally, an excise tax is imposed on the sale of specific medical devices as defined by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The excise tax on specific medical devices, as defined by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, is equal to 2.3% of the device's sales price. It is imposed on the manufacturer or importer of the device. The tax was created by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and was suspended for CY2016 and CY2017 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. The excise tax on specific medical devices, equal to 2.3% of the sales price, was suspended for CY2018 and CY2019. It will resume in CY2020. Medicare pays LTCHs under the LTCH PPS, which is higher than payments under the IPPS. LTCHs are paid the LTCH PPS rate for patients meeting specific criteria. LTCH discharges with psychiatric or rehabilitation diagnoses do not qualify for the LTCH PPS rate. A site neutral payment rate is being phased-in for discharges that do not meet LTCH PPS criteria. Additional temporary criteria for payment under the LTCH PPS were provided in legislation, including a criterion for discharges before January 1, 2017. The LTCH PPS rate applies to LTCH discharges meeting specific criteria, including being a grandfathered hospital-within-hospital, located in a rural area, and involving a severe wound. The Cures Act reinstated temporary payment criteria related to certain spinal cord conditions for FY2018 discharges. The Cures Act reinstated temporary payment criteria for certain severe wound discharges under the LTCH PPS, narrowing the definition and eligibility requirements. Congress has also passed bills to promote health information technology adoption and electronic data sharing among healthcare stakeholders. The Cures Act authorized Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments for meaningful use of certified EHR technology, with penalties for non-compliance starting in CY2015. The law also exempted physicians in ambulatory surgery centers from payment penalties. Physicians in ambulatory surgery centers were exempt from meaningful use payment penalties in CY2017 and CY2018. The exemption expired in December 2018, but the requirement for certified EHR technology in ASCs has not been met yet. Medicare Advantage pays private health plans to provide Medicare-covered benefits, with adjustments based on a five-star quality rating system. The Social Security Act allows the HHS Secretary to terminate contracts with MA organizations or PDPs for various reasons, including failure to meet Medicare program conditions. High star quality ratings in MA plans lead to increased payments and rebates, and these ratings are publicly reported for beneficiary consideration when choosing a plan. CMS regulations amended in 2012 allow for contract termination if an MA organization or PDP receives less than 3 stars for 3 consecutive years. The HHS Secretary cannot terminate contracts solely based on low quality ratings until the end of plan year 2018. The HHS Secretary issued a memorandum stating that MA plans receiving less than three stars for three consecutive years could face termination. The earliest possible termination date under this policy would be December 31, 2022. LTCHs provide prolonged inpatient care for patients discharged from acute-care hospitals with stays longer than 25 days. LTCHs provide prolonged inpatient care for patients discharged from acute-care hospitals with stays longer than 25 days. CMS implemented a payment regulation to prevent inappropriate patient shifting based on financial incentives, applying a 25% patient threshold adjustment policy to all LTCHs. In FY2008, CMS expanded the 25% patient threshold adjustment policy to include all LTCHs. MMSEA Section 114(c)(1) delayed the application of this adjustment for certain LTCHs for three years. MMSEA Section 114(c)(2) also delayed the adjustment for LTCHs co-located with other hospitals under specific conditions. ARRA Section 4302(a) modified the start of these delays. The delays in MMSEA Sections 114(c)(1) and 114(c)(2) were modified to start from July 1, 2007. The end date for the delay under MMSEA Section 114(c)(2) was changed to three years from October 1, 2007. ACA Section 3106 extended the delay of the 25% patient threshold adjustment, and PSRA Section 1206(b)(1) further extended it. The delay of the 25% patient threshold adjustment for LTCHs was extended multiple times, with the latest extension through FY2018. LTCHs were initially exempt from the IPPS under Medicare and paid on a reasonable-cost basis. The LTCH PPS was established under the BBRA 99, providing higher Medicare payment rates for inpatient hospital care than the IPPS. A temporary moratorium was placed on new LTCH development under MMSEA Section 114(d) with exceptions for existing LTCHs. LTCHs under MMSEA Section 114(d) had restrictions on new development, with exceptions for existing LTCHs. ARRA, Section 4302, amended the moratorium to allow LTCHs with a certificate of need to increase beds after April 1, 2005. The moratorium on increasing LTCH beds was extended by ACA Section 3106(b) and reinstated by PSRA Section 1206(b)(2) and PAMA Section 112(b). Cures Act Division C Section 15004 reinstated the exception to the moratorium on increasing LTCH beds. The moratorium on new LTCH development and bed increases expired on September 30, 2017. CMS has extended non-enforcement of supervision requirements for therapeutic services in critical access hospitals and small rural hospitals multiple times through legislation and rules. The moratorium on new LTCH development and bed increases expired on September 30, 2017. Legislation and rules have extended non-enforcement of supervision requirements for therapeutic services in critical access hospitals and small rural hospitals through various Acts and the Cures Act. The Surgery Center (ASC) final rule re-established the non-enforcement policy from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019. Appendix A lists expiring health care-related demonstration projects and pilot programs related to Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and private health insurance programs. The appendix lists health care-related demonstration projects and pilot programs scheduled to expire in 2019, as well as those that expired during 2018 or 2017.
