    "content": "The Act titled \"National Highway System Designation Act of 1995\" designates the National Highway System. Section 103 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to designate the most recent National Highway System submitted by the Secretary of Transportation as the National Highway System. The Secretary may add or delete route segments upon a State's request, maintaining the total mileage of the National Highway System. The Secretary may approve changes to the National Highway System requested by States, ensuring the total mileage does not exceed 168,000 miles. States must identify route segment changes in cooperation with local officials through transportation planning activities. The Secretary may approve State requests for changes to the National Highway System if they meet criteria and enhance national transportation characteristics. The \"Financing Improvement Act of 1995\" limits advance construction funding for transportation projects and requires projects to be included in the State's transportation improvement program. Additionally, states may receive payments for construction with a flexible tapered share. The \"Financing Improvement Act of 1995\" allows states to use other federal funds for project matching share and receive payments for construction costs with a flexible federal share limit. The Secretary must adhere to payment limitations outlined in sections 106(c), 120, and 130 of the title. SEC. 204 outlines regulations for toll roads, bridges, tunnels, non-toll roads with dedicated revenue sources, and ferries. Section 129 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to allow states to loan the Federal share of toll or non-toll projects with dedicated revenue sources to public entities for construction. Dedicated revenue sources for non-toll facilities include excise taxes, sales taxes, and motor vehicle use. The amended Section 129 of title 23, United States Code allows states to loan the Federal share of toll or non-toll projects with dedicated revenue sources to public entities for construction. The dedicated revenue sources for non-toll facilities may include excise taxes, sales taxes, motor vehicle use fees, tax on real property, tax increment financing, or other appropriate sources as determined by the Secretary. Public or private entities receiving the loan must ensure compliance with federal laws, including environmental regulations, and the loan amount for a qualifying project can be subordinated to other project financing. The amended Section 129 of title 23, United States Code allows states to loan the Federal share of toll or non-toll projects with dedicated revenue sources to public entities for construction. Loans may be obligated for qualifying projects, with repayment starting within 5 years of project completion. The loan term cannot exceed 30 years, with interest rates set by the State to ensure project feasibility. The amended Section 129 of title 23, United States Code allows states to loan the Federal share of toll or non-toll projects with dedicated revenue sources to public entities for construction. Loans may be obligated for qualifying projects, with repayment starting within 5 years of project completion. The Secretary shall establish procedures and guidelines for making loans pursuant to this paragraph. Amounts repaid to a State from a loan made under this paragraph may be used for various purposes, including the purchase of insurance or as a capital reserve for other forms of credit enhancement for project debt. SEC. 205 amends Section 302 of title 23, requiring states to have a State highway department with adequate powers to meet the duties of the title. SEC. 206 allows donation of private funds, assets, and publicly owned right-of-way for Federal-aid projects. Section 323 of title 23, United States Code is amended to allow for the donation of private funds, assets, and publicly owned right-of-way for specific projects under this title. The State matching share for a project can be credited by the amount of the donated funds or the fair market value of publicly owned right-of-way incorporated into the project. Section 323 of title 23, United States Code is amended to allow for the donation of private funds, assets, and publicly owned right-of-way for specific projects under this title. A gift or donation may be made at any time during the development of a project. The \"State Infrastructure Bank Financing Improvement Act of 1995\" allows for the establishment of State Infrastructure Banks. A new program allows states to establish State Infrastructure Banks for providing loans and assistance to entities for transportation projects. States can deposit a portion of their apportionments for qualifying projects. The State Infrastructure Bank allows states to deposit a portion of their apportionments for transportation projects within 120 days. Funds can be derived from the State's surface transportation program apportionment, with the option to transfer funds to other State Infrastructure Banks or multi-State entities. Federal disbursements must align with the Federal-aid highway program. The State Infrastructure Bank allows states to deposit funds for transportation projects within 120 days. States must consult with metropolitan planning organizations for project programming. Cash management requirements do not apply to funds used as a capital reserve. States must match the non-Federal share for deposits into the transportation infrastructure bank. Investment income generated by the bank is credited back to the bank. The transportation infrastructure bank allows funds to be credited, available for loans, and invested in financing instruments to enhance transportation activities. Federal deposits into a State Infrastructure Bank are not a commitment or guarantee by the United States. The State Infrastructure Bank issues financing instruments that do not constitute a commitment from the United States. It allows loans for transportation projects, with the possibility of subordinating debt to other financing. The State Infrastructure Bank offers loans for transportation projects, with repayment starting within 5 years of project completion and not exceeding 30 years. Interest rates are determined by the State, and funds repaid can be reused for any eligible purpose. The Secretary will establish procedures and guidelines for State Infrastructure Bank loans, including defining \"other assistance\" to cover various forms of debt financing related to projects. Administrative costs will be determined annually. The State Infrastructure Bank can use up to two percent of federal funds for administrative costs. Annual reports are required to be submitted to the Secretary. States must maintain an investment grade rating to continue receiving federal deposits. The State Infrastructure Bank must have insurance and file an annual report with the Secretary to maintain fund viability."
