Higher Federal Matching Percentage for Routine HIV Screening Services: Amends Section 1903 of the Social Security Act to increase the federal matching percentage to 90% for costs related to providing routine HIV screening services. Routine HIV screening services include an HIV screening test (and confirmatory test if positive) provided as part of medical care in any health care setting for individuals aged 13-64 who have not previously tested positive for HIV within the last 6 months. Routine HIV screening services involve testing individuals aged 13-64 who have not tested positive for HIV in the last 6 months. The conditions include informing individuals of test results and providing post-test counseling for those who test positive. Routine HIV screening services involve testing individuals aged 13-64 who have not tested positive for HIV in the last 6 months. The payment amount for these services should closely approximate that of Medicare Part B, with no cost-sharing imposed. In cases where a political subdivision contributes to the non-Federal share of expenditures, the increase in the Federal share should first reduce this contribution. The text discusses exemptions from routine HIV testing requirements for individuals at increased risk of acquiring HIV due to possible exposure. Amendments are made to various sections of the Act to reflect changes in testing criteria. Amendments are made to sections of the Act regarding routine HIV screening services for Medicaid beneficiaries. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to submit a report to Congress on barriers to accessing these services within 2 years of the Act's enactment."
