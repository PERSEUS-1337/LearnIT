Congress finds that the International Labor Organization estimates 21 million people are subjected to modern slavery, with a majority being women and girls. The Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons was created to assist in coordinating a response to trafficking, producing the annual Trafficking in Persons Report. The annual Trafficking in Persons Report is a key resource for human trafficking reporting, analysis, and recommendations globally. It includes tier rankings for each country, which are crucial for promoting protection for victims, preventing trafficking, and prosecuting perpetrators. Many countries have improved their trafficking record to avoid a low tier ranking in the report. Ambassador Mark Lagon, former Ambassador-at-Large to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, played a significant role in this area. Ambassador John Miller, former Ambassador-at-Large to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, emphasized the need to upgrade the status of the Office to a Bureau for equal standing and to enhance efforts in combating trafficking. The Ambassador-at-Large for the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons emphasizes the importance of equal standing with other State Department bureaus to prioritize the issue of human trafficking. The tier ranking process established by Congress has been compromised by the subordinate stature of the Office, hindering accurate reporting on successes and failures in combating human trafficking. The credibility of the Trafficking in Persons Report relies on rigorous scholarship. The Trafficking in Persons Report is based on rigorous scholarship and the application of minimum standards for combating human trafficking. Strong anti-slavery policy requires equal hierarchical standing for officials from the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking, with direct access to the Secretary of State. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking should be elevated to a Bureau within the Department of State hierarchy, without increasing personnel or budget. The Bureau should be led by an Assistant Secretary with direct access to the Secretary of State for more effective implementation of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. The Secretary of State should review and potentially revise the 24 Assistant Secretary positions to align with the highest Departmental needs and foreign policy priorities, including combating trafficking in persons. The Bureau to combat trafficking in persons is established. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 is amended to change the name of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking to the Bureau to Combat Trafficking in Persons. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 is amended to change the name of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking to the Bureau to Combat Trafficking in Persons. Any reference to the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking shall now be deemed a reference to the Bureau to Combat Trafficking in Persons. SEC. 5. REPORT REGARDING DESIGNATION OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE TO COMBAT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS. The Secretary of State must submit a report to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations within 90 days of this Act detailing current Assistant Secretary of State positions, including their titles, duration, and legislative authorization. The report will also address the intention to designate Assistant Secretary of State positions authorized by the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956. The Secretary of State must report to Congress within 90 days on the current Assistant Secretary of State positions, including the intention to designate the Assistant Secretary of State to Combat Trafficking in Persons as authorized by the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956. SEC. 6. Countries on special watch list for 4 consecutive years may be downgraded and reinstated on special watch list. Section 110(b)(2) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 is amended to include countries on a special watch list for 4 consecutive years that are downgraded and reinstated on the list. Countries listed in paragraph (1)(C) cannot be on the special watch list (described in subparagraph (A)) for more than 1 consecutive year. SEC. 7. COST LIMITATION.
