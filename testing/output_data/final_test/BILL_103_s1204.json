FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that it is in the interest of the United States to maximize economic return from the growing trade in cruise ship sailings to and from Alaska by encouraging the use of US facilities and services, while protecting existing employment and economic activity. Cruise ship sailings to Alaska are a vital and growing segment of the US travel industry. The number of passengers entering or leaving Alaska via cruise ship has increased by 14 percent in the last two years and is expected to continue growing. Currently, all cruise ships in Alaska trade are foreign-flag vessels, as there are no US-flag cruise ships available. The City of Vancouver benefits economically from servicing these cruise ships, providing employment to 2,435 persons in 1992. The City of Vancouver benefited economically from servicing cruise ships, providing employment to 2,435 persons in 1992 and generating payments for goods and services of $119,700,000. The transfer of cruise ship-based economic activity from Vancouver to US ports could result in additional government revenues of $97,600,000 per year at 1992 spending levels. SEC. 2. FOREIGN FLAG CRUISE VESSELS. Foreign-flag cruise vessels are allowed to transport passengers between ports in Alaska and other US ports, with exceptions. US cruise vessels can engage in coastwise trade in Alaska upon meeting certain requirements and obtaining a Certificate of Financial Responsibility from the Federal Maritime Commission. Foreign-flag cruise vessels transporting passengers under this section must be notified by the Secretary to terminate their service within one year of notification. Coastwise privileges granted to these vessels will expire 365 days after receiving the notification. Notifications will be issued in reverse order of entry into coastwise service and in a minimum number to ensure passenger safety. Foreign-flag cruise vessels must terminate their service within one year of notification. Coastwise privileges will expire 365 days after receiving the notification, with notifications issued in reverse order of entry into coastwise service to ensure passenger safety. If a United States cruise vessel does not enter the coastwise passenger trade within the specified time frame, the termination of service will be delayed by 90 days. The Act does not apply to foreign-flag cruise vessels that regularly carry passengers and cargo for hire. It does not affect the transportation authority for Canadian vessels in Alaska."
