It includes provisions for disclosures, enforcement, civil liability, and application of state and federal laws. The Rent-To-Own Reform Act of 2006 aims to address issues in the rent-to-own industry, such as targeting low-income neighborhoods, lack of disclosure in contracts, and unfair collection practices. It seeks to provide consumers with protections similar to retail installment sales under State and Federal laws. The Rent-To-Own Reform Act of 2006 aims to provide protections to consumers in rent-to-own transactions, including disclosure of material terms and prohibiting abusive collection practices by dealers and collection agents. The Rent-To-Own Reform Act of 2006 includes definitions for key terms used in rent-to-own transactions. The Rent-To-Own Reform Act of 2006 provides definitions for key terms used in rent-to-own transactions, including definitions for 'Board' as the Federal Reserve System, 'cash price' as fair market price, and 'consumer' as an individual for personal, family, or household purposes. The Rent-To-Own Reform Act of 2006 defines 'credit' as the right granted to a consumer to possess consumer goods under a rent-to-own contract before full payment, with credit calculated as total payments minus cash price and fees.

The term 'rent-to-own transaction' refers to the lease or bailment of an item of consumer goods under such a contract. The term 'seller' includes a person who agrees to transfer ownership of the item to the consumer upon fulfilling all obligations under the contract. The term 'seller' in the Rent-To-Own Reform Act of 2006 refers to a person who regularly provides consumer goods under rent-to-own contracts and to whom payments are due. The term 'State' includes any state, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and any U.S. territory or possession. SEC. 1004. Application of state laws regarding fees, charges, guarantees, and warranties to rent-to-own transactions. In a rent-to-own transaction, a seller is limited in charging interest, finance charges, or fees that exceed the state laws' limits for credit sales or retail installment sales of similar items. This includes restrictions on interest rates, fees, and credit insurance premiums. In a rent-to-own transaction, a seller can charge additional termination fees and fees that are reasonable in relation to the cash price of the item. In a rent-to-own transaction, termination fees are limited to 5% of the cash price, must be disclosed in the contract, and can be paid upfront or over time. Recovery fees must also be disclosed. Termination by the consumer in accordance with the contract's terms results in the return of the item to the seller. In a rent-to-own transaction, termination fees are limited to 5% of the cash price and must be disclosed in the contract. Termination by the consumer satisfies all obligations except fees due before termination. Guarantees and warranties for goods in rent-to-own transactions are governed by state laws. \"Federal laws apply to rent-to-own transactions, with termination fees limited to 5% of the cash price and must be disclosed in the contract.\" The Truth in Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act apply to rent-to-own transactions. The laws ensure consumer protection and fair treatment in credit transactions. Payments owed are treated as debt under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, applying to credit transactions and credit extension or denial. SEC. 1006. DISCLOSURES. The seller must provide specific information on each item available for purchase in a rent-to-own transaction, including the cash price, itemized services with their prices, annual percentage rate, payment schedule, and total payments required for ownership. Upon entering a rent-to-own contract, the seller must provide written disclosures to the consumer, including whether the item is new or used, as required by the Truth in Lending Act regulations. \"SEC. 1007. PROHIBITIONS AND ENFORCEMENT.\" Prohibitions under a rent-to-own contract include not threatening criminal prosecution, using coercion to collect payments, engaging in harassing conduct, disclosing consumer information to third parties, or engaging in fraudulent behavior. Prohibited actions under a rent-to-own contract include making fraudulent representations, using unconscionable means to collect debts, falsely advertising services as free when they have charges, and using incorrect definitions of \"cash price\" for compliance with laws. The Federal Trade Commission enforces compliance with regulations related to rent-to-own transactions, prohibiting unfair or deceptive practices and violations of issued regulations. The Federal Trade Commission enforces regulations related to rent-to-own transactions, treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Board and the Federal Trade Commission issue regulations to implement and enforce these rules. The Federal Trade Commission will issue regulations for subsection (b). SEC. 1008. CIVIL LIABILITY. Liability for Failure To Properly Disclose Terms under section 1006 includes actual damages, $250 for each failure, and legal costs. Other violations of the title result in liability for actual damages, $2,500 per violation, and legal fees. An action under this title can be brought in any US district court within 24 months of the violation. This does not prevent asserting a violation in a collection action more than 2 years after the violation occurred. The Rent-To-Own Reform Act of 2006 applies to rent-to-own contracts entered into after regulations are issued by the Board. It does not apply to motor vehicle leases or sales subject to the Truth in Lending Act. The Board must issue necessary regulations within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The Rent-To-Own Reform Act of 2006 does not affect state laws regarding rent-to-own transactions, except where there is inconsistency. Consumer lease provisions of the Truth in Lending Act do not apply to rent-to-own transactions, except for motor vehicle leases or sales."
