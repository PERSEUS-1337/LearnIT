    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Women's Choice and Reproductive Health Protection Act of 1995\". Congress recognizes the importance of reproductive rights for women's full enjoyment of legal rights. Abortion has been a legal medical procedure in the US since 1973, supported by major medical institutions. However, access to abortion services is decreasing, with 84% of counties lacking providers. Between 1982 and 1992, the number of abortion providers decreased in 45 states. Congress must retain policies such as funding for abortion services for victims of rape or incest, protection from clinic violence, implementation of contraceptive and infertility research programs, authorization of family planning programs, prohibition of gag rules on reproductive medical information, and evaluation of the drug Mifepristone. The curr_chunk discusses various reproductive rights issues, including the evaluation of the drug Mifepristone, establishment of cancer screening programs, the right to choose as per Roe v. Wade, fairness in insurance, and access to abortion services for military personnel overseas. The curr_chunk states the sense of Congress regarding certain reproductive health issues. The sense of Congress supports funding for abortion services in cases of life endangerment, rape, and incest under the medicaid program. Federal resources are deemed necessary to ensure safe access to reproductive health facilities and combat violence nationwide. The sense of Congress supports adequate funding for preventive health measures, research centers, and loan repayment programs related to reproductive health services under the Public Health Service Act. Contracts under section 487B of the Public Health Service Act should receive sufficient funding for research programs. SEC. 4. FAMILY PLANNING AMENDMENTS. The Public Health Service Act is amended to authorize appropriations for family planning grants and contracts. SEC. 5. FREEDOM OF FULL DISCLOSURE. The Civil Rights Act is amended to include information about reproductive health care services. SEC. 1107 prohibits governmental authorities from restricting the provision or receipt of nonfraudulent information about reproductive health care services. It includes family planning, prenatal care, adoption, and abortion services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to ensure that the FDA evaluates the drug Mifepristone or RU-486 according to the law. Additionally, initiatives to promote testing, licensing, and manufacturing of the drug in the US are to be assessed. Congress acknowledges the constitutional limits set by the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on states' power to restrict abortion rights, which have evolved since 1989. Certain States have restricted women's right to choose to terminate a pregnancy or use contraception, leading to illegal or unsafe abortions, hindering interstate commerce, and impeding freedom of travel. Certain States have restricted women's access to safe and legal abortion, burdening medical resources and interfering with healthcare services. This also obstructs access to contraception and discriminates against women who cannot afford interstate travel, infringing on their rights secured by Federal and State law. Congress has the power to enact legislation to create statutory rights in areas of national concern and to prohibit State interference with interstate commerce, liberty, or equal protection of the laws. The purpose of this section is to establish limitations on a State's power to restrict a woman's freedom to terminate a pregnancy. The section establishes limitations on a State's power to restrict a woman's freedom to terminate a pregnancy, allowing freedom of choice before fetal viability and restricting it after unless necessary for the woman's life or health. Requirements on abortion procedures can be imposed if medically necessary. The section clarifies that states cannot prevent unwilling individuals or healthcare institutions from refusing to participate in abortions, decline to pay for abortions, or require minors to involve a parent before terminating a pregnancy. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories. SEC. 8. FAIRNESS IN INSURANCE. Federal law cannot prohibit health insurance providers from offering coverage for reproductive health care services, including abortion. SEC. 9. Abortions in facilities of the Uniformed Services not prohibited if not federally funded. Section 1093 of title 10, United States Code is amended to allow abortions in facilities of the uniformed services located outside the 48 contiguous states if the cost is fully paid from a source other than Department of Defense funds, abortions are not prohibited by local laws, and the abortion is permitted under applicable healthcare laws for members and dependents."
