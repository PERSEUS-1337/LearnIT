The Congress acknowledges the importance of organ procurement organizations in increasing organ donation. The current certification process by the Department of Health and Human Services is causing uncertainty and hindering the effectiveness of organ procurement organizations. Recommendations for changes in the certification process have been made by various organizations due to identified limitations. The current certification process for organ procurement organizations is criticized for its exclusive reliance on population-based performance measures, immediate decertification without opportunity for corrective action, and lack of due process for appeal. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can extend the recertification period for organ procurement organizations from 2 to 4 years based on past practices to avoid disruption. This extension allows for the development of improved performance measures to accurately assess organ procurement organizations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can extend the recertification period for organ procurement organizations from 2 to 4 years to improve performance measures and certification processes. SEC. 3. CERTIFICATION AND RECERTIFICATION OF ORGAN PROCUREMENT ORGANIZATIONS. The amendment to Section 1138(b) of the Social Security Act sets forth regulations for the certification and recertification process of organ procurement organizations by the Secretary. The amendment to Section 1138(b) of the Social Security Act establishes regulations for certifying and recertifying organ procurement organizations. Certification or recertification can occur once every 4 years and must meet performance standards based on outcome and process measures. Organizations failing to meet standards may submit a corrective action plan. The Secretary may approve a corrective action plan submitted by an organization, granting an additional 3-year implementation period. Organizations under a corrective action plan are considered certified. The Secretary must establish procedures for organizations to appeal certification denials. In 2000, organizations with existing certifications are subject to transition rules. The procurement organization's certification or recertification under the Social Security Act will remain valid until January 1, 2002, or until the Secretary publishes a final rule implementing new provisions."
