    "content": "The \"Safe Reprocessed Medical Devices Act of 2002\" aims to increase the safety of reprocessed single-use medical devices, provide accurate information to health professionals, and report adverse events to the FDA. The \"Safe Reprocessed Medical Devices Act of 2002\" amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to regulate the reprocessing of single-use medical devices intended for use on a single patient. The reprocessed device must be approved as safe and effective for the intended number of uses or be substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device. The device must also be labeled with the number of times it has been reprocessed. The reprocessed medical device must be labeled with the number of times it has been reprocessed, the name of the reprocessor and original manufacturer, and a statement indicating it is a reprocessed device for single use. The Secretary shall review reprocessed medical devices exempt from reporting requirements to determine if they pose substantial health risks and if a safety report is necessary for their effectiveness. The Secretary will review reprocessed medical devices to assess risks and decide if they need safety reports. Public comments will be sought on whether devices should remain exempt. A list of devices no longer exempt will be published, and reprocessors must submit a report within 120 days. During this period, the device cannot be deemed misbranded or adulterated for lack of submission. After submitting a report to the Secretary, the device's classification must be determined before it can be deemed misbranded or adulterated. Failure to submit a required report may trigger subsection (o). The termination of an exemption for a reprocessed device does not affect the exemption for the original device. Reprocessed devices previously used in patients cannot be introduced into interstate commerce. The text discusses the exemption of reprocessed medical devices from being labeled as new or unused when introduced into interstate commerce. The Secretary must consider additional risks from reprocessing when determining exemptions for such devices. The Secretary must consider additional risks from reprocessing when determining exemptions for reprocessed single-use devices. Validation data on cleaning, sterilization, and functional performance is required to ensure substantial equivalence to a predicate device. The Secretary must publish a list of reprocessed single-use device types and require validation data for reports on these devices. The Secretary requires validation data for reprocessed single-use devices listed, to be submitted within 9 months. No adverse actions can be taken solely for lack of validation data during this period. After submission, no misbranding or adulteration determinations can be made until certain conditions are met. Upon a determination that a device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device under clause (iii), the device may no longer be legally marketed. The Secretary may require validation data in reports for revising device lists. Definitions for 'single-use device' and 'reprocessed' are added to the Act. The definition of a reprocessed single-use device is clarified, stating that it includes devices described as 'recycled'. The term 'original device' is defined as a new, unused single-use device. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will modify the MEDWATCH forms within 6 months to improve reporting on reprocessed devices, including reprocessor details and reuse status."
