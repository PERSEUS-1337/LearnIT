    "content": "The Trade Injury Compensation Act of 2000 may be cited as such. Key findings are also included in the Act. The Trade Injury Compensation Act of 2000, also known as the Act, includes key findings by Congress regarding the importance of promoting competition in global markets through trade agreements. It highlights the significance of the World Trade Organization's dispute resolution mechanism in maintaining stability and predictability in world trade. Additionally, it emphasizes the negative impact on the US economy when foreign countries fail to comply with WTO reports, allowing for retaliatory measures such as imposing additional duties on noncomplying countries. The World Trade Organization ruled in favor of the United States against the European Union's ban on US beef with hormones. The US beef industry has suffered due to the EU's noncompliance, and a Beef Industry Compensation Trust Fund should be established. Additional duties imposed should provide relief to the US beef industry affected by noncompliance. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include terms such as Uruguay Round Agreements, World Trade Organization, WTO Agreement, WTO member, and injured producer. The \"beef retaliation list\" refers to products from EU countries subject to higher duties by the US Trade Representative due to the EU's ban on US beef with hormones, following a dispute resolution at the World Trade Organization. SEC. 4. BEEF INDUSTRY COMPENSATION TRUST FUND. Establishment of the \"Beef Industry Compensation Trust Fund\" in the Treasury of the United States, funded by appropriations and credits, including amounts from additional duties on products on a United States beef retaliation list. Transfers to the Fund are based on estimates and occur quarterly from the general fund of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers funds quarterly to the Beef Industry Compensation Trust Fund based on estimates. The remaining amount is invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, with interest and proceeds credited back to the Fund. The Fund is credited and forms part of it. Amounts in the Fund are available for distributions as per appropriations Acts. The Secretary of Agriculture can provide grants from the Fund to a beef promotion board for various purposes. The Secretary of the Treasury will stop transferring duties on the beef retaliation list when the EU complies with WTO ruling. Any unused funds will benefit the domestic beef industry. The Secretary of the Treasury will report to Congress annually on the Fund's financial condition and operations. The Secretary of the Treasury will report annually to Congress on the Fund's financial condition and operations during the preceding and next fiscal year. PROHIBITION ON REDUCING SERVICES OR FUNDS: Payments to injured producers under this Act cannot result in the reduction or denial of any entitled services or assistance."
