    "content": "Members of Congress and the Obama Administration are debating short- and long-term efforts to sustain recovery, stimulate the economy, reduce the federal budget deficit, and stabilize the national debt. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established mechanisms for deficit reduction over a 10-year period. President Obama submitted a detailed FY2013 budget proposal to Congress, and the House passed a concurrent resolution on the FY2013 budget based on a proposal by Committee Chairman Paul Ryan. Several Members of the Senate are also involved in the budget discussions. The Senate has not agreed on a concurrent resolution for the FY2013 budget, but the appropriations process is ongoing in both chambers. The House passed the Sequester Replacement Reconciliation Act (H.R. 5652) on May 15 to repeal and replace the automatic spending reduction scheduled for January. The CRS report compares proposals to repeal and replace sequestration with specific spending reductions over FY2012-FY2022. It focuses on three proposals - the President's FY2013 budget, the House budget resolution, and the Conrad/Fiscal Commission resolution - that impact human resources programs. These programs accounted for 67% of federal outlays in FY2011. The report provides an overview of proposed spending trends and policy recommendations for human resources programs, including services, health, Medicare, income security, Social Security, and Veterans benefits. It briefly explains budget functions and the Budget Control Act of 2011, which placed limits on discretionary spending for FY2012-FY2021. The report does not cover all provisions in the proposals or quantify costs/savings associated with specific proposals. The report compares federal spending projections under current law for human resources programs with various budget proposals. It analyzes how the Budget Control Act of 2011 impacted spending limits and outlines key policy initiatives proposed by the Administration and in budget resolutions. The federal budget is divided into functional categories and subfunctions, with some grouped into \"superfunctions.\" Congress uses the budget resolution as an internal blueprint for considering budget priorities after the President submits his detailed budget request. The congressional budget resolution is an internal blueprint for Congress to consider appropriations acts and legislation for the upcoming fiscal year. It sets enforceable levels for projected spending, revenues, deficit/surplus, and national debt. Unlike the President's budget request, it does not specify spending levels by program but establishes aggregate spending amounts for functional categories. These amounts are based on assumptions about specific programs but are not binding on appropriations committees. The congressional budget process includes tools for enforcing the annual budget resolution, such as points of order to prevent legislation violating spending ceilings or revenue floors. The \"reconciliation\" process can also be used to implement budget policy, as seen in the House-passed budget resolution for FY2013. The reconciliation instructions in H.Con.Res. 112 led to the creation of a reconciliation bill (H.R. 5652) that passed the House on May 15, 2012. The Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 established limits on discretionary spending for FY2012 through FY2021, impacting the CBO \"current law\" baseline for human resources programs. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established discretionary spending limits for security and nonsecurity categories. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was tasked with developing legislation to achieve $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction over a specific period. Failure to pass the legislation would trigger automatic spending reductions. Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, a Joint Committee failed to meet its deadline for deficit reduction legislation, leading to automatic spending reductions starting in January 2013. These reductions include sequestration of mandatory and discretionary spending, with half coming from the Department of Defense. The Budget Control Act of 2011 led to automatic spending reductions starting in January 2013, with half coming from the Department of Defense. Nonsecurity spending is exempt from sequestration or subject to special rules. CBO allocated budgetary effects of the BCA to budget Function 920. The Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in automatic spending cuts, with half from the Department of Defense. CBO adjusted the baseline for Medicare and human resources to eliminate projected effects of sequestration under the BCA. The CBO baseline for human resources budget functions does not include spending reductions scheduled under the Budget Control Act. Mandatory spending is mostly exempt from sequestration, so the baseline for these functions would not change significantly. However, budget functions with discretionary spending would see lower baselines if BCA provisions were included. Function 500, which includes discretionary spending for education, training, employment, and social services, could be significantly affected by spending reductions and lower limits in FY2014 and beyond. Function 700, primarily for veterans benefits and services, is exempt from sequestration but could still be impacted by lower discretionary spending limits. CBO's baseline does not yet reflect the Supreme Court's decision on the Affordable Care Act. The CBO is analyzing the impact of the Supreme Court's decision on the ACA on federal spending and revenues. Human resources spending accounts for a majority of federal outlays, showing a growing trend over time. In FY2011, it represented 67% of all federal spending and 16.1% of GDP. In FY2011, human resources spending dropped slightly to 16.1% of GDP. National defense spending peaked in FY1968 at 9.4% of GDP and decreased to 4.7% in FY2011. CBO projects human resources spending to fluctuate around 15.5% of GDP until climbing back to 16.1% in FY2022, remaining higher than pre-recession levels. Fueling long-term growth are factors such as the effects of the baby boom generation's retirement, increased enrollment in Medicare and Social Security, wage indexing in Social Security, medical cost inflation, and new spending from the ACA of 2010. Cost-mitigating factors include economic recovery, lower spending on programs like Unemployment Insurance and SNAP, and the expiration of stimulus funding from the ARRA. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5) shows that spending in human resources is dominated by health (Function 550 - Medicaid), Medicare (Function 570), income security (Function 600), and Social Security (Function 650). Projections indicate a decrease in spending for income security and smaller functions, while spending on health, Medicare, and Social Security will increase due to an aging population and rising healthcare costs. Real spending for Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security within the human resources superfunction is projected to increase by 2022. Medicaid is estimated to account for 22% of human resources spending, Medicare for 23%, and Social Security for 34%. Income security programs are expected to decrease from 23% to 14% of human resources spending by 2022. Other smaller functions will also contract as a share of the superfunction. Federal low-income assistance programs, including veterans programs, are projected to decrease to 4% in FY2022 under Function 700. Health care programs like Medicaid, CHIP, and health insurance tax credits are expected to see growth, while spending for other purposes contracts. The health insurance tax credit created under the ACA of 2010 is set to begin in 2014. Spending for non-health low-income programs is expected to decrease over the next decade. Comparison of estimated outlays for human resources spending as a share of GDP shows relatively flat projections with slight dips in FY2017 and FY2018 before gradually rising. The President's budget and Conrad/Fiscal Commission resolution align closely with CBO baseline, with the Administration proposing increased spending in the early years. The Administration proposes increased spending in the early years, while the House budget resolution assumes decreasing spending for human resources as a share of GDP. CBO projects human resources spending to be 16.1% of GDP in FY2022. The House resolution assumes lower limits on discretionary spending compared to the BCA. The House budget resolution differs from the President and the Conrad/Fiscal Commission in budget Functions 550 (Medicaid) and 600 (income security) over the next 10 years. The House Budget Committee report also mentions different long-term policy assumptions for Medicare, but these changes would not occur until after FY2022. Funding for the Department of Education (ED) and social services programs within the Department of Health and Human Services are included in Function 500. Function 500 includes funding for Department of Education, social services programs in Department of Health and Human Services, and employment and training programs in Department of Labor. It also covers funding for Library of Congress, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Smithsonian Institution, National Gallery of Art, and other art agencies. Most spending in Function 500 is discretionary, with mandatory spending on student financial assistance, training, and Social Services Block Grants. The spending is divided into six subfunctions: education, higher education, research, training, labor services, and social services. Function 500 consists of discretionary spending on education, training, employment, and social services. Most of the spending in this function is subject to sequestration under the Budget Control Act (BCA), except for Pell Grants and Social Services Block Grants which are exempt. The budgetary effects of the BCA are not reflected in the current law baseline, resulting in higher estimated outlays for Function 500 programs. Estimated outlays for Function 500 programs from FY2012 to FY2022 in constant FY2012 dollars are shown in Figure 5 under different scenarios. CBO projects a decline initially, followed by an increase from FY2015 to FY2019, leveling off thereafter. The Administration's budget proposes a spike in spending, followed by a decline through FY2017, remaining below the CBO baseline. The Conrad/Fiscal Commission resolution tracks slightly lower than the CBO baseline. The House budget resolution shows a decrease in spending for Function 500 through FY2014, followed by a gradual rise. CBO projects that Function 500 will consume 0.55% of GDP in FY2013 and drop to 0.47% by FY2022. This is compared to other budget proposals with varying percentages of GDP consumption. The Administration proposes short-term funding increases for critical investment areas within the original BCA discretionary spending limits. The Administration proposes short-term funding increases for activities to create jobs and boost economic recovery, including grants for school modernization, teacher hiring, and summer jobs for low-income youth. The President also calls for program consolidations and increased spending for certain initiatives like Race to the Top and school reform programs. Additionally, efforts to maintain college access and affordability include sustaining the maximum Pell Grant award. The President proposes to sustain a maximum Pell Grant award of $5,635, double college work-study jobs, provide incentives for states and colleges to keep tuition costs down, and shift campus-based aid towards colleges that restrain tuition increases. The Administration plans to consolidate and eliminate certain job training programs while expanding access to workforce development services. The House Budget Committee suggests reorganizing education programs, terminating ineffective programs, and addressing duplication in teacher quality. The House Budget Committee proposes changes to higher education programs, including modifications to the Pell Grant program, consolidation of job training programs, termination of funding for cultural agencies, and elimination of certain programs. They also suggest removing regulatory provisions to allow for more flexibility and innovative teaching methods. The House Budget Committee proposes changes to higher education programs, including modifications to the Pell Grant program and termination of certain student loan provisions. The Conrad/Fiscal Commission resolution includes reduced discretionary spending and elimination of in-school interest subsidies for federal student loan programs. Function 550 covers health care services programs, such as Medicaid and anti-bioterrorism activities. Health programs in Function 550 fund anti-bioterrorism activities, national biomedical research, health services for under-served populations, and training for the health care workforce. Agencies in this function include NIH, CDC, HRSA, and FDA. Major mandatory programs are Medicaid, CHIP, federal health benefits, and health care for Medicare-eligible military retirees. Spending is divided among Health care services, Health research and training, and Consumer and occupational health and safety subfunctions. Majority of spending is mandatory and exempt from sequestration. Function 550 includes both mandatory and discretionary spending, with most of the spending being exempt from sequestration. Certain discretionary health programs have a special rule limiting sequestration to 2%. The budgetary effects of the BCA are not reflected in CBO's baseline at the function level. The Supreme Court's decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius on June 28, 2012, had implications for federal government actions. The Supreme Court's decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius on June 28, 2012, ruled that states cannot lose current Medicaid funding for refusing to expand the program as required by the ACA. The decision may impact the CBO baseline and is currently being assessed. The House budget resolution shows a different trend in Medicaid spending compared to other budgets, with a relatively flat real spending trajectory. Medicaid spending is expected to increase sharply over the next 10 years due to the ACA expansion. As a share of GDP, Function 550 is projected to consume 2.35% in FY2013 and rise to 3.52% by FY2022 under the CBO baseline. The Administration proposes legislative initiatives to reduce spending growth in the health function, including replacing federal-state matching rates under Medicaid and CHIP with a single federal matching rate. They plan to phase down the Medicaid provider tax threshold starting in FY2015 and rebasing Medicaid disproportionate share hospital allotments in FY2021. Additionally, there will be a limit set on Medicaid reimbursement for durable medical equipment. The House Budget Committee proposes fundamental reform of Medicaid, including setting a limit on reimbursement for durable medical equipment and converting Medicaid spending into a block grant indexed for inflation. They advocate repealing Medicaid expansions in the ACA, eliminating subsidies for low-income individuals to purchase insurance, and removing the individual mandate. Savings are expected through program integrity initiatives. The House budget resolution proposes savings by repealing unspent funds from ARRA and ACA. The Senate Budget Committee documents suggest adopting program changes recommended by the Simpson-Bowles Commission for Medicaid, including eliminating provider taxes as state share, covering dual-eligibles under Medicaid managed care, reducing administrative costs, and expediting Medicaid waivers. Medicare, which provides health insurance to individuals 65 or older and certain disabled persons, is mostly mandatory spending in Function 570. Medicare, providing health insurance to individuals 65 or older and certain disabled persons, consists mostly of mandatory spending. Nearly 99% of spending is mandatory, with almost all going towards Medicare benefits. Congress appropriates funds for program administration. Sequestration under the BCA limits most Medicare mandatory spending to 2%, exempting certain programs like the low-income drug subsidy. CBO estimates that 90% of mandatory Medicare spending is subject to the 2% limit, with the rest completely exempt. Discretionary Medicare administrative expenses are not exempt from sequestration. The CBO baseline for Medicare does not include the impact of sequestration. Estimated outlays for Medicare from FY2012 to FY2022 show little difference between budgets, with the House resolution slightly lower. CBO estimates Medicare will consume 3.23% of GDP in FY2013, rising to 3.65% by FY2022. The Administration's budget assumes a freeze on physician payment rates under Medicare, increasing baseline spending. Proposed reductions in Medicare spending include adjustments to payment updates for post-acute care providers and teaching hospitals. The Administration's budget proposes reductions in Medicare spending, including adjustments to payment updates for post-acute care providers and teaching hospitals. It also includes increasing income-related premiums for Part B and Part D, aligning Medicare Part D drug payments with Medicaid rates, and building upon initiatives from the ACA to control rising healthcare costs. The White House proposes changes to reduce Medicare spending through the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) with lower target growth rates and additional tools. The House Budget Committee recommends converting Medicare into a \"premium support\" program, allowing individuals to choose private health insurance plans with subsidies. This policy recommendation would not impact individuals aged 55 or older. The current proposal suggests gradually increasing the age of eligibility for Medicare to align with Social Security, starting in 2023. It includes budget-neutral replacement for the current SGR formula, repeal of the IPAB, medical liability insurance reform, and additional means-testing of Medicare Part B and Part D premiums for high-income seniors. The Conrad/Fiscal Commission resolution acknowledges the ACA's foundation for long-term health care savings but emphasizes the need for further action. The Conrad/Fiscal Commission resolution acknowledges the ACA's foundation for long-term health care savings and emphasizes the need for further action, including reform of the SGR formula and expanding the reach of IPAB to make recommendations affecting hospitals and other providers. Function 600 includes federal entitlement programs for various groups such as persons with disabilities, the unemployed, and those in need of income support. It covers programs like Unemployment Insurance, SNAP, TANF, foster care, adoption assistance, SSI, EITC, ACTC, retirement, disability, and housing assistance. This function also includes spending on General retirement and disability insurance, Federal employee retirement, Unemployment insurance, Housing assistance, and Food programs. Function 600 covers federal entitlement programs for various groups including persons with disabilities, the unemployed, and those in need of income support. It includes spending on Federal employee retirement, Unemployment insurance, Housing assistance, Food and nutrition assistance, and Other income security. While most spending in Function 600 is mandatory and exempt from sequestration, discretionary programs like housing assistance would be affected by the Budget Control Act's enforcement mechanism. The budgetary effects of the BCA are not reflected in the CBO baseline, impacting estimated outlays for Function 600 programs from FY2012 through FY2022. The Administration's budget request, House budget resolution, and Conrad/Fiscal Commission resolution all show a decline in real spending through FY2018, with a slight rise in the final four years. Function 600 covers federal entitlement programs for various groups and includes spending on Federal employee retirement, Unemployment insurance, Housing assistance, Food and nutrition assistance, and Other income security. As a share of GDP, CBO estimates Function 600 will consume 3.37% of the national economy in FY2013 and fall to 2.30% by FY2022. The Administration's budget includes proposals for UI and SNAP spending reductions as the economy recovers. It also proposes extending tax provisions like EITC and ACTC. Additionally, there are provisions to address UI system shortfalls. The House budget resolution includes provisions to address shortfalls in the UI system and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. It suggests converting SNAP into a block grant tailored for each state's low-income population, with work requirements similar to TANF. The resolution also assumes eliminating categorical eligibility for SNAP and increasing federal employee contributions. The House budget resolution includes increases in federal employee retirement contributions, reduction in Railroad Retirement benefits, elimination of HAMP, and creation of a sliding income scale for children's SSI eligibility. The resolution also aims to reform means-tested entitlements and adopt non-health mandatory savings recommended by the Simpson-Bowles Commission. The House budget resolution includes goals of protecting the disadvantaged, ending wasteful spending, and looking to the private sector. Specific recommendations for Function 600 include creating a task force for cost-saving changes to the federal retirement program and allowing the PBGC to increase premiums. The committee also mentions tax reform options, legislation to improve trigger mechanisms for the Extended Benefit program, and Social Security programs under Function 650. The function includes Social Security benefit payments (mandatory) and funds for program administration (discretionary). Social Security benefits are exempt from sequestration under the BCA, while administrative funds are subject to budget enforcement. The budgetary effects of the BCA are not reflected in the CBO baseline for Function 650. Despite the exempt funding, the CBO baseline remains essentially unchanged. Figure 9 displays estimated outlays for Function 650 from FY2012 to FY2022 under different budget scenarios, showing minimal differences between them. The figure displays minimal differences in outlays for Social Security under different budget scenarios from FY2012 to FY2022. The Administration's budget supports Social Security reform but opposes privatization and requests funds to reduce disability claims backlog. No significant policy changes are assumed in Social Security within the 10-year budget window. The House Budget Committee proposes reauthorizing demonstration authority for the Disability Insurance program and implementing program integrity measures to reduce the disability claims backlog. The House resolution requires the Social Security Board of Trustees to recommend statutory reforms to the President in deficit years, with expedited procedures for congressional consideration. The Conrad/Fiscal Commission resolution endorses the Social Security reform recommendations of the Simpson-Bowles Commission. The Simpson-Bowles Commission's Social Security reform recommendations endorsed by the Conrad/Fiscal Commission include moving towards a more progressive benefit formula, enhancing benefits for low-wage workers, increasing benefits for older beneficiaries, and gradually increasing retirement ages based on life expectancy. The curr_chunk discusses various proposals for Social Security reform, including gradually increasing the taxable maximum, adopting the Chained Consumer Price Index for cost-of-living adjustments, and improving information provided to future beneficiaries. It also covers programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs and includes both mandatory and discretionary spending accounts. The Monuments Commission oversees mandatory and discretionary funding for veterans' benefits and services, with almost 90% of discretionary funding going to veterans' health care. Programs under this function include income security, education, training, medical care, housing, and other benefits. All VA programs are exempt from sequestration, but federal administrative expenses could be reduced. The budgetary effects of the BCA are not reflected in the CBO baseline at the function level. Estimated outlays for Function 700 programs show increases in spending over the 10-year period, with a drop between FY2016 and FY2018. The Administration's proposed budget tracks slightly lower than other budget lines starting in FY2016. As a share of GDP, Function 700 is estimated to consume 0.85% of the national economy. Function 700 is estimated to consume 0.85% of the national economy in FY2013. VA spending is projected to decrease to 0.71% of GDP by FY2022 according to CBO, the House resolution, and the Conrad/Fiscal Commission resolution. Human resources programs make up the majority of federal outlays and have increased over the past five decades. CBO expects spending for these programs to remain lower for most of the coming decade but to rise towards the end of the decade and return to FY2011 levels by FY2022. Human resources spending is projected to decrease as a share of GDP over the next decade, with growth expected only in health care and Social Security. Policymakers are debating strategies to stimulate the economy, reduce the federal deficit, and stabilize the national debt. The CRS report compared three FY2013 budget proposals, highlighting differences in programs included in the human resources budget functions. The President's budget and the House budget propose different levels of spending for human resources programs over the next decade. The President suggests an immediate increase in spending for education, training, employment, and social services to boost the economy, while the House resolution calls for lower initial spending followed by a gradual increase. The House budget proposal differs from other budget proposals in its approach to Medicaid spending, aiming to keep it flat with a slight increase in the future by converting it into a capped block grant. This contrasts with the current structure of Medicaid maintained in other budgets with some legislative changes. The impact of the Supreme Court's decision on the Affordable Care Act on projected spending for Function 550 is still unknown. Projected spending for Medicare (Function 570) shows continued growth over the next 10 years in all three budget proposals. The House plans to change Medicare into a \"premium support\" program after FY2022, with other legislative changes expected in the near term. Spending on income security programs (Function 600) is projected to decrease over the 10-year period in current law and all budget proposals. Key initiatives in the budget proposals include converting SNAP into a block grant, extending certain tax credit provisions, and increasing retirement contributions for federal employees. Social Security spending remains consistent across all proposals, with no major legislative changes assumed. Veterans programs are not expected to undergo significant legislative changes in any of the proposals. The budget proposals assume increased spending for veterans programs under current law. There are significant differences in size among the proposed budgets, with varying impacts on deficit reduction. The House budget resolution envisions a reduction in spending for ETESS, while the Administration proposes an increase in spending for Medicaid and Medicare. In FY2022, spending for Medicaid and Medicare will be significantly higher than Function 500, with Social Security being 12 times larger. Reductions in these areas have far-reaching implications for deficit reduction. The House resolution proposes lower Medicaid spending compared to Medicare and Social Security. The Congressional Budget Office's baseline for Medicare is adjusted to align with other human resources functions. The appendix tables provide supporting data for the budgetary effects of sequestration triggered under the Budget Control Act."
