TITLE II--PROTECTING AND PRESERVING THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUNDS\n\nSEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\nThis title may be cited as the ``Protecting and Preserving the Social Security Trust Funds Act''. The Protecting and Preserving the Social Security Trust Funds Act emphasizes that the budget surplus should not be used for non-social security programs and that all surpluses generated by the social security trust funds must be used to strengthen the social security system. At least 62 percent of the on-budget surplus should be reserved for the social security trust funds. The Protecting and Preserving the Social Security Trust Funds Act reaffirms Congress's support for not counting social security trust fund receipts and disbursements in budget calculations. It also ensures that balances in the trust funds are used solely for paying social security benefits as required by law. Additionally, a new point of order is added to prevent using social security funds for other purposes. The Senate has established rules to protect the Social Security Trust Funds Act, including points of order against budget resolutions that violate specific sections of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 and would cause deficits. Additionally, subsequent legislation cannot be considered if it goes against these rules. The Senate rules protect the Social Security Trust Funds Act by imposing points of order against budget resolutions that would cause deficits. An exception is made for social security reform legislation that safeguards the system from insolvency and maintains promised benefits. Amendments to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 allow for supermajority waiver and appeal in certain cases. SEC. 204. SEPARATE BUDGET FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. The outlays and receipts of the social security program under title II of the Social Security Act, including the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, are excluded from official documents and publications by Federal agencies and other government entities. The outlays and receipts of the social security program under title II of the Social Security Act, including the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, shall be submitted as a separate budget. SEC. 205 of title 31, United States Code is amended to require the President's budget to be in compliance. Additionally, TITLE III focuses on saving Social Security first, with a designation of on-budget surplus. SEC. 301 designates on-budget surplus amounts for fiscal years to be reserved for and applied to the social security trust funds. The specified amounts range from $6,820,000,000 in 2001 to $102,300,000,000 in 2009. SENSE OF THE SENATE: If future budget surplus exceeds projections, more surplus should be directed to strengthen social security trust funds."
