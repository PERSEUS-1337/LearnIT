    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Carlsbad Irrigation Project Acquired Land Transfer Act\" and involves the conveyance of land. The Secretary of the Interior may convey acquired lands and interests in the Carlsbad Project to the Carlsbad Irrigation District, including related facilities. The Secretary retains surface rights and storage easements for lands under Brantley and Avalon dams in Eddy County, New Mexico. The conveyance terms are based on the 1978 Bureau of Reclamation report. Any conveyance of acquired lands under this Act shall be subject to terms and conditions including continued management by the District for Carlsbad Project purposes and assumption of rights and obligations from a 1994 agreement with the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish. The District is not obligated for financial support or entitled to any revenues from agreements related to fish and wildlife management at Brantley Lake State Park. If the Secretary fails to complete the conveyance within 180 days, certain conditions will apply. If the Secretary fails to complete the conveyance within 180 days, a report must be submitted to Congress within 30 days detailing encountered problems and steps taken to complete the conveyance. SEC. 3. LEASE MANAGEMENT AND PAST REVENUES COLLECTED FROM THE ACQUIRED LANDS. The Secretary of the Interior must identify and notify leaseholders of mineral and grazing leases on acquired lands. The District will assume rights and obligations for these leases and receive receipts for financing purposes. The District will take over operations, maintenance, and replacement of the Summer Dam previously managed by the Bureau of Reclamation. Major maintenance programs ongoing at the time of transfer will be funded through existing cost share formulas. The District will also comply with mineral leasing stipulations for the Carlsbad Project. Receipts in the reclamation fund will be deposited in the General Treasury for deficit reduction or debt retirement. After enactment, receipts from mineral and grazing leases on acquired lands will be used for implementing the Act and deficit reduction. Up to $200,000 will cover implementation costs, with additional costs shared between the Secretary and the District. The remaining amount will be deposited into the General Treasury for deficit reduction or debt retirement. SEC. 4. VOLUNTARY WATER CONSERVATION PRACTICES. The District can voluntarily implement water conservation practices. SEC. 5. LIABILITY. The United States is not liable for damages related to conveyed property, except for negligence. SEC. 6. FUTURE BENEFITS. Upon transfer, lands and facilities under this Act will no longer receive Reclamation benefits as part of a Reclamation Project. Passed the Senate on October 7, 1998."
