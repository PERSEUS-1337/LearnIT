Since July 2000, the FMS and IRS have jointly managed the program, which helps in collecting overdue federal taxes through continuous levies on federal payments. The FPLP allows the IRS to impose continuous levies on federal payments disbursed by the FMS to taxpayers with delinquent tax debt. Levies can be placed on various payments, including federal employee retirement annuities, federal payments to contractors, Social Security benefits, and federal salaries. The FMS can reduce these payments by up to 15% to settle tax debts, except for federal contractors who can be reduced by 100%. A database of individuals and companies with delinquent tax debts is maintained by the FMS for the program. The FMS maintains a database of individuals and companies with delinquent tax debts. The process of initiating a continuous levy involves the IRS sending tax debt information to the FMS, which then searches for matches in its database. If a match is found, the IRS notifies the taxpayer of its intent to levy federal payments until the tax debt is paid. If there is no response within 30 days, the FMS is authorized to levy all eligible federal payments. The IRS authorizes the FMS to levy federal payments from individuals or companies with tax debts until the debt is paid in full or other arrangements are made. The FMS sends a letter to the taxpayer after each levy, explaining the reduction in payment and advising them to contact the IRS. Certain federal tax debts cannot be collected through the FPLP, such as those in bankruptcy, innocent or injured spouses, or those in hardship situations. In January 2007, the IRS withheld 57% of individual and business tax debts. In January 2007, the IRS withheld 57% of individual and business tax debts through the FPLP. The IRS activated $63 billion in delinquent tax accounts for continuous levy in FY2007, but this does not guarantee immediate collection. The collection of overdue taxes through the FPLP totaled $345 million in FY2007, showing an increase from previous years. The TOP program allows for withholding federal payments to pay off delinquent federal and state non-tax debt. It was expanded in 1998 to include state tax debt collection. Debts must be delinquent for 180 days to be eligible for offset. The FMS began offsetting payments for federal non-tax debt in 1999 and state income taxes in 2000. 39 states and DC participate in the offset process. The Federal Payment Offset Program allows for withholding federal payments to pay off delinquent federal and state non-tax debt. Various federal payments can be offset, including retirement payments, IRS tax refunds, vendor payments, federal employee travel payments, federal salary payments, and Social Security benefit payments. The offset amount is determined by the individual's total debt, 15% of their monthly benefit payment, or the amount exceeding $750. The FMS compares payment recipient information with delinquent debt data before issuing an offset payment. The Federal Payment Offset Program allows for withholding federal payments to pay off delinquent federal and state non-tax debt. Before offsetting a payment, the FMS compares recipient information with delinquent debt data in its database. If a match is found, the payment is offset to the extent allowed by law. The debtor is informed through three letters over a few months before the offset takes place. Debt collections through the TOP totaled $3.6 billion in FY2007 and $30.8 billion from FY1999 through FY2007. The 110th Congress is considering proposals to expand the Federal Payment Offset Program (FPLP) due to concerns over the federal budget deficit and tax gap. The Medicare Provider Accountability Act (H.R. 4287, S. 1307) would require CMS to screen Medicare payments for delinquent tax debt under FPLP and TOP to recover non-tax debt. The proposal aims to expand the Federal Payment Offset Program (FPLP) to recover non-tax debt like unpaid child support and student loans. It would streamline the process for recovering unpaid taxes and allow the IRS to initiate a levy on federal payments to tax debtors sooner. Congressional interest in offsetting Medicare payments to providers has increased following a report by the Government Accountability Office. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlighted CMS's lack of mechanisms to prevent tax debtors from receiving Medicare payments, resulting in significant federal revenue loss. If CMS payments had been subject to levy through the FPLP, the government could have collected $50-140 million in delinquent taxes in the first nine months of 2005. According to a report, over 21,000 physicians, health care providers, and suppliers who received Medicare Part B payments owed over $1 billion in unpaid federal taxes as of September 30, 2005. A bill passed in February 2008 directed CMS to participate in the FPLP to process payments through the program, with specific targets to meet within certain timeframes. The bill passed in June 2008 (H.R. 6275) aimed to raise exemption amounts for individual taxpayers under the alternative minimum tax. It included an amendment allowing the IRS to levy federal payments to vendors selling or renting property to the government if they are delinquent in federal taxes. The Bush Administration's FY2009 budget request supported using the FPLP to screen Medicare payments for overdue taxes and proposed removing the 10-year limit on collecting delinquent federal non-tax debt. The Senate Subcommittee on Investigations discussed the collection of delinquent federal taxes from Medicaid providers in a 2007 hearing. Over 30,000 providers from seven states owed over $1 billion in taxes in FY2006. Legal barriers have hindered the use of the FPLP to collect these taxes. The Federal Contractor Tax Compliance Task Force (FCTC) has determined that federal payments to state Medicaid agencies do not qualify as \"federal payments\" under IRC Section 6331(h)(2)(A) and cannot be continuously levied to collect delinquent federal taxes. Legislation introduced in the House and Senate aims to authorize the IRS to subject any federal payment to Medicaid providers to tax collection. The bills introduced in the House and Senate aim to authorize the IRS to subject any federal payment to Medicaid providers to continuous levy under the FPLP for delinquent federal taxes, without specifying a particular implementation method or providing funds for the cost."
