    "content": "Modification of policy on plutonium use. The Congress finds that all grades of plutonium can be used for nuclear explosive devices, the Department of Defense views reprocessing plutonium as high proliferation risk, excess plutonium from civilian programs is a global security issue, and reprocessing programs may encourage proliferation in risky nations. Large surplus stockpiles of separated plutonium exist globally. Abundant and inexpensive sources of uranium have reduced the economic need for plutonium in civilian nuclear reactors. Breeder reactors, once major consumers of civil plutonium, have faced financial and technical challenges and have been abandoned or shut down in several countries. Reprocessing, once seen as cost-effective for nuclear fuel recycling, is now recognized as costly and environmentally hazardous. The United States has suspended military plutonium production and abandoned civil reprocessing and commercial breeder reactor development. Russia continues to separate plutonium for both civil and military purposes, accumulating a surplus of 30 tons of civil plutonium with no safe application. Global surplus of civil plutonium is mainly from reprocessing in the UK, France, and Japan, using spent fuel from the US-origin low enriched uranium. Enriched uranium transfer and disposition responsibility under nuclear cooperation agreements with countries. Large amounts of civil plutonium to be recovered in reprocessing plants in the UK, France, and Japan. Environmental challenges increase with radiation contamination in new plants. UK's THORP plant to separate 59 tons of plutonium in the next decade. President's communication to Congress on the matter. The President has requested a review of US nonproliferation policies, focusing on British reprocessing. The Irish government opposes THORP's operation due to health risks and proliferation concerns. The 1974 Convention parties agreed that new discharge authorizations for radioactive discharges should consider the need for spent fuel reprocessing. The UK government is reviewing the operation of THORP, with concerns raised about its financial viability and the need for commercial reprocessing. The UK government is reviewing the operation of THORP due to concerns about financial viability and the need for commercial reprocessing. Congress believes plutonium separation plants pose environmental hazards and proliferation risks, urging the President to address these concerns in discussions with the UK and other countries. The UK government is reviewing the operation of THORP due to concerns about financial viability and commercial reprocessing. The Government of the United Kingdom must act before the conclusion of the review."
