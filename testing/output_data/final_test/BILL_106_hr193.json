    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Wild and Scenic River Act\" and designates the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Scenic and Recreational Rivers in Massachusetts. The Congress designated segments of the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers in Massachusetts for study and potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The Study Committee advised the Secretary of the Interior in conducting the study and considering management alternatives for the rivers. The study determined eligible river segments for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers. The Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers in Massachusetts are eligible for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System based on their free-flowing condition and various values. This includes specific segments of each river, such as the Sudbury River from Danforth Street Bridge to its confluence with the Assabet River, the Assabet River from downstream of Damon Mill Dam to its confluence with the Sudbury River, and the Concord River from Egg Rock to the Route 3 bridge in Billerica. The towns directly abutting these segments include Framingham, Sudbury, Wayland, Lincoln, Concord, Bedford, and Carlisle. The towns of Framingham, Sudbury, Wayland, Lincoln, Concord, Bedford, Carlisle, and Billerica in Massachusetts have shown support for National Wild and Scenic River designation through town meeting votes. A comprehensive management plan was prepared for the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers, establishing objectives for long-term protection of their values and resources. The Study Committee recommended including these segments in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers in Massachusetts totaling 29 miles have been designated for management under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. This includes specific segments of the Sudbury and Assabet Rivers for scenic and recreational river designations. The 8-mile segment of the Concord River from Egg Rock at the confluence of the Sudbury and Assabet Rivers downstream to the Route 3 Bridge in Billerica is designated as a recreational river. It will be administered by the Secretary of the Interior in cooperation with the SUASCO River Stewardship Council through cooperative agreements with relevant political subdivisions. The management will follow the 'Sudbury, Assabet and Concord Wild and Scenic River Study, River Conservation Plan' dated March 16, 1995. The plan dated March 16, 1995, satisfies the requirement for a comprehensive management plan. The Director of the National Park Service will represent the Secretary of the Interior in implementing the plan and reviewing proposed federally assisted water resources projects for designated river segments. The Scenic Rivers Act allows the Director to enter cooperative agreements with Massachusetts, political subdivisions, trustees, and organizations for river protection. The Director can provide assistance for plan implementation, with a limit of $100,000 per year. The amendment made by subsection (b) states that any portion of a segment not already within the National Park System shall not become part of it, be managed by the National Park Service, or be subject to its regulations. The Secretary of the Interior must consider the impact of proposed water resources projects on the values of designated segments in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The plan and Water Resources Study will guide decision-making. The zoning bylaws of certain towns in Massachusetts are deemed to satisfy standards under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The US Government is prohibited from acquiring land along designated river segments or their tributaries. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act authorizes appropriations of up to $100,000 annually for the Secretary of the Interior. Amendments are made to designate specific paragraphs related to Elkhorn Creek, Oregon, and remove duplication in the existing paragraphs. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
