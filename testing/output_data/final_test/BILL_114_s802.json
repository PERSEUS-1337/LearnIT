    "content": "The \"Girls Count Act of 2015\" aims to address the lack of birth registration for children worldwide, highlighting that 4 out of 10 babies born in 2012 were not registered. This Act emphasizes the importance of a proof of birth system for determining a child's citizenship and nationality. The lack of birth registration among girls worldwide can hinder their access to official identification, leading to difficulties in obtaining documents like passports or driver's licenses. This lack of documentation can prevent girls and women from participating in the formal economic, legal, and political sectors, exacerbating their vulnerability to trafficking, child marriage, and limited access to health and education services. Additionally, it can further restrict their ability to seek employment, participate in civil society, or own property. Girls in poor families undertake domestic labor such as carrying water, harvesting crops, and caring for younger children. The lack of official information on women and girls hampers accurate assessments of access to education and poverty levels. To address this, it is crucial for girls to be counted and have access to birth certificates for inclusion in foreign assistance policies and programs. The United States policy aims to promote the rule of law and ensure equal participation of girls and boys in society by providing birth certifications. It also focuses on enhancing training in developing countries to address undercounting of girls and evaluating the impact of policies on girls. The United States aims to support programs in the developing world to improve Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems, prevent discrimination against girls in accessing birth certificates, and increase property rights and social security for girls. The Secretary and the Administrator are authorized to coordinate with multilateral organizations like the World Bank and United Nations to promote laws collecting data on girls and ensuring their participation in society. They can also collaborate with private sector and civil society organizations at local and international levels. The Secretary and the Administrator work with various organizations to advocate for the registration of all children in developing countries to prevent exploitation and provide opportunities. They report to Congress on foreign assistance beneficiaries and programs benefiting girls, and define terms in the Act. The Act defines key terms such as Administrator, Foreign assistance, and Secretary. It also includes a provision for the Act to expire five years after its enactment. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
