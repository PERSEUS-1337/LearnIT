    "title": "AB 2461",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2699 of the Labor Code is amended to allow aggrieved employees to bring civil actions for violations instead of the Labor and Workforce Development Agency. \"Person\" and \"aggrieved employee\" are defined for this purpose. In civil penalty cases, courts can exercise discretion similar to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency. Courts may award a lesser penalty if the maximum amount is deemed unjust or oppressive. Civil penalties are established for violations not specifically provided for in certain provisions. If a person does not employ any employees at the time of the violation, the civil penalty is $500. If the person does employ employees, the penalty is $100 per aggrieved employee for the initial violation and $200 per aggrieved employee for subsequent violations. No penalty is imposed for failures to act by the Labor and Workplace Development Agency. An aggrieved employee can recover a civil penalty through a civil action, with the right to seek attorney's fees and costs. This does not limit the employee's ability to pursue other remedies under state or federal law. An aggrieved employee cannot bring an action under this section if the agency has already taken action within the specified timeframes for the same violation. Civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees are distributed with 75% going to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement and education, and 25% to the employees themselves. Civil penalties recovered under subdivision (f)(1) are distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcing labor laws and educating employers and employees. The superior court reviews and approves any penalties in proposed settlements. This part does not affect the exclusive remedy provided by workers' compensation provisions for employer liability in work-related injuries or deaths. The section excludes the recovery of penalties related to workers' compensation laws. Agencies can create regulations to enforce the provisions. Section 2699.3 of the Labor Code is amended to specify requirements for civil actions by employees alleging violations. The aggrieved employee must notify the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and the employer in writing of alleged violations, providing supporting details. If the agency does not investigate within 30 days, the employee can pursue a civil action under Section 2699 of the Labor Code. If the agency decides to investigate the alleged violation, it must notify the employer and the aggrieved employee within 33 calendar days. The agency has 120 calendar days to investigate and issue a citation. If no citation is issued within 158 days or if the agency fails to provide timely notification, the aggrieved employee can start a civil action under Section 2699. A plaintiff can add a cause of action under specific labor code sections within 60 days of specified time periods. The time periods mentioned do not count towards the commencement of a civil action for penalties. Section 2699.5 of the Labor Code is repealed."
