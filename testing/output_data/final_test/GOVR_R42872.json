    "content": "To calculate federal tax liability, tax filers add up all income, subtract deductions to get adjusted gross income (AGI), then subtract personal exemptions. They deduct either itemized or standard deductions to arrive at taxable income, which is taxed at marginal rates. To calculate federal tax liability, tax filers subtract deductions from taxable income to arrive at a preliminary tax liability. Tax credits are then subtracted from this amount to determine the final tax liability. Deductions reduce tax liability based on the tax filer's marginal tax rate, while tax credits reduce tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The value of deductions varies depending on the tax filer's marginal tax bracket. Deductions in the tax code serve various purposes, such as accounting for personal expenditures, encouraging certain activities, easing the burden of nonfederal taxes, and adjusting for income-related expenses. Higher-income tax filers benefit more from deductions due to their marginal tax bracket. The tax code allows for deductions to reduce an individual's tax liability. Above-the-line deductions, such as teacher classroom expenses, appear on Form 1040 and reduce Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). These deductions are considered adjustments to income and can benefit tax filers seeking certain tax preferences. Itemized and standard deductions, known as below-the-line deductions, are applied after AGI is calculated to determine taxable income. The tax code allows deductions to reduce tax liability. Higher AGI reduces the likelihood of claiming tax preferences. Tax filers can choose standard or itemized deductions, with the deduction amount subtracted from AGI to determine final tax liability. The standard deduction, introduced in 1944, is a fixed amount available to all taxpayers without additional documentation. The standard deduction was introduced in 1944 to simplify tax administration and compliance by reducing excessive unsupportable claims of deductions. It also serves a social welfare purpose by providing a minimum amount of deductions from income. The standard deduction was introduced in 1944 to simplify tax administration and compliance by reducing excessive unsupportable claims of deductions. It also serves a social welfare purpose by providing a minimum amount of deductions from income. The calculation of the standard deduction has changed over time, with adjustments made to the percentage of AGI and maximum values. In 1964, a minimum standard deduction was introduced, and in 1977, a flat standard deduction was established. The standard deduction amounts have been indexed for inflation since 1985 and increased over time through various tax acts. The standard deduction has evolved over time through various tax acts, such as the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. The deduction for joint filers was increased to 200% of singles, but this provision expired in 2012. Currently, the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly is equal to 167% of the upper limit for singles for the 2013 tax year and beyond. For the 2015 tax year, the standard deductions are $12,600 for married filing jointly, $6,300 for single or married filing separately, and $9,250 for head of household. For the 2016 tax year, the standard deductions are the same except for head of household which is $9,300. There is also a standard deduction for dependents, limited to $1,050 or earned income for tax year 2016. The standard deduction for tax year 2016 is generally limited to the greater of $1,050 or the sum of earned income plus $350. Additional standard deductions for those aged 65 or older and those who are legally blind are increased by $1,550 for single or head of household and $1,250 for married filing jointly. These amounts are adjusted annually for inflation. Alternatively, tax filers claiming itemized deductions must list each item separately on their tax return and provide documentation in case of an IRS audit. Tax filers can itemize deductions with documentation for IRS audits since the Revenue Act of 1913. TRA86 limited itemized deductions, such as consumer interest, and introduced complex rules for investment interest. Only those with total deductions exceeding the standard deduction benefit from itemizing on IRS Schedule A form. Itemized deductions on the IRS Schedule A form have various requirements and limits. Some deductions require meeting minimum threshold amounts, like a certain percentage of AGI. For example, a threshold must be met to deduct casualty, disaster, or theft losses. Miscellaneous itemized deductions are allowed only if they exceed 2% of the individual's AGI, making it easier to decide between itemizing or taking the standard deduction. This helps streamline tax administration and compliance. The IRS imposes restrictions on itemized deductions to reduce the number of smaller events reviewed. Some deductions are subject to a 2% AGI floor, like unreimbursed meals while traveling for business. Caps are placed on certain deductions to prevent economic distortion and limit benefits, such as the $1 million limit on home mortgage interest for married couples filing jointly. These restrictions aim to prevent higher-income tax filers from taking advantage of certain deductions. The Pease limitation on itemized deductions, introduced in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, affects high-income tax filers by reducing certain deductions by 3% of AGI exceeding a threshold. This ceiling aims to curb incentives for wealthier individuals to finance home purchases with deductible interest. The Pease limitation on itemized deductions reduces deductions by 3% of AGI exceeding a threshold, with a maximum reduction of 80%. It was in effect from 1991 to 2009, repealed from 2010 to 2012, phased out between 2006 and 2009, reinstated in 2013, and restored for tax years 2013 and beyond by ATRA. For the 2016 tax year, the Pease threshold amounts are adjusted to $259,400 for single individuals, $285,350 for heads of household, $311,300 for married filing jointly or surviving spouses, and $155,650 for married filing separately. Tables 1 and 2 summarize above- and below-the-line tax deductions, referencing where provisions can be found on tax forms and in the Internal Revenue Code. Annual limits, income limits, and tax expenditure amounts for FY2016 and FY2017 are also provided. Tax expenditures for FY2016 and FY2017 are provided in the last column. These estimates are based on current law and do not include temporary provisions set to expire. Some tax deductions do not have estimates if they result in revenue losses less than $50 million per fiscal year. Not all deductions are considered tax expenditures for various reasons. The deduction for uncompensated employee expenses is an appropriate measure to adjust a tax filer's AGI."
