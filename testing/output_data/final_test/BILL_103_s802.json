    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress has directed the Secretary of Defense to seek multiyear burden sharing agreements with economically strong NATO allies to increase host nation contributions towards overseas basing costs for US forces. In fiscal year 1992, Germany contributed 23%, Italy 20%, and the UK also made contributions. In fiscal year 1992, the UK contributed approximately 14% of overseas basing costs for US forces, while Japan paid 75.1% according to a burden sharing agreement. The economically strong NATO allies were urged to contribute 75% of the costs. In fiscal year 1992, economically strong allies were urged to contribute 75% of overseas basing costs for US forces stationed in their countries to save the United States an estimated $5 billion. Increased burden sharing by allies of the United States. The President will negotiate with foreign nations to have them pay 75% of overseas basing costs for US Armed Forces stationed there under defense agreements. Covered nations include NATO members and others with defense agreements with the US. The United States has defense agreements with foreign nations allowing for the assignment of combat units or equipment. This does not apply to nations receiving assistance under specific Acts. SEC. 3. USE OF FUNDS FOR PAYING OVERSEAS BASING COSTS. Funds cannot exceed allowable percent of overseas basing costs for stationing US Armed Forces and civilian employees in a nation due to defense agreements. The allowable percent varies by fiscal year: 60% for 1994, 40% for 1995, and 25% for years after 1995. SEC. 4. WAIVER AUTHORITY. The President has the authority to waive limitations on overseas basing costs if it is in the national security interest. A plan and schedule must be submitted to Congress by September 30, 1993, for agreements with foreign nations to pay 75% of basing costs for US Armed Forces and civilian employees stationed there. Overseas basing costs are defined as all costs related to operating installations in foreign countries where US Armed Forces are based, including pay for foreign nationals, utilities, local services, military construction projects, real property maintenance, environmental restoration, leasing costs, taxes, user fees, tolls, and import duties. This definition excludes the pay and allowances of US Armed Forces members and civilian employees of the Department of Defense."
