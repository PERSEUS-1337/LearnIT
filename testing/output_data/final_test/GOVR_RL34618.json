    "content": "At the Munich Security Conference in February 2009, Vice President Joe Biden affirmed that the US would not recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states, emphasizing the right of sovereign states to make their own decisions. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili received strong support from the new US Administration during the conference. Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg warned Belarus against recognizing the independence of the regions, stating it would jeopardize its standing in the European Union. Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer warns that Western efforts to improve relations with Russia may embolden Russia to try to gain sovereignty over Georgia again. He suggests that Russia's claims of Georgia massing troops near South Ossetia could be a pretext for a new attack. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe criticizes Russia for not following ceasefire agreements and calls for the withdrawal of recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia's independence. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe condemned Russia for military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, called for international monitors and peacekeeping forces in the regions, and demanded Russian troop withdrawal from Georgian-controlled areas. They also urged access for human rights protection and criticized cross-border violence. Georgian residents fled as tensions in the region date back to the 1920s when South Ossetia tried to declare independence. Conflict escalated in 1990 and hostilities broke out in January 1991 between Georgia and South Ossetia. Winter weather has cut off the region from Russia, leading to an economic and humanitarian crisis. In 1992, a conflict broke out between Georgia and South Ossetia, resulting in thousands of deaths and displacement of people. A cease-fire was brokered by Russia, and peacekeeping units were established in a security zone around Tskhinvali. The units consisted of Russian, Georgian, and Ossetian troops, with monitoring by the OSCE. The Joint Control Commission, with representatives from Russia, Georgia, and North and South Ossetia, aimed to settle the conflict. Ethnic Georgians and Ossetians resided in different parts of the region. In the early 1990s, Georgians and ethnic Ossetians resided in different parts of the region, with many fleeing or migrating during the fighting. Russia's influence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia turned separatist conflicts into Russia-Georgia disputes. Most residents of these regions wanted to be part of Russia. Mikheil Saakashvili came to power in 2003, promising reforms and central government control over separatist regions. He increased pressure on South Ossetia by cracking down on smuggling involving Russian organized crime. In the region, there was an operation involving Russian organized crime and corrupt Georgian officials. Georgia sent troops into South Ossetia, while Georgian guerrilla forces and Russian officials also entered. President Saakashvili proposed a peace plan for South Ossetia in 2005, offering autonomy and a three-stage settlement. South Ossetian \"president\" Eduard Kokoiti rejected the plan. In response to the Georgian peace plan for South Ossetia, \"president\" Eduard Kokoiti rejected it and asserted South Ossetians' citizenship to Russia. Despite international support, Kokoiti proposed a peace plan for South Ossetia in December 2005, envisioning independence. A referendum in November 2006 reaffirmed South Ossetia's independence, but the OSCE and U.S. State Department did not recognize the results. In response to the Georgian peace plan for South Ossetia, President Eduard Kokoiti rejected it and asserted South Ossetians' citizenship to Russia. Despite international support, Kokoiti proposed a peace plan for South Ossetia in December 2005, envisioning independence. A referendum in November 2006 reaffirmed South Ossetia's independence, but the OSCE and U.S. State Department did not recognize the results. In March 2007, President Saakashvili proposed another peace plan for South Ossetia involving creating \"transitional\" administrative districts under Sanakoyev's authority. In July 2007, a commission was established to work out South Ossetia's \"status\" as part of Georgia, but no further meetings were held. Russia conducted a military exercise in July 2008 that was seen as a rehearsal for potential conflict. In July 2008, Russia conducted a military exercise named Caucasus 2008 near the border with Georgia, involving 8,000 troops. The scenario involved a hypothetical attack on Georgia's breakaway regions, with Russian forces practicing a counterattack by land, sea, and air. The Georgian Foreign Ministry protested, claiming it was a threat of invasion. At the same time, a separate exercise called Immediate Response 2008 involved 1,000 U.S. troops, 600 Georgian troops, and forces from other countries to increase troop interoperability for NATO operations. Tensions escalated in South Ossetia in July 2008, with artillery attacks between Georgians and South Ossetians resulting in casualties. Calls for restraint and peace talks were issued by the EU, OSCE, and COE. Russian military planes flew over South Ossetia, claiming to deter a Georgian attack, which was denounced by the Georgian government. Tensions escalated in South Ossetia in July 2008, with artillery attacks between Georgians and South Ossetians resulting in casualties. Russian military planes flew over South Ossetia to deter a Georgian attack, leading to denouncement by the Georgian government. The U.N. Security Council discussed the overflights, with Georgian diplomats considering the session successful and Russian envoy criticizing the \"pro-Georgian bias.\" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Georgia to defuse tensions, calling for Russia to respect Georgia's independence and reaffirming the U.S.' commitment to Georgia's territorial integrity. On July 25, 2008, a bomb blast in Tskhinvali, South Ossetia, killed one person, leading to further artillery exchanges between Georgians and South Ossetians. The escalation resulted in serious fighting on August 2-4, with threats of attacks on Georgian cities and the evacuation of women and children to North Ossetia. South Ossetia accused Georgia of launching a \"massive\" artillery barrage against Tskhinvali on August 7, 2008. On August 7, 2008, Georgia reported intense bombing of Georgian villages in the conflict zone, leading to a unilateral ceasefire announcement by Saakashvili. Despite this, South Ossetian forces continued shelling Georgian villages, prompting Georgia to send ground forces into South Ossetia. Georgian troops soon controlled much of South Ossetia, including Tskhinvali. Russian President Medvedev denounced Georgia's incursion into South Ossetia at an emergency session of the Russian Security Council on August 8. Russian President Medvedev condemned Georgia's actions in South Ossetia, stating that Russia will not allow its citizens to be killed with impunity. He emphasized Russia's historical role as a guarantor of security in the Caucasus and launched air attacks in response to the Georgian incursion. Medvedev asserted that Russia will continue to play an active role in the region's security. Russian troops, supported by volunteer militiamen, engaged Georgian forces in South Ossetia on August 8. Russian warplanes destroyed Georgian airfields near Tbilisi. Georgian President Saakashvili declared a \"state of war\" and mobilized reservists. By August 10, Russian troops had taken control of Tskhinvali and most of South Ossetia, shelling areas across the border. Georgia requested US Secretary Rice to mediate with Russia, stating their armed forces had ceased fire. On August 11, Russia bombed apartment buildings in Gori, occupied the city, and continued aerial bombardments of Georgian villages. The U.N. Observer Mission in Georgia reported the movement of heavy weapons by the Abkhaz side towards the Kodori Valley. Russian military and Abkhaz militia forces moved into the Zugdidi district, southwest of Abkhazia, and bombs fell on the town on August 10. UNOMIG observers were withdrawn from the Kodori Valley due to safety concerns, as Abkhaz rebels threatened to push Georgian armed forces out. Russian peacekeepers allowed Abkhaz forces to deploy in the Gali region and along the Inguri River, violating their mandate by not stopping rebel weaponry deployments. Russian troops occupied Zugdidi on August 11, disarming Georgian police forces in Kodori Valley. Up to 6,000 troops were deployed by sea or air, with Russian ships preventing ships from entering or leaving the port at Poti. Igor Dygalo claimed Russian ships sunk a Georgian vessel off the coast of Georgia. Russian ships were preventing ships from entering or leaving the port at Poti. They also sank Georgia's coast guard vessels. Russian troops occupied a Georgian military base in Senaki on August 11. On August 12, Medvedev announced the conclusion of Russia's operation in Georgia to restore peace. President Medvedev announced the conclusion of Russia's operation in Georgia to restore peace. The aggressor has been punished and suffered heavy losses. Despite ordering a halt in operations, he instructed generals to continue \"mopping up\" actions, including ongoing bombing and occupation of villages. Medvedev met with French President Sarkozy, who presented a ceasefire plan on behalf of the EU. They agreed in principle to a six-point peace plan, calling for all parties to cease hostilities and pull troops back. The peace plan calls for a ceasefire, withdrawal of Russian combat troops from Georgia, allowing humanitarian aid, and facilitating the return of displaced persons. It excludes mention of Georgia's territorial integrity and allows Russian \"peacekeepers\" to remain in a larger security zone outside South Ossetia. International discussions on security and stability of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are also proposed. International peacekeepers will be deployed in South Ossetia, with Russian \"peacekeepers\" expected to stop patrolling outside the region once international monitors are in place. EU foreign ministers endorsed the peace plan, and EU monitors may participate. Medvedev met with the de facto presidents of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Moscow, where they signed a peace agreement. Secretary Rice visited Tbilisi, and Saakashvili also signed the agreement. A draft resolution based on the plan was submitted to the UNSC by France, but Russia blocked it, insisting only verbatim elements of the plan be included. The Russian military conducted \"mopping up\" operations in Georgia, degrading military assets and occupying buffer zones near Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russian General Staff claimed the peace plan allowed for establishing buffer and no-fly zones, similar to those in Nagorno Karabakh conflict. Reports of looting, infrastructure destruction, and detentions by Russian troops and paramilitary forces. Russian troops and paramilitary forces were looting, destroying infrastructure, detaining Georgians, and placing mines throughout the country. They burned a Georgian military base and occupied Senaki, making forays into the countryside. Russian forces in Poti prevented trade, pillaged, detained Georgian troops, destroyed a missile boat, and seized U.S. HUMVEEs. France raised concerns about a mountain warfare training base in Sachkere being threatened with destruction. Russian military forces threatened a mountain warfare training base in Western Georgia for NATO interoperability training. Russian troops reportedly left some areas but occupied others, arguing that Georgia's actions had negated past ceasefire regimes in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. On August 28, Nogovitsyn claimed that Russia had the right to deploy troops in Poti and adjacent areas to South Ossetia based on 1992 ceasefire accords. Russia's Federation Council and Duma recommended recognizing the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia on August 25. Medvedev announced on August 26 that Russia would recognize the regions' independence for humanitarian reasons and urged other countries to do the same. Nicaragua became the second country to extend diplomatic recognition to Abkhazia and South Ossetia on September 5. At a late August 2008 summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, China's disapproval of recognizing breakaway regions was evident. The Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization meeting in early September did not result in any members extending diplomatic recognition to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. On September 8, 2008, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Russian President Dmitriy Medvedev signed a follow-on ceasefire accord outlining the withdrawal of Russian forces from areas adjacent to the borders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by October 10. The ceasefire accord signed by French President Sarkozy and Russian President Medvedev outlined the withdrawal of Russian forces from the borders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by October 10. It also included agreements for Georgian forces to return to their barracks, international observers to remain and increase in number, and an international conference in Geneva to address security, stability, and resettlement in the region. Medvedev emphasized Russia's recognition of the regions as independent and the deployment of Russian \"peacekeepers\" in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. On August 26, 2008, Russia recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent regions, with French President Sarkozy praising the move. However, on September 9, the Russian defense minister announced that thousands of Russian troops would remain in both regions, sparking criticism from the US and Georgia. NATO Secretary General also criticized the EU for not pushing Russia to reduce its troop levels to pre-conflict numbers. Russia reduced its \"peacekeepers\" to pre-conflict levels, withdrawing troops from Poti and Senaki on September 13. The EU deployed unarmed monitors to patrol areas along Georgia's borders with South Ossetia and Abkhazia by October 1. Russian troops pulled back from occupied \"buffer zones\" by October 9, but supported Abkhazia and South Ossetia in territorial expansion efforts. The United States argues for Russian troop withdrawal from South Ossetia and Abkhazia as per the ceasefire plan. A conference in Geneva on the future of the regions includes delegations from Georgia, Russia, and the US, as well as Abkhaz and South Ossetian representatives. Russia's insistence on the regions participating as independent states complicates progress. EU, UN, and OSCE mediators are involved in the discussions. During the 3+3 talks in Geneva, OSCE mediators and emissaries from Georgia, Russia, and the United States met for formal and informal sessions. The Russian delegation was mostly absent from the morning session. Tensions arose in the afternoon session between the Georgians and emissaries from Abkhazia and South Ossetia, who demanded to be treated as sovereign country representatives and walked out. The U.S. expressed willingness to work with Russia on non-use of force pledges but questioned Russia's demand for a ban on offensive arms transfers to Georgia. During the Geneva sessions in November and December 2008, discussions involving emissaries showed little progress on main issues. However, at the February 17-18, 2009 session, an agreement was reached to establish an \"incident prevention and response mechanism\" to defuse tensions. Emissaries from the EU, OSCE, and U.N. will hold weekly meetings to investigate violent incidents and ensure humanitarian aid delivery. Assistant Secretary Fried praised the agreement as a positive step forward, but noted that implementation will depend on the goodwill of all sides. No progress was made on the issue of access to South Ossetia for humanitarian aid. The recent Russia-Georgia conflict resulted in hundreds of casualties, infrastructure damage, and displacement of tens of thousands of people in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The situation along the administrative lines remains dire, with ongoing attacks and violence hindering progress towards restoring security and peace in Georgia. The next meeting to address these issues may be held in late May or early June 2009. The conflict between Russia and Georgia has caused significant damage and displacement in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The destruction of military capabilities in Georgia has made it less eligible for NATO's Membership Action Plan. Russia's military campaign and unilateral recognition of the regions' independence have raised concerns about its reliability as a peaceful member of the international community. The conflict has also had a severe economic impact, costing hundreds of millions of dollars for Russia. The conflict between Russia and Georgia resulted in significant economic damage, including a weakening of investor confidence, liquidity contraction in the banking system, stress on public finances, and damage to physical infrastructure. The conflict caused an estimated $394.5 million in damages and reduced projected economic growth for 2008 from 9% to 3.5%. Commissioner of Human Rights of the COE, Thomas Hammerberg, found widespread destruction of ethnic Georgian villages and homes in South Ossetia, attributed to \"ethnic cleansing\" efforts by Ossetian and North Caucasian militias. In 2008, there was a growing debate among Georgian citizens about the conflict with signs of opposition forming new parties and alliances. Calls for President Saakashvili to resign and schedule early elections were made by opposition parties. President Medvedev's vow to \"punish\" Georgia and the subsequent end of the Russian offensive marked intentions beyond restoring control over South Ossetia. Russia's aims in ending their offensive against Georgia were accomplished, with possible reasons including coercing Georgia to accept Russian conditions on separatist regions, relinquish NATO aspirations, and depose Saakashvili. Russia may have also wanted to \"punish\" the West for various reasons, leading to dim prospects of improved Russia-Georgia relations. The decision to sever diplomatic relations between Russia and Georgia on August 29 led to ruptured bilateral trade and transport ties. The conflict highlighted Putin's dominant role in the Russian government, with him taking charge of military operations in North Ossetia. Putin and Medvedev escalated their anti-Western rhetoric following international criticism of Russia's actions in Georgia. Putin and Medvedev escalated their anti-Western rhetoric, strengthening the influence of the siloviki over foreign and defense policy. Russia risked international isolation by engaging in condemned behavior, with Putin downplaying the significance of Western sanctions. The EU, COE, and NATO retreated from considering extended sanctions against Russia. South Ossetia's \"president\" Kokoiti stated his region seeks independence. On September 17, 2008, Russia signed Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance agreements with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, allowing the regions to decide on the number of Russian troops they host. This renders arguments by the EU and the OSCE about Russian troop levels inoperable. South Ossetia and Abkhazia expressed desires for independence and ties with Russia, with potential unification in the future. The friendship agreements with Abkhazia and South Ossetia allow Russia to establish military bases, deploy border troops, and unify laws and systems with the regions. Russian troops were invited to establish bases despite the dissolution of the CIS \"peacekeeping\" mandate. In February 2009, Russia announced construction or revamping of facilities in South Ossetia and Abkhazia for troops deployment. NATO and the EU criticized the basing arrangements as destabilizing, warning of increased threats from smuggling and criminal activities to Georgia's stability. Russia's recognition of independence conferred legitimacy on corrupt ruling groups in the regions. Russia reshuffled regional officials in Georgia as a condition for economic assistance, hinting at criminal activities. Both Russia and Georgia blamed each other for initiating the conflict, with Georgian officials releasing cell phone intercepts to support their claim. Russian oppositionist alleged that North Caucasian \"volunteers\" prepared an attack in South Ossetia, with major troop movements through the Roki tunnel on August 7, 2008. In August 2008, major troop movements occurred through the Roki tunnel, leading to Georgian troops entering South Ossetia to try to stop the Russian advance. Conflicting accusations between Russia and Georgia led to PACE approving a resolution for an international investigation into the conflict causes. In December 2008, EU finance ministers approved the establishment of an international commission to address the conflict. In December 2008, the EU finance ministers approved the establishment of an international commission to investigate the conflict in Georgia. Former U.N. special representative Heidi Tagliavini from Switzerland was chosen as the commission head. The commission conducted interviews and research and is expected to release a report by July 2009. Georgia also formed a legislative commission to investigate the conflict causes, concluding that Georgia's military action in South Ossetia was in response to a plan by Russia. Estimates of casualties in the conflict between Georgia and Russia varied. Russian sources reported 162 civilians killed in South Ossetia, while Georgian sources reported 372 citizens dead. Russian military personnel casualties were reported as 64 killed and 283 wounded. Casualty figures from the conflict between Georgia and Russia in South Ossetia included 168 military servicemen, 188 civilians, and 16 policemen. \"Missing persons\" may lead to a revised death toll. Ethnic cleansing against Georgians was reported in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, displacing 127,000 people. About 68,000 displaced persons had returned home, while 34,000 needed temporary shelter and 30,000 needed long-term housing. In the aftermath of the conflict, about 30,000 people needed long-term housing as their homes were destroyed. The returnees required assistance to restore their livelihoods and repair property damage. Russia reported that most South Ossetians had returned home, with some still in temporary accommodation due to heavy damage. The Georgian government provided housing for displaced persons, rehabilitating thousands of damaged houses or apartments. The government rehabilitated thousands of damaged houses and constructed nearly 4,000 houses in new communities for displaced people. Concerns have been raised about the lack of social services in these communities and some displaced persons being forced to return to conflict areas. Georgia filed a case against Russia at the International Court of Justice for alleged crimes in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. President Medvedev also threatened to file a case about Georgia's \"genocide\" in South Ossetia.

The Georgian military used \"indiscriminate and disproportionate force resulting in civilian deaths in South Ossetia\" on August 7-8, while the Russian military used \"indiscriminate force\" in South Ossetia and the Gori area. Both Russia and Georgia were accused of using cluster bombs against civilians. HRW rejected Russia's claim of \"genocide\" in South Ossetia. HRW received a letter from the Georgian Defense Ministry admitting to the use of cluster bombs near the Roki tunnel. The Dutch government's report concluded that Russia had used cluster bombs in Gori. Russia encouraged South Ossetians to file cases alleging human rights abuses by Georgia. Georgians also filed cases against Russia. Many world leaders and organizations rushed to mediate the Georgia-Russia conflict, with governments criticizing both countries for their actions. The UN Security Council struggled to agree on a resolution due to Russia and China's refusal. Russia was accused of excessive force and recognizing the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, while Georgia was criticized for attempting to reintegrate South Ossetia by force. The focus was on implementing a ceasefire and providing urgent humanitarian relief. At the UNSC meeting on August 10, Russia and China rejected texts proposed by the US, France, and UK. US Representative Khalilzad criticized Russia for attacking Georgia and targeting civilians, warning of consequences for their actions.

EU President Sarkozy strongly condemned the recognition, while Italian Foreign Minister Frattini criticized the creation of ethnically-homogeneous enclaves but warned against isolating Russia. Most members at a UNSC meeting criticized Russia's non-compliance with the peace plan and recognition of the regions. Several countries, including the United States, Great Britain, France, and Spain, criticized Russia's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. U.S. Deputy Permanent Representative Alejandro Wolff condemned Russia's actions as incompatible with a UNSC resolution and raised concerns about further disregard for the U.N. Some observers called for sanctions against Russia, such as excluding them from the Group of Eight and reconsidering their hosting of the 2014 Winter Olympics. The West considered withdrawing support for Russia as the host of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and re-examining Russia's membership in the World Trade Organization. Analysts urged sanctions on Russia, but the desire for engagement on counter-terrorism and energy issues hindered harsh actions. The European Parliament approved a resolution postponing talks on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement until Russia withdrew troops from Georgia. The European Parliament strongly condemned Russia's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia's independence and called for an international investigation into the Russia-Georgia conflict. It criticized Russia's military actions in Georgia as unacceptable and disproportionate, emphasizing that there was no legitimate reason for Russia to invade and occupy parts of Georgia.

Observers criticize Russia's disproportionate response in Georgia, highlighting the ethnic cleansing and civilian targeting. They stress that NATO did not target civilians in Serbia, unlike Russian forces in Georgia. The international community debated Kosovo's status and supported regional self-rule. Some argued Georgia was provoked by Russia and South Ossetia, leading to military action. London's Independent urged the US to defend Georgia's sovereignty while cautioning against a bellicose approach towards separatist regions. Jane's publication also emphasized these points.
