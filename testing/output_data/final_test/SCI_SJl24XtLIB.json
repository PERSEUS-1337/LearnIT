    "content": "Computational neuroscience aims to develop models of neural activity and interpret them as abstract computations. Recent work has shown that functional diversity of neurons may be limited to a few cell types, and incorporating constraints into artificial neural networks can improve their ability to mimic neural data. An algorithm has been developed to cluster neurons by cell type and create models of neural activity constrained by these clusters, resulting in more predictive and interpretable models. This research informs the design of future artificial neural networks by revealing the contributions of functional cell types to neural computation. The complexity of the brain poses obstacles to understanding its intelligent behavior. Computational models constrained by biological factors have shown promise in replicating neural activity. Studies have linked artificial neural networks trained with constraints to reproduce brain activity, strengthening the connection between AI and neuroscience. The Allen Institute for Brain Science has identified cell types using transcriptomic, morphological, and electrophyisiological features. They aim to connect cell diversity to neural activity models, fitting them with constraints to replicate brain behavior. The Allen Institute for Brain Science has identified cell types to constrain single-cell activity models. Using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM), they model single-cell spiking activity in response to stimuli, with stimulus and self-interaction filters for each cell. The hypothesis is that the self-interaction filter is related to the cell's functional type, while other parameters are cell-specific. This approach guides algorithm development for neural activity datasets. The neural activity dataset model consists of two stages: a Generative Model (GMM) with cell-specific parameters and a spiking response generation stage. An Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to estimate latent variables for each neuron's activity and global parameters. Variational Inference is employed for continuous random variables. The neural activity dataset model utilizes Variational Inference to estimate latent variables for each neuron's activity. This involves approximating the distribution with a multivariate Gaussian and using importance sampling to fit the parameters. The method compares favorably to fitting a GMM to individual GLM parameters, discovering classes with higher accuracy to true labels. The Maximization step involves finding parameters that minimize the KL divergence. The Maximization step involves finding parameters that minimize the KL divergence between the approximated distribution over W and the mixture model. Algorithm 1 is applied to the IVSCC dataset to model the spiking response of isolated neurons to a pink noise stimulus. The algorithm accurately recovers the true parameters of a generative model from simulated data using GLMs with parameters sampled from a GMM. The Adjusted Rand Score is used to measure clustering accuracy in GMMs, with results reported using an Overlap Score. Cluster centers of self-interaction filters are fitted to data, and validation ANLL is compared between GMM-GLM and independent GLMs. The model's performance is evaluated on spiking data from 290 cells in the IVSCC dataset without ground truth for cell types. The IVSCC dataset lacks ground truth for cell types, so model performance is assessed by comparing ANLL of held out data to GLMs. Limited morphological, locational, and transcriptomic information is available for each cell, and comparisons are made to discover relationships between electrophysiological cell types and other cell partitions based on metadata. These metadata do not validate cell types but provide dimensions for clustering neurons. The results show that cells with spiny dendrites, in cortical layer 1, or expressing certain Cre lines were assigned to clusters more often than by chance. The algorithm's performance was compared to previous studies, showing comparable results. Future work will involve model selection and testing the algorithm's robustness to noise in in vivo neural recordings. When applying the algorithm to in vivo data, additional constraints from the brain and metadata can be utilized. The algorithm calculates the empirical probability of a cell with a specific attribute being in a cluster. Neural Network models generated by this algorithm can contribute to theoretical literature on biological and artificial networks. Theoretical techniques can help interpret the functional cell type network models produced by the algorithm in terms of abstract network operations."
