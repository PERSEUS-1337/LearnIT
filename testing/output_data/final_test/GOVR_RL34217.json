    "content": "According to the 2011 Medicare Trustees report, total Medicare expenditures were $523 billion in 2010 for 47.5 million beneficiaries. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the Actuary projected overall Medicare spending to reach $557.4 billion in 2011 due to factors like advances in healthcare, an aging population, and rising medical costs. Efforts to preserve Medicare's program integrity have increased, with CMS contracting private entities for program integrity activities including provider audits and reviewing claims for medical necessity. Efforts to preserve Medicare's program integrity have increased through provider audits, reviewing claims for medical necessity, and identifying fraud. Contractors refer suspected fraud cases to MACs for recovery and further investigation by HHS/OIG and DOJ. HIPAA established the HCFAC Account to combat healthcare fraud. The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account (HCFAC Account) is funded by transfers from the Medicare Trust Funds, certified jointly by the Secretary of HHS and the Attorney General. HIPAA also established the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) with mandatory annual appropriations from the Trust Funds. HHS/OIG and the Attorney General submit annual reports on HCFAC activities to Congress, while GAO reports on HCFAC-funded activities biennially. In FY2010 and FY2011, the HCFAC Account received approximately $1.17 billion and $1.4 billion in mandatory appropriations. Congress also approved additional discretionary investments of $198 million for FY2009, $311 million for FY2010, and $311 million for FY2011 to enhance Medicare's program integrity efforts. This report provides an overview of Medicare program integrity activities, including combating health care fraud, roles of private contractors and law enforcement agencies, federal anti-fraud funding, and recent program integrity initiatives. Medicare is the primary health insurance program for individuals aged 65 and older. Medicare is the nation's health insurance program for individuals aged 65 and older and certain disabled individuals. It consists of Parts A, B, C, and D, covering hospital services, medical services, Medicare Advantage plans, and prescription drugs. Many beneficiaries choose Medicare Advantage \u2013 Prescription Drug plans. Approximately 25% of Medicare beneficiaries choose MA-PD plans for combined Parts C and D coverage. CMS oversees all aspects of Medicare, including Parts A, B, C, and D, through contracts with private organizations. Funding for Medicare administration comes from a discretionary budget request for program management. CMS oversees all aspects of Medicare, including Parts A, B, C, and D, through contracts with private organizations. Funding for Medicare administration comes from a discretionary budget request for program management, which includes activities such as paying claims processing contractors, quality reporting, health plan oversight, and information technology infrastructure. Program management funds are transferred from the Medicare Trust Funds. Program integrity activities are separate and focus on preventing fraud and abuse. In April 2010, CMS consolidated program integrity activities under the Center for Program Integrity (CPI) to better integrate and strengthen oversight. CPI's mission is to protect Trust Funds from fraud and improper payments in the healthcare system. It focuses on four program areas to achieve this goal. CPI has classified program integrity efforts into prevention, detection, and recovery areas. Prevention activities include payment system operation, medical review, and education. Detection efforts involve analytical pilots to detect improper payment trends. Recovery focuses on analyzing complaints and tips to target potential fraud schemes. CPI plans to collaborate with program integrity partners to increase overpayment recoveries through various tools and measures. This includes restitution, fines, penalties, damages, program suspensions, and exclusions. Additionally, CPI aims to develop performance measures for better tracking and reporting of program integrity information. The outreach effort by public and private partners aimed to raise awareness of CMS's program integrity activities through national and local summits. Rising healthcare costs and the need for proper stewardship of public resources have fueled interest in controlling Medicare costs, with a focus on reducing fraud and abuse as a way to restrain growth. Several new laws have been enacted to improve Medicare program integrity activities and combat fraud and abuse, which can contribute to rising healthcare costs and harm patients. Estimates suggest that between 3% and 10% of health care expenditures are lost annually to fraud, with Medicare's FY2010 improper payment error rate at 10.5% accounting for $34.3 billion in overpayments. Fraud and abuse in Medicare involve withholding necessary services or providing medically unnecessary services. Abuse refers to practices that increase costs or result in improper payments, while fraud is intentional deception for unauthorized benefits. Health care fraud is often associated with financial misconduct but can also involve delivering poor quality care. Health care fraud involves various types of schemes that target public health insurance programs and private health plans. Perpetrators often pay kickbacks to providers and beneficiaries to submit fraudulent claims to Medicare. Fraudulent activities include billing for unnecessary services. Recent fraudulent activity in health care includes billing for unnecessary services or tests, submitting claims for services by unlicensed providers, and illegally marketing drugs for higher reimbursements. Organized crime involvement in health care fraud was highlighted in recent investigations, with low penalties and barriers making it an attractive target. Medicare's FFS program faces different types of fraud compared to Parts C and D plans, largely due to payment differences. Medicare's FFS program faces fraudulent activities such as overbilling, upcoding, and receiving kickbacks. Providers may overstate services or provide unnecessary care to increase reimbursement. Examples include billing for services not provided, altering claim forms for higher payments, and soliciting kickbacks for patient referrals. Medicare Parts C and D involve capitated payments to private health plans and prescription drug plans, where providers receive a fixed monthly amount per enrollee for a set of benefits. This payment model incentivizes providers to limit services or provide fewer services to maximize profit. Medicare Parts C and D involve capitated payments to private health plans and prescription drug plans, incentivizing providers to limit services to maximize profit. Fraudulent activities in Parts C and D include engaging in deceptive marketing practices, selectively enrolling healthy beneficiaries, failing to provide necessary services, and manipulating bid amounts for payment. Program integrity efforts historically focused on combating fraud in Parts A and B, but with the increase in private plan enrollment, there is a need to address fraud in capitated plans. In Medicare, program integrity activities aim to reduce abuse and prevent fraud since 1990. The Government Accountability Office has identified Medicare as high risk for fraud and abuse. CMS contracts with private companies to review claims for medically necessary services to protect the Medicare Trust Funds. In Medicare, improper payments are identified through claim review strategies and result from provider billing mistakes. CMS conducts benefit integrity activities to prevent fraud, including claims data analysis, fraud investigations, provider audits, and referrals to law enforcement for prosecution. The Medicare program's size and complexity make it vulnerable to fraud and abuse. Suspected cases are referred to law enforcement for prosecution, and fraud cases may be investigated by HHS/OIG and referred to DOJ. Medicare's payment systems, while ensuring prompt payment to providers, also create opportunities for exploitation, leading to a \"pay-and-chase\" approach to recoup improper payments. Medicare must pay most claims within 30 days, leaving little time for review to ensure accuracy. Medicare law requires timely payment of clean claims and review of a small percentage of claims before payment. The Medicare program faces challenges with processing claims quickly, leading to a pay and chase dynamic where fraudulent providers can exploit the system. Emphasis is shifting towards a more proactive approach to prevent improper payments. The program integrity emphasis is moving towards preventing overpayments by implementing various activities such as provider auditing, medical review, benefit integrity, Medicare secondary payer, provider outreach and education, and a Medicare-Medicaid Data Match Project. CMS's Medicare Integrity Program has expanded to include preventive methods and collaboration with the Health Care Fraud Prevention & Enforcement Action Team to identify and prosecute suspicious activity. Medicare providers submit annual cost reports to CMS for payment settlement. Reports are analyzed for accuracy, with on-site audits conducted if anomalies are found to ensure compliance with reimbursement policies. Under Medicare Part C, CMS contracts with Medicare Advantage plans for managed care. CMS audits these plans to verify payment accuracy to beneficiaries. A GAO report found CMS did not document audits for years 2001-2005. CMS plans to evaluate provider audit performance based on Medicare recoveries. Medical review activities aim to prevent payment errors and billing mistakes. Medical review activities ensure payment accuracy and adherence to care standards. Medicare contractors use automated edits for claims review, followed by manual reviews or additional documentation requests for billing errors. Benefit integrity includes fraud identification and referral to law enforcement through Program Safeguard Contractors and Zone Program Integrity Contractors. Benefit integrity activities involve national and regional data analysis, medical documentation review, fraud investigation, and education on fraud detection and prevention. PSCs and ZPICs refer suspected fraud cases to OIG or law enforcement for further action. Medicare secondary payer activities ensure payment accuracy by only paying for services where it has primary payment responsibility. Medicare is the secondary payer to employer-based insurance plans, auto liability insurance, and workers compensation insurance. CMS maintains a database of Medicare beneficiaries' health insurance information for MSP investigations. Provider outreach aims to reduce billing errors and keep providers informed of Medicare billing and coding changes through education and outreach activities conducted by Medicare FFS contractors. CMS conducts outreach and educational activities to inform providers about national and local policies, new Medicare initiatives, and significant program changes. When billing irregularities are found, CMS contractors work directly with providers to correct mistakes. The Medicare-Medicaid Data Match Program, initiated in 2001, helps identify overpayments and fraud affecting both programs by analyzing comparative Medicare and Medicaid data for atypical billing patterns. CMS coordinates with states and providers to recover federal overpayments. The Medi-Medi pilot, funded by CMS and the FBI, started in California in 2001 and expanded to 8 other states. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 mandated the nationwide expansion of the program with dedicated funding. By FY2008, CMS had projects in 10 states, identifying over $27 million in overpayments and referring 30 cases to law enforcement. The HHS/OIG plans to report on the Medi-Medi program in the future, which was funded for national expansion in 2006 but only 14 states have agreed to participate. CMS contracts with various contractors for Medicare program integrity activities, including Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), Program Safeguard Contractors (PSCs), Zone Program Integrity Contractors (ZPICs), Medicare Drug Integrity Contractors (MEDICs), Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs), and others. The Medicare program integrity involves various contractors such as Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) who process and pay claims, conduct program integrity functions, and replace fiscal intermediaries and carriers as mandated by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. The Medicare program integrity involves various contractors like Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) who handle claims, conduct program integrity functions, and replace fiscal intermediaries and carriers. CMS established a goal to award contracts to 19 MACs for processing claims for Parts A and B providers and DME providers. By March 2011, all DME MACs and nine A/B MACs were fully implemented, with some jurisdictions still in the process of implementation. The Medicare program is transitioning from Program Safeguard Contractors (PSCs) to zone program integrity contractors (ZPICs) for benefit integrity activities. ZPICs will handle Medicare Parts A, B, C, and D claims under a single contract for each geographic area, unlike the previous separate contracts for different claim types. ZPICs and PSCs analyze data, conduct provider audits, investigate fraud, and take administrative actions to recover funds. The transition from Program Safeguard Contractors (PSCs) to zone program integrity contractors (ZPICs) for Medicare benefit integrity activities is ongoing. ZPICs refer cases to HHS/OIG or DOJ for prosecution, implement actions to recover improper payments, and do not collect overpayments but refer them to claims processors. CMS plans to have one ZPIC serve each zone, with five zones covering states with high fraud activity levels. As of January 2010, contracts for 4 ZPIC zones were awarded, with two zones fully operational in Florida and Texas. The transition from PSCs to ZPICs is ongoing, with questions about fraud detection emphasis and performance improvement. More transparency is needed in reporting PSC/ZPIC results and CMS evaluation. HHS/OIG found discrepancies in overpayment referrals by PSCs, with physicians and DMEPOS suppliers accounting for 80% of overpayments. Suppliers accounted for 80% of overpayments, with Part B claims representing 29% of PSCs oversight responsibilities but contributing to nearly 90% of overpayments referred for collection. Medicare contracts with MEDICs for program integrity activities in the Medicare prescription drug benefit program, including fraud and abuse reviews for Medicare Part C. MEDICs perform functions similar to ZPICs for Medicare Parts A and B, including data analysis, investigation, development of fraud cases, and audit of Medicare Part D plans' compliance programs. The HHS/OIG found vulnerabilities in CMS's efforts to identify Part D fraud and abuse, with 25% of Part D sponsors not reporting any instances. CMS relied on beneficiary complaints rather than data analysis to identify cases. MEDICs also relied on external sources, facing administrative barriers hindering proactive monitoring methods. CMS requested $166 million for additional fraud and abuse monitoring. CMS requested $166 million in additional funding in the FY2012 budget to enhance MEDIC data analysis, trending, and benchmarking for Parts C and D, increase on-site audits of contractors, and improve coordination with fraud and abuse contractors. Transparent access to performance data could help refine measures like return on investment. Congress authorized a three-year demonstration program in 2003 to test RACs for identifying improper payments in Medicare. The RAC program in Medicare was expanded nationwide and made permanent by 2010. Four national RAC contracts were awarded in 2009 to companies like Diversified Collection Services and CGI Technologies. Each RAC is responsible for identifying and correcting improper payments in a specific region of the country. The nationwide RAC implementation was completed in October 2009. CMS released updated RAC FFS statistics for the demonstration and National Program, showing total corrections of $365.8 million in FY2010-FY2011. RACs were authorized to extend audits to Medicare Parts C and D by December 31, 2010. While not responsible for identifying fraud, RACs must refer potential cases to CMS for investigation. In 2005-2008, RACs referred only two potential fraud cases to CMS. CMS is implementing a system to track fraud referrals and require RACs to receive mandatory fraud identification training. The CERT contractor calculates improper payment rates for CMS's FFS program. The Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) requires federal agencies to estimate and report annual improper payments. The contractor calculates three types of improper payment rates: contractor-specific, provider-specific, and national rates. These rates are used to assess MAC performance and provider compliance with billing and coding requirements. In FY2009, CMS reported a national Medicare FFS error rate of 7.8% or $24.1 billion in improper payments, which was later revised to 12.4% or $35.4 billion. The FY2010 national improper payment rate was 10.5%, amounting to $34.3 billion in improperly paid claims for FFS Medicare. The Medicare Advantage (MA) CY2009 improper payment error rate was 15.4% or $12.0 billion, mainly due to health plan errors in documenting beneficiary diagnoses. Medicare Part D had various improper payment error rate components, ranging from 12.7% to .1%. The National Supplier Clearinghouse (NSC) reviews enrollment applications from DMEPOS suppliers to Medicare beneficiaries, ensuring they meet required standards and have necessary licenses. NSC coordinates fraud and abuse efforts with CMS. The National Supplier Clearinghouse (NSC) reviews DMEPOS suppliers' enrollment applications for Medicare, conducts mandatory site visits for initial and re-enrollment, and coordinates fraud and abuse efforts with CMS. In a 2007 report, HHS/OIG found that 45% of suppliers were out of compliance with participation standards in high fraud areas. NSC may also conduct random site visits if non-compliance is suspected. The HHS/OIG recommended that CMS strengthen the DMEPOS enrollment process by conducting more unannounced site visits. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act added additional screening requirements for DMEPOS providers in 2011. The HHS/OIG will monitor CMS's implementation of these safeguards, including temporary supplier enrollment moratoriums. The coordination of benefits contractor identifies payments that are the responsibility of another payer, with Medicare being the secondary payer. The Medicare Coordination of Benefits (COB) program is responsible for managing and reporting other health insurance coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. The COB contractor handles all program integrity functions related to Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) claims investigations. CMS shares responsibility for Medicare program integrity with HHS/OIG, DOJ, and FBI. HHS/OIG focuses on detecting healthcare fraud and abuse in federal programs, with a focus on Medicare and Medicaid. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) conducts audits and investigations related to health care fraud and abuse. CMS contractors refer potential fraud cases to the HHS/OIG for further investigation and sanctions. The HHS/OIG can impose penalties and exclusions on providers convicted of fraudulent activities, while the DOJ handles criminal prosecutions. In FY2010, the OIG excluded 3,340 individuals and entities from federal health care programs. The FBI leads investigations into health care fraud. The FBI is the primary agency investigating health care fraud, with jurisdiction over federal and private insurance programs. They focus on complex fraud schemes involving large medical providers. While they cannot impose sanctions, their investigations have led to numerous convictions. Cases of potential fraud are referred to the DOJ for prosecution by CMS contractors, HHS/OIG, and the FBI. The DOJ's Civil and Criminal Divisions handle health care fraud cases, utilizing tools like the False Claims Act to prosecute those submitting false claims to the government. The False Claims Act allows private plaintiffs to bring lawsuits for fraudulent claims to the U.S. government. U.S. Attorneys Offices nationwide prosecute health care fraud cases, with a significant increase in investigations from FY2009 to FY2010. Medicare beneficiaries can report fraud to the HHS/OIG's National Fraud Hotline, and the Administration on Aging oversees Senior Medicare Patrol Projects to educate beneficiaries on detecting and reporting fraud. The Medicare program integrity and anti-fraud activities are funded through the HCFAC and MIP programs established by HIPAA. HCFAC funds enforcement and prosecution of health care fraud, while MIP funding supports program integrity activities by CMS contractors. Prior to HIPAA, funding for Medicare's program integrity activities came from CMS's annual program management budget, leading to fluctuations in funding. The HCFAC program, established by HIPAA, provides stable funding for Medicare anti-fraud activities. It is jointly administered by the Secretary and the Attorney General, aiming to coordinate law enforcement efforts, conduct investigations, facilitate enforcement of penalties, establish safe harbors, and support reporting against healthcare providers. Funding for the program is sourced from the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. To fund anti-fraud activities, HIPAA established the HCFAC Account within the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Money collected from investigations is deposited into the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. The Secretary is authorized to establish the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) to conduct various program integrity activities. HCFAC and MIP appropriations are shown in Table 2 for selected fiscal years. Congress approved HCFAC discretionary funding in 2009. In 2009, Congress approved $198 million in discretionary funding for the HCFAC program, with funds transferred from the HI Trust Fund. Subsequent years saw increases in funding, with $311 million allocated in FY2010 and a proposed $581 million for FY2012. Total HCFAC funding for FY2012, including mandatory and discretionary funds, would reach $1.9 billion. The Obama Administration estimated that additional discretionary program integrity investment in the FY2011 budget would save $10 billion over 10 years. The President's FY2012 budget request allocated funds for Medicare anti-fraud activities, program integrity activities, DOJ, and HHS/OIG. Approximately 50% of the funds for Medicare were for oversight activities in MA and Part D programs, with the rest for enforcement, program oversight, specific proposals for fraudulent providers, and regional fraud hotlines. In FY2010, Congress allocated $3.5 billion for Medicare program management, including processing claims, staff salaries, facility inspections, and research. Funds were directed towards anti-fraud efforts, with specific allocations for fraudulent providers, fraud hotlines, supplier site visits, data analysis, and provider oversight. Additional discretionary funds are appropriated annually for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP administration and oversight. Performance statistics and reports are available to evaluate Medicare's program integrity efforts, focusing on measures like return on investment. Studies have examined the HCFAC and MIP programs separately, with broad requirements for program integrity activities. Under HIPAA, annual reports to Congress identify appropriated and recovered amounts, including transfers to Medicare trust funds from fines, penalties, forfeitures, and damages. GAO issues biennial reports on HCFAC appropriations for fraud control efforts and trust fund savings. The HCFAC Account and MIP activities have been evaluated separately, with a lack of comprehensive data on MIP performance compared to HCFAC appropriations. Improper payments stem from three main root causes, as identified in past reviews and studies. Improper payments in Medicare can occur due to documentation and administration errors, authentication and medical necessity errors, and verification errors. These errors result from a lack of supporting documentation, inability to confirm provider criteria for payment, and failure to verify current and accurate information. CMS assesses MIP program performance by measuring the percentage of improper payments made to providers each year. Medicare reported a FY2010 improper payment rate of 10.5% or $34.3 billion, compared to 12.4% in FY2009. The difference is attributed to clinical care provided in inpatient settings that should have been outpatient. The increase in error rate from FY2008 to FY2009 was due to stricter claims review standards. The improper payment rate does not measure Medicare FFS fraud. The Medicare FFS improper payment rate does not measure fraud and abuse but is mainly an administrative error measure. The main types of payment errors include incorrect coding, claims for unnecessary services, and lack of documentation. Despite not meeting reduction targets since FY2008, CMS aimed to reduce the error rate by 50% between FY2009 and FY2012. GAO and HHS/OIG have questioned the accuracy of CMS's calculations, with GAO attributing a reduction in error rate to provider education on documentation. The GAO and HHS/OIG have raised concerns about CMS's payment error reduction efforts. HHS/OIG recommended using error rate data to identify error-prone providers and implement corrective action plans. CMS implements corrective action plans, monitors provider-specific plans, and shares error rate data with program integrity contractors to identify improper payments and reduce mistakes. The Medicare Advantage improper payment rate was 15.4% in 2009, amounting to $12.0 billion. HHS's FY2010 report highlighted health plan errors in documenting beneficiaries' diagnoses as a primary factor. The errors in Medicare Part D payments are caused by data transfer issues and payment calculation errors in the MARx system. These errors include Payment Error relating to Low-Income Subsidy status (PELS), Payment Error related to Incorrect Medicaid Status (PEMS), and Payment Error Related to Prescription Drug Event Data Validation (PEPV). The estimated error rates and improper payments associated with these components are summarized in Table 5. Additionally, HIPAA mandated HHS and the DOJ to issue an annual report to Congress on HCFAC results and accomplishments, which includes examples of enforcement actions. The annual reports to Congress on HCFAC results and accomplishments describe enforcement actions, recoveries, and amounts deposited into the HI Trust Fund due to health care fraud activities. However, these reports do not cover all fraud activities or specify funding for Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal health care programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 made discretionary funding contingent on including measures in the HCFAC report. The annual HCFAC report to Congress includes measures of operational efficiency and impact on fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs. Fraud recoveries and transfers to the HI Trust Fund from 1998 to 2010 show a lag between identification of fraud and recovery due to lengthy litigation processes. The federal government won approximately $2.5 billion in judgments and settlements. Between FYs 1998-2010, the federal government recovered approximately $17.01 billion in fraud judgments and settlements, returning nearly $2.9 billion to the HI Trust Fund. Recoveries fluctuated annually, with a peak of $2.2 billion in FY2006 and a low of $0.5 billion in 1999. Between FYs 1998-2010, fraud judgments and settlements totaled $17.01 billion, with recoveries fluctuating annually. In 2006, a significant increase was attributed to a settlement with Tenet Healthcare Corporation, returning over $900 million for unlawful billing. Trust Fund transfers also varied, reaching $1.94 billion in FY2008 after steady increases from 1998 to 2006. In FY2008, HCFAC expenditures increased to $1.94 billion, followed by rapid increases in FY2009 ($2.51 billion) and FY2010 ($2.86 billion). Federal health care fraud enforcement activities have returned over $18 billion to the Medicare Trust Funds since 1997, with a return-on-investment (ROI) of $4.90 for every $1.00 expended. The three-year average ROI (2008-2010) is $6.80 recovered for every $1.00 spent, which is $1.90 higher than the historical average. Total HCFAC expenditures remained relatively constant from FY1998 to FY2010, increasing slowly from $119.6 million to $577.4 million. In FY2009, Congress appropriated $198 million in additional discretionary funding to the HCFAC program, almost doubling HCFAC funding. The majority of these funds were allocated to CMS, with approximately 10% each going to the DOJ and HHS/OIG. In FY2010, the distribution of additional funds remained the same, with CMS receiving approximately 80% and DOJ and HHS/OIG receiving approximately 10% each. The number of enforcement actions, including new criminal and civil health care fraud investigations, has increased over the past 10 years. There is a debate on whether the rise in enforcement actions is due to more resources to fight illegal behavior rather than an actual increase in fraud. The definition of health care fraud has expanded over the years, making it seem like fraud has increased when it has remained steady. GAO reports on HCFAC activities do not include MIP in their analysis. The GAO found that HHS and DOJ's accounting for HCFAC deposits and expenditures was accurate, despite some weaknesses in measuring cost savings from health care fraud enforcement efforts. Recent reports have raised concerns about the use of HCFAC and MIP funding, with a 2005 report showing that CMS could not demonstrate how its share of HCFAC expenditures was used for health care investigations. The GAO found that funds for health care fraud at the FBI were shifted to counterterrorism activities. GAO identified weaknesses in CMS's allocation of MIP funds, recommending a more effective method considering activity effectiveness and contractor performance. HHS/OIG audits and investigates HHS programs annually. The HHS/OIG audits and evaluates HHS programs annually, providing recommendations to improve program management. Priority recommendations for strengthening Medicare program integrity include eliminating vulnerabilities to fraudulent claims, ensuring supplier compliance with enrollment standards, reducing rental periods for home oxygen equipment, ensuring accuracy of prescription drug plan bids, implementing fraud prevention safeguards, and ensuring plan validity. In FY2011, HHS/OIG plans to conduct nearly 175 Medicare studies and audits, focusing on Medicare Parts A and B. A report revealed challenges in documentation safeguards for federal health care programs, with $1.2 billion paid for claims with invalid prescriber identification numbers in Medicare Part D. This raised concerns about the validity of prescriptions and physician licensing in the Medicare program. Both Congress and the Administration have taken steps to increase Medicare program integrity, including holding hearings, passing laws with new tools, and issuing executive orders. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provided CMS with additional program integrity tools. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) (P.L. 111-152) provided CMS with enhanced program integrity tools, including improved provider screening, pre-payment claims review, and expanded RAC program to Medicare Parts C and D. PPACA also mandated better data sharing between program integrity entities for monitoring and assessing risks. PPACA increased appropriations for HCFAC by $350 million over FY2011-FY2020, with funding from Medicare Part A Trust Fund and additional appropriations from other acts. Section 4241 of the Small Business and Jobs Act of 2010 also allocated $100 million for predictive analytics technologies. Predictive analytics technologies, funded by PPACA and the Small Business and Jobs Act of 2010, are used in healthcare to detect fraudulent billing by analyzing data from various sources. This helps CMS determine the legitimacy of claims before payment, reducing the need for post-payment reviews. The Small Business and Jobs Act of 2010 funded predictive analytics technologies for healthcare fraud detection. CMS was required to award contracts for predictive modeling by April 2011, with some delays. Legislation addressing the federal debt limit was proposed in July 2011, leading to the Budget Control Act of 2011 being passed by the House and Senate, and signed into law in August 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) was signed into law by the President on August 2, 2011. It aimed to reduce federal deficits by $917 billion over FY2012-FY2021, with total reduced spending estimated at $2.1 trillion. BCA capped federal discretionary appropriations but exempted certain programs like Medicare program integrity. It authorized increased appropriations for Medicare program integrity activities funded through the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) account. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) set maximum discretionary annual program integrity appropriations for HCFAC activities in addition to current funding. Executive Order 13520 directed federal agencies, including CMS, to reduce improper payments rates and report on payment accuracy. The Obama Administration emphasized program integrity by directing government managers to use recapture auditors to reduce improper payments. They also established a Do Not Pay List to prevent payments to ineligible entities. The proposed FY2012 budget includes legislative proposals to strengthen Medicare. The proposed FY2012 budget includes new legislative proposals to strengthen Medicare's program integrity activities, aiming to reduce expenditures by $8.6 billion over 10 years. Initiatives include recovering erroneous payments from Medicare Advantage insurers, reporting sweep accounts, and imposing penalties for outdated enrollment records. The CMS plans to impose penalties for outdated enrollment records and explore using Universal Product Numbers on Medicare reimbursement claims for fraud detection. They also aim to create a Medicare claims ordering system for high-risk services and review power wheelchair claims for fraud prevention. Additionally, the Secretary may exclude providers affiliated with sanctioned entities and implement predictive analytics for program integrity. The Secretary may have more discretion in implementing predictive analytics technologies to ensure cost-effective tools are used appropriately. Limiting providers/suppliers ability to discharge health care fraud debts in bankruptcy proceedings and strengthening penalties for illegal distribution of beneficiary identification numbers are proposed. Program integrity activities aim to prevent improper payments, detect fraud, investigate suspects, recover overpayments, and prosecute offenders. CMS contracts with private entities to carry out these activities. The implementation of HCFAC and MIP in 1996 provided CMS and Medicare enforcement agencies with dedicated funding to coordinate health care fraud-fighting activities. Program integrity and anti-fraud resources increased significantly from 1999 through 2010, leading to a quadrupling of civil and criminal fraud enforcement actions. Health care fraud enforcement activities have also resulted in increased recoveries transferred to the Medicare Trust Funds. GAO reports have raised concerns about the use of MIP funding and recommended that CMS develop more quantitative measures. The implementation of HCFAC and MIP in 1996 provided CMS and Medicare enforcement agencies with dedicated funding to coordinate health care fraud-fighting activities. GAO reports have raised questions about how MIP funding is used and recommended more quantitative measures to assess the impact of MIP-funded program integrity activities. Protecting Medicare from fraud is challenging due to the lack of reliable estimates on the amount lost to fraud, leading to difficulties in resource allocation. To combat Medicare fraud, CMS and its partners need to utilize a mix of preventive and investigative program integrity methods, including increasing pre-payment claim reviews and applying stricter standards for provider reviews. To combat Medicare fraud, CMS is increasing pre-payment claim reviews, applying stricter standards for provider enrollment, and conducting background checks on providers before allowing them to bill the program."
