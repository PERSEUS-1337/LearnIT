    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress acknowledges Reverend Joseph Armstrong DeLaine's significant role in the civil rights movement, particularly in desegregating public schools in the United States. In 1949, Reverend DeLaine organized African-American parents in South Carolina to petition for a bus for black students who had to walk long distances to attend segregated schools. This eventually led to the Briggs et al. v. Elliott et al. case, which was instrumental in ending public school segregation. Reverend DeLaine faced domestic terror due to his involvement in the desegregation movement, leading to job loss, threats, and property damage. After relocating to South Carolina, he was charged with assault for defending his home. He later moved to Buffalo, New York, where he established an African Methodist Episcopal Church. Reverend DeLaine faced adversity in the desegregation movement, leading to job loss and threats. He was charged with assault in South Carolina but later cleared of all charges in 2000. Reverend DeLaine advocated for equal education for all, regardless of skin color, leaving a lasting civil rights legacy. Levi Pearson, along with Reverend Joseph DeLaine, filed a lawsuit against the Clarendon County School District to protest the unequal treatment of black children. Despite facing domestic terror and economic consequences, his case was dismissed on a technicality, but his courage in fighting for equal education left a lasting impact. Levi Pearson's courage to fight for equalized treatment and funding for black students led to further desegregation efforts in South Carolina. He became President of the NAACP chapter in Clarendon County. Harry and Eliza Briggs also fought for desegregated schools, facing consequences such as losing their jobs and moving to Florida. Harry and Eliza Briggs were pioneers in desegregating America's public schools, despite facing consequences such as losing their jobs and moving their family to Florida. The Briggs were pioneers in desegregating public schools, facing consequences like job loss and relocation to Florida. Congressional Gold Medal.

DeLaine, Harry and Eliza Briggs, and Levi Pearson by the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. The Secretary of the Treasury will strike 3 gold medals for this purpose.
