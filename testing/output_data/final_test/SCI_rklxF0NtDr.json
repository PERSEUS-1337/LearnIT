    "content": "The Policy Message Passing algorithm enhances graph-structured neural networks by using stochastic sequential processes for information aggregation. It outperforms existing models on complex reasoning and prediction tasks, offering robustness to noisy edges and a larger search space. Sequential inference algorithms, like dynamic programming, have been crucial for tasks involving partial information and large search spaces. In the modern deep learning era, sequential memory architectures like recurrent neural networks are used for sequential inference, narrowing down the search space. Neural-based iterative correction is developed for posterior approximation in amortized inference. Reinforcement learning is utilized for sequential inference in environments with partial observation and world dynamics. Graph-structured models rely heavily on local observations and sequential inference through nodes and message functions. Learning graph-structured models involves maximizing likelihood by transforming node information through communication operations. Message functions and inference processes play key roles, with various potential functions used in different cases. Deep graph neural networks generalize message functions to neural networks. In modern deep graph-structured models, inference procedures are mainly developed under the context of probabilistic graphical models. Various function types have been developed, such as graph convolution operations, attention-based functions, and gated functions. However, powerful inference processes in deep graph-structured models are still limited, with most models following fixed hand-crafted rules. This paper proposes representing the inference process with a neural network. The paper proposes representing the inference process in deep graph-structured models with a neural network. The neural network P \u03c6 represents the distribution over all possible inference trajectories in the graph model, introducing properties like distribution nature, consistent inference, and uncertainty. The primary contributions of the paper are outlined. The paper introduces a new perspective on message passing for stochastic inference in graph-structured models. It proposes a variational inference framework for learning inference models and shows that a powerful inference machine can improve predictions, especially on challenging tasks or noisy graphs. Various Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have been developed recently for different applications, sharing common structures like propagation networks and output functions. The paper follows a unified view of GNN and introduces new methods based on a recent survey. The paper introduces a new graph neural network architecture with propagation networks and output networks. The graph-to-graph module updates node and edge attributes through message passing operations. The output network maps information in the graph states. The output network in the model maps graph states to the target output y, which can be labels for nodes, edges, the whole graph, or sentences. The stochastic graph inference algorithm uses reasoning agents to infer the output prediction y by passing messages over the graph. The model consists of agents that learn to reason over graphs by sequentially performing actions for inference. The model uses reasoning agents to infer output predictions by passing messages over the graph. Agents learn to reason over graphs by performing actions for inference, selecting message functions, and communicating via shared memory. The model uses reasoning agents to infer output predictions by passing messages over the graph. The inference procedure operates on graphs starting with an initial graph state containing information about nodes, edges, and global information. Edges represent relationships between nodes for message passing during inference. The method allows flexibility in inference with a graph state s and output y using network f o (s; \u03b8 o ). The focus is on refining the graph state through message passing to match the correct output. Update functions modify node attributes v, with potential for edge and global attributes. Message passing operates on edges in the graph to update nodes. The method involves updating node states in a graph by passing messages from neighboring nodes using different functions. A set of functions {f k (\u00b7, \u00b7)} 0\u2264k\u2264K is defined for message passing, with a reasoning agent determining which function to use for each edge. Each function f k (\u00b7, \u00b7) has learnable parameters \u03b8 k and the ability to pass no information. The reasoning agent in the current graph state outputs a distribution for message passing on each edge. State is maintained over iterations for remembering message passing actions. Global state is used for sharing information across agents. Equations update networks and compute distributions. Parameters are shared, but each edge has its own agents. Uniform prior is added for regularization in message distribution. Action sampling is performed by sampling actions from distributions \u03c0 using the Gumbel softmax trick. The model updates graph state through a sequence of reasoning steps, producing a trajectory \u03c4. At test time, multiple reasoning trajectories are sampled and results are aggregated. Training data specifies input graph structure for evaluation of the learned model. In training data, input graph structure and target value are provided for inference. The learning objective involves probabilistic reasoning with a learnable prior for reasoning sequences. The reasoning process depends on graph states, with \u03c4 representing the latent reasoning sequence. The text discusses using variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution over trajectories for efficient reasoning processes. By utilizing a reasoning agent as a proposal distribution, effective and efficient inference procedures can be conducted. The text discusses minimizing KL divergence by using variational inference to derive equations for optimizing the evidence lowerbound (ELBO) in reasoning processes. Learning objectives can be defined as a product of probabilities over time steps in the reasoning process. Parameters of networks are learned to specify the output given the target inference values and graph state. The text discusses maximizing the ELBO to learn network parameters for inference in reasoning processes. The learning objective includes a likelihood term to fit data and a KL term to guide the learnable prior agent. The proposal distribution helps address the drifting problem in unfamiliar graph states during inference. In variational inference, the proposal distribution accesses ground truth data to generate good graph states, while the prior agent may encounter states leading to failure. To address this, a model mixes sampling from both prior and proposal agents at the trajectory level, using importance sampling weights to re-weight the objective. This approach is tested on visual reasoning tasks and social network classification. The text discusses visual reasoning tasks and social network classification, comparing a proposed model with popular graph neural network variants. The model needs to handle imperfect observations, noisy edges, and make modifications to graph nodes. The graph neural network model described in Battaglia et al. (2018) is followed, which has the ability to learn and control information flow effectively. The text discusses various graph neural network models for visual reasoning tasks and social network classification, including mean pooling aggregation, attention-based models, recurrent relational networks, and neural relational inference models. The inference model is a probabilistic model capturing graph structures with four function types on each edge. A synthetic dataset \"Where am I\" based on Shapes Andreas et al. (2016) dataset is designed for visual question answering tasks. The dataset contains images with shape objects on grids, requiring inference over objects by comparing context to infer positions. The inference model uses graph networks to solve a problem where objects' positions need to be inferred by comparing context. The model faces difficulties due to multiple overlapping configurations for each object, requiring iterative modification of nodes content to avoid confusion. The Policy Message Passing (PMP) model and its variants outperform baselines in classification accuracy for objects, highlighting the need for dynamical reasoning in complex tasks. Models with fixed structures struggle to generalize well, while attention-based models offer some improvement but lack consistent strategic reasoning. The model is tested on large-scale benchmark datasets with real images, specifically on the Jigsaw Puzzle solving task. The study evaluates the Policy Message Passing (PMP) model on image datasets like Visual Genome and COCO. Different puzzle sizes (3x3, 4x4, 6x6) are used for testing. Performance is measured using per-patch classification score and Kendall-tau correlation. The study evaluates the Policy Message Passing (PMP) model on image datasets like Visual Genome and COCO, using different puzzle sizes for testing. Results show that the proposed models consistently outperform baseline models by a 10% - 20% margin, indicating the importance of a powerful inference process in deep graph-structured models. Analysis on the number of inference steps and size of function set reveals that a function set of size 4 is sufficient for message diversity. The Policy Message Passing (PMP) model shows good performance on 6 \u00d7 6 puzzles with 6 steps. Comparison with state-of-the-art methods on CelebA dataset demonstrates near perfect results on various puzzle sizes. The model's ability to handle noisy edges on large scale graphs is also examined. In an experiment comparing graph-structured models, including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), on the Cora benchmark, perturbations were added to the adjacency matrix by introducing more noisy edges. The proposed model utilized a recurrent network agent with 32 hidden dimensions and showed promising results in reasoning over graphs within a Bayesian framework. The process involves generating a distribution over messages for propagating data on a graph, with learned functional form and parameters. Learning these parameters can be done through a variational approximation. Future work may involve adapting the model to use a more general set of functions."
