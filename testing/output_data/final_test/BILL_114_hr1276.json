    "content": "The Coastal State Climate Change Planning Act, also known as the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, is amended to include climate change adaptation planning. The Secretary will establish a coastal climate change adaptation planning program to assist coastal states in developing plans to minimize climate change impacts and provide financial and technical assistance for plan implementation. Guidelines will be developed in consultation with coastal states within 180 days of enactment. The Secretary, in consultation with coastal states, will issue guidelines for a grant program to develop climate change adaptation plans for coastal areas. Plans must identify public facilities and services, coastal resources, energy facilities, and other land uses likely impacted by climate change. The Secretary will issue guidelines for a grant program to develop climate change adaptation plans for coastal areas. Plans must include adaptive management strategies for land use, long-term monitoring of environmental change, and other necessary information to identify climate change impacts on coastal communities. The grant program aims to assist coastal states in developing hazard mitigation plans consistent with state and federal laws. Grants are allocated to coastal states with approved management programs, with priority given to states that have received funding for program changes. The Secretary may provide technical assistance to coastal states for timely plan development supported by grants. Coastal states must have their plans approved by the Secretary to be eligible for grants. The Secretary can make grants to coastal states with approved climate change adaptation plans to support projects implementing strategies within those plans. The Secretary will publish requirements for grant applications, allocations, eligible activities, and terms within 90 days of the first approved plan. 30-50% of funds will be awarded through a competitive process. Grants may be awarded for projects addressing stress factors in the coastal zone for climate change adaptation. Activities within the coastal zone include addressing public facilities, tourism, sedimentation, ocean acidification, fisheries habitat destruction, disease control, invasive species eradication, and wildlife habitat loss through restoration and protection projects. The Secretary will implement projects to address impacts from natural hazards in the coastal zone, provide training to local policymakers on climate change, and promote the use of National Estuarine Research Reserves for research. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 is amended to authorize grants for projects in National Estuarine Research Reserves. Congress clarifies that coastal states are not required to modify their management programs under this section."
