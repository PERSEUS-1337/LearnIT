The question of Russia's reliability in international relations due to human rights issues is debated. Analysts note uneven democratic progress in the 1990s and weaknesses in elections under Putin's leadership. United Russia Party's dominance in the State Duma after 2003 raised concerns. After the 2003 election, the Kremlin made it harder for smaller parties to win seats in the legislative house of the Federal Assembly by raising the minimum votes needed to win seats and abolishing single-member district races. Putin took over the ruling United Russia Party, which gained a two-thirds majority in the Duma election, allowing them to pass laws without needing to accommodate other parties. Electoral changes since 2007 included granting one or two seats to parties gaining between 5% and 6.99% of the vote, and extending the Duma's term from four to five years. Prime Minister Putin proposed the creation of a \"popular front\" of political forces for the 2011 Duma election, allowing non-party candidates nominated by various organizations to be included on United Russia's party list. Critics compared this to the former German Democratic Republic's system when Putin served in the Soviet-era KGB. Putin announced his candidacy for the 2012 presidential election at the United Russia Party convention in 2011, with President Medvedev endorsing him. Medvedev proposed a \"big government\" plan to support the party in the upcoming Duma election. Medvedev aimed to develop the party and political system during his presidency, focusing on combating corruption and promoting civil society and economic modernization. He sought to attract liberal voters through a \"popular front\" program released in 2011, which was intended to support the United Russia Party in the elections. The program proposed larger pensions for those delaying retirement, tax cuts for businesses, and higher alcohol and tobacco taxes. It also aimed for a more humane criminal code. Despite these proposals, the program prioritized stability over modernization, contrasting with Medvedev's views. Public discontent with the political system dominated by Putin was evident leading up to the 2011 Duma election, with many believing it would be manipulated by the authorities. In December 2011, Russian analyst Andrey Kolesnikov argued that Medvedev symbolized modernization, but public discontent with the political system dominated by Putin was evident. This discontent was highlighted by incidents involving Prime Minister Putin being booed at a boxing match and deputies refusing to stand up for him in the State Duma. All seven legal political parties had been approved to run in the upcoming election. Seven legal political parties were approved by the Central Electoral Commission to run in the December 4, 2011, Duma election. Four of these parties already held seats in the State Duma, while the other three had to obtain 150,000 signatures each to run. Just Russia is a social-democratic party, LDPR and Patriots are nationalist parties, and Right Cause and Yabloko are centrist-liberal parties. The United Russia Party included nearly 200 non-party members in their candidate list to make it more appealing. Some oppositionists called for a boycott of the election. Some parties boycotted the election or urged voters to spoil their ballots, while others advised against voting for United Russia. The campaign season lasted from November 5 to December 2, with fewer international monitors allowed compared to previous elections. United Russia supporters focused on anti-Americanism during campaigning. During the Duma campaign, United Russia backers emphasized anti-Americanism and warned against Yeltsin-era populists. President Medvedev threatened to deploy nuclear missiles to Kaliningrad if talks with NATO failed. Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov criticized the statement as a tactic to rally support for United Russia. Other parties referred to United Russia as the \"party of crooks and thieves.\" The Kremlin was reportedly incensed by the phrase \"party of crooks and thieves\" used by LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, contributing to a loss of popular support for the United Russia Party. Golos alleged that officials, including the President, were openly campaigning for United Russia in violation of electoral laws, pressuring public institutions and businesses to ensure votes for the party. During the week before the election, United Russia Party endorsed Putin as its presidential candidate at an extravagant congress. Putin warned of foreign interests funding Russian groups to influence the election, prompting a call for an investigation into Golos by three Duma deputies. The Prosecutor's Office investigated Golos for alleged violations of electoral and NGO laws, leading to a court ruling that Golos' website articles constituted illegal polling. Golos was also accused of opposing the electoral commission's work, prompting a call to block them as election monitors. Russian Presidential Human Rights Council Chairman criticized the prosecution of Golos during the election. Medvedev warned against electing a divisive Duma in a final appeal to voters. In a final appeal to voters on December 2, Medvedev urged support for United Russia Party candidates to form a capable legislative body. United Russia lost 77 seats but still retained over half of the seats in the Duma. Four parties passed the 7% threshold to win seats, with a turnout of 60.1% of registered voters. The 2007 election had a turnout of 60.1% of registered voters, slightly lower than in 2007 but higher than in 2003. The North Caucasus republics reported high turnouts and vote counts for the ruling United Russia Party, with Chechnya showing a 99.51% turnout and 99.48% voting for United Russia. Golos reported significant violations in many key voting procedures during the election. The 2007 election had a turnout of 60.1% of registered voters, slightly lower than in 2007 but higher than in 2003. The North Caucasus republics reported high turnouts and vote counts for the ruling United Russia Party. Golos reported significant violations in key voting procedures, including absentee ballot abuse, multiple voting instances, and irregularities in the counting of votes. The OSCE's preliminary report echoed these findings, highlighting government interference, biased electoral commissions, and media favoritism towards the ruling party. The 2007 election had a turnout of 60.1% of registered voters, with reports of high turnouts and vote counts for the ruling United Russia Party in the North Caucasus republics. Significant violations in key voting procedures were reported, including absentee ballot abuse and irregularities in vote counting. The OSCE's preliminary report highlighted government interference, biased electoral commissions, and media favoritism towards the ruling party. The election was marked by political parties, pro-government bias, ballot-box stuffing, and manipulation of the vote, making it not free and fair. Monitors received credible allegations of pressure on voters, with observed procedural violations and instances of manipulation. Vote tabulation and observer activities were obstructed in some cases. Observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States reported that the 2007 election was held legally and without serious violations. Yabloko did not win any seats but received enough votes to qualify for public financing and free airtime in the next election. Several opposition websites were disabled on election day due to cyberattacks, raising concerns about freedom of expression. Medvedev claimed the election was completely free, fair, and democratic, while United Russia Party received what they expected. Putin reported to United Russia officials on December 6 that \"United Russia has won a majority, a stable majority. True, there are losses, but they ... would be inevitable for any political force ... that has borne the burden of responsibility for the situation in the country for years.\" The First Deputy Chief of the Presidential Staff, Vladimir Surkov, asserted that \"in a society which is colorful, irritated and far from being united, I repeat that United Russia's 50% is an excellent result\u2026. Attempts to rock the boat and interpret the situation in a negative and provocative light are doomed to failure. Everything is under\" Russian officials denounced the OSCE's report as biased and hypocritical, focusing on criticism from Secretary Clinton. United Russia's control of over 50% of seats ensures legislation passage, but may need allies for constitutional changes. Minority parties in the Duma reflect increasing leftist and nationalist views among the public. Increasing leftist and nationalist views among the public led to protests in Moscow and St. Petersburg against a flawed election, resulting in hundreds of detentions by police. The Kremlin mobilized pro-government youth groups to hold large demonstrations in support of the government's claim of a \"clean victory.\" Demonstrations under the slogan \"For Honest Elections!\" were held in multiple cities on December 10, 2011. In Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other cities, protests against a flawed election drew crowds of up to 70,000. Demands included the ouster of the CEC head and release of political prisoners. Some protests were dispersed by police. More demonstrations planned for December 17 and 24, 2011, with concerns of potential unrest. Security forces aim to prevent a \"color revolution\" like in Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan. The Duma election in Russia sparked widespread public dissatisfaction and emboldened opposition to Putin's potential re-election as president in March 2012. Several individuals announced their intention to run against Putin, potentially harming his popularity. The Obama Administration selectively praised Russia for respecting the election process. The Obama Administration praised Russia for respecting human rights and the rule of law in some areas but expressed serious concerns about the conduct of the elections, including ballot-box stuffing and harassment of independent Russian election observers. $9 million in U.S. assistance was provided for voter education and non-partisan efforts to enhance the electoral environment. Secretary Clinton praised Russian efforts to ensure fair elections and called for a full investigation into electoral fraud. Prime Minister Putin criticized her comments as inciting unrest and called for laws to limit foreign funding in elections. Clinton reiterated the US commitment to democracy and human rights. The White House expressed support for democracy and human rights globally, including in Russia. They vowed to continue speaking out against human rights violations and engage with both the Russian government and civil society groups. Tensions rose as Russian media reported alleged emails showing US interference in Russian elections, and Russian officials accused the CIA of instigating opposition demonstrations. Opposition leaders called for support from the US and Europe. Leaders Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Ryzhkov are urging the US and EU to take action against Russia for the flawed election. Kasparov calls for sanctions on Russian leaders and endorses US Congress sanctions related to human rights abuses. Ryzhkov calls for PACE to reject Russian Duma delegates, for the EU-Russia agreement to include democratization provisions, and for visa bans and economic sanctions on Russian officials committing human rights violations. Concerns are raised about United Russia Party's campaigning potentially damaging US-Russia relations. The United Russia Party's anti-American campaign could harm U.S.-Russia relations. There are concerns about the potential impact on cooperation if anti-American themes continue in Putin's presidential campaign. The U.S. has not yet imposed sanctions for election repression, but some analysts suggest increasing support for Russian civil society and human rights groups. Putin's criticism of U.S. aid to Russian civil society and human rights groups may jeopardize it. Russia is expected to join the WTO in December 2011, leading Congress to consider extending trade relations. Membership in the WTO could improve the rule of law in Russia, but some argue it may not strengthen it significantly without continued Western support. Many in Congress are concerned about democratization and human rights progress in Russia. They suggest retaining Jackson-Vanik provisions or enacting other measures to sanction Russia if human rights standards are violated. Speaker of the House John Boehner has called for conditioning U.S.-Russia relations on Russian progress on democratization and respect. Members of the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe criticized the controversial election in Russia and raised concerns about the detention of protesters. Senator John McCain expressed worries about declining democratization and human rights in Russia, citing issues with the Duma election, the death of Sergey Magnitsky, conviction of Mikhail Khodorkovskiy, and increasing corruption. He called for the release of detained protesters and warned about Russia's government becoming less tolerant. On December 7, Senators McCain, Lieberman, and Shaheen condemned Russian crackdowns on protesters demonstrating against election fraud and called for their release. Concerns about Russia's democratic development and human rights violations continue to be a focus for Congress and the Administration in U.S.-Russia cooperation. The question remains whether Russia can be a reliable partner in international relations without upholding human rights and the rule of law."
