This report provides an overview of the U.S. FTZ system, discussing its history, structure, and current issues for Congress. FTZs are similar to free trade zones found globally. Free trade zones (FTZs) are restricted access industrial parks located near ports, allowing for duty savings and streamlined customs procedures. They are part of the global supply chain, with roughly 3,500 zones in 135 countries, including the United States. FTZs facilitate international co-production by operating within countries but considered outside their boundaries. Free trade zones (FTZs) are industrial parks near ports that allow for duty savings and streamlined customs procedures. They operate within countries but are considered outside their boundaries, facilitating global supply chains. FTZs employ millions of workers worldwide, with most located in developing countries and engaged in manufacturing. Free trade zones (FTZs) are industrial parks near ports that allow for duty savings and streamlined customs procedures. They employ millions of workers worldwide, with most in developing countries engaged in manufacturing. China accounts for over 60% of world employment in zones, followed by the rest of Asia, Mexico, Central America, and the Middle East/North Africa. FTZs function similarly worldwide but differ in size, economic purposes, and government incentives. They may represent a significant share of a country's manufacturing employment and occupy large geographic areas. Free trade zones (FTZs) vary in size and economic purposes, from large industrial complexes in developing countries to smaller enclaves in developed countries. In the United States, FTZ designation can be easily brought to any company location, offering streamlined customs procedures and tariff exemptions. Developing country zones may also provide subsidies and flexible labor regulations. Free trade zones offer incentives like subsidies, flexible labor regulations, and tax exemptions. As countries develop, they start consuming products made in their zones. Common elements include container ships, liquid storage tanks, and facilities for transferring containers. The growth of zones is due to a well-designed concept, international guidance for attracting foreign investors, and technological advancements supporting globalization. The growth of free trade zones is attributed to a well-designed concept, international guidance for attracting foreign investors, and technological advancements supporting globalization. Modern day zone growth began with an \"experiment\" in 1959 at the Shannon, Ireland airport, which proved successful and led to the promotion of the concept through the United Nations. The United States government also played a role in spreading the concept of world processing zones between 1983 and 1995. The U.S. FTZ Program was established in 1934 to boost U.S. trade during the Great Depression. Technological advancements and international factors have contributed to the growth of free trade zones worldwide, supported by organizations like USAID, OPIC, and the Department of Commerce. The U.S. FTZ Program was established in 1934 during the Great Depression to accelerate trade by creating the FTZ Board. The program started slowly but gradually gained momentum through internal and external factors. The U.S. FTZ Program was initially established in 1934, prohibiting manufacturing in zones. However, in 1950, Congress amended the FTZ Act to allow manufacturing in zones, leading to further growth. In 1952, the FTZ Board issued new regulations allowing FTZ sites to be designated at a company's facility, encouraging more businesses to utilize FTZs. Additional growth was spurred by U.S. Treasury Department decisions in 1980 and 1982 clarifying that manufacturers do not need to pay duty on value-added or transportation fees for imported goods. The U.S. FTZ Program allows companies to save costs by not paying duty on value-added or transportation fees for imported goods. Factors like international price competition, education on cost-saving methods, and technological advancements have accelerated FTZ use. Most FTZ activity in the U.S. is in manufacturing operations, with 174 active FTZs and 276 manufacturing/production operations nationwide. Each state has at least one FTZ, showing widespread involvement in the zone system for both foreign and domestic businesses. The U.S. FTZ Program allows companies to save costs by not paying duty on imported goods. Most FTZ activity is in manufacturing, with 174 active FTZs nationwide. Every state has involvement in the zone system, combining foreign and domestic inputs to make products. 58% of inputs are domestic, while 42% are foreign. FTZs account for 13% of all foreign goods entering the U.S. and employ 370,000 workers. Total zone inputs increased six-fold from 1993 to 2012, largely due to inflation in crude oil prices. Between 1993 and 2012, U.S. FTZs primarily use domestic inputs over foreign inputs, with most outputs consumed within the United States. Employment in FTZs has remained steady since 1993, with a small portion of output being exported. Since 1993, employment in U.S. FTZs has remained relatively steady. The rise in the early 1990s was due to labor-intensive auto production companies moving in, but it has leveled off since then. FTZs have been increasingly used by petrochemical companies since 1997, benefiting from tariff-free storage and an inverted tariff structure. Crude oil is the major foreign input, accounting for 72% of all foreign products brought into zones in 2012. In 2012, foreign inputs into U.S. FTZs totaled $303 billion, with crude oil accounting for 72% of all products. The incentive for importing crude oil is to save money on tariffs. However, once the effect of rising oil prices is considered, the value of foreign inputs shrinks to $100 billion. FTZs primarily benefit manufacturing firms and the economy with savings possibilities. These savings come from tariff reduction, administrative efficiencies, tax benefits, and duty deferral. This could help maintain operations in the U.S., attract foreign producers, and support communities. Consumers may benefit from cost savings, and tax revenues may increase. However, there are potential costs to the U.S. economy, such as granting tariff reductions on imported components. Potential costs to the U.S. economy include disadvantages for domestic producers, competitive disadvantages for certain industries, loss of tariff revenue, and market distortions. FTZ regulations aim to address these issues. The FTZ regulations aim to address potential costs and benefits of the program, including duty reduction and customs inventory control for companies using FTZs. The application process is administered by the FTZ Board, with costs stemming from administrative requirements and monitoring by Customs and Border Protection. There are no precise estimates of the market value of FTZs in the United States or worldwide trade zones. The main benefits of using FTZs include duty reduction on inverted tariff situations, customs inventory control efficiencies, duty exemption on exports, duty deferral, drawback elimination, tax savings, quota storage, and zone-to-zone transfer. Duty reduction on inverted tariff situations is the most heavily used benefit, allowing businesses to choose the tariff level that applies to imported components or finished goods, resulting in significant savings. For example, a new Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga estimated savings of $1.9 million by utilizing FTZ status. In Chattanooga, TN, a company with FTZ status estimated $1.9 million in savings, or $13 per car, on producing 150,000 cars annually. In the oil industry, most inverted tariff benefits go to the petrochemical sector, accounting for 15% to 17% of refinery yield. FTZ Board authorization is required for potential impact on domestic suppliers. Customs and inventory efficiencies, like \"bundling\" entries, provide significant savings for FTZ users. FTZs offer significant cost savings for large-operation zone users by allowing them to pay a single merchandise processing fee instead of separate fees for each shipment. This can result in a 90% reduction in processing fees. FTZs handle over 10% of U.S. imports by value but account for less than 1% of import filings due to bundling efficiencies. Duty exemption allows merchandise to be re-exported without paying duties, providing savings for U.S. exporters. FTZs offer cost savings for large-operation zone users by allowing a single merchandise processing fee instead of separate fees for each shipment, resulting in a 90% reduction in processing fees. Duty exemption in FTZs allows merchandise to be re-exported without paying duties, providing savings for U.S. exporters. However, companies need to carefully consider the costs and benefits of FTZ use, including startup and maintenance costs, before applying for FTZ status. Startup costs include the application process, background checks for importers, and a physical security system. FTZs work best when a company can potentially see a return of 100% to 200% on investment in zone use. Maintenance costs for FTZs include greater oversight by CBP officials, a full-time zone manager, a \"bond\" payment for potential tariffs, and annual fees for zone use. Grantees must operate zones as public utilities but can charge users for managing costs, with fees ranging from several thousand dollars to $10,000 or more per year. The FTZ program involves users paying fees ranging from several thousand dollars to $10,000 or more annually. The FTZ Board, consisting of the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Treasury, oversees the establishment and administration of zones. The Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection provides oversight and ensures compliance with laws and regulations related to zone use. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for activating and securing Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs), controlling merchandise movement, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. CBP conducts audits, oversees security measures, and collaborates with Homeland Security's Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to prevent unlawful employment in FTZs. The Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) in the U.S. are subject to labor laws and oversight by various agencies including the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FTZ Board grants authority to applicants to establish, operate, and maintain zones, with grantees managing the zones locally. Grantees must operate the zones as public utilities, provide fair rates, make annual reports to the FTZ Board, and ensure uniform treatment for zone users. The U.S. FTZ Board published revisions to regulations in the Federal Register on February 28, 2012. The U.S. FTZ Board published revisions to regulations in the Federal Register in 2012 to streamline the application process for manufacturers and distributors wanting to operate in an FTZ or establish a subzone. The new regulations reduce the timeline for applications for production authority from 12 months to 4 months and allow companies to obtain FTZ designation in as little as 30 days. The U.S. FTZ Board revised regulations in 2012 to streamline the application process, reducing the timeline to 4 months. Congressional issues regarding FTZs include domestic concerns about resource allocation and data sufficiency, as well as international concerns about economic development and worker rights. The U.S. FTZ system was established in the 1930s to boost commerce after the Great Depression. Today, it plays a key role in global trade and economic competitiveness. Congress may need to assess if the FTZ system still aligns with its original purpose and if it is the most effective tool for promoting productivity and economic growth. The U.S. FTZ system was established in the 1930s to boost commerce after the Great Depression. Today, it plays a key role in global trade and economic competitiveness. A potential issue arises when FTZ benefits are not available to all U.S. producers, leading to a misallocation of resources. While technically open to all firms, the high startup costs make it more beneficial for larger companies. Efforts have been made to simplify the application process to address accessibility concerns. The FTZ system simplifies the application process to reduce U.S. tariffs efficiently. Tariffs can cause resource misallocation, and eliminating them may be politically challenging. FTZs lower tariffs effectively by allowing public comment, benefiting industries without strong opposition. Lowering specific tariff lines may not eliminate distortion equally. Congress could provide tariff-free access across the board for more efficient market access. One way to provide tariff-free access to the U.S. market is through broad-based tariff reductions, typically achieved through multilateral trade negotiations. The use of Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) can also create logistical benefits, but may lead to distortions as users benefit from streamlined customs procedures and lower fees. There are concerns about the accessibility of the program, as larger importers may have a stronger incentive to establish an FTZ due to capped merchandise processing fees. Broader customs reform applicable to all importers could offer similar benefits. Providing tariff-free access to the U.S. market can be achieved through broad-based tariff reductions or the use of Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs). While broader customs reform could offer similar benefits without the risk of distortions, logistical challenges may hinder its implementation for all importers. CBP has considered allowing importers to file one entry form per month, but concerns about the feasibility and resource burden remain. Ensuring the safety and security of U.S. imports while facilitating timely trade continues to be a challenge. The challenge of facilitating timely trade while ensuring the safety and security of U.S. imports remains. Every shipment in and out of foreign-trade zones requires authorization from CBP, with documents submitted including classification, country of origin, and merchandise value. Public reports on products moving in and out of zones are incomplete, but data is published by the Commerce Department and the U.S. FTZ Board on imports, exports, and zone use. The FTZ Board and Census Bureau provide estimates of zone use from different sources and methods. While their final estimates are close on some measurements, missing data complicates policy recommendations. The FTZ Board collects data from zone users on \"foreign\" and \"domestic status\" inputs, while the Census Bureau tracks imports and exports in general, including detailed data by Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes for FTZs. The Census Bureau provides detailed data on imports into FTZs and bonded warehouses by HTS codes, as well as import charges owed. Data on merchandise leaving FTZs for consumption or export can be requested. Industry-specific data on domestic inputs, goods transferred between zones, value added, and the actual character of goods entering and exiting FTZs are reported to CBP for security purposes but not publicly available. Security issues related to imports remain a concern. CBP conducts periodic reviews of companies involved in importing goods, including those in Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs). Companies must undergo a thorough screening process, known as \"activation,\" which includes background checks on key employees, facility security assessments, and inventory control evaluations. Unlike direct imports into the US, FTZ imports require additional security measures. Companies must apply to CBP to use a zone and provide detailed procedures manuals for handling merchandise. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed trade and security concerns related to CBP's \"in-bond cargo\" system in 2007. The GAO found that CBP lacks sufficient information on in-bond shipments and does limited data analysis. This system, which includes shipments to, from, and between zones, is designed to facilitate trade flow but has shortcomings in assessing its extent of use. The GAO found that CBP has limited information on in-bond shipments, hindering security risk management and inspection targeting. CBP is working to automate the system to address these concerns. Unlike in-bond shipments, the FTZ process is automated for security and tracking. The FATF/OECD conducted a global security assessment on zones, with findings reported in Money Laundering. The FATF/OECD conducted a global security assessment on Free Trade Zones (FTZs) and released a report in March 2010. The report identified smuggling and tax evasion activities involving a U.S. company and a U.S. FTZ. Recommendations focused on improving trade data systems, electronic customs filing, and monitoring of customs brokers and bonded warehouses. FTZs are promoted for their job and trade creation potential, employing 320,000 people. FTZs are highlighted for their job-creating and trade-creating potential, employing 320,000 manufacturing workers in the U.S. Factors impacting U.S. manufacturing employment include productivity gains and the movement of facilities abroad. Debate continues on the influence of these factors and how to address the situation. FTZ trade groups argue that FTZ operations can support job retention and growth, enhancing the global competitiveness of U.S. firms. FTZ use enhances global competitiveness for U.S. firms by saving costs through assembly operations in U.S. FTZs. For example, Nissan estimates $8.3 million in annual FTZ benefits. Job growth impact is challenging to determine due to direct and indirect effects. The United States promotes free trade zones worldwide to enhance global competitiveness for U.S. firms. Export-led growth may not always contribute to economic development, as it can be cyclical and destabilizing when world economic growth slows. Developing a domestic economy that relies more on domestic consumer demand could provide stability in the long run for developing countries. Export processing zones can accelerate economic development by focusing on exports, attracting foreign investment, and promoting diversification into higher value-added goods. Government planning towards this goal has been successful in some countries. Working within the WTO may be more efficient and less market distorting. Some argue that working within the WTO to eliminate tariffs worldwide is more efficient than promoting export processing zones for international economic development. However, the slow process of tariff elimination does not address the infrastructure and customs simplification benefits of free trade zones in developing countries. Focus on trade capacity building and ensuring developing countries can process, track, and transport goods may help address this challenge. The Doha Development Agenda in the WTO includes negotiations on trade facilitation and capacity building, although progress has been stalled. The Doha Agenda has been stalled, but Congress impacts worker rights in trade zones worldwide through U.S. trade preference laws and free trade agreements. There may be uncertainty regarding the applicability of these provisions to free trade zones under some agreements. The United States has suspended trade preferences to certain countries due to labor violations, but the applicability of labor provisions in free trade agreements to trade zones in other countries has not been tested. Jordan has permitted relaxed labor standards in its free trade zones, which came to light in 2006 when problematic labor conditions were documented. Discussions between U.S. and Jordanian labor representatives resolved the issue. Jordan relaxed labor standards in its free trade zones, leading to problematic conditions in 2006. Discussions between U.S. and Jordanian labor representatives resolved the issue informally, without setting a precedent for addressing labor standards in free trade zones of countries with U.S. free trade agreements. The future inclusion of labor standards in trade agreements remains uncertain, with international organizations issuing guidelines on labor issues in free trade zones. The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises include labor guidelines, but do not specifically mention export processing zones or free trade zones. The ILO has issued reports on working conditions in export processing zones, noting uneven implementation of labor codes of conduct by multinational corporations. Concerns have been raised about the future of free trade zones, including U.S. FTZs. The future of free trade zones, including U.S. FTZs, is uncertain due to trade liberalization and tariff reductions. Despite questions about their importance after NAFTA, free trade zones remain popular globally, with over 3,700 firms and 1.2 million workers in zones in Mexico. Between 1997 and 2012, the number of firms using export processing zones decreased from 3,600 to 3,200, but there was an increase in employment from 310,000 to 370,000. The overall increase in zone use, particularly in the oil sector, also led to a nearly four-fold increase in the current dollar value of merchandise received/shipped. The OECD identified reasons supporting the growth of world export processing zones, including emphasis on export-oriented and foreign direct investment-oriented growth, transfer of labor-intensive industries to developing countries, and global production networks. Factors that could increase the use of free trade zones globally, including U.S. FTZs, are improvements in technology, security monitoring, and efficiencies for zone users. Possible external trends that could boost U.S. FTZs include a return of basic manufacturing to the United States and an increase in exports. As long as international trade barriers and security issues persist, the need for FTZs will continue to grow."
