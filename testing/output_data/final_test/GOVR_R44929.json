    "content": "The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant, administered by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, aims to improve the well-being of low-income maternal and child populations by providing essential health services. It serves pregnant women, mothers, children, and children with special health care needs, some of whom also receive services from Medicaid or CHIP. The grant consists of three funding programs, with the block grant being the largest. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant consists of three funding programs. The first is a block grant provided to states to coordinate programs and provide health services. The second is the SPRANS program, which funds research and training for low-income pregnant women, mothers, and children. The third is the CISS program, which supports integrated services at the community level. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant is a federal-state partnership program that provides funding for health care services to maternal and child health populations. It was established under Title V of the Social Security Act and combines various maternal and child health services and programs to improve health outcomes. The Title V MCH Services Block Grant, established under the Social Security Act, consolidates health services for mothers and children in low-income households. The 1981 OBRA increased state flexibility in using federal funds to address maternal and child health needs. The MCH Services Block Grant program, established under the Social Security Act, ensures that each state receives combined funding from consolidated programs. Changes made under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 increased appropriations, accountability, and application/reporting requirements. Additional programs for CSHCNs and low-income women and children were added over time. Title V also supports services from the MIECHV program and state-based CSHCNs program, creating federal-state partnerships to address maternal and child health needs. The MCH Services Block Grant program, established under the Social Security Act, enables states to provide quality health care to mothers and children with low incomes. It aims to reduce infant deaths, preventable diseases, and handicapping conditions among children, increase access to health assessments and treatment services for low-income children, offer perinatal care to at-risk women, and provide rehabilitation services to blind and disabled children. Additionally, it supports family-centered, community-based, and care-coordinated services. The MCH Services Block Grant program, established under the SSA, aims to provide quality health care to pregnant women, infants, children, CSHCNs, and others. HRSA defines pregnant women, infants, children, and CSHCNs based on age and health conditions. In FY2015, 57,064,187 individuals were served by programs funded by the MCH Services Block Grant, including pregnant women, infants, children, CSHCNs, and others (women of childbearing age and those not classified by the state). The funds are used to provide core public health services. The Community Integrated Services Systems (CISS) program provides core public health services for low-income mothers and children. Projects funded by SPRANS include maternal and child health workforce development, genetic services, and diagnostic and treatment services for hemophilia. CISS grants support integrated maternal and child health services at the community level. Block grant funds are used by states to ensure access to quality maternal and child health services for those with low income or limited availability of health services. States determine the specific services provided under the block grant, which may include counseling, dental care, family planning, immunization, prenatal care, lead-based poisoning screening, support for community health centers, vision and hearing screening, and well-child care. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant provides funding to states and jurisdictions for various services including direct health care, enabling services, population-based services, and infrastructure building services. States are responsible for administering programs with Title V allotments and are organized within the 10 regions of HHS. Direct health care services receive the largest proportion of funding. In FY2015, direct health care services accounted for 57.62% of expenditures under the MCH Services Block Grant program, totaling approximately $3.87 billion out of $6.29 billion. States can use block grants to ensure access to quality maternal and child health services for those with limited resources. States determine the services provided under the MCH Services Block Grant, which can include medical services not covered by public and private insurers, capacity expansion of healthcare systems, community building for enabling services, education and outreach programs, newborn screening, injury prevention, and support for children with special healthcare needs. The MCH Services Block Grant program promotes health care and safety in child care settings, provides support for children with special health care needs, and serves as the payer of last resort. Certain uses of block grant funds are prohibited under Section 504 of the SSA. The MCH Services Block Grant program prohibits the use of funds for nonfederal requirements or transfers to other programs. Funds cannot be used for research or training at for-profit entities and are subject to restrictions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. States must submit a needs assessment and plan to receive block grant funds, which must address statewide health goals, preventive care for women and children, and services for children with special health care needs. The state block grant administrators must coordinate with other programs like Medicaid, WIC, and education programs to make services accessible and avoid duplication of effort. Coordination efforts vary among states, with some having interagency agreements outlining expected levels of coordination. The Title V agency contracts with health providers for services, while Medicaid reimburses when possible. HRSA analyzed coordination between state Medicaid and maternal/child health agencies in 2008, showing varying levels of formality in interagency agreements. The SPRANS program offers grants for maternal/child health research and services, including genetic testing and counseling. The SPRANS program offers grants for maternal/child health research and services, including genetic testing and counseling. Eligible grantees include public or nonprofit private institutions of higher learning and organizations conducting maternal and child health research. Preference is given to projects in areas with a high infant mortality rate. In 2014, Indiana had a high infant mortality rate of 7.08, with black infants experiencing a rate of 14.34, more than double the state average. The CISS grant program supports projects that enhance integrated services at the community level for mothers and children, focusing on rural areas and those with special health needs. The CISS grant program supports various health care programs for maternal and child health, including MIECHV and community-based services for CSHCNs. Funds are allocated through the MCH Services Block Grant formula, with specific requirements outlined in 42 U.S.C \u00a7702(a). The allocation requirements for state funding under the CISS grant program are determined by a formula based on the proportion of low-income children in each state. State matching funds and other maternal and child health funding sources are not required to follow the federal allocation requirements, providing states with flexibility in funding distribution. Block grant funds are awarded annually to states with flexibility in directing funds where needed. Low-income mothers and children are defined for allocation purposes, but not as a criterion for receiving services. Recipients of services funded by block grants do not have a federally prescribed means test. The block grant funds are allocated to states with flexibility in funding distribution. Recipients of services funded by the block grants do not undergo a federally prescribed means test. States must allocate a minimum percentage of funds for specific populations and services, with restrictions on administrative costs. States also need to maintain a level of state funding for maternal and child health programs that matches their FY1989 level. Funding for federal-state partnerships comes from various sources. The funding for maternal and child health programs includes allocations from the federal government, local MCH funds, other funds from various sources like CDC and WIC, program income funds collected by state agencies, and state MCH funds that states match to federal allocations. States must match at least $3 for every $4 given by the federal government. In FY2015, the federal-state partnership was funded at $6.3 billion, with State MCH funds and program income accounting for over 78% of combined federal and state spending. The MCH Services Block Grant receives funding from federal and state sources, with states required to match federal funds. If a state does not use its full allotment, the funds are redistributed to other states. 15% of the grant is awarded competitively to organizations for SPRANS projects. Congress may provide specific directives for SPRANS funding, with priority determined by HRSA. In FY2017, Congress allocated funds for various health programs under the SPRANS program, including oral health, epilepsy, sickle cell, and fetal alcohol syndrome. Additionally, $20 million in supplemental funding was provided to help territories respond to the Zika virus. In FY2016, HRSA awarded $17 million to American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico for Zika virus response. In FY2017, Congress allocated funds for various health programs under the SPRANS program, including oral health, epilepsy, sickle cell, and fetal alcohol syndrome. Additionally, $5 million in additional funding was provided to develop Family-to-Family Health Information Centers (F2F HICs). The F2F HICs program funds family-staffed and family-run centers in 50 states and the District of Columbia, providing information, education, technical assistance, and peer support to families of children with special health care needs. The CISS program requires Congress to appropriate over $600 million to the MCH Services Block Grant, with a set-aside of 12.75% for CISS. In FY2016, HRSA received $638.2 million for the MCH Services Block Grant program, with funds distributed competitively to organizations focusing on areas with high infant mortality rates. The allocation of funds differed from the statutory requirement due to a mandate in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. In FY2016, HRSA received $638.2 million for the MCH Services Block Grant program. The funding allocation for SPRANS was $77.1 million (12.08%), CISS was $10.3 million (1.61%), and block grants to states were $550.8 million (86.31%). Reporting mechanisms required by Section 505 of the SSA include a needs assessment every five years, an annual report, and an independent audit every two years. Each state must submit an annual report to the Secretary of HHS on all Title V activities. States must prepare and submit an annual report to the Secretary of HHS on all Title V activities, presented in a standardized format. The report should include a list of activities and recipients of Title V funding, progress towards national and state health objectives, and data on maternal and child health systems. States must provide information on program participation, measures of maternal and child health, and workforce data. States vary in their capacity for data collection and reporting, with estimates allowed if actual numbers are unavailable. States are required to report expenditures by four categories of service and annually report pediatric and family practice workforce data to HRSA. This includes information on licensed obstetricians, family practitioners, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, pediatricians, and pediatric nurse practitioners. States also report on the receipt of services by eligible individuals such as Medicaid and SSI beneficiaries, and access to prenatal care for pregnant women. States report expenditures by service categories and pediatric workforce data to HRSA. They also report on services received by Medicaid beneficiaries. Priority needs in states' strategic plans include family support, oral health, childhood obesity, mental health, and services for children with disabilities. HRSA compiles this information annually for Congress. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of CDC provides vital statistics and health data nationally and by state. Some jurisdictions must report their own data. The Secretary must report on funded SPRANS and CISS projects to committees. Source of Funding for Title V Block Grants and Appropriation History of Family-to-Family Health Information Centers are also provided. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, ACA, American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, PAMA, and MACRA provided varying levels of funding for a program from FY2007 to FY2015. MACRA (P.L. 114-10) provided full-year funding of $5 million for FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017."
