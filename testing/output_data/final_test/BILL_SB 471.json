    "title": "SB 471",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the interconnectedness of water and energy resources, known as the water-energy nexus. Energy used in California's water system accounts for a significant portion of electricity and natural gas consumption, with gaps in quantifying associated greenhouse gas emissions. The water used in California's energy system, such as for hydropower and thermoelectric power, represents a large portion of state water demand. Saving water also saves energy, as energy production often leads to greenhouse gas emissions. The Legislature aims to reduce water-related greenhouse gas emissions through improved linkage between water and energy systems. The Legislature aims to integrate planning for water, energy, and greenhouse gas emissions to reduce water-related greenhouse gas emissions and access eligible funds. Moneys from the fund should be appropriated in a manner consistent with legislative requirements. The state must ensure that funds from the allocated fund are used to further regulatory purposes and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California. The funds should maximize economic, environmental, and public health benefits, as well as promote job creation within the state. The allocated fund must be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California and promote job creation. Investments should target disadvantaged communities and businesses to mitigate climate change impacts. Funding allocated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, transportation systems, and land conservation. Funding allocated for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through strategic planning, sustainable infrastructure projects, waste diversion, local agency programs, and innovative technologies. The commission, in collaboration with other state agencies, will conduct a study on water-related energy use in California. This study will involve workshops for input from various stakeholders and identify any data gaps. The commission, in collaboration with other state agencies, will establish a grant and loan program for water projects that reduce water-related greenhouse gas emissions. Eligible project categories include precision irrigation. The grant and loan program for water projects aim to reduce water-related greenhouse gas emissions through various initiatives such as precision irrigation, infrastructure improvements, local water solutions, clean energy generation, leak detection, water appliance efficiency, and water monitoring software. Public funds allocated to private water companies must benefit ratepayers or the public and be overseen by the Public Utilities Commission. The board may establish guidelines and regulations for program implementation."
