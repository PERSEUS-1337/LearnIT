    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Promoting New Manufacturing Act\" and includes a provision for a Building and Manufacturing Projects Dashboard. The Administrator must publish the EPA's estimates for each fiscal year, including the total number of preconstruction permits issued, the percentage issued within one year of application, and the average time for the Environmental Appeals Board to make a decision on permit appeals. The publication must be made within 60 days of the Act's enactment for fiscal years 2008 through 2013. The Environmental Protection Agency must publish estimates for each fiscal year, based on information in their possession, including data from the RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse database. States and local air agencies can voluntarily provide additional information for the database. SEC. 3. Timely issuance of regulations and guidance for new or revised national ambient air quality standards in preconstruction permitting. In publishing final rules for national ambient air quality standards, the Administrator must also publish regulations and guidance for implementing the standard concurrently. If this information is not published at the same time as the standard, the standard will not apply to preconstruction permit applications until it is published. After finalizing national ambient air quality standards, regulations and guidance must be published for implementation. This information is necessary for preconstruction permit applications to be valid. The Environmental Protection Agency retains the authority to issue additional regulations or guidance to support states and facilities in meeting these standards. States, local, or tribal permitting authorities can enforce stricter emissions requirements if needed. States, local, or tribal authorities can impose stricter emissions requirements than Federal standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency. SEC. 4. REPORT TO CONGRESS ON ACTIONS TO EXPEDITE REVIEW OF PRECONSTRUCTION PERMITS. The Administrator must submit a report to Congress annually, identifying EPA activities to improve preconstruction permitting efficiency and reasons for delays in issuing permits under the Clean Air Act. The Administrator must submit an annual report to Congress detailing efforts to improve preconstruction permitting efficiency under the Clean Air Act, including resolving delays in completeness determinations and processing permits. Public comments on the draft report must be solicited for at least 30 days before submission. The Environmental Protection Agency will only use voluntarily provided information by States and local air agencies for the RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse database. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include the terms \"Administrator\" referring to the head of the EPA, \"best available control technology\" and \"lowest achievable emissions rate\" as defined in the Clean Air Act, and \"major emitting facility\" and \"major stationary source\" as defined in the Clean Air Act. The term \"national ambient air quality standard\" is also defined. The term \"national ambient air quality standard\" refers to a standard for air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. A \"preconstruction permit\" is required for the construction or modification of major emitting facilities or sources. The RACT/BACT/LAER Clearinghouse database is the central repository of air pollution technology information on the EPA's Website. The House of Representatives passed the bill on November 20, 2014. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
