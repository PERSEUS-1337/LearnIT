    "content": "The federal government has a long history of involvement in water resource development and management, including water-borne transportation, irrigated agriculture expansion, flood reduction, and aquatic ecosystem restoration. Growing population, environmental regulations, water contamination, climate variability, and changing public interests have led to increased water use conflicts, especially in the West. Federal water resource construction decreased in the late 20th century due to fiscal constraints, local control preferences, environmental impact assessments, and wildlife protection requirements, marking the end of expansionist federal policies from the early 20th century. The 110th Congress faces water resource issues related to federal involvement in planning, construction, and financing of projects. Decisions are made amidst conflicting laws, objectives, and institutional mechanisms. Legislation often addresses specific needs, with recurring themes like demand for new project services. The 110th Congress is considering site-specific restoration legislation for various water resource projects, including coastal Louisiana, the Upper Mississippi River-Illinois Waterway System, the Great Lakes, the San Joaquin River, and the Platte River. Additionally, there are hundreds of individual water resources projects authorized through Water Resources Development Acts (WRDAs) addressing new water supply technologies, rural water supply development, and Indian water rights settlements. Oversight of existing laws and projects such as the Central Valley Project and flood protection in New Orleans is also a focus. The 110th Congress is considering restoration legislation for various water resource projects, including coastal Louisiana, the Upper Mississippi River-Illinois Waterway System, the Great Lakes, the San Joaquin River, and the Platte River. Federal projects on various rivers and pumps in the California Bay-Delta may be affected by court decisions, agency actions, or circumstances like drought. Water allocation debates have increased due to scarce water supplies and growing urban populations in the West, leading to federal-state tensions over intrastate water allocation. Concerns about the reliability of water supplies and management mechanisms have risen due to observed changes in snowmelt timing, runoff, and potential climate variability. During the 110th Congress, Western water legislation focuses on project management, program issues, and sustainability of water supplies. Congressional attention may also include oversight of various water projects like the Central Valley Project, Klamath project, and Colorado River operations. Nationally, there may be a focus on the federal role in levee construction, maintenance, and water resources management, with particular attention to Hurricane Katrina oversight issues. The federal government is involved in significant restoration initiatives from the Florida Everglades to the California Bay-Delta, focusing on river and watershed restoration efforts. There is also a demand for water supply projects, navigational improvements, flood control projects, and beach protection. Controversy exists over water allocation among different projects. The 109th and 110th Congress have been dealing with significant water supply components, including controversies over water allocation among different uses, new requests for developing dwindling water supplies due to widespread drought, and security threats to water infrastructure. Various national water policy proposals have been left pending, with some reintroduced in the 110th Congress, addressing issues during project authorizations and debates on WRDA legislation and FY2008 appropriations. During the 110th Congress, discussions include federal reserved water rights, transfer of water across federal lands, Indian water rights settlements, and the licensing of nonfederal hydropower facilities. The Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have been involved in building large dams and water diversion structures in the United States. The Bureau of Reclamation manages reservoirs and dams in 17 western states, providing water for irrigation and millions of people. The Corps of Engineers focuses on flood control, navigation, and power generation projects nationwide. Construction authorizations for water projects slowed in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1980s, authorizations for Bureau projects slowed due to various factors. The Bureau announced a new mission in 1987 focused on environmentally sensitive water resources management. Increased population, drought, fiscal constraints, and water demands for various purposes led to pressure to alter project operations. However, changes are complicated by water rights, contractual obligations, and economic effects. Unlike the Corps, there is no regular authorization vehicle for Bureau projects, which are considered individually. Water project and management issues being considered during the 110th Congress include the San Joaquin River restoration settlement legislation. During the 110th Congress, key issues included San Joaquin River restoration, Bureau's Title 16 program, oversight of CVPIA and CVP operations, CALFED appropriations, Delta Smelt population declines, water recycling projects, drought response, climate variability effects on reservoirs, and Colorado River water management. Congress also focused on oversight of the Bureau's mission and its role in western water supply and resource management, with debates on its shift from development to management agency. The 110th Congress focused on key issues such as San Joaquin River restoration, Bureau's Title 16 program, oversight of CVPIA and CVP operations, CALFED appropriations, Delta Smelt population declines, water recycling projects, drought response, climate variability effects on reservoirs, and Colorado River water management. There were debates on the Bureau's shift from a water resources development agency to a water resource management agency, with questions raised about federal funding for rural water supply projects and environmental mitigation. Key questions included the future federal role in water resources management, the Bureau's role in western water management, responsibility for developing new supply systems, funding sources, and environmental mitigation strategies. The 110th Congress focused on key water resource issues such as San Joaquin River restoration, Bureau's Title 16 program, oversight of CVPIA and CVP operations, CALFED appropriations, Delta Smelt population declines, water recycling projects, drought response, and climate variability effects on reservoirs. Congress addressed the need for a National Water Commission and periodic water resource assessments, with discussions on revamping existing projects to accommodate changing demands. WRDA bills were introduced in the early 2000s to authorize Corps water resources activities and make changes to agency policies. The last WRDA was enacted in 2000. WRDA bills were introduced or considered in 2002-2006 but not enacted due to debates over controversial projects and Corps planning reforms. WRDA 2007 debates in the 110th Congress included changes to state and local roles, Corps policies, and authorization of projects like coastal Louisiana restoration and hurricane protection measures. The 110th Congress debates on the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2007 included authorizations for hurricane protection measures in Louisiana and flood control activities nationwide. Hurricane Katrina sparked interest in flood control projects, leading to concerns about streamlining federal spending. Congress also addressed the Corps of Engineers' adoption of performance-based budgeting, safety of Corps facilities, and Everglades ecosystem restoration. The 110th Congress expressed dissatisfaction with the Corps' financial management, especially fund reprogramming and multiyear contracts for projects. Corps flood control and hurricane protection projects, post-Katrina, are under scrutiny. Water resources management by the Corps, like on the Mississippi, Missouri, and Columbia and Snake Rivers, is controversial. Congressional oversight, legislative direction, and appropriations may focus on the Corps' projects and emergency response role. Water resources debates in the 110th Congress will focus on changing policies, practices, and accountability of water resource agencies, as well as authorizing investments in ecosystem restoration and flood mitigation. The federal role in water resources planning and management, highlighted by Hurricane Katrina, raises questions about responsibilities for flood mitigation and water supply competition. Increasing competition for water supplies, especially in urban centers like Atlanta, has led to more communities seeking federal assistance for water supply development projects. Congress typically makes incremental changes through WRDA bills for the Corps and project-specific legislation for the Bureau due to challenges in enacting broad legislation on federal water resources policies. The fractured nature of congressional committee jurisdictions over water resources and water quality issues further complicates the process."
