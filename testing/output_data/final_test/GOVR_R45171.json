    "content": "Apprenticeship is a workforce development strategy that combines on-the-job training with related instruction. The United States has low utilization of apprenticeship compared to other developed nations, leading to increased interest in expanding these programs. The primary federal mechanism for supporting apprenticeships in the US is registering compliant programs. The federal government supports apprenticeships by registering programs that meet standards set by the Department of Labor (DOL). DOL has provided grants to states and intermediaries to expand apprenticeship opportunities. The National Apprenticeship Act of 1937 directs DOL to promote labor standards for apprenticeships. The National Apprenticeship Act directs the Department of Labor to promote labor standards for apprenticeships. The Office of Apprenticeship within DOL registers programs that meet federal and/or state standards, issuing certificates of completion to apprentices. Registration does not entitle sponsors to financial support. Registered apprenticeship programs, approved for GI Bill support and federal workforce funds, may not always receive federal funds. Unregistered programs similar to apprenticeships are not typically recognized by the federal government. Registered apprenticeships are certified programs that comply with standards set by a registration agency. States can establish a state apprenticeship agency (SAA) to register programs, which must be approved by the federal DOL. The SAA's recognition is valid for five years, with DOL monitoring the agency. The Department of Labor (DOL) monitors State Apprenticeship Agencies (SAAs) to ensure compliance with regulations. SAAs must be renewed every five years, with technical assistance provided for nonconformities. Currently, 25 states operate SAAs, while 25 states register programs through DOL. Pre-apprenticeship programs prepare individuals for registered apprenticeships and can offer instruction in various fields. DOL does not regulate pre-apprenticeship programs but has issued guidance on quality standards. A quality pre-apprenticeship program should facilitate entry into a registered apprenticeship program by submitting an application to the registration body. Assistance in program development and registration applications can be sought from registration agencies or industry groups. Regulations specify that occupations taught through apprenticeships must involve skills learned in a practical, structured manner. A quality pre-apprenticeship program should facilitate entry into a registered apprenticeship program by submitting an application to the registration body. Skills learned in a practical, structured manner through on-the-job supervised learning are essential for apprenticeships. DOL maintains a list of over 1,300 apprenticeable occupations, and sponsors have options in designing apprenticeship programs. Regulations establish three general frameworks for programs based on skill attainment through on-the-job training hours. The apprenticeship program requires completion of at least 2,000 hours of on-the-job training. Skill attainment is measured through demonstrated competencies verified by the sponsor. The program must have a written plan outlining the work process schedule and terms of the apprenticeship. Regulations specify components that apprenticeship sponsors' standards must address, including work processes, related instruction, and wage progression. Minimum 144 hours of instruction per year is recommended, with progressively increasing wages for apprentices. Adequate and safe equipment must be assured. The curr_chunk outlines additional standards for apprenticeship programs, including safety training, probationary periods, complaint procedures, administrative requirements, and the process for program approval. The registration agency reviews apprenticeship programs for compliance with regulations, may grant permanent registration or provisional approval, and can recommend deregistration if non-compliant. Programs must be reviewed at least once every five years. Evaluation factors include quality assurance assessments, EEO compliance reviews, and completion rates. The registration agency evaluates apprenticeship programs for compliance with regulations, including completion rates. Programs with low completion rates may receive technical assistance, and persistent low rates could lead to deregistration. Deregistration may occur if a program consistently fails to meet standards or perform successfully. The registration agency evaluates apprenticeship programs for compliance with regulations, including completion rates. Programs with low completion rates may receive technical assistance, and persistent low rates could lead to deregistration if improvements are not made despite assistance. If a program fails to demonstrate required corrections within a specified timeframe, deregistration proceedings may be initiated, with the sponsor having the option to request a hearing with an administrative law judge. When a sponsor requests a hearing for deregistration, the administrator of the Office of Apprenticeship makes the final decision. Sponsors can work with intermediaries like public agencies, private nonprofits, unions, or industry groups to develop and register apprenticeship programs. Intermediaries help with program construction, connecting with instruction providers, and applying to registration agencies. In some cases, intermediaries can develop, register, and manage programs. An intermediary can develop and register apprenticeship programs for individual employers, like the American Hotel and Lodging Association did for lodging managers. Employers agree to the program's standards and are responsible for recruiting apprentices and implementing the program. Members of the Armed Forces can also participate in registered apprenticeship programs while on active duty. USMAP participants can complete apprenticeship requirements through military duties. DOL registers military apprenticeships similar to civilian employers. Completion results in a DOL certificate, recognized by civilian employers. Apprenticeships must relate to the individual's military specialty. For example, a Navy utilitiesman can choose from six different apprenticeship options. Table 1 shows registered apprenticeships from FY2013 to FY2017. The table displays registered apprenticeships from FY2013 to FY2017, including active, new, and completer apprentices. Data should not be used to calculate annual completion percentages due to the multiyear nature of most programs. Some data is limited to programs registered with DOL. Table 2 is limited to federally registered apprentices. In FY2017, 68% of active apprentices were in the construction industry. Efforts have been made to expand the federal role in supporting apprenticeships, including competitive grants and a 2017 Executive Order. The federal government has supplemented registration and technical support with competitive grants from multiple funding streams. In the past three fiscal years, Congress has allocated funds to DOL for apprenticeship programs through competitive grants. Appropriations were $90 million in FY2016, $95 million in FY2017, and $145 million in FY2018. These grants have supported State Expansion Grants and National Industry efforts. In September 2016, grants totaling $50.5 million were awarded to nongovernment organizations to expand apprenticeship in specific industries and populations. Another set of grants totaling $20.4 million was awarded to support training programs for high-skill immigrants under H-1B visas. The funds must be used for training in high growth industries and economic sectors. The Department of Labor (DOL) used $175 million from H-1B training funds for American Apprenticeship Initiative Grants in 2015. The Trump Administration showed interest in using these funds for apprenticeship activities but had not solicited any grants. President Trump's Executive Order 13801 in June 2017 emphasized promoting apprenticeships as a cost-effective workforce development strategy. The Executive Order directed the Secretary of Labor to consider proposing regulations to modify the registration process for apprenticeship programs, allowing for expedited registration for programs recognized by a qualified third party. It also encouraged federal agencies to promote apprenticeships as a workforce development strategy and established a task force to identify promotion strategies. DOL is to use funding to promote apprenticeships, subject to available appropriations and applicable law. The Executive Order directed the Department of Labor to use funding to promote apprenticeships, with specific mention of funding from H-1B visa fees. A Department of Commerce report in November 2016 provided case studies of existing apprenticeship programs in various industries, highlighting substantial employer investments in apprentices. Employer investments in apprentices are substantial, with costs ranging from $25,000 to $250,000 per apprentice. The major cost for programs was apprentice wages, with additional costs for start-up, tuition, staff time, and overhead. Companies were generally satisfied with their programs, unanimous in their support of apprenticeships, and poaching of apprentices was not a major issue. Some firms reduced cost risks of poaching by developing apprenticeship programs in consortia with similar employers. Programs were competitive, selecting 10-15% of applicants. Federal funding streams can support apprenticeship or human capital development. Administering departments have issued guidance on utilizing funds for apprenticeship. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) provides federal funding to state workforce agencies for job training and career services, administered by Workforce Development Boards (WDBs). WDBs can use WIOA funds to support apprenticeship, such as reimbursing sponsors for apprentice wages and providing training. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) allows funds to be used for apprenticeship program expenses, integrates local registered apprenticeship programs into state workforce systems, and ensures representation on state and local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs). Registered apprenticeship programs are automatically eligible for WIOA funding. GI Bill benefits can be used for approved apprenticeships by eligible individuals, including former members of the Armed Forces. Veterans using the Post-9/11 GI Bill for apprenticeships qualify for a housing allowance that decreases over time. They also receive a books and supplies stipend if pursuing apprenticeship more than half-time. Veterans using the Post-9/11 GI Bill for apprenticeships may use their benefits to cover tuition and fees for related instruction. Individual apprentices may also access federal student aid funds like Pell Grants or subsidized loans if the apprenticeship is eligible for federal student aid. Registration of an apprenticeship program does not guarantee eligibility for federal student aid, and some unregistered programs may still qualify. Eligible apprenticeship programs must lead to a degree to qualify for federal student aid. To be eligible for federal student aid, apprenticeship programs must lead to a recognized credential, be provided by an eligible institution, and meet program length requirements. Financial criteria must also be met for need-based aid. The on-the-job training portion of an apprenticeship can be eligible for aid if it is for qualified credit from an eligible institution. There are no federal limits on the percentage of on-the-job training in a program. On-the-job training for apprenticeship programs must be provided by an eligible institution of higher education to qualify for federal student aid. Federal Work Study funding can be used to cover a portion of an apprentice's wages during on-the-job training, even if it is not part of the student's educational program."
