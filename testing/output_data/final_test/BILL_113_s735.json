    "content": "The \"Survivor Benefits Improvement Act of 2013\" extends the initial period for increased dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses with children from two years to five years. It also allows surviving spouses who remarry after age 55 to remain eligible for benefits such as dependency and indemnity compensation, health care, and housing loans. Additionally, the Act provides benefits for children of certain Thailand service veterans born with spina bifida. Benefits for children of certain Thailand service veterans born with spina bifida include health care, vocational training, rehabilitation, and monetary allowance similar to those provided to children of Vietnam veterans with spina bifida. The coverage extends to all forms of spina bifida except spina bifida occulta. For veterans of covered service in Thailand, the definition includes individuals who served in Thailand from January 9, 1962, to May 7, 1975, and were exposed to herbicide agents. The term \"herbicide agent\" refers to chemicals used in herbicides during military operations in Thailand. During the period from January 9, 1962, to May 7, 1975, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, made amendments related to veterans who served in Thailand. This included adding \"AND THAILAND\" to the subchapter heading and updating the table of sections in chapter 18 of the title. The text introduces benefits for children of certain Thailand service veterans born with spina bifida and a pilot program on grief counseling in retreat settings for surviving spouses of veterans who die while serving on active duty in the armed forces. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a pilot program providing grief counseling services in group retreat settings to surviving spouses of veterans who die while serving on active duty. Participation in the program is optional for the surviving spouse and services will include information and counseling on coping with grief. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a pilot program providing grief counseling services to surviving spouses of veterans who die while serving on active duty.
