    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility Safe Closure Act of 2009\". The Senate findings state that Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is crucial for holding high-security risk individuals, providing maximum security, multiple levels of confinement, and valuable human intelligence in the war on terror. New intelligence collected from detainees at GTMO is crucial in the fight against terrorism, providing valuable information on terrorist organizations, their presence in different regions, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, recruitment methods, and operative training. The Expeditionary Legal Complex (ELC) at GTMO is unique, providing a secure location for detainee trials, access to classified information, defense lawyers, prosecution, and media. There are two lawyers for every charged detainee and 127 medical staff for detainee healthcare. Since 2002, over 520 detainees have left Guantanamo for other countries, with a ratio of one health care professional for every two detainees. GTMO is operated by the Department of Defense, using only approved interrogation techniques. Detainees are treated humanely, with no solitary confinement or waterboarding. Current treatment and oversight exceed maximum-security prisons worldwide. Approximately 245 detainees from over 30 countries remain at GTMO, including terrorist trainers, financiers, bomb makers, and recruiters. They fall into three categories: those cleared for release but with no country willing to accept them, those tried or awaiting trial, and high-threat detainees. The Pentagon claims that 61 released GTMO detainees have returned to the fight. Said Ali al-Shihri, involved in the bombing of the US Embassy in Yemen, was released to Saudi Arabia, went through a rehabilitation program, and is now the deputy leader of al-Qaida in Yemen. In 2007, the Senate passed a resolution stating that Guantanamo detainees should not be released into American society or transferred to facilities in American communities. President Obama ordered the closing of GTMO prisons within a year, but the US is still in a global war on terror and will likely continue to detain terrorists in another facility if GTMO is closed. SEC. 3 prohibits the use of funds to transfer detainees from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to any facility in the United States or its territories, construct facilities for such detainees in the US, or house detainees in the US."
