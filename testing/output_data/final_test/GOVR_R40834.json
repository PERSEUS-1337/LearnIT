    "content": "In March 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 to reform the U.S. health care system. President Obama signed these measures into law in March. Other health reform proposals were also introduced by Senators and Representatives. The Judiciary Committee reported out the Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2009 (H.R. 3596) to limit antitrust exemptions under the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The House passed the Health Insurance Industry Fair Competition Act (H.R. 4626) to enable more robust antitrust enforcement. Rising health care costs in the U.S. strain state and federal budgets, with 46.3 million Americans lacking health insurance coverage. Major policy changes are needed to address future cost growth and access issues. Health insurance markets are highly concentrated, with one insurer often dominating over 50% of the market. This concentration raises concerns about the cost, quality, and availability of health care. Some argue that market concentration has led to higher health care prices, limiting access to affordable health insurance and care. Some argue that higher health care prices due to market concentration make health care less affordable and accessible for families. Strong bargaining leverage of health insurers may help lower premiums for consumers. Competition among insurers has influenced market strategies, with economies of scale and regulations contributing to market concentration. The Obama Administration prioritized reforming the health insurance and health care system. The Obama Administration made reform of the American health insurance and health care system a top policy priority with the PPACA. The goal is to broaden access to health care by increasing insurance coverage, lowering costs, providing incentives for individuals to acquire insurance, and restructuring the market. Some analysts question if the measures in the PPACA will effectively slow the growth of health care costs, suggesting a more fundamental reform may be needed. The report discusses the evolution and characteristics of the health insurance industry in the U.S., including market concentration and profitability measures. It also analyzes options for Congress regarding the industry, highlighting its origins in the 1930s and subsequent evolution. In the late 19th century, individual accident insurance and workplace health benefits began to be offered by private insurers, railroad, mining, and timber firms. Burial and sickness policies became popular in the 1890s, with the development of group accident and health plans. Workers in industrialized urban centers sought insurance due to occupational risks and lack of support from family networks. Many obtained policies through fraternal organizations, labor unions, or private insurers. Around one-third of male industrial workers in World-War-I-era had some form of accident, health, or burial insurance. The modern health insurance industry in the United States was influenced by the Progressive-era push for compulsory social insurance and the onset of the Great Depression. In 1929, Baylor University Hospital in Dallas created a pre-paid hospitalization benefit plan for school teachers to address the burden of unpaid bills on hospital finances and teachers. Unlike earlier policies, subscribers were entitled to hospital benefits. The Baylor Plan, created by Baylor University Hospital in Dallas in 1929, offered subscribers hospital care and services instead of cash indemnity. It did not cover physician bills but improved enrollees' ability to pay those charges. The plan was soon extended to other groups, leading to the creation of similar group hospitalization plans in other cities like Sacramento, St. Paul, Washington, DC, and Cleveland. The Blue Cross emblem, first used by the St. Paul plan, became widely adopted by other prepaid hospital benefit plans. The Blue Cross symbol was widely adopted by prepaid hospital benefit plans following AHA guidelines in 1933. Plans emphasized public welfare, limited benefits to hospital charges, and operated as non-profits. By 1939, 25 states had legislation for hospitalization plans, with Blue Cross plans considered charitable organizations exempt from certain regulations and taxes. The health insurance market in the United States initially avoided competition among providers by tying benefits to single sponsoring hospitals. Joint plans with free choice of physicians and hospitals were favored over individual hospital plans to prevent price competition. The American Hospital Association supported joint plans to ensure economic stability for community hospitals. In 1937, the AHA mandated Blue Cross plans to have certain requirements. In 1937, the AHA required Blue Cross plans to have exclusive territories to prevent competition. Critics of competition in health care and insurance believed it led to wage cuts and market instability during the Great Depression. Reducing competition during that time was thought to hinder economic recovery, but competition in health insurance markets poses unique challenges. During World War II, Blue Cross plans expanded rapidly across states, with some resistance from medical societies and state laws. Employers used health insurance as a tool to attract new workers amidst wartime wage and price controls. In the late 1940s, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) sued employers for not bargaining collectively over fringe benefits, leading to unions negotiating health insurance. Before 1954, health insurance benefits were not excluded from federal income taxation. The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 introduced Section 106, excluding employer contributions for health insurance from taxable income, making health insurance cheaper for individuals. The tax exclusion in 1954 made health insurance cheaper for individuals, leading to rapid expansion among higher-income employees. Other factors like rising income levels and competition for workers also contributed to the growth of employer-provided health benefits. Insurers traditionally only considered insurable risks that were definite and measurable, but the judgment of medical personnel and insured behavior could affect the financial risks linked to illness or injury. The entry of commercial insurers into the health insurance market in the 1950s changed the competitive environment by challenging Blue Cross organizations and introducing different premium-setting practices. The entry of commercial insurers in the 1950s challenged Blue Cross organizations by introducing an \"experience rating\" approach, allowing them to underbid Blue Cross for firms with healthier-than-average individuals. This led to a loss of healthier groups for Blue Cross, raising average costs and hindering their ability to compete on price. The shift towards experience rating changed the nature of competition in the health insurance market, as insurers focused on recruiting healthier groups rather than managing risks efficiently. In the late 1950s, health insurance benefits became common in compensation packages. Congress established the Federal Employees' Health Benefit Plan in 1959, providing Blue Cross and Blue Shield benefits to federal workers. Rising hospital costs led to premium increases by Blue Cross affiliates, causing public concern and resistance from state insurance regulators. In the mid-1960s, Blue Cross affiliates and voluntary hospitals pushed for certificate of need (CON) regulations to avoid stricter cost control measures and limit entry to new hospitals. Low-income and elderly individuals faced challenges in obtaining affordable health insurance and paying for healthcare. Federal aid was provided by Congress in the 1950s to help cover healthcare costs for these groups, with Social Security extended to pay for certain medical expenses for aged, blind, and disabled beneficiaries. The Kerr-Mills Act of 1960 paved the way for Medicaid, supporting state programs for the healthcare of the elderly, blind, disabled, and low-income individuals. The Kerr-Mills Act of 1960 paved the way for Medicaid, supporting state programs for the healthcare of the elderly, blind, disabled, and low-income individuals. In 1965, the Johnson Administration worked with Ways and Means Committee Chairman Wilbur Mills to create the Medicare program, providing health insurance for nearly all Americans over age 65. Medicare combined a compulsory hospital insurance program (Part A) with a voluntary physician services plan (Part B), with Blue Cross organizations serving as fiscal intermediaries for Medicare. Private health insurance companies play a significant role in federal health programs, including Medicare Advantage (Part C), prescription drug benefit plans (Part D), and CHIP. Plans combining insurance with direct health care provision, like the Kaiser Health Plan, have become important players in local markets despite opposition from the AHA and AMA. In the mid-1930s, California construction workers formed the Kaiser Health Plan, which evolved from group practices and clinics established in the 1920s and 1930s. Health care cooperatives emerged in the 1930s and 1940s, but national reach was not achieved until the 1970s. President Nixon's 1971 program promoted prepaid group plans to control rising medical care costs. Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) integrated health care and insurance functions to incentivize wellness and reduce unnecessary care. The Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 aimed to expand the number of HMOs to provide greater access to healthcare. Managed care organizations like HMOs became a key strategy for controlling healthcare costs in the late 1980s. Consumer resistance in the mid-1990s led to a retreat from more restrictive managed care strategies. Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) grew rapidly in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, offering discounted fee-for-service rates through contracts with insurers or self-insured firms. PPO plans provided more flexibility than staff-model HMOs, allowing enrollees to receive care outside the network with plan approval or additional costs. Employers began offering choices among competing health plans, allowing workers to avoid restrictive plans by paying higher premiums. The differences between non-profit Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurers and for-profit commercial health insurers were seen to have narrowed by the 1980s. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 removed Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans' tax exemption, citing that their insurance activities were commercial rather than charitable. Despite this, some tax advantages were retained to reflect their provision of community-rated health insurance. In the 1990s, many health insurers faced financial challenges, with Blue Cross/Blue Shield of West Virginia going bankrupt. In the 1990s, Blue Cross/Blue Shield affiliates faced financial difficulties, leading to bankruptcies and reorganizations as for-profit insurers. This resulted in consolidations within the industry, with some insurers acquiring HMOs and other managed care organizations. Anthem acquired multiple Blue Cross/Blue Shield affiliates, strengthening its market position across several states. In 2004, Anthem acquired WellPoint Inc., which had Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans in California, Georgia, and New York. By 2008, the top 30 health insurers had a total of 168.2 million enrollees. Legislation in the 1990s introduced Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) for high-deductible health insurance plans to cover out-of-pocket expenses. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are tax-advantaged medical savings accounts that cover out-of-pocket expenses for high-deductible health insurance plans. These plans had 8 million consumers by early 2009. Health insurance pools risks among individuals to distribute the financial burden of medical care. Insured individuals pay premiums to receive benefits in case of adverse events, with insurers assuming the bulk of financial risks associated with unpredictable health outcomes. The health insurance market involves pooling medical expenses through premiums, shifting money from healthy to sick individuals. Health insurers act as intermediaries, reimbursing providers and controlling services covered. Most plans are managed care (HMOs, PPOs) rather than traditional indemnity plans. The health insurance market involves various parties like employers, governments, and providers. It is not a perfectly competitive market due to its features. In competitive markets, efficiency is achieved when the social cost equals the social benefit of the last unit sold. Key conditions for market efficiency include many buyers and sellers, no spillover effects, free entry and exit, symmetric information, no transaction costs, and profit maximization for firms and well-being maximization for consumers. Reforms in the health insurance market are crucial as most conditions for market efficiency are not met. Departures from these conditions can lead to inefficient outcomes. Lack of symmetric information is a significant issue in this market, with consumers relying heavily on intermediaries for specialized knowledge. This setup can limit consumer choice and impact the quality of healthcare. Health insurers play a significant role in making health care payments, with national health expenditures increasing since 1960. Consumer out-of-pocket spending has grown slightly slower than the U.S. economy, while health expenditures from other sources have grown faster. Insurers' design of health care networks influences how consumers use health care, with consumers typically choosing a primary physician for tests, treatments, and referrals to specialists. Employers and labor unions negotiate with insurers for health benefits on behalf of their workers. Health care consumers rely on intermediaries like employers, insurers, and physicians to navigate the health care system. This heavy reliance on intermediaries is a key characteristic of the current health care market, where consumers benefit from specialized expertise and bargaining power. Patients rely on intermediaries like physicians and health insurers to navigate the complex U.S. healthcare system, which includes a diverse array of healthcare providers. Intermediaries protect consumers from financial risks but also shield them from information about costs. Third-party payers may lead to increased demand for care and supply from providers. Health care costs can limit consumers' choices, with job restrictions on insurance options and physician choices affecting hospital options. Those without intermediaries face challenges navigating the system, leading to higher prices for care and lack of bargaining power. Individuals paying out-of-pocket are charged more than insurers. Tax advantages for employer-sponsored plans do not benefit those in the individual market. Intermediaries play a crucial role in the health care market, influencing efficiency, cost control, and service quality. Demand for health insurance is influenced by various factors such as risk attitudes, medical expenses variability, coverage effectiveness, income, and premium levels. Politicians, employers, and health insurers act as intermediaries, impacting insurance benefits packages and regulatory environments. The effectiveness of health care covered by insurance is influenced by income and premium levels. An insurance policy includes premiums, medical services covered, and cost sharing. The insurance premium is determined by the expected benefits the company will pay out, which is the average price of medical care multiplied by the average quantity of care provided, plus a loading fee for administrative expenses and profits. The loading fee affects demand for insurance coverage. The average price of medical care depends on service complexity, bargaining power of providers and insurers, and provider cost structure. The average quantity depends on consumer demand, provider willingness to supply care, and insurer managed care controls. The size of the load factor depends on insurers' administrative costs, costs of capital, and ability to pass along higher premiums. Providers gain when medical care prices are higher and quantities are higher. Consumers benefit when quantities are higher and prices are lower. Higher cost-sharing rates and managed care requirements may lead to higher out-of-pocket costs but lower premiums. Insurers gain when the load factor and cost-sharing rates rise. Cost-sharing rates rise in response to competitive pressure, leading insurers to lower load factor, prices, and quantities. Employer-sponsored health insurance covers the majority of the nonelderly U.S. population, with employers passing their share of the financial burden onto employees. Information asymmetry in markets can result in inefficient outcomes. Insurance analysts focus on information asymmetry in insurance markets, including adverse selection and moral hazard. Principal-agent problems can create inefficiencies due to asymmetries between consumers and intermediaries. In the health insurance market, buyers may have more knowledge about individual health risks than insurers, leading to challenges in distinguishing between healthy and less healthy applicants. This can result in insurers offering plans that may not break even if covering a representative sample of buyers. Adverse selection in health insurance markets can lead to insurers offering plans that may bankrupt them if attracting high-risk individuals. This problem can result in high premiums, driving healthier buyers out of the market. Employer-sponsored health insurance plans often pass costs to employees through lower wages. Group plans attract healthy individuals, reducing adverse selection but making employees less cost-sensitive. Self-insurance by firms may raise new adverse selection issues. Risk-rated premiums charge different rates based on health risk factors, unlike group plans. Without adjusting premiums for individual characteristics, risk pools can splinter, leading to adverse selection death spirals. If older, sicker individuals dominate the pool, rates will increase due to higher costs. The increase in rates due to higher costs may cause younger, healthier individuals to drop coverage, leading to a potential adverse selection death spiral. Concerns have been raised about the availability and affordability of coverage for those without employer-sponsored or public insurance. Individual mandates could help mitigate adverse selection risks for those without employer-sponsored or public insurance. Insurers face losses if uninsured individuals enroll once they anticipate adverse events, leading to limited open enrollment seasons and preexisting condition limits in some group health insurance plans. In the individual health insurance market, lack of guaranteed renewal at average-risk rates can limit effective risk pooling and incentivize insurers to make long-term investments in individuals' health. Moral hazard, where insurance status changes behavior, is another issue, leading to increased medical services consumption and potential neglect of health. Moral hazard in health insurance leads to increased medical services consumption and potential neglect of health. Insurers react by raising premiums and limiting care through cost-sharing measures. Lack of transparency in pricing of medical services exacerbates the issue. The cost of medical services and the potential conflicts of interest between patients and healthcare providers are addressed through payment and incentive systems, professional standards, and licensing. The use of intermediaries with specialized knowledge can make it challenging for patients to evaluate the quality of care received. Fixed fees and professional standards aim to address the principal-agent problem between patients and physicians, but may not fully solve issues. Fee-for-service arrangements can lead to overprovision of care due to financial incentives. A study comparing salary and fee-for-service doctors found that the latter scheduled more office visits, particularly for well patients. Defensive medicine, ordering unnecessary tests, can also contribute to increased costs in healthcare. Defensive medicine, where providers order tests to reduce malpractice risk but offer limited therapeutic benefits, is a concern. Health insurers use coinsurance and pre-approval to address moral hazard among patients. Managed care in the 1990s aimed to control costs due to moral hazard. R&D decisions by medical firms may be influenced by health insurance coverage. Reforms are needed to address these issues in the health financing system. Health insurance coverage impacts provider and patient choices. Reforms in the health financing system must consider potential moral hazards to avoid unforeseen issues. Understanding how price affects demand for health insurance is crucial, especially with current tax subsidies and proposed changes. Price sensitivity, measured by price elasticity, shows that a 1% increase in price could lead to a 1% to 2% decrease in people buying health insurance. Recent studies have found that a small price reduction could lead to moderately large increases in health insurance coverage. Elasticities range from 0.0 to -0.4, with a 1% increase in price resulting in a 0% to 0.4% reduction in participation in health insurance. Subsidies alone may not be sufficient to increase coverage. Health insurance is subsidized through the tax system in various ways, including employer-paid premiums being tax-exempt for workers and self-employed individuals being able to deduct health insurance costs. The federal government forgoes about $230 billion annually in tax revenue due to these exclusions. Targeting health insurance subsidies to employees not offered health insurance is challenging and could increase public costs. Health insurers bear risks by pooling contributions to health savings accounts, resulting in a $500 million revenue loss in 2008. The law of large numbers states that insurance risk decreases as the number of people in the insured pool increases, with experts recommending a minimum pool size of 25,000 policies to ensure financial stability. Insurance companies pool funds from about 50,000 individuals to cover expenses and stabilize funds. Premiums in individual and small-group markets are higher due to expense variability and adverse selection risks. Administrative tasks include underwriting, claims processing, provider payments, and negotiations. Costs are covered by loading fees in premiums, with returns earned on investments. Premiums are collected at the policy start, while claims are paid out. The predominant type of health insurance plan has shifted from traditional indemnity plans to managed care plans over the past 25 years. Managed care involves vertical integration between health insurers and providers, with options ranging from managed indemnity plans to staff HMOs. Premiums are collected at the beginning of the policy period, while claims are paid out throughout or after the period, with insurance companies investing premiums until needed. Health insurers, including commercial insurance firms, Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans, and HMO-type organizations like Kaiser Permanente, offer administrative service only (ASO) support to self-insured plans. Non-profit health insurers may have limited tax advantages and face less state regulation compared to for-profit companies. The \"Blues\" (Blue Cross/Blue Shield) are prominent in the industry. Non-profit health insurers like Blue Cross/Blue Shield may have limited tax advantages and face less state regulation compared to for-profit companies. Blue Cross/Blue Shield organizations have been allowed to convert to for-profit status since 1994. Employers that self-insure take on some or all of the functions of an insurance company, such as bearing risk and paying claims. Self-insuring employers mostly contract with established insurance companies for administrative services. Large multi-state firms that self-insure benefit from preempting state regulation and establishing federal standards, ensuring consistent employee benefits across all states. For-profit insurers dominate the health insurance market, offering a variety of plans tailored for different firms. These insurers operate nationwide and aim to maximize profits for their shareholders. Employer-sponsored health insurance is common, with employers negotiating prices with insurance companies and bearing no insurance risk. Employer-sponsored health insurance allows companies to negotiate prices with insurers and choose to self-insure, bearing all insurance risk. Large employers often opt for self-insurance, while small firms typically offer only one plan. Very large firms provide multiple plan choices to employees, leading to higher levels of employer-sponsored health coverage. The employer's health insurance decisions are fairly unresponsive to price, with evidence suggesting that plan choice is associated with higher levels of employer-sponsored health coverage and health care satisfaction. Health insurance premiums have increased significantly over the past nine years, with employer contributions rising by 83% between 1999 and 2008. Regulation at the state level, along with federal standards, aims to promote various social goals and assure the financial solvency of insurance. The state and federal regulations aim to promote social goals, ensure insurance solvency, and protect consumers. Large employers self-insuring are exempt from some state regulations under ERISA, but still subject to state laws for insurance-related issues. Federal standards were established through legislation like COBRA and HIPAA. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) improved access to health insurance by restricting exclusions for pre-existing conditions and prohibiting discrimination. However, it does not guarantee policy renewal at reflective rates, limiting its effectiveness. HIPAA helps with insurance continuity when transitioning from group to individual coverage but does not cover all transitions. The health insurance market is highly concentrated in the US, potentially leading to distorted prices and inefficiencies. When firms have market power in product markets, they raise prices and reduce output, leading to inefficient coverage. Market power in buying from suppliers can lower payments and output. Profitability depends on interactions with consumers and suppliers. Market concentration measures show the potential for firms to distort prices and reduce efficiency. Market concentration measures the potential for firms to exercise market power by raising prices. It is typically assessed through market share analysis, but factors like brand strength and potential entry of new firms can also impact market power. Common measures include N-firm concentration ratios and the Hirschman-Herfindahl index (HHI) based on market shares of competing firms in a specific geographic area. The Hirschman-Herfindahl index (HHI) is a measure of market concentration calculated by summing the squares of the percentage market share of all firms in a market. A higher HHI indicates a greater degree of market concentration and is commonly used in antitrust and merger analysis. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) incorporated the HHI into its horizontal merger guidelines in 1982, which include requirements for defining product and geographic markets. The merger guidelines, revised multiple times since 1982, specify HHI thresholds to determine opposition likelihood for corporate mergers. Markets are categorized as unconcentrated, moderately concentrated, or highly concentrated based on HHI levels. Mergers in unconcentrated or moderately concentrated markets are unlikely to face federal opposition unless they significantly raise the HHI. Industrial organization economists argue that market structure and consumer service can be influenced by economies of scale and scope. Leading firms with superior management or technology can lead to high market concentration, which may benefit consumers. The 1982 merger guidelines emphasized efficiency defenses in antitrust policy, recognizing that market concentration can result from economic efficiency or anticompetitive strategies. Concentration measures are influenced by how a market is defined in terms of product lines and geographic area. Market concentration can be influenced by how a market is defined in terms of product lines and geographic area. A broader market definition including more products or a larger geographic area can result in lower measured market concentration. For example, Coca Cola argued that the relevant market should include all beverages and extend throughout the United States, resulting in lower market concentration compared to a definition focusing only on carbonated soft drinks in local areas. Defining markets by product category and geographic area can impact market concentration measures. Market concentration is crucially defined by product category and geographic area to reflect consumer alternatives. Health insurance markets are highly concentrated, with most metropolitan areas showing high concentration levels in 2007. The Government Accountability Office also found high concentration in small group health insurance markets in 2004. These findings are based on AMA market share statistics for commercial health insurance. The AMA report calculates concentration statistics for the HMO market, the PPO market, and the combined HMO and PPO market based on commercial health insurance data. Differences between HMO and PPO plans have blurred over the last two decades, leading to confusion among consumers about the type of plan they have. The distinction between HMO and PPO plans has blurred, causing confusion among consumers. Many large employers are shifting to self-insured plans in response to rising premiums. Market share data may overstate insurers' effective market shares if the market for administrative services to self-insured firms is more competitive. Large health insurers hold the bulk of administrative service only contracts with self-insured firms, with lower profit margins compared to standard commercial health plans. Market share data collected on the consumer side of the health insurance market may not accurately reflect factors affecting insurers' market power. Health care providers and insurers are involved in public insurance programs like Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. Market concentration measures based on consumer shares may underestimate supply side competitiveness. Market concentration on the supply side may not always lead to the ability to raise prices or lower output due to various factors. Concentration measures may overlook consumer alternatives and potential entrants can limit price increases. Firms in concentrated industries may choose not to exercise market power for other reasons, such as organizational goals. Some argue that non-profit health insurers may not exercise market power like for-profit insurers. The debate continues on whether market concentration enables firms to increase profitability through pricing power, despite concerns about reduced economic efficiency. Several recent studies have examined the effects of market concentration in the health insurance market. One study found evidence that private health insurers charge higher premiums to more profitable firms, indicating market power. Increased market concentration led to a 2% average increase in premiums between 1998 and 2006. Additionally, higher market concentration was associated with lower job and earnings growth for physicians, but higher growth for nurses. The exertion of insurer market power affects various provider types differently. Hospitals in concentrated health insurance markets provide more inpatient days of service, showing enhanced provider efficiency. Some insurers use high physician reimbursement rates to deter potential rivals. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan was accused of using most-favored-nation clauses to prevent hospital competition. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan and some providers allegedly coordinated to exclude insurgent providers offering lower cost services. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan denies violating antitrust laws with most-favored-nation clauses. Market concentration in the 1960s and 1970s influenced firm behavior, pricing, output policies, and industry performance. Market concentration in industries can lead to higher prices and profits, lower output levels, and reduced product quality. Economists studying market structures focus on factors like economies of scale and competition intensity. Larger firms in industries with strong economies of scale tend to dominate due to cost advantages. Regulation and barriers to entry also play a role in shaping market structures. Market concentration in the health insurance market is influenced by historical elements and policies that aimed to avoid competition and splintering of risk pools. Factors such as exclusive territories and community rating policies have contributed to the highly concentrated market structures. Regulatory decisions have also played a role in promoting market concentration. The health insurance market has seen higher levels of market concentration due to commercial insurers and managed care strategies. Mergers and acquisitions have reshaped the market, with some insurers using them to enhance their market power. Factors like employment-based health benefits, market structure of healthcare providers, state and federal regulations, and federal government programs like Medicare and Medicaid have all influenced the market. Federal antitrust policy has also had an impact on the market. During the 1980s and 1990s, managed care transformed the American health care system by controlling rising health care costs. Traditional insurers faced challenges in implementing managed care techniques, affecting the private health insurance market. Federal antitrust policy has influenced market structure in various industries, including health care and health insurance markets. Analyzing factors promoting market concentration is crucial for assessing the consequences of proposed health insurance industry reforms. Some insurers struggled with implementing managed care successfully, leading to acquisitions or mergers with health maintenance organizations. Market concentration among health insurers may be influenced by hospitals and other providers seeking bargaining power. Many hospitals formed exclusive networks to increase bargaining power in negotiations with insurers, inspired by the success of hospital chain Columbia/HCA. Mergers were seen as a way to eliminate excess capacity, while physicians also formed groups to enhance their bargaining strength. The introduction of Medicare's IPPS and similar systems by private insurers in the early 1990s led to reduced hospital lengths of stays and occupancy rates. Increasing market concentration or strategic coordination among providers and insurers may lead to resource misallocation and reduced health access. Economies of scale in health insurance can impact cost efficiency and market competition. Some industry analysts suggest that there is little relation between the size of major health insurers and administrative costs, indicating that economies of scale in administrative functions play a minimal role in market concentration. Experts believe a financially sound insurer would need a risk pool with about 25,000 policies covering 50,000 people, with actuarial gains tapering off above that point. This suggests that the health insurance industry may lack economies of scale above a certain minimum point, potentially impacting the effectiveness of a public option in reducing administrative costs. Some economists and financial analysts believe that firms in industries without scale economies may grow due to managerial benefits rather than efficiency. Weak corporate governance can drive corporate growth by focusing on benefits for managers. Marketing strategies affecting customer loyalty can impact market structure and concentration by hindering entry of rivals or changing competition dynamics. Marketing plays a significant role in the health insurance market, with the Blue Cross emblem serving as a potent marketing tool. Insurers invest heavily in advertising and marketing strategies to attract consumers and compete with rivals. In 2007, commercial health plans spent 4.6% of total premium revenues on marketing, while ASO plans only spent 1.0%. Marketing efforts are also directed towards employers' human resources departments to help them choose among insurers. In the health insurance market, marketing is crucial for attracting consumers and competing with rivals. Insurers target employers' human resources departments to select plans, which can be cheaper than marketing to individuals. Competition in the market is influenced by how insurers compete for both employers and employees. Consumers have the option to compare plans through websites like eHealthInsurance.com, but comparing plans can be challenging due to potential omissions of important details in plan brochures. Health insurance competition can be hindered by the difficulty in comparing plans, lack of important policy details, and reluctance of employers to switch insurers. Some insurers engage in aggressive price competition during underwriting cycles. Some health insurance executives in 2004 suggested that better cost monitoring techniques and market consolidation could help insurers align medical cost increases with premium growth, reducing sharp price competition and large swings in premiums. Rising premiums are attributed to the growth of medical and health care costs, which make up the majority of health insurance premium income. Many economists believe that the extent of health insurance coverage has led to increased health care services and higher prices over time. The portion of health insurance premiums not paid out as claims, known as loading costs, includes administrative expenses, taxes, and profits. Health insurers earn profits from the difference between premiums and claims paid, as well as from investment income generated by the lag between premium payments and claims. This lag allows insurers to invest funds until claims are paid, resulting in shorter lag times for health insurers compared to other insurance lines. Health insurers have shorter lag times compared to other insurance lines. Some insurers faced investment income declines in 2007 and 2008 due to lower interest rates and economic recession. Profitability data for those years may be atypical. Insurers participate in various health insurance segments, with Medicare Advantage playing a significant role in profitability. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has calculated that Medicare Advantage (MA) plan costs are 18% higher than traditional fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare plan costs due to healthier MA enrollees. Generous reimbursement policies have encouraged insurers to increase MA enrollments. Research shows that high market concentration in health insurance markets can lead to higher premiums, but the impact on premium growth rates from HMO mergers varies. More empirical research is needed to explore the relationship between health insurance market concentration and economic outcomes. Financial data for the health insurance industry can be complex due to the nature of the business, with insurers making a profit if total premiums and investment income exceed total claims and expenses. Insurers can invest funds in stocks due to the lag between premium collection and claim payments. Insurers manage funds through various investments like stocks, bonds, and direct investments to generate earnings. They maintain three sets of books for statutory accounting, GAAP, and tax accounting, which can impact reported net income. Profitability in the insurance industry can vary depending on accounting standards, actuarial judgments, and state regulations. Financial indicators from different sources may show varying results. Tables present profitability indicators by major industrial sectors. Profitability in the insurance industry can vary due to accounting standards, actuarial judgments, and state regulations. Tables show profitability indicators by major industrial sectors. Profits as a percentage of revenues are used to compare retail-oriented industries, sensitive to funds passing through a firm. Traditional commercial coverage and ASO plans differ in revenue booking, affecting profit percentages. The profitability of health insurance companies is influenced by factors such as ASO plan enrollments and capital structure. Higher ASO enrollments lead to higher net margins. Return-on-equity ratios depend on how capital is raised and can be impacted by corporate changes. Comparing profitability ratios across industries requires caution due to different cost structures and risks. Industry profitability is also affected by temporary factors. The profitability of health insurance companies is influenced by factors such as ASO plan enrollments and capital structure. Industry profitability is affected by temporary economic shocks and broader social trends. Individual firms vary in performance on profit measures. The two health insurance sectors are not among the top 20 industries in terms of profits. A.M. Best Company provides ratings and analysis for the insurance industry. Table 5 presents medical loss ratios for major health insurers over the period 2000-2008. The medical loss ratio, a key indicator of profitability and administrative efficiency in the health insurance industry, is calculated as total health benefits paid divided by premium income. It reflects how well premiums are keeping up with increases in medical costs and shows what proportion of premiums are returned through benefits to consumers. State insurance regulators typically monitor health insurers' medical loss ratios. Some financial analysts believe lower medical loss ratios indicate profit potential, leading to calls for stricter federal requirements. Medical loss ratios may not include data from ASO plans used by self-insured plans, which are common for larger firms. Critics argue that the ratio is a flawed measure of administrative costs and profitability, suggesting customer satisfaction and cost-per-covered-person-per-month data would be more informative. Medical loss ratios vary by market segment, with higher administrative costs leading to lower ratios. Costs are typically higher for individual plans compared to large group plans, resulting in lower medical loss ratios. Insurers may shift insurance risks to consumers or providers, impacting overhead costs allocation. Medical loss ratios range from 70.7% to almost 89% among major insurers in 2008. Data tracking health plan performance is considered proprietary, and defining more stringent limits on medical loss ratios would require careful attention. In the insurance industry, major insurers have varying medical loss ratios, with some experiencing significant decreases over the past decade. These ratios can be volatile, influenced by factors like aggressive pricing or high medical costs. Trends in ratios may also reflect changes in insurers' administrative costs, particularly related to claims processing and call centers. Despite advancements in information technology, productivity growth in the insurance sector has been slower compared to other industries. In the insurance industry, productivity growth has been slower compared to other sectors. Some insurers claim that better information technology management has helped reduce administrative costs. The Sherlock Company tracks health insurance companies' administrative expenses to analyze trends in marketing costs and medical loss ratios. The Sherlock Company provides estimates for the insurance industry, but their data collection method may skew profitability measures if certain firms do not cooperate. Profit margins in the health insurance industry for 2007 and 2008 were affected by job losses and asset price declines. These margins may be atypical compared to other sectors like pharmaceuticals. The Sherlock Company provides estimates for the insurance industry, with data showing profit margins for standard commercial plans and ASO plans in 2007. Standard commercial plans were more profitable than ASO plans, with larger firms tending to be more profitable. Insurers running ASO plans charge fees, but firms pay claims themselves. Insurers running ASO plans charge firms fees, but firms pay claims themselves out of funds collected from employees. A hypothetical firm might pay $90 in benefits and $10 to administer the program out of every $100 of employee health insurance funds. ASO profit margins can be calculated by using premium equivalents to make them comparable to standard plans. Profit data for Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans in 2008, including investment income, is presented in Table 7 from publicly reported data. Table 8 displays profit margins for the six largest national commercial insurers in 2008, showing higher margins compared to Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans. The data suggest that investment income plays a significant role in insurers' profits, with many active in various health insurance market segments. The insurance market in 2008 showed varying profit margins across different segments. Health insurers had negative margins in the small group and commercial ASO markets but positive margins in the individual market. Smaller insurers tended to have higher profit margins in the individual market. Congressional concern over health insurance policy is expected to continue post-health care reform in 2010, with potential further actions to impact health insurance markets. The section discusses possible policy responses to issues in the health insurance market, including more aggressive antitrust enforcement to address market concentration. Federal agencies have been active in opposing hospital and health insurance mergers to enhance competition. State governments also have antitrust enforcement capabilities in insurance regulation. The McCarran-Ferguson Act delineates federal and state responsibilities for insurance regulation, potentially hindering effective antitrust enforcement. Modifying the Act and removing impediments could strengthen federal antitrust policy in the health care market. Congress could pass laws to promote competition among health insurers, such as the Health Insurance Industry Fair Competition Act (H.R. 4626) which aims to enable more robust antitrust enforcement. The Obama Administration supports passage of H.R. 4626 to enable more robust antitrust enforcement in healthcare markets. Strong antitrust action is preferred to build up countervailing power for health insurers and providers, promoting economic efficiency in competitive markets. However, past federal government efforts to increase competitiveness in the health sector through antitrust remedies have faced challenges, with losses in cases aimed at promoting competition among hospitals. Federal antitrust policies have not significantly impacted health insurance market structure. Simplifying regulations and standardizing processes could increase competition. Allowing insurers from related lines of business to compete in self-insured markets may also help. Congress could implement stricter regulations to improve private health insurance markets, potentially realigning regulatory responsibilities with state governments. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Protection and Affordable Care Act have imposed federal requirements on health insurance plans, potentially impacting how health insurance companies compete. Changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) could also have consequences in the health insurance market, with some large corporations opposing such changes. Medical underwriting, which offers better prices to healthy individuals, shifts the cost burden of healthcare but does not reduce overall costs. While insurers may earn higher profits, society does not benefit as underwriting incurs real resources and may increase administrative costs. The health insurers' trade association, AHIP, is willing to limit pre-existing condition exclusions only if coverage is mandatory for all individuals. Regulations prohibiting medical underwriting practices could alter the healthcare landscape. The nature of competition in health insurance markets could change with regulations limiting coverage for preexisting conditions. Health insurers may compete based on consumer service rather than shifting risks. Implementation of individual mandate provisions may impact insurers' management and marketing decisions. Critics argue that low medical loss ratios contribute to rising premiums, while analysts suggest high ratios could undermine the industry. The Protection and Affordable Care Act requires health insurance plans to have a minimum medical loss ratio of 80-85%, with waivers available in certain cases. This regulation aims to ensure insurers allocate a significant portion of premiums towards healthcare services. The State of Maine has requested a waiver of the 80% threshold for individual insurance policies until 2014, which may require clarification on how medical loss ratio will be calculated and its interaction with state-level insurance regulation. AHIP and NAIC, among other groups, submitted responses to a 30-day request for comments on defining medical loss ratios in April 2010. Individual or employer mandates could impact the health insurance market significantly, with an individual mandate resembling the requirement for automobile drivers to have minimum insurance coverage. The individual health insurance mandate is similar to the automobile insurance mandate in most states, aiming to widen the insurance risk pool and discourage forgoing insurance. Critics argue that it could transfer economic resources from younger and healthier individuals to older and sicker ones. In Massachusetts, the mandate was tied to the availability of \"affordable\" policies. An employer mandate would require certain firms to offer qualifying health insurance to their employees or pay into a government health fund. Some argue that health costs of uncovered employees are borne by those with private insurance coverage. Imposing an employer mandate could level the playing field among larger and smaller firms, but it may force some firms to lower wages and benefits. Employer mandates would impact the health insurance market by potentially reversing the decline in employer-provided health insurance for American workers. While employer-provided health care has advantages like administrative efficiency and risk pool mitigation, it can also limit job mobility and efficient worker-job matching. Enhancing the individual health insurance market or providing health coverage based on citizenship could be beneficial. The proposal in H.R. 3200 aims to create a Health Insurance Exchange with a public option to increase competition among health insurers. Critics are concerned that the public option could have advantages over private insurers and lead to a broader federal role in healthcare finance. The Health Choices Act (S. 1679) proposes new federal health insurance standards and the creation of an \"Affordable Health Benefit Gateway\" in each state, along with a public option plan called the \"Community Health Insurance Plan.\" Senator Baucus released the America's Healthy Futures Act of 2009, which includes new federal health insurance standards and exchanges but no public option. Senator Reid's measure merged provisions from different bills, allowing states to include a public option in health insurance exchanges. The version of H.R. 3590 that passed the Senate omitted the public option. The proposed Health Insurance Exchange, similar to the Massachusetts Connector, acts as an intermediary between insurance companies and eligible enrollees. Massachusetts mandates health insurance with penalties for non-compliance, leading to a significant decrease in the number of uninsured individuals. The Exchange could have important effects by imposing minimal requirements on plans. The Health Insurance Exchange could act as a \"traffic cop\" or a \"gatekeeper\" in allowing insurers to offer coverage to eligible individuals. In Medicare Part D, CMS acts as a traffic cop, allowing a wide range of insurers to enter the market. Alternatively, an exchange could play a more active \"gatekeeper\" role by preselecting a limited number of alternatives. The Health Insurance Exchange could act as a gatekeeper by selecting attractive plans or imposing stricter requirements. Standardization of Medigap policies was mandated by Congress to promote competition among insurers. A public option within the exchanges could expand coverage and control costs, addressing concerns about market concentration and industry practices. Proponents argued it would help limit costs. Government intervention in the market through a public option could enhance economic efficiency by countering monopoly power of providers, potentially lowering prices and increasing output. However, without proper regulation, a public plan may attract high-cost providers, leading to economic inefficiency in the healthcare market. A public plan without regulation could attract high-cost individuals, threatening its viability. To avoid adverse selection, proposals mandate coverage for all, require community rating, and prohibit denial of insurance based on health or pre-existing conditions. Some suggest creating health insurance cooperatives as an alternative. Cooperative health insurance policies would be available through health insurance exchanges as an alternative to a public plan. Proponents argue that cooperatives would increase competition without more federal involvement. Some historical medical cooperatives faced opposition but reached 600,000 people at their peak. The success of historical medical cooperatives, reaching 600,000 people at their peak, was limited by lack of direction and opposition. Programs were discontinued in 1946. Blue Cross and Blue Shield models demonstrated transformation of American health finance system through collaboration with existing organizations. The governance and structure of Blue Cross were profoundly influenced by the strategy of linking new structures to existing organizations. Initially community-oriented, Blue Cross reflected the ideals of the \"voluntary hospital\" movement. However, by 1986, Congress found that Blue Cross organizations behaved similarly to commercial insurers. Competitive pressures may push health insurance cooperatives to act like other insurers, prompting calls for fundamental reforms in the healthcare sector by Senators Wyden and Bennett. Senators Wyden and Bennett have proposed fundamental reforms in the healthcare sector, introducing the Healthy Americans Act and the Empowering Patients First Act. These proposals aim to mandate private health insurance, create state-run pools, provide subsidies, offer tax incentives for insurance coverage, ease purchase of policies across state lines, modify medical malpractice remedies, and ban certain practices. The proposed healthcare reforms include changes to medical malpractice remedies, banning certain uses of research data, and reintroducing cash indemnity payments in certain situations. The concentration of health insurance markets has led to self-insurance by large firms, which may provide some competition but is unlikely to benefit other consumers. Market power in concentrated markets often results in higher prices and reduced competition. The concentration of health insurance markets leads to higher prices, limited access to affordable health insurance, and high profits. However, reducing insurance industry profits may not significantly lower health care costs or administrative costs. It is uncertain if more vigorous enforcement of antitrust laws would reduce health insurance premiums or expand coverage. Health insurance is interconnected with the entire healthcare system. Health insurance is intertwined with the whole health care system, with costs increasing due to various factors. Policies focused on health insurance sector reform may not solve larger cost growth and access problems if other parts of the health system remain unchanged. The appendix presents indicators of health insurer profitability for the period 2000-2008. Return on equity measures a company's profitability from underwriting and investment activities. It can be volatile due to accounting changes and adjustments in equity levels. Firms raise capital through equity (sale of shares) and debt (loans or bonds). Increasing debt-to-capital ratio can boost return on equity but raises bankruptcy risk. Table A-2 shows return-on-revenue figures for major health insurers from 2000-2008. Return-on-revenue figures for major health insurers from 2000-2008 are presented in Table A-3, showing profits as a percentage of shareholder equity. Shareholder equity can be influenced by changes in a firm's capital structure and timing of financial writedowns. Health insurance sectors are not among the top 20 industries in terms of profits as a percentage of shareholder value for 2008."
