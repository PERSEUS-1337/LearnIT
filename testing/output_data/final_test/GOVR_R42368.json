    "content": "The President is required by federal law to submit an annual budget to Congress by the first Monday in February. This budget outlines the President's fiscal policy, including proposed spending levels, revenues, and deficit/surplus levels. It also highlights priorities for federal programs like defense, education, and health. President Obama submitted his FY2013 budget on February 13, 2012, which included proposed changes to CMS programs. The President's FY2013 budget for CMS includes assumptions and proposed legislative changes, increasing net outlays by $61.3 billion from FY2012. The budget raises Medicare spending by blocking a reduction in physician payments, adding $9.2 billion in FY2012 and $25.6 billion in FY2013. The President's FY2013 budget for CMS proposes legislative changes that would increase net outlays by $61.3 billion from FY2012. This includes a $9.2 billion increase in FY2012 and a $25.6 billion increase in FY2013 for Medicare spending. The budget estimates total net outlays of $834.6 billion in FY2013, with a projected decrease of $4.6 billion in FY2013 if legislative proposals are implemented. Overall, CMS's net outlays are estimated to be $829.4 billion in FY2013, representing a 9.5% increase over FY2012. The report summarizes the President's budget estimates for each section of the CMS budget, including legislative proposals for Medicare, Medicaid, program integrity, and health insurance programs. The budget estimates for Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, program integrity, state grants, health insurance programs, CMMI, and program management are provided. Medicare is a federal entitlement program established in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals 65 and older, as well as permanently disabled individuals under 65. It consists of four parts (A-D) covering various healthcare services. The President's FY2013 budget estimates Medicare outlays to be $510.4 billion, with adjustments made for Congressional action preventing a reduction in Medicare physician payments. The President's FY2013 budget includes legislative proposals for Medicare to decrease outlays by $4.8 billion. The budget estimates total net mandatory and discretionary outlays to be $531.3 billion, an increase of $44.9 billion from FY2012. The budget eliminates the sequestration process and the Congressional Budget Office estimates $88 billion in net savings for Medicare through payment rate reductions. In January 2022, the \"Medicare\" section details legislative proposals for the Medicare program, including current law and the President's proposals. A table summarizes the costs/savings. Medicaid is a means-tested program jointly funded by the federal government and states, with state-designed variations under federal rules. State participation in Medicaid is voluntary, with variability in eligibility levels. State variability is common in Medicaid, with eligibility expanding to individuals under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The federal government shares Medicaid costs with states, requiring states to contribute the rest to qualify for funds. The President's FY2013 budget projects total net outlays of $282.7 billion for Medicaid, with proposed legislative changes impacting the program. The President's budget estimates that total net outlays for Medicaid would increase by $0.2 billion in FY2013, reaching $282.9 billion, a 10.8% increase from FY2012. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to cover low-income, uninsured children. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is jointly funded by the federal government and states, with federal funding capped on a state-by-state basis. It allows states to cover low-income children above Medicaid eligibility levels and pregnant women under certain conditions. The President's FY2013 budget estimates CHIP's total outlays to be $10.2 billion, a 3.3% increase from FY2012. The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control program, established under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, focuses on detecting and preventing healthcare fraud in programs like Medicare. In FY2009, discretionary funding allowed the program to expand its activities to include Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D. The Medicaid Integrity Program aims to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicaid. The budget for program integrity activities in FY2013 is estimated at $1.9 billion, with an increase of $36 million from FY2012. Funding consists of $1.3 billion in mandatory funding and $0.6 billion in discretionary funding. The state grants and demonstrations portion of the budget funds various grant programs and activities, including the Money Follows the Person Demonstration and Medicaid Integrity Program. The President's FY2013 budget estimates a decrease in total outlays for state grants and demonstrations compared to FY2012. The President's FY2013 budget does not include legislative proposals for state grants and demonstrations in the CMS budget. The Affordable Care Act reforms the private health insurance market and involves public agencies like CCIIO in implementation. The budget estimates the effects of ACA provisions currently in effect and includes one legislative proposal for the private health insurance market. Total outlays for FY2013 are projected under current law. The President's FY2013 budget estimates a decrease in total outlays for health insurance programs to $4.1 billion, with one legislative proposal that won't impact the budget. CMMI, established by ACA, aims to improve healthcare quality and reduce expenditures with a budget of $1.1 billion for FY2013. The budget estimates for FY2013 show a $0.4 billion increase in total outlays for CMMI, reaching $1.1 billion. The Quality Improvement Organization's 10th Statement of Work runs from August 1, 2011, to July 13, 2014, with $827.0 million authorized for FY2012. $528.0 million is needed to fund the SOW successfully. CMS will now pay for staff working on QIO activities from the QIO account in FY2012. The President's FY2013 budget estimates a total of $5.6 billion for program management activities, an increase of $1.0 billion (20.3%) from FY2012. Discretionary funding for program management is estimated at $4.8 billion, a 71% increase from FY2012, with the majority allocated to program operations. In FY2013, the President's budget estimates a total of $5.6 billion for program management activities, with a $1.0 billion increase from FY2012. The program operations line sees a $24.6 million increase due to research activities being integrated into CMMI. Mandatory funding for program management activities is estimated at $0.3 billion, a $35 million decrease from FY2012, with potential for a $0.4 billion increase if legislative proposals are implemented. The President's FY2013 budget estimates $6.0 billion for program management activities, a $1.4 billion increase from FY2012. The budget includes proposals impacting the CMS budget, with program expansions and spending reductions. Legislative proposals are grouped by program areas such as Medicare, Medicaid, program integrity, and private health insurance protections. Medicare payments for Part B services are based on a fee schedule. The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system determines annual updates to the Medicare physician fee schedule based on actual expenditures. Since 2002, expenditures have exceeded targets, leading to cuts under the formula. Congress has enacted laws to override reductions, except in 2002 when a 4.8% decrease occurred. The President's budget includes adjustments to prevent payment reductions to physicians. The Administration's adjustment to the baseline aims to prevent payment reductions to physicians, reflecting Congress's past actions of freezing payments. MedPAC recommended eliminating payment updates for SNFs, IRFs, LTCHs, and HHAs in 2011 due to Medicare payments exceeding providers' costs for post-acute services. The Medicare margins for different post-acute providers in 2011 were SNFs at 10.9%, IRFs at 8.1%, LTCHs at 4.8%, and freestanding HHAs at 14.5%. The ACA amended the annual update policy for these providers to include a productivity adjustment for cost savings, implemented at different times for each provider. Reductions in annual updates for IRFs, HHAs, and LTCHs vary in amount and timing, potentially resulting in lower payment rates than the previous year. The President's budget proposes additional update reductions for post-acute providers (IRFs, LTCHs, SNFs, HHAs) from 2014 through 2021, with payment updates not dropping below 0.0. Medicare reimburses providers for beneficiaries' unpaid coinsurance and deductible amounts after reasonable collection efforts, historically reimbursing 100% of bad debts. Previous legislation reduced bad debt reimbursement for acute care hospitals to 55% and for SNFs to 70%, except for dual eligibles. Medicare reimburses providers for beneficiaries' unpaid coinsurance and deductible amounts after reasonable collection efforts, historically reimbursing 100% of bad debts. The President's budget proposes reducing bad debt reimbursement to 25% over three years for all providers starting in 2013. Medicare provides additional payments to hospitals with medical residency programs to cover higher patient care costs related to physician training. These indirect medical education (IME) payments are calculated as a percentage increase to Medicare's inpatient payment rates, varying based on the hospital's resident-to-bed ratio. MedPAC has recommended changes to ensure funding supports necessary workforce skills, with the President's budget proposing a 10% reduction in IME funding. The President's budget proposes a 10% reduction in IME funding starting in 2014. The Secretary would set standards for teaching hospitals to encourage training of primary care residents. IRFs must meet criteria to qualify for higher Medicare payments, including treating a certain proportion of patients with specified medical conditions. The rule for qualifying for higher IRF payment rates requires at least 75% of a facility's inpatient population to be diagnosed with specific medical conditions. The compliance threshold was temporarily suspended and reissued in 2004 with revised conditions and a transition period for reaching the threshold. The DRA extended the transition period, and starting in 2007, IRFs must comply with a 75% threshold. Starting July 1, 2007, the IRF compliance threshold is set at 60%, including comorbidities as qualifying conditions. The President's budget aims to reinstitute the 75% threshold in 2013. Patients undergoing hip and knee replacements can receive rehabilitative care in various post-acute care settings, with IRF care reimbursed at a higher rate than SNF care. The budget proposes adjusting reimbursement rates in post-acute care settings for overlapping conditions, limiting payment differentials for specific conditions starting in 2013. The ACA established penalties for acute care hospitals with high readmission rates starting in FY2013, capped at 1% in FY2013, 2% in FY2014, and 3% in FY2015 and beyond. SNFs are not subject to these penalties. MedPAC recommended a quality incentive payment policy for SNFs in Medicare based on rehospitalization rates. The President's budget plans to reduce payments to SNFs with high preventable hospital readmission rates by up to 3% in 2016. Critical access hospitals (CAHs) are limited-service rural facilities with specific criteria and offer 24-hour emergency care. Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) are rural facilities that offer 24-hour emergency care, have no more than 25 inpatient beds, and receive enhanced cost-based Medicare payments. The President's budget proposes reducing Medicare reimbursement to CAHs to 100% of reasonable costs starting in 2013. To be certified as a CAH, a rural entity must meet distance criteria or be designated as a necessary provider. The President's budget proposes eliminating Medicare enhanced payments for entities less than 10 miles from another hospital or CAH. Home Health Agencies are paid under a prospective payment system for a 60-day episode of care, covering skilled nursing, therapy, medical social services, and aide visits. The President's budget proposes a $100 copayment for each home health 60-day episode with 5 or more visits starting in 2017. Medicare pays separately for the technical and professional components of services under the fee schedule. Medicare pays separately for the technical and professional components of services under the fee schedule. CMS recommended using a higher utilization rate in the calculation of fee schedule payments for advanced imaging services, leading to higher per unit payment due to lower equipment use factor. The ACA changed the utilization rate assumption for calculating payment for advanced imaging equipment from 50% to 75% in 2011 and later to 90% in 2013. Medigap is private health insurance that supplements Medicare coverage for beneficiaries with fee-for-service Medicare Part A. Medicare beneficiaries with fee-for-service Medicare Part A can enroll in Medicare Part B by paying a monthly premium. Medigap plans, offered by insurance companies, have varying coverage levels with some providing full coverage for Parts A and B deductibles and coinsurance. In 2010, over 60% of Medigap beneficiaries were covered by plans offering \"first-dollar\" coverage. A proposal in 2017 suggested imposing a Part B premium surcharge for new beneficiaries choosing Medigap plans with low cost-sharing, equivalent to about 15% of the average Medigap premium. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 set the Part B deductible at $110 in 2005, increasing annually based on per capita costs. The deductible was $155 in 2010, $162 in 2011, and $140 in 2012. A proposal in 2017 suggested increasing the deductible by $25 in 2017, 2019, and 2021 for new Medicare enrollees. Most Medicare beneficiaries pay Part B premiums based on a percentage of the program's estimated costs per aged enrollee. Higher-income beneficiaries pay a larger share of premiums, with income thresholds determining the percentage. The Affordable Care Act also imposed an income-related premium for Part D services and suspended inflation-indexing of income thresholds for Parts B and D through 2019. About 4% of current Part B enrollees were estimated to pay higher income-related premiums in 2011. Starting in 2017, the President's budget proposed increasing the applicable percentage of costs for higher income beneficiaries. The proposal aims to increase the program's cost per aged enrollee for higher income beneficiaries to 40-90%, replacing the current 35-80% range. It also suspends inflation-indexing of income thresholds until 25% of beneficiaries under Parts B and D are subject to these premiums. Medicare Part D covers outpatient prescription drugs for enrolled beneficiaries, with about 60% currently enrolled. Some may qualify for low-income subsidy (LIS) for assistance with premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Dual-eligibles and certain other groups automatically qualify for full low-income subsidy. Prescription drug coverage under Medicare Part D is provided through private plans, with about 40% of enrollees receiving low-income subsidies. Plans negotiate prices with drug manufacturers and may offer rebates in exchange for lower costs. Negotiations between drug manufacturers and plans may involve rebates for formulary inclusion or preferred placement. Medicaid was the main drug payer for dual-eligible beneficiaries before Medicare Part D. Manufacturers must provide rebates for drugs available to Medicaid enrollees, categorized as single source or innovator multiple source drugs. The Medicaid rebate system includes a basic rebate percentage for non-innovator multiple source drugs. A proposal in 2013 required drug manufacturers to pay the difference between rebates provided to Part D plans and Medicaid rebate levels for low-income subsidy beneficiaries. Penalties for not meeting electronic health records criteria were imposed on Medicare providers under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The penalties for not meeting electronic health records criteria will be redirected to the Medicare Improvement Fund (MIF) for deficit reduction. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) establishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board to propose Medicare spending reductions, focusing on payments to MA and PDP plans and provider reimbursement rates. The Board is prohibited from proposing changes to Medicare benefits, eligibility, or financing. The Independent Payment Advisory Board will propose Medicare spending reductions when the projected Medicare per capita growth rate exceeds certain targets. Recommendations by the Board will automatically take effect unless Congress intervenes. The target growth rate will depend on changes in consumer price indices for the first five years, then switch to the projected five-year average increase in GDP per capita plus 1.0 percentage point. Starting in 2020, the target growth rate will be based on the growth in nominal GDP per capita. The proposal by the Independent Payment Advisory Board aims to lower the target growth rate to the growth rate in nominal GDP per capita plus 0.5 percentage point. The IPAB would also be given additional tools to consider value-based benefit design and policies promoting integrated care. P.L. 98-417 established the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) pathway for generic drug approval at the FDA, with a 180-day market exclusivity for patent infringement. The FDA provides a 180-day market exclusivity to the first paragraph IV filer(s) for patent infringement. Settlement agreements between brand-name and generic firms in Hatch-Waxman litigation, known as \"pay-for-delay\" agreements, may involve the brand name company paying the generic firm not to market the patented pharmaceutical. Amendments in P.L. 108-173 address these agreements, requiring many settlements to be filed with the FTC and DOJ for review of possible anticompetitive effects. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009, incorporated into Title VII of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), establishes a licensure pathway for competing versions of previously marketed biologics, creating a regulatory regime for biosimilar and interchangeable biologics. The FDA plays a key role in determining standards for biosimilarity and interchangeability. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009 established FDA-administered periods of data protection and marketing exclusivity for brand-name biologic drugs and follow-on products. Brand biologics receive four years of marketing exclusivity and 12 years of data exclusivity. Data protection allows competitors to develop their own clinical data for marketing approval. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009 established FDA-administered periods of data protection and marketing exclusivity for brand-name biologic drugs and follow-on products. Brand biologics receive four years of marketing exclusivity and 12 years of data exclusivity. Effective in 2013, brand biologics would be awarded seven years of exclusivity rather than the current 12 years. The BPCIA also creates a patent dispute resolution procedure for use by brand-name and follow-on biologic manufacturers. Additionally, the BBA97 required states to pay Medicare Part B premiums for a new group of low-income Medicare beneficiaries\u2014Qualifying Individuals (QIs)\u2014whose income was between 120% and 135% of the Federal Poverty Limit. The Qualifying Individuals (QI) program, established in 1998, has been extended 12 times. The program pays Medicare premiums for low-income individuals. The President's budget proposes extending the program through 2014 with appropriations of $695 million for 2013 and $995 million for 2014. Medicaid and CHIP are jointly funded by the federal government and states. Federal reimbursement is provided on an open-ended basis to states that meet program requirements. The federal government's share of Medicaid expenditures is determined by the FMAP rate, with exceptions made for certain states, populations, and services. CHIP matching funds are provided at an enhanced FMAP rate, capped on a state-by-state basis. During economic downturns, state Medicaid and CHIP programs face challenges. The President's budget proposes a single federal matching rate for Medicaid and CHIP, with an automatic trigger for increased support during recessions. States can use health care provider taxes to finance their share of Medicaid expenditures. The President's budget proposes a phasedown of the Medicaid provider tax threshold from 6.0% to 3.5% by FY2017. States can use health care provider taxes to finance their share of Medicaid expenditures, with certain restrictions in place. The President's budget proposes reducing the Medicaid provider tax threshold from 6.0% to 3.5% by FY2017. States receive federal matching funds for Medicaid DSH payments, with ACA requiring aggregate reductions in DSH allotments in subsequent years. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 reduces Medicaid DSH allotments from $5.0 billion in FY2018 to $4.0 billion in FY2020. The President's budget proposes rebasing FY2021 allotments to the lower FY2020 level increased by CPI-U. States have flexibility in setting Medicaid payment rates, with federal regulations limiting payments for certain providers like hospitals and nursing homes. Federal regulations limit Medicaid payments for certain providers like hospitals and nursing homes. Medicare historically paid for durable medical equipment (DME) based on fee schedules, but a competitive acquisition program was established to determine prices based on suppliers' bids. The program began in 2008 but was halted and restarted in 2009. The competitive acquisition program for durable medical equipment (DME) began in 2009, with contracts and payments starting in 2011. The second round of competition started in 2011 in 91 additional areas, with payments and contracts expected to begin in 2013. The program is expected to be extended by 2016, and the President's budget would limit federal reimbursement for Medicaid spending on certain DME services. States are required to provide Medicaid coverage to certain nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals with income up to 133% FPL starting in 2014. States have the option to cover new Medicaid groups prior to 2014 and provide coverage to individuals with income above 133% FPL starting in 2014. States may phase in coverage over time and offer Medicaid through benchmark plans as an alternative to traditional benefits. Benchmark coverage options include plans under FEHBP, state employee coverage, commercial HMO plans, or Secretary-approved plans. The President's Budget proposes to allow states to require benchmark benefit plan coverage for non-elderly, non-disabled adults with income above 133% FPL. States must continue Medicaid benefits for low-income families through transitional medical assistance (TMA). Congress expanded work-related Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) benefits in 1988, requiring states to provide up to 12 months of coverage to families losing Medicaid eligibility due to increased work hours or income. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 extended these requirements beyond the original sunset date of September 30, 1998. The Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 extended TMA requirements through December 31, 2012, and the President's budget proposes extending them through December 31, 2013. HHS poverty guidelines are simplified versions of Census Bureau poverty thresholds used for determining financial eligibility for federal programs like Medicaid. The guidelines are updated annually based on CPI-U changes. The 2012 poverty guidelines are adjusted to standardize differences between family sizes and reflect price changes. The President's budget proposes a hold harmless provision for adjusting the guidelines only with CPI-U increases, impacting social programs like Medicaid, SNAP, and WIC. Medicare covers durable medical equipment, including power wheelchairs, with a history of fraud and abuse associated with expensive items like power mobility devices. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced new program integrity tools to combat Medicare fraud, including a requirement for beneficiaries to have a face-to-face examination before durable medical equipment (DME) is prescribed. Medicare is focusing on high-risk areas for improper payments and fraud, with a recent demonstration in seven states requiring prior authorization for certain equipment. In FY2010, Medicare spent $261 million on power mobility devices out of a total of $606 million for durable medical equipment. The President's budget proposal includes continuing the Medicare PMD prior-authorization demonstration to combat fraud. Providers and suppliers must update enrollment information to ensure proper monitoring and scrutiny. Civil penalties may be imposed for failure to update records timely. Claims processing systems lack necessary data for fraud detection. Claims processing systems currently lack data to determine if a patient saw a practitioner or if billed services were medically necessary. Additional information is needed to validate high-risk services and practitioner orders. Electronic health records (EHR) systems, incentivized by ARRA and ACA, can interact with clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and electronic claims processing, providing valuable information on services ordered by practitioners. The patient records contain information on services ordered by practitioners, while claims processing systems request reimbursement from payers like Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP. Program integrity systems could validate practitioner orders for high-risk treatments. Demonstrations may identify data and edits for electronic claims systems to validate services ordered by federal health program providers. The President's budget proposes an electronic Medicare claims ordering system to validate high-risk services. The President's budget proposes an electronic Medicare claims ordering system to validate high-risk services and prevent improper payments by requiring providers to report the use of accounts that transfer funds to jurisdictions where recovery actions are difficult. The Secretary could monitor providers and suppliers using \"sweep\" accounts to transfer Medicare payments to investment accounts, especially if they are offshore. Imaging service expenditures under Medicare grew rapidly from 2003 to 2005, with DRA capping x-ray and imaging services at a set rate. ACA reduced payments for DXA in 2010 and 2011 and required a study by the Institute of Medicine on reimbursement rates. The Government Accountability Office recommended that CMS consider instituting a prior authorization requirement for expensive imaging procedures. The President's budget proposes prior authorization for costly imaging services to ensure appropriate use. Medicaid statutes allow states to implement prescription drug monitoring activities, with some states having \"lock-in\" programs for beneficiaries exceeding necessary drug utilization levels. The President's proposal aims to require states to monitor Medicaid claims for potential drug abuse or excessive prescription drug utilization. States can tailor their programs by choosing specific drug classes to focus on and prevent improper prescribing and utilization patterns. Under third-party liability rules, Medicaid is the payer of last resort, requiring other insurers or programs to pay for medical costs before Medicaid. States must identify third parties and ensure providers bill them first. If a third party exists, they must pay before Medicaid, without reimbursing for services not covered by Medicaid state plans. The DRA strengthens states' TPL authority to recover Medicaid payments from third parties, clarifying entities considered third parties and requiring insurers to comply with TPL rules. The President's budget proposes allowing states to collect costs from third parties for prenatal, pediatric, and medical child support expenses. Drug manufacturers selling to Medicaid must pay rebates under the MDR program. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, manufacturers must provide their full product line to Medicaid beneficiaries. Rebates are calculated based on the average price of a drug, but there have been issues with manufacturers including sales of excluded drugs in their calculations, reducing rebates owed to states. The President's budget proposal aims to ensure manufacturers properly report drugs in their AMP calculations to reduce rebates owed to states. CMS and HHS/OIG have authority to monitor drug manufacturers' reporting and conduct audits. There is significant variation in methodologies used by manufacturers to report drug price data to CMS. The President's budget proposal aims to ensure manufacturers properly report drugs in their AMP calculations to reduce rebates owed to states. Studies and False Claims Act settlements have revealed irregularities in manufacturers' drug price reporting. The ACA made changes to Medicaid prescription drug pricing policies to create more uniform reporting standards. The budget would require regular audits and surveys of drug manufacturers to ensure compliance with rebate agreements and regulations. Medicaid covers outpatient prescription drugs approved by the FDA under the FFDCA. FDA approves drugs through NDA or ANDA. Medicaid reimbursement is limited to on-label drug indications listed in compendia. CMS proposed regulatory changes due to some drugs not properly listed with FDA. The President's budget proposes regulatory changes for drug manufacturers to list products electronically with FDA for Medicaid coverage. Manufacturers must offer rebates to states selling products to Medicaid programs. ACA amended the Medicaid drug rebate statute, and CMS guidance allows manufacturers to report drug prices to CMS. The President's budget proposes increasing penalties for drug manufacturers who knowingly report false information under Medicaid drug rebate pricing agreements. Medicaid and CHIP are jointly funded by the federal government and states, with federal reimbursement provided on an open-ended basis to states meeting program requirements. The federal government provides Medicaid and CHIP funding to states based on program requirements. Medicaid funding is determined by the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) rate, with exceptions for certain states and situations. CHIP funding is based on an enhanced FMAP rate, capped on a state-by-state basis. States are generally prohibited from using other federal funds for Medicaid unless authorized by law. The President's budget aims to increase penalties for drug manufacturers who provide false information under Medicaid drug rebate pricing agreements. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-300) requires federal agencies to review programs for erroneous payments and report estimates to Congress. CMS implemented the Medicaid Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) to estimate improper Medicaid and CHIP payments. States must also assess Medicaid eligibility and quality control (MEQC) to report erroneous payment rates. The President's budget proposes consolidating MEQC and PERM requirements. Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) recover improper payments and receive a percentage as compensation. RAC corrections for FY2010-FY2011 totaled $365.8 million, with $313.2 million from overpayment collections alone. The President's budget proposal aims to allow CMS to retain a portion of RAC recoveries (up to 25%) from Medicare and Medicaid for new processing audits and training to prevent future improper payments. HHS/OIG has the authority to exclude healthcare providers from federal programs, including those who make false statements on enrollment applications. ACA extended HHS/OIG authority to include individuals or entities involved in Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans. The President's budget proposal aims to expand HHS/OIG authority to exclude individuals and entities from federal health programs if they are affiliated with sanctioned entities, closing a loophole that allows evasion of exclusion. It would also make it illegal to distribute Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP beneficiary identification or billing privileges to prevent fraudulent claims. The proposal under section 1332 of the ACA allows states to apply for waivers of certain ACA requirements for health insurance coverage, starting in 2017. States can apply for waivers related to qualified health plans, consumer choice, cost sharing, tax credits, and shared responsibilities. The Secretaries have the authority to grant state innovation waivers if certain criteria are met, allowing states to provide comprehensive and affordable health insurance coverage. The President's budget proposes allowing states to apply for waivers earlier than currently permitted. Each year, CBO analyzes the budget proposal. The CBO conducts an analysis of the President's budget proposal, with differences in economic assumptions and enrollment estimates leading to discrepancies in impact estimates. The main variance between CBO and Administration estimates for CMS legislative proposals involves the response to Medicare payment rate reductions for physicians' services. The President's budget includes an adjustment to prevent these reductions, costing $271 billion according to CBO and $429 billion according to the Administration over the next 10 years. The CBO estimates that the President's budget proposal would reduce Medicare outlays by $276 billion over the next 10 years, with differences in assumptions leading to discrepancies in impact estimates. For Medicaid, the legislative proposals would save $66 billion over the next 10 years. The CBO estimates that program integrity activities would save $66 billion over the next 10 years, 12% higher than the Administration's estimate. There are significant differences in estimates for Medicaid proposals, with the CBO projecting higher savings for phasing down the provider tax threshold. The President's proposal for state innovation waivers would result in a net cost of $4.4 billion according to the CBO, while the Administration predicts no budgetary impact."
