This program aims to provide separate home visitation services for these vulnerable populations. The section aims to improve child well-being by providing voluntary home visitation services to low-income pregnant women and families with young children. The Secretary will award planning and operating grants to local agencies for this purpose. Operating grants will be given to agencies to offer home visitation services to eligible individuals. To be eligible for an operating grant, a local agency must meet all requirements set by the Secretary, including implementing an approved model of home visitation that has shown positive effects on child and parent outcomes. The local agency must follow national or regional home visitation program models approved by the Secretary to ensure services are consistent. The Secretary may require State or local matching funds for grants under this section. The Secretary may allocate grant funding to local agencies implementing home visitation models with strong evidence of effectiveness, including in-kind contributions and payments to the State for home visitation services. The Secretary considers distribution of low-income families and approves home visitation models meeting requirements or supported by strong evidence of effectiveness.
