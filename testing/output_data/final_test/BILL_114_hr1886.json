FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\" Summarized curr_chunk: \nCongress finds that employer-based health insurance is the largest source of coverage in the US, with 70% of employed individuals receiving it. However, the percentage of Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance has decreased from 70% in 2000 to 60% in 2011 due to rising healthcare costs. According to Business Group on Health and the Kaiser Family Foundation, most companies continue to provide health insurance for employees and plan to do so in the future. Employers offering insurance will not add risk to the health insurance exchanges under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The transitional reinsurance program aims to stabilize risk in the individual health insurance market for the first three years of the exchanges. Additionally, a fee is required for each employer-sponsored covered life to fund the transitional reinsurance program, which may discourage employers from continuing coverage. The purpose of this Act is to remove the current funding mechanism for the transitional reinsurance program, as the fee required for each employer-sponsored covered life is seen as a disincentive for employers to continue offering coverage to all employees. This Act aims to support employer-sponsored insurance so that Americans can sustain quality health coverage. SEC. 2. Changes in funding for transitional reinsurance program in the individual market. Changes in funding for transitional reinsurance program in the individual market include amending Section 1341(b) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to shorten time periods and adjust funding amounts for specific years. The funding for the transitional reinsurance program in the individual market is being adjusted, with changes to time periods and funding amounts for specific years. This includes authorizing $6 billion for plan years starting in 2015 and 2016, with unexpended amounts deposited into the Treasury's general fund. The funding for the transitional reinsurance program in the individual market is being adjusted. $6 billion is authorized for plan years starting in 2015 and 2016 to make reinsurance payments to health insurance issuers covering high-risk individuals. The funds will be allocated among States based on reinsurance needs for each year, with unexpended amounts deposited into the Treasury's general fund. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct an audit of expenditures made under the transitional reinsurance program for plan years beginning in 2014. The audit will include a review of claims submitted by health insurance issuers, amounts collected, and reinsurance payments. A report on the audit will be submitted to Congress within 3 months after the last reinsurance payments are made, but no later than July 1, 2016."
