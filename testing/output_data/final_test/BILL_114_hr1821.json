The Opioid Overdose Reduction Act of 2015 acknowledges the significant increase in opioid overdoses in the United States. Deaths from drug overdose, particularly prescription pain relievers, have risen sharply. Drug overdoses now surpass car accidents in claiming lives. Timely administration of opioid overdose drugs can prevent deaths, and both medical and non-medical personnel can be trained to safely administer these drugs. The Opioid Overdose Reduction Act of 2015 aims to save lives by providing protections from civil liability for administering opioid overdose drugs to individuals who have overdosed on heroin or opioids. Several states have programs allowing non-medical personnel to administer these drugs, which have proven to save lives. Civil liability concerns may deter medical and non-medical personnel from administering these drugs, as well as physicians from prescribing them to individuals other than their patients. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"health care professional\" refers to a person licensed to prescribe drugs, \"opioid overdose drug\" is a drug that reverses opioid overdose effects, and \"opioid overdose program\" is a program that provides drugs and education to prevent opioid overdoses.

This includes declaring the election of the State that sections 5, 6, and 7 shall not apply to any civil actions covered by this Act, as of a certain date, and containing no other provisions. SEC. 5.

This requirement does not apply if harm is caused by the gross negligence or reckless misconduct of the healthcare professional. SEC. 6. LIMITATION ON CIVIL LIABILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS WORKING FOR OR VOLUNTEERING AT A STATE OR LOCAL AGENCY OPIOID OVERDOSE PROGRAM. Individuals providing opioid overdose drugs at a program are not liable for harm caused by another individual administering the drug in an emergency, except in cases of gross negligence or reckless misconduct.

Individuals are not liable for harm caused by administering an opioid overdose drug if obtained from a healthcare professional or program, or with a prescription, and if the individual was properly educated, except in cases of gross negligence or reckless misconduct."
