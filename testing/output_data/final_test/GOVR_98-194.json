    "content": "The U.S. House of Representatives has final authority over contested election cases from the 73rd to the 112th Congress. This report focuses on cases involving the question of whether a Member-elect was duly elected, highlighting the nature of the contest and the case disposition. It does not cover questions regarding qualifications like age and citizenship. For more detailed information, consult relevant House records. State-level cases are not included in this report. Since 1933, the House of Representatives has considered 107 contested election cases, mostly resolved in favor of the contestee. The Federal Contested Elections Act of 1969 led to many cases being dismissed due to contestants failing to meet the burden of proof. In at least 3 out of 107 contested election cases considered by the House since 1933, the contestant was ultimately seated. In some cases, lack of evidence, voting irregularities, or failure to sustain the burden of proof led to dismissal. The presentation of credentials is only considered prima facie evidence of election legitimacy. The presentation of credentials as prima facie evidence of election legitimacy is not conclusive. The final authority over the seating of Members of Congress lies within each House of Congress. Any Member-elect can object to the seating of another Member-elect based on their own responsibility and reliable facts before being sworn in. The House may agree to seat a challenged Member-elect immediately or provisionally based on their prima facie right, with final disposition referred to the Committee on House Administration. The House may agree to seat a challenged Member-elect immediately or provisionally based on their prima facie right, with final disposition referred to the Committee on House Administration. The resolution offered for swearing in the challenged Member-elect may not expressly mention any election contest filed, but the House later considers the matter of \"election\" on a majority vote basis, indicating that the seating is provisional and conditional. The seating of a Member-elect does not prejudice a contest pending under the Federal Contested Elections Act over the final right to the seat. The House may seat a challenged Member-elect provisionally, with final disposition referred to the Committee on House Administration. In some cases, the Member-elect was asked to step aside while the oath was administered, and in a few instances, the oath was given on a provisional basis. The House adopts a resolution authorizing the Speaker to administer the oath and refers the final right to the seat to the appropriate committee for further review. The House has the power to investigate contested elections and may seat a Member-elect provisionally while referring the final decision to the Committee on House Administration. In cases where a Member-elect was asked to step aside, the House either delayed administering the oath until after an investigation or allowed the Member-elect to take the oath without a final determination on the seat. In a specific case where no notice of contest was filed, the Committee on Elections dismissed the matter, recommending against seating contestant Bowles. The Committee on Elections dismissed a contest, recommending that contestant Bowles was not entitled to a seat and contestee Dingell was entitled to a seat. The House passed H.Res. 260 awarding the seat to Dingell on February 24, 1934. No evidence was presented before the Committee on Elections, and the contest was dismissed despite the contestant having a 14,000 vote majority. Another contest involving contestant Shanahan was also dismissed by the Committee on Elections. The House Elections Committee recommended that contestant Shanahan was not entitled to a seat, and contestee Beck was entitled to a seat. Contestant Reese, the regular Republican candidate for Congress in the 8th District of Mississippi, withdrew from the contest due to election law infractions. The committee recommended the adoption of H.Res. 261, declaring Reese was not entitled to the seat. The House adopted H.Res. 261, declaring Ellzey entitled to the seat over Reese. Contestant Brewster challenged Utterback's win, citing election irregularities. Despite some irregularities, the Elections Committee found no significant difference in the election under scrutiny. The contest involved 16 precincts and had been submitted to the Supreme Court of Maine, which advised that returns from two precincts should be thrown out. The committee found no sufficient evidence of fraud or corruptness to justify a recount, recommending denial of contestant Brewster's seat. The committee recommended denying contestant Brewster a seat and awarding it to contestee Utterback. The House adopted the resolution on May 28, 1934. Contestant Casey was not entitled to the seat, and contestee Turpin was awarded the seat. Contestee Gormley received 42,132 votes, while contestant Goss received 42,054 votes, with a majority of 78 votes for the contestee. The contestant alleged fraud, irregularities, corruption, and deceit in the election, specifically focusing on a voting booth in Waterbury. The Elections Committee found the allegations lacking necessary details but decided to investigate further. They established guidelines for the case, emphasizing the importance of official returns as evidence, presuming election officials' loyalty and honesty, and placing the burden of proof on the contestant. Hearings revealed confusion at the polling place. The committee held hearings and found no complaints of irregularities or fraud at the polling place, concluding that contestee Goss was duly elected. The House awarded the seat to Goss on April 20, 1934. Contestant Chandler alleged he received a majority of lawful votes but was deprived of a rightful count due to rejected ballots. The election officers rejected ballots favoring the contestant, citing them as void, spoiled, or marked. The contestant claimed discrepancies in the number of ballots delivered to precincts and missing ballots from ballot boxes. The Elections Committee emphasized the need for specific details in contest notices and stated that fraud must be proven, not presumed. The mere closeness of an election result does not imply fraud or irregularities. The committee found no evidence of fraud or deception in the election. A private recount by the contestant was deemed inadmissible. The committee clarified the distinction between mandatory and directory provisions in suffrage laws. The rules for conducting an election can be mandatory or directory, depending on whether they are essential for the validity of the election. The purpose of these rules is to ensure a fair and free exercise of the right to vote, prevent illegal voting, and determine the election results accurately. Deviating from the prescribed procedures will not invalidate the election as long as it does not disenfranchise any legal voters, allow illegal votes, or create uncertainty in the outcome. The contestant failed to establish fraud in the election contest. Contestee Thurston was declared duly elected with a majority of 177 votes. The central question was whether ballots marked for presidential nominees but not for congressional candidates should be counted as straight party tickets. The Elections Committee decided against this assumption and confirmed Thurston's election. The House adopted H.Res. 359, denying contestant Ellis's election and awarding the seat to contestee Thurston. Contestant Fox claimed that contestee Higgins induced a candidate to run as a \"Wet Party\" candidate, leading to confusion in the voting process. The Elections Committee found no evidence of collusion or confusion in the voting process for the contested election in the 6th district of Louisiana. The House declined to seat contestant Fox and awarded the seat to contestee Higgins. The governor gave only eight days' notice for a special election in Louisiana, which was deemed void due to not conforming with state law. Another election was held where Sanders was elected, but it was also declared void. The House adopted a resolution to investigate and decide on the contested elections in the 6th district of Louisiana. The House debated and passed H.Res. 231 declaring both elections in Louisiana's 6th district null and void. Contestee Reece was seated despite contestant Lovette's fraud allegations lacking evidence. The House passed H.Res. 358, awarding the seat to contestee Reece in a contest where evidence failed to substantiate charges. H.Res. 362 declared contestant McAndrews not elected and contestee Britten elected due to inconclusive evidence of corruption. Contestee Simpson won by 1,222 votes out of 201,500, with mistakes found in 128 precincts. Despite a request for a recount, the Elections Committee found no evidence of fraud or irregularities, and declined to undertake a recount. H.Res. 374 awarded the seat to Simpson, with no further action taken. The committee found violations of election laws, but none were proven. Despite 4,000 pages of evidence, the case was not decided before adjournment. The House declared contestant Lanzetta was not entitled to the seat, and contestee Marcantonio was awarded the seat. The House Committee on Elections concluded that contestee King won by a majority of 1,857 votes, despite allegations of voter intimidation and campaign violations. The committee dismissed all charges due to lack of evidence of improper fund use and timely notice issues. Additionally, a third contention based on Hawaii state law was also dismissed. The House Committee on Elections declared that contestant McCandless was not elected, and contestee King was duly elected. Contestant Miller's allegations of voting irregularities were dismissed as they did not affect the outcome, with contestee Cooper winning by 2,000 votes even if the contested county's votes were excluded. The House Committee on Elections declared contestee Cooper as the winner over contestant Miller, with Cooper elected to the seat. Contestee Jenks received a plurality of 550 votes, leading to a recount resulting in a tie. After a ballot-law commission decision favoring contestant Roy, contestee Jenks disclosed missing ballots, ultimately winning by 10 votes. The House Committee on Elections issued a certificate of election to Jenks after considering the missing 34 ballots and possible ballot box tampering. Member-elect O'Connor raised concerns about Jenks' election, leading to a majority recommendation that contestant Roy was the winner by 20 votes. A minority report disagreed. The Speaker asked Jenks to temporarily step aside while administering the oath of office to other Members-elect and Delegates. The House adopted H. Res 1, allowing Jenks to take the oath of office. A majority report declared contestant Roy as the rightful winner, but the resolution was recommitted for further investigation into missing ballots. The length of the contest led to a ruling by the Speaker regarding election case reporting. The Speaker ruled that House Rule XI was directory, not mandatory, regarding election case reporting. H.Res. 339 allowed hearings during recess, leading to H.Res. 482 recommending Roy be seated after a 20-vote win. The House then voted to deny Jenks the seat and award it to Roy. Roy was entitled to the seat after a contest where contestant alleged influence by Taylor in failing to place their name on the ballot. The contest was not pursued, leading to the withdrawal of the contestant. The contest for the seat was resolved with the withdrawal of the contestant after allegations of fraud and misconduct. Contestee Polk was declared the winner with a majority of 339 votes. The Committee on Elections found no evidence to support the claims made by contestant Swanson regarding illegal votes. The Committee on Elections determined that the 70 WPA workers' votes were illegal and should be disregarded, although it would not change the final result. They found no evidence of fraud or irregularity in the informal recount for sheriff and a state legislature seat. The committee stated that an application for a recount must be based on proof of irregularity or fraud, not just a suggestion of possible error. The House declared that contestant Swanson was not duly elected, and contestee Harrington was entitled to the seat. Contestant Eaton received a majority of 342 votes but failed to prove violations of election laws. Contestant Scott was also not elected, and contestee Eaton was declared entitled to the seat. The Elections Committee dismissed the contest due to lack of evidence. H.Res. 534 declared contestant Neal not entitled to the seat and contestee Kefauver as entitled. H.Res. 54 was passed, stating contestant Miller had served notice of contest. The House of Representatives dismissed contestant Miller's notice of contest, stating he was not a competent person to bring a contest for a seat in the House. Contestant Clark alleged fraud and irregularities in the election, but the Elections Committee found no evidence to support his claims. The Elections Committee found no evidence of fraud or irregularities that would have affected the election outcome. Some irregularities were noted, but the committee did not intervene in enforcing Oklahoma's laws. The committee found no evidence of fraud or irregularities that would have affected the election outcome in Oklahoma. The failure to keep registration books in precincts was deemed not essential to the validity of the election, and the alleged irregularities were not significant enough to constitute a claim of fraud. The House Elections Committee dismissed the contest due to lack of evidence of fraud or irregularities that would have impacted the election outcome in Oklahoma. Contestant alleged various wrongdoings, but the committee deemed them not significant enough to warrant a full recount of the ballots. The contestant's allegations in the election contest were not sustained by sufficient proof, leading to the dismissal of the case by the House. The committee extended the time for taking testimony but ultimately concluded that a full recount was not warranted. The nature of the contest was not disclosed in the record, and the contestant attempted to run as an Independent Republican in Georgia where no such party existed. The contestant attempted to run as an Independent Republican in Georgia, where no such party existed, but his name did not appear on any ballots and he received no votes. The House dismissed the election contest against contestee Peterson on May 5, 1944, as the contestant failed to exhaust all legal remedies and establish a prima facie case. Contestee Wasielewski won with a majority of 17,000 votes, while the contestant alleged violations of campaign expenditure laws and reporting requirements. The Elections Committee found that contestee violated Wisconsin laws by publishing false statements, exceeded expenditure limits, but most were by an unregulated campaign committee. They determined that funds were not disbursed with contestee's knowledge, citing negligence but no fraud. Despite irregularities, the committee concluded they did not impact the election outcome, leading to the dismissal of the contest against contestee Wasielewski. The House passed H.Res. 490 dismissing the contest against contestee Wasielewski on March 29, 1944. Contestee received a majority of 6,000 votes, with allegations of violations of election laws. The Elections Committee found no violation as the contested expenditures were made by campaign committees, not the contestee. Additionally, no evidence of fraud or concealment of expenditures was found. The House dismissed the contest against contestee McMurray on January 31, 1944, due to accounting irregularities. Both contestant and contestee alleged miscounted ballots in the November 1942 election but were denied a recount by the Elections Committee. The House dismissed a contested election case on January 31, 1944, due to accounting irregularities. The parties had requested an extension of time for taking testimony, which was granted on May 17, 1943. A recount was conducted on May 4, 1943, but did not change the final result. The parties agreed to dismiss their claims on June 5, 1943. On November 24, 1943, the House passed H.Res. 368, dismissing the contest against contestee Miller. Contestee received a majority of 29,000 votes, while the contestant filed no evidence except two transcripts of proceedings before the Wayne County, Michigan, canvassing board. The Committee on Elections concluded that such evidence was incompetent. On December 12, 1945, the House passed H.Res. 455, dismissing the contest and declaring that contestee Dondero was entitled to the seat. Dondero was declared entitled to the seat in a contest that lacked merit. The House passed resolutions dismissing the contest against contestee Davis and affirming his entitlement to the seat on April 27, 1948.

Karst requested dismissal of the contest, which was granted by the House through H.Res. 399. Huber contested Ayres' election due to ballot irregularities in Ohio. The Committee on House Administration found that the names of candidates on the ballots in Ohio had not been rotated as required by the Constitution. Huber contested Ayres' election, but the House declared Ayres legally elected. Lowe, a candidate in the Democratic primary, did not appear on the general election ballot. The contest against Lowe was recommended to be dismissed by the Committee on House Administration.

The contestant failed to comply with statutory requirements for conducting the contest, and evidence did not show he received a majority of legally cast votes. The House dismissed a contest in 1951 due to lack of evidence of fraud or irregularities in the election. The committee declared Scott duly elected in 1952 without any election contests. Dolliver's attempted contest in 1957 was deemed insufficient by the Committee on House Administration.

The House later passed H.Res. 339 to resolve the contest. On June 14, 1961, the House passed H.Res. 339, declaring contestant Roush duly elected after a debate on the recount process and alleged election irregularities. The dissent raised concerns about not following established precedent for swearing in a Member-elect. The House Committee dismissed a contest involving a question of standing under the Federal Contested Elections Act. Contestant Frankenberry filed a notice of contest alleging campaign spending by contestee Olson. The contestant alleged that $187,000 had been spent on the campaign by the contestee, with $167,000 contributed by the contestee's mother and sister, violating contribution limits. Additionally, the creation of 34 campaign committees, only one of which was registered as required, violated New York law. Member-elect Cleveland objected to administering the oath of office to Ottinger based on reliable facts, leading to a delay in taking the oath. The Speaker administered the oath to Ottinger after adopting a resolution. The Committee on House Administration reported H.Res. 126 to dismiss the contest on the grounds of the contestant not being a candidate from the district. The House dismissed the contest on the grounds that the contestant was not a candidate from the district and was not competent to bring a contest for a seat in the House. The resolution was adopted after debate on whether the statutory procedure for contesting elections applied only to candidates. The House dismissed the contest on the grounds that the contestant was not a candidate from the district and was not competent to bring a contest for a seat in the House. Precedent supported limiting the use of statutory procedure to candidates alone to prevent spurious contests by those without a serious interest in the election. The contests involved failure to challenge alleged discrimination among voters before the election, denial of seats to Members-elect due to discriminatory practices, and standing to proceed under the Federal Contested Elections Act. Contestees were elected in the November 1964 general election, while contestants were selected. In the 1964 general election, contestees were elected, while contestants were selected in an unofficial \"election\" in Mississippi. The contestants alleged disenfranchisement of Negroes, violation of the Constitution and U.S. law, and sought to unseat the contestees. They argued that the House had a duty to ensure elections were in accordance with the Constitution, especially where voter exclusion, intimidation, and violence occurred. In the 1964 general election, contestees were elected in Mississippi. Member-elect Ryan objected to administering the oath of office to certain individuals, leading to hearings and a report by the House Committee on Administration. The House Committee on Elections issued a report on the contested election in Mississippi in 1964, stating that the contestants did not challenge the exclusion of Negroes from the ballot or the issuance of certificates of election. The report found that the contestants were not candidates at the election and therefore had no standing to invoke the House contested election statute. The report also noted that the election in Mississippi had not been set aside by a court and that other officials were elected without question. The House Committee on Elections report on the 1964 contested election in Mississippi concluded that the contestants did not qualify to use the House contested elections statute. The report noted that the election, presidential electors, and a U.S. Senator had been elected without question. It also mentioned a case challenging Mississippi's voter laws progressing through U.S. courts, stating that disenfranchisement, if proven, would not have affected the outcome of the congressional elections. The report recommended dismissing the cases as the contestees were elected under laws that had not been set aside at the time of the election. The committee did not support voter disenfranchisement in the 1964 elections and stated that future action could be taken if violations of the Voting Rights Act were presented. The House later dismissed the contests and declared the contestees entitled to their seats in 1965. In 1965, the House dismissed contests and declared contestees entitled to their seats after alleged violations of state elections law in Iowa. Contestant filed a notice of contest citing various violations, including burning of ballots, casting more ballots than names on the polls, recording of absentee ballots by one person, and disappearance of a tally sheet. The Subcommittee on Elections of the Committee on House Administration held hearings on the contest in 1965. The committee found no evidence of fraud or willful misconduct, dismissing the charges brought by the contestant. The burned ballots were determined to be unused, and errors at the polls were deemed insufficient to change the election result. The allegation of more ballots cast than names listed on the polls was attributed to inadvertent errors. The Subcommittee on Elections of the Committee on House Administration found no evidence of fraud or willful misconduct in the 1965 contest. The disappearing tally sheet was located and involved technical operation of a voting machine, not the counting of results. The request for a recount was deemed a \"fishing expedition\" with no evidence of fraud to substantiate it. Iowa had no recount statute for a U.S. House election, but the committee would proceed if substantial allegations of irregularity or fraud were alleged. The evidence did not justify a recount as the contestant failed to provide clear proof. The contestant did not provide sufficient evidence to justify a recount in the 1965 election contest involving the counting of \"overvotes\" on punch card voting machines. The House Administration Committee dismissed the contest on October 8, 1965, and the resolution was adopted on October 11, 1965. The issue revolved around alleged errors in tallying votes and improper procedures for duplicating defective ballots. Member-elect Davis objected to the oath of office being administered to Blackburn, citing reliable facts. The Speaker asked Blackburn to step aside while administering the oath to other Members-elect. A lawsuit in Georgia courts regarding punch card votes was terminated when the Georgia Supreme Court upheld state election officials' interpretation of the law. The judicial decision favored state election officials' interpretation of the law in Blackburn v. Hall, Georgia Court of Appeals. The contestant withdrew his notice of contest, and the Committee on House Administration confirmed the contestee as the duly elected Representative from the 4th congressional district of Georgia. The House adopted a resolution to that effect on July 11, 1967, after discussing difficulties with punch card ballots and \"automatic\" voting machines. The House adopted a resolution confirming the contestee as the duly elected Representative from Georgia's 4th congressional district. The case involved the question of the contestant's standing to utilize the House contested elections statute procedures. Contestant challenged the contestee's seat in the House under the contested elections statute, alleging that the nomination procedures for their party's candidate were contrary to Georgia election statutes. The primary winner withdrew, and a new nominee was substituted, leading to the dispute. The Georgia statutes and Democratic Party rules allowed a county committee to make a substitute nomination only after the state convention. The contestant argued that a special election should have been held for the congressional seat. The Committee on House Administration concluded that the contestant, who was an unsuccessful primary candidate, had no standing to challenge the election under the contested elections statute. The committee considered a petition filed by a contestant regarding the election of Members of Congress. Despite no charges of fraud or irregularities, the committee declared that even if the Democratic candidate's nomination was irregular, it did not warrant unseating the Republican contestee. There was no precedent for removing a Member solely based on nomination irregularities. The committee considered a petition regarding the election of Members of Congress and noted the potential danger in declaring an election void due to an unlawful nomination. It highlighted the risk of allowing losing candidates to impeach the election of winning candidates based on nomination irregularities. Additionally, a suit seeking a special primary was dismissed by the Georgia courts. The committee recommended dismissing a case involving allegations of malconduct, irregularity, and fraud in a Democratic primary election. The losing candidate had sought nomination but lost to Charles Weltner. The winner of the general election was from the Republican party. The major issue was whether a losing primary candidate had standing to contest the election. The losing candidate in a primary contested the election of a Member from another party, alleging voter registration irregularities. The Committee on House Administration recommended dismissal, citing lack of involvement of the candidate or his opponent in the alleged irregularities. The House adopted a resolution dismissing the contest. The losing candidate in a primary contested the election of a Member from another party, alleging voter registration irregularities. A motion to dismiss was filed based on insufficient grounds to change the election result. The Subcommittee on Elections recommended dismissal as the contestant failed to prove qualified voters were denied the vote. The House adopted a resolution dismissing the contest. In a special election to fill a vacancy, a lawsuit was filed alleging voter inconsistencies. A preliminary injunction was obtained, and the House Administration Committee recommended administering the oath to the apparent winner. The plaintiff acknowledged not claiming the seat or alleging fraud. The House adopted a resolution, and the oath was provisionally administered. No further action was taken, and Conover served the remainder of the term. No further action was taken in the matter, and Conover served the remainder of the term. Young contested Mikva's election alleging fraud and violations of the law, including disseminating false information and accepting unreported campaign contributions. However, no specific evidence was provided to support these allegations, and the contest was ultimately dismissed for failure to state grounds. The contestee moved to dismiss the election contest for failure to provide sufficient grounds to change the election results. A partial recount was conducted in 124 precincts, reducing the contestee's majority by 471 votes. The House Administration Committee determined that a full recount would not change the outcome of the election. The House Administration Committee dismissed the election contest due to lack of proof. A recount was conducted in the Emery/Kyros election as per Maine state law. Both parties agreed to set aside questionable ballots for the U.S. House of Representatives to determine validity. The contestant filed a Notice of Contest on December 27, 1974. The contestant filed a Notice of Contest on December 27, 1974, regarding disputed ballots divided into three types. The Subcommittee on Elections used the \"obvious voter intent\" standard to determine ballot validity, overriding state laws when no legitimate state interest was found. The contestant later withdrew from the case. The contestant Wilson filed a Notice of Intent to Contest on January 6, 1975, citing violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The House dismissed the election contest on December 19, 1975, due to insufficient evidence supporting the allegations. The House dismissed the contestant's case on December 19, 1975, questioning Stokes' qualifications as a Representative. The committee decided on the case's merits despite the lack of a formal petition or memorial. The contestant must state adequate grounds for disqualification with sufficient particularity under applicable standards. The committee found no factual allegations to cast doubt on contestee's qualifications and recommended dismissal of the case on December 19, 1975. Ziebarth filed a Notice of Intention to contest citing election closeness, overcounting, undercounting, expert opinion on recount results, and lack of recount provisions in Nebraska. The contestant filed a motion to dismiss due to lack of grounds to change election results. The subcommittee requested more specific details, but the contestant failed to provide them. The secretary of state of Nebraska refuted the allegations of overcount and undercount. The case was dismissed based on the reasons for rejecting a recount request solely due to closeness of the vote and absence of state provisions for recounting. The contestant, Saunders, challenged the election citing conspiracy with the contestee and decline in polls leading to defeat. The Committee recommended dismissal of the contest due to lack of specific details and proof of mistake in the original count. The House adopted H.Res. 898, dismissing the case on December 19, 1975. The Committee on House Administration dismissed the contestant's motion to contest the election results, citing a lack of evidence to support her claim. The House passed the measure to dismiss the contest on May 9, 1977, after a recount showed the contestee had a majority of votes. The Committee on House Administration recommended dismissing the election contest due to lack of evidence that the allegations would have changed the result. The House passed the resolution to dismiss the contest on May 9, 1977, after a recount showed a difference of 201 votes. The contestant in the election was unable to secure a judicial recount and filed a notice of intention to contest the election. An ad hoc panel concluded that the contestant failed to provide sufficient evidence to change the election result. The House passed a resolution to dismiss the contest on May 9, 1977, with a difference of 201 votes after a recount. The contestant Pierce received 95,053 votes, with a majority of 344 votes. A notice of contest was filed alleging election mistakes and requesting a recount in certain precincts. An ad hoc panel found the contestant did not meet the burden of proof for a recount. The House passed H.Res. 528 on May 9, 1977. The official returns showed that Leggett received 75,866 votes and Dehr received 75,202 votes, with a margin of 664 votes. After a recount, Leggett had 75,844 votes and Dehr had 75,190 votes, reducing the margin to 651 votes. The contestant filed a notice of contest claiming 14 precincts were improperly counted, but an ad hoc panel found no errors to support the claim. The committee unanimously adopted a motion to report H.Res. 770, which was passed by the House on October 27, 1977. In another primary election, the contestee received 29,094 votes, while contestants Hill and Panasigui received 574 and 957 votes respectively. Contestant Hill received 574 votes, and contestant Panasigui received 957 votes. The \"Concerned Citizens Committee of the First Congressional District\" (CCC) filed suits in state and federal courts, which were dismissed. The Justice Department found the complaints baseless and upheld the election results. The committee recommended dismissing the election contest due to insufficient grounds to change the results.
