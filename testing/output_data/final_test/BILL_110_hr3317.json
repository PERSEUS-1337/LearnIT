    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"GEAR UP Enhancement Act of 2007\" and references amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965. Congress created the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) in 1998, inspired by successful programs like Say Yes to Education and Project GRAD. Despite increased college access, a gap persists for low-income students in high school graduation and college enrollment. Since its inception in 1998, GEAR UP has assisted around 2 million students in 48 states and various territories. The program has significantly improved high school graduation rates and college readiness for low-income students, with 84.4% of the first class of GEAR UP students graduating from high school compared to the national average of 52.1%. Students in the GEAR UP program are more likely to be college-ready in English and Reading, take the core high school curriculum, and have plans for college by grade 10. SEC. 3. AWARD PERIOD; PRIORITY. Section 404A(b) (20 U.S.C. 1070a-21(b)) is amended to allow the Secretary to award grants to eligible entities for 7 years. Priority is given to entities with successful educational programs and a commitment to early intervention. The GEAR UP Enhancement Act of 2007 aims to ensure that students continue to receive assistance through secondary school, emphasizing collaboration and replication of successful strategies for college access. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS: CONTINUITY OF SERVICES. The Cohort Approach under Section 404B(g)(1) is amended to provide continued services through the student's first year of attendance at an institution of higher education. Additionally, services under this chapter are extended to students who have received services under a previous GEAR UP grant award but have not yet completed the 12th grade. Early Intervention under Section 404D is also amended. The Cohort Approach under Section 404B(g)(1) is amended to provide services through the first year of attendance at an institution of higher education. Subsections (a)(1)(B), (b)(2)(A), and (c) are modified to include students in their first year of college. SEC. 5. FLEXIBILITY IN MEETING MATCHING REQUIREMENTS. Section 404C (20 U.S.C. 1070a-23) is amended to allow eligible entities to request a reduced match percentage during the grant award period to provide financial assistance for post-secondary education. In Section 404C, eligible entities can request a reduced match percentage for post-secondary education financial assistance. Non-Federal funds obligated under subsection (c)(1) and (c)(2) are treated as 2 dollars for student obligations, including pre-existing non-federal financial assistance programs. Other resources recognized by the Secretary are also included. The Secretary recognizes other resources for eligible entities, such as equipment, supplies, cash contributions, transportation expenses, in-kind services, indirect costs, and facility usage. SEC. 6. EARLY INTERVENTION. Section 404D (20 U.S.C. 1070a-24) is amended to include financial literacy and economic literacy education or counseling, foster parent and family involvement in education, promote college education advantages, and engage entities for collaborative activities. The amended Section 404D includes financial and economic literacy education, foster parent involvement, promoting college education benefits, and collaborative activities with entities. Additionally, eligible entities receiving funds can provide technical assistance for various activities authorized under the section. The amended Section 404D allows funds to be used for providing technical assistance to middle or secondary schools within the State or partnerships within the State as described in section 404A(c)(2). SEC. 7 amends Section 404E to provide scholarships to students in addition to regular aid. SEC. 8 authorizes appropriations. SEC. 8 authorizes appropriations of $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for the following 6 years."
