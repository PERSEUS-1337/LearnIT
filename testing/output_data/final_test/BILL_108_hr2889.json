The Act aims to minimize bycatch and mortality of Atlantic Striped Bass in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone, conduct a study on migratory patterns, and delineate areas of highest discard and bycatch associated with mobile net gear. The study aims to identify gear types and fisheries with high Atlantic Striped Bass discard and bycatch levels, protect recreational fishing opportunities, businesses dependent on the fishery, and understand bycatch in non-directed commercial fisheries in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone. To protect the historical opportunities of the recreational Striped Bass fishery and ensure the maintenance of the Atlantic Striped Bass stock. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that Atlantic Striped Bass have expanded their range into the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone due to management measures rebuilding stock levels. They migrate annually, aggregate on bottom features for feeding, and exhibit age- and sex-dependent behaviors. The Federal moratorium on harvesting Atlantic Striped Bass in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone in 1990 helped the stock recover and reduced fishing mortality rates. However, commercial fishing during coastal migrations and on winter-feeding grounds is causing a bycatch issue for non-directed fisheries in the area. The non-directed fisheries in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone are negatively impacting the benefits of the Atlantic Striped Bass population. Bycatch of Atlantic Striped Bass is increasing, potentially raising the fishing mortality rate above target levels set by the Magnuson-Stevens Act and the Interstate Fishery Management Plan. Efforts to increase the number of larger fish and develop a fuller age structure are being compromised by the predominance of older fish in the population. The Act aims to address the negative impact of non-directed fisheries on the Atlantic Striped Bass population by initiating data collection and implementing necessary management measures to increase the percentage of larger fish. SEC. 4. STUDY OF ATLANTIC STRIPED BASS IN THE MID-ATLANTIC EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE. The Secretary of Commerce will conduct a study to map migratory patterns, wintering areas, and feeding grounds of Atlantic Striped Bass in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone using data from fishing vessel observers. The study will focus on data from 1992 to 2002 and fisheries using various gear types, paying attention to trips targeting specific species. The study will use data to map locations where gear caught or discarded Atlantic Striped Bass exceeding 10% of the target species landed, and identify gear types causing bycatch exceeding 10%. Data will be confirmed by observers on fishing vessels in specific areas and using certain gear types. A report is due within 3 years. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 3 years after the enactment of the Act, detailing the abundance, wintering grounds, and feeding grounds of Atlantic Striped Bass in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone. The report to Congress will include details on the annual coastal migration of Atlantic Striped Bass, including biomass, age structure, and sex ratio. It will also cover months with high bycatch levels in non-directed commercial fisheries, gear types causing the most bycatch, and the impact of non-directed fisheries on recreational opportunities in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone. The report to Congress will detail the annual coastal migration of Atlantic Striped Bass, including biomass, age structure, and sex ratio. It will also address the impact of non-directed fisheries on recreational opportunities in the fishery and the Atlantic Striped Bass stock as one management unit. SEC. 5. MANAGEMENT MEASURES. The Secretary must establish regulations based on a study to minimize bycatch of Atlantic Striped Bass in non-directed commercial fishing in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone, including temporary closures of high-risk areas. The Secretary will establish regulations to minimize Atlantic Striped Bass bycatch in non-directed commercial fishing, including temporary closures in high-risk areas based on observer data analysis. Possession regulations will not affect existing regulations under the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act. Regulations will be established to minimize Atlantic Striped Bass bycatch in non-directed commercial fishing in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone (U.S.C. 5158). Before final reports or regulations are issued, they must undergo peer review by the Northeast Fishery Science Center. Definitions in the Act include the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone and the exclusive economic zone as defined in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of Commerce."
