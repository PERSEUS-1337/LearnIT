    "content": "Donor advised funds allow individuals to make tax-deductible gifts to sponsoring organizations. The donor's recommendations determine the grants given to charities from the fund. DAFs have been around since the 1930s, initially sponsored by community foundations. Currently, commercial DAF sponsors like Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard have grown rapidly, controlling one-third of DAF assets. Community foundations hold 43% of assets, religious organizations 15%. Commercial DAFs accept small contributions and lack a direct charitable interest compared to other sponsors. DAFs can be used by individuals to hold funds temporarily for year-end planning and make quick distributions to charitable organizations. They offer tax benefits by allowing fund earnings to accumulate tax-free and facilitate contributions of appreciated property, such as real estate, that may not be easily divisible for traditional charitable giving. Additionally, DAFs can be used similarly to private foundations, allowing for large contributions to generate income for grants in perpetuity. Contributions of property to a Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) can be sold without tax consequences, allowing donors to make subsequent contributions to multiple recipients over time. Donors also receive tax benefits when donating appreciated property to a DAF, as they do not have to pay capital gains tax on the appreciation. DAFs have more generous treatment than private foundations in terms of deductions for property donations. Publicly traded property like corporate stock can be deducted for the full fair market value when donated to a DAF, while real estate is limited to cost basis when contributed to a private foundation. Contributions to Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs) have more generous tax benefits compared to private foundations. DAFs allow for higher limits on income donations to charities, have no minimum payout requirements or excise taxes, and are subject to fewer restrictions on self-dealing. Setting up and administering a DAF is more cost-effective than a foundation, making it suitable for smaller contributions. Additionally, DAFs offer privacy in contributions as individual grants are not disclosed. Private foundations have more favorable treatment than DAFs in terms of control and grant-making. Donors to foundations can control the foundation, receive a salary, and involve their children in its operation, while donors to DAFs do not have legal control over investment or grant choices. However, evidence suggests that donors to DAFs still have effective control over grants and investments. Foundations also have greater freedom in grant-making, allowing them to make grants to individuals and non-profit organizations for charitable purposes. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-280) made changes regarding Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs), requiring reporting of aggregate assets, grants, and contributions for sponsoring organizations. It also imposed penalty taxes and restrictions on grants that did not meet required standards or benefited the donor or their family. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 made changes regarding Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs), requiring reporting of aggregate assets, grants, and contributions for sponsoring organizations. It imposed penalty taxes and restrictions on grants that did not meet required standards or benefited the donor or their family. Congress mandated a study by Treasury on DAFs, asking specific questions about charitable deductions, payout ratios, and advisory roles in fund distribution. The 2011 Treasury Report addressed restrictions on giving as a percentage of income and the treatment of gifts of appreciated property in relation to Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs). Treasury maintained that the rules should not be changed due to the legal rights of DAF sponsors and the lack of control donors have over sponsoring organizations. The 2011 Treasury Report discussed restrictions on giving in relation to Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs). It highlighted the issue of control donors have over sponsoring organizations and the individual DAF accounts. The report questioned the appropriateness of deduction rules in this context. There is evidence that donors have significant influence over the distribution of funds in Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs). Public comments and website reviews suggest that donors often have de facto control over investment and distribution decisions. Respondents generally reported following donor advice, but concerns were raised about donors having too much influence. For example, the Alaska Community Foundation sometimes denies grant requests that do not meet criteria. The Alaska Community Foundation may deny grant requests that do not meet legal criteria, such as those not charitable in nature or benefiting the donor advisor. Grants do not have to be made every year, but inactivity may lead to fund reassignment. The organization aims to work closely with donors to fulfill their grant-making goals. The Alaska Community Foundation may deny grant requests that do not meet legal criteria, such as those not charitable in nature or benefiting the donor advisor. The organization aims to work closely with donors to fulfill their grant-making goals, typically following donors' requests and finding alternatives if necessary. The largest commercial DAF organization, Fidelity, also only approves grants used exclusively for charitable purposes and reserves the right to decline grants that may benefit the donor or third parties. Fidelity Charitable may deny grants used for lobbying, political contributions, or improper purposes. They have a policy of distributing at least 5% of funds to organizations and may request grants from accounts with no payouts. Remedial actions could include returning the grant or making an additional contribution. Fidelity Charitable allows donors to recommend grants of 20% of net assets and offers choices of investment allocations. The Alaskan foundation manages funds without donor direction, while other foundations like The American Endowment Foundation and The Renaissance Charitable Gift Fund allow investment control. Treasury also addressed issues like restrictions on donations of appreciated property and timing of deductions. The Treasury Report discusses concerns about deductions for contributions to Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs), highlighting the lack of legal control over donations and potential issues with payout rates, especially for commercial DAFs. There is a noted tension between financial advisors of National DAF sponsors and charitable purposes. Fidelity's 5% payout rate commitment may not be binding due to significant donations from some donors. Congress is evaluating these issues. The Treasury Report raises concerns about Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs) and whether they should be treated as private foundations or public charities. Donor-advisors have significant control over grants and investments from DAFs, similar to foundations. This control leads to stricter regulations on income share, reporting, and distributions compared to public charities. The Treasury Report includes data analysis and comments on this issue. The analysis of data on DAFs reported on IRS Form 990 for 2006 revealed opposition to payout ratios from community foundations and national DAFs. Some suggested voluntary rules and restrictions to address payout requirements, such as forcing grants if none are made over several years. There was debate over a 5% minimum distribution requirement, with concerns about monitoring costs and donors interpreting it as a guideline. The Treasury Report analyzed 990 data on DAFs, finding an average payout rate of 9.3% with variation across sponsors. Payout rates ranged from zero at the 25th percentile to 10.5% at the 75th percentile. Larger DAF sponsors had higher dollar-weighted payout rates at 15.4%. The Treasury Report found that larger DAF sponsors have a higher dollar-weighted payout rate of 15.4%, compared to foundations which hover slightly above the required 5% payout. The report notes that payout ratios are only available for sponsoring organizations and not individual DAF accounts, suggesting no need for a minimum payout requirement. Private foundations are typically established to exist in perpetuity and make grants out of their earnings, while DAF contributors are more heterogeneous. DAFs can be set up as endowments or for annual giving, with a high payout rate potentially concealing accounts with a payout rate of less than 5%. Schwab Charitable lists advantages of DAFs such as separating year-end tax planning from charitable giving decisions and simplifying tax preparation with only one charitable deduction. The report analyzes the 2008 DAF sample, revealing that over 70% of DAF accounts in organizations paid less than 5% in grants, with 54% making no payments at all. The Treasury considers contributions to DAFs as completed gifts based on legal ownership and control. Some comments questioned the completion of gifts involving appreciated property to donor advised funds with certain conditions. Data from the 2008 IRS Form 990 was used for analysis. The IRS has been collecting data on Donor Advised Funds (DAFs) since 2005 through Form 990 informational returns filed by tax-exempt entities. Prior to 2005, information on DAFs was gathered through surveys conducted by the Chronicle of Philanthropy. The data reported on Form 990 is considered an improvement over survey-generated data, but it has limitations. One major limitation is that data on DAFs is reported at the sponsoring organization level, not at the individual DAF account level, making it difficult to obtain information on contributions, grants, and payout rates per individual DAF. The 2011 Treasury Report analyzed data from 2006 Form 990s on sponsoring organizations and DAFs. The analysis in this report is based on 2008 Form 990 data, cautioning that comparisons with the Treasury Report may be affected by form redesigns and reporting errors. The analysis is also limited to a sample of returns from the public use file, resulting in estimated population totals. In 2008, there were over 181,000 individual DAF fund accounts and roughly 1,818 organizations maintaining at least one DAF account. Most charitable organizations with DAFs had very few accounts, with one-third reporting only one fund and half reporting five or less. On average, DAF sponsoring organizations had 100 accounts, with a small percentage holding a large number of DAF accounts. Fifty-one organizations reported having 500 or more accounts. In 2008, there were over 181,000 individual DAF fund accounts and roughly 1,818 organizations maintaining at least one DAF account. A large proportion of individual DAF accounts are maintained by a small number of organizations, with more than 121,000 accounts held by institutions with 500 or more individual accounts. The number of DAF accounts per organization is highly skewed, with some organizations maintaining a significant number of accounts. Data on contributions, grants paid, and DAF asset values are only available at the DAF sponsoring-organization level. In 2008, DAF sponsoring organizations reported a total of $29.5 billion in DAF assets on their Form 990s. On average, assets per DAF account were roughly $162,000. 87% of all DAF assets are held by sponsoring organizations that maintain 100 or more individual DAF accounts, with substantial variation in average assets per DAF account across organizations. In 2008, DAF sponsoring organizations reported $29.5 billion in DAF assets, with an average asset value per DAF of $162,000. The National Philanthropic Trust's reports show a decline in DAF assets due to the 2007 recession, with discrepancies in data from different sources highlighting the need for caution when comparing DAF data. In 2008, total contributions to DAF accounts were $7.1 billion, representing 3.3% of total individual charitable giving. DAF sponsoring organizations received an average of $3.9 million in contributions, with an average contribution per DAF account of $39,103. Organizations with only one DAF account received substantially higher average contributions, driven by a few large contributions. About one-third of these organizations reported positive contributions, with an average contribution of $1.3 million. In 2008, organizations with only one DAF account reported an average contribution of $1.3 million, showing significant variation in contribution levels. The 2011 Treasury Report on DAFs noted total contributions of $9.0 billion in 2006, with lower contributions in 2008 possibly due to the recession or reporting errors. Contributions to DAFs declined from 2007 to 2009 before increasing in 2010, as per the National Philanthropic Trust's 2011 DAF study. In 2008, DAF sponsoring organizations reported paying out $7.0 billion in grants to charitable organizations, with an average of $38,641 in grants per DAF account. Organizations with only one DAF account had higher average grants per DAF compared to those with multiple accounts. Some DAF sponsoring organizations did not pay out any grants. In 2008, some DAF sponsoring organizations did not pay out any grants, with an estimated 453 organizations not distributing any funds. These organizations held a total of $280.4 million in assets. Most of the organizations that did not pay grants sponsored only one or very few DAFs. Individual DAF account grant data is not reported, so the total amount held in accounts not paying grants is unknown. In 2008, many DAF sponsoring organizations did not distribute any grants, with roughly half of those maintaining only one account not paying out. Data on individual account payouts is not available, but evaluating payout rates at the organization level can offer insights into charitable fund distribution. Payout rates for DAF sponsoring organizations are not directly comparable to private foundations due to different regulations. DAF sponsoring organizations disbursed $7.0 billion in grants from DAF accounts. In 2008, DAF sponsoring organizations paid out $7.0 billion in grants from DAF accounts, with total DAF assets reaching $29.5 billion. The average payout rate across DAF sponsoring organizations was calculated based on total grants paid from DAFs divided by total assets available for grant-making. In 2008, DAF sponsoring organizations had an average payout rate of 13.1%, with significant variation across organizations. 43% had payouts of less than 5%, and 26% did not report a payout. The Treasury Report in 2006 found an average payout rate of 9.3%, with payouts ranging from 0.0% to 19.5%. The Treasury did not report the share with no payout or less than 5%, with over 25% having no payout and over 50% with a payout rate of less than 5%. The National Philanthropic Trust (NPT) provided dollar weighted payout rates, with rates fluctuating from 16.5% in 2007 to 17.1% in 2010. The Treasury's estimates were close to NPT's, but adjustments were made for over-reporting. The 2008 sample may have had over-reporting, making the 19.2% share and 13% average rate potentially too high. The trend of rising payout ratios from 2007 to 2009 in the NPT data reflected the financial crisis, with organizations maintaining a single DAF account having an average payout of 10.6%. More than half did not pay out any grants in 2008, and over 70% paid less than 5%. Individual DAF accounts likely follow similar payout patterns, with a large share not paying out grants and most paying less than 5%. DAF accounts do not pay out grants in any given year and most pay less than 5%. Nearly 87% of all DAF accounts are held by organizations with at least 100 individual accounts, with an average payout rate of 16.1%. Some sponsoring organizations have a payout rate of less than 5%. Data on payouts from individual DAF accounts within these organizations is not available. Commercial financial institutions maintain charitable affiliates with individual DAF accounts for clients. In 2008, 46.7% of individual DAF accounts were held in commercial DAFs, which accounted for 34.3% of DAF assets, 39.2% of DAF contributions, and 39.7% of DAF grants. Commercial DAFs had an average payout rate of 26.5% in 2008. These organizations represent a small portion of DAF sponsoring organizations but have a significant share of DAF accounts, assets, contributions, and grants. In 2008, commercial DAFs had an average payout rate of 26.5%, with less variation compared to all DAF sponsoring organizations. The 25th percentile and 75th percentile payout rates for commercial DAFs were 17.7% and 38.8% respectively, higher than the average payout rate of 13.1% across all DAF sponsoring organizations. In 2008, commercial DAFs had a payout rate of 26.5%, with less variation compared to all DAF sponsoring organizations. The 25th percentile and 75th percentile payout rates for commercial DAFs were 17.7% and 38.8% respectively, higher than the average payout rate of 13.1% across all DAF sponsoring organizations. DAFs with a national reach not affiliated with a financial institution had a higher payout rate of 28.7% compared to the overall payout rate of 9.3% in 2006. Policy issues include minimum distribution requirements, rules on charitable contributions, and treatment of contributions to DAFs as completed gifts. Various proposals were made, such as stricter regulations on commercial or national DAFs and limits on advisory rights or the duration of DAFs. The Treasury Report analyzed 2008 data on DAFs, showing a higher payout ratio than foundations but with variability across sponsoring organizations. Some organizations made no payouts or less than the 5% minimum. The overall payout ratio in 2008 was 13.1%. The 2008 data on DAFs showed a 13.1% overall payout ratio, higher than that of foundations. Dollar weighted payout ratios increased after 2006 but declined between 2009 and 2010. The Treasury Report suggested that high payout rates for DAFs in 2006 may justify not imposing a minimum payout requirement. The distribution of DAF sponsoring organizations with only one sponsor shows that despite an average payout rate of 10.6%, over half made no distribution and over 70% made a distribution of less than 5%. Larger DAF sponsoring organizations with multiple accounts tend to have somewhat higher aggregate payout rates compared to those with only one account. The analysis of DAF sponsoring organizations shows that there is substantial variation in payout rates at the individual account level. Public comments suggest that a 5% payout requirement imposed on the overall sponsor would be more meaningful than on individual accounts. Data from 2008 indicates that a minimum payout per sponsor would be relatively insignificant. The analysis of DAF sponsoring organizations reveals significant variation in payout rates at the individual account level. Implementing a 5% payout requirement on overall sponsors, rather than individual accounts, would be more effective. This approach would impact only a small percentage of sponsors with a limited number of DAFs, while leaving the majority with no restrictions. Moving funds from inactive DAF accounts to a general fund for charitable distributions at year-end is a practical solution. Some comments suggest imposing minimum distribution requirements on commercial DAF sponsors or national DAFs, with higher distribution requirements or exemptions for traditional DAF sponsors like community foundations. This could involve distributing an annual percentage over the past five years to accommodate economic cycles. The Treasury Report rejected stricter rules for DAFs compared to foundations, citing the legal control of funds by sponsoring organizations. Donors do not control contributions or investments, but benefit from tax advantages and larger donation options. Donors have significant control over grant making and investment decisions in donor-advised funds (DAFs), as indicated by sponsoring organizations following their advice. The Treasury Report concluded that donations to DAF accounts are completed gifts, similar to gifts to foundations, but commentators questioned the completeness of the gift if there were future options to buy or sell the gifted property. Some comments suggested disallowing options like puts or calls related to gifts of property. Suggestions were made to delay deductions for appreciated property until it is sold. Concerns were raised about the lack of charitable purpose for commercial DAFs, leading to proposals for tighter regulations and restrictions. There is tension between the needs of charitable organizations and maintaining large investment accounts in commercial DAFs. Some proposals include applying minimum distribution requirements only to these DAFs. Some comments proposed restrictions on DAF accounts, such as limiting advisory rights duration or the life of the account to ensure timely charitable use. Donors may object to these limits if they want to involve future generations in philanthropy. Some comments suggested limits on charges for DAF account maintenance and investments. There is a lack of transparency regarding the costs of managing and investing DAF funds. Reporting on individual DAF accounts could enhance understanding and oversight, but there are differing opinions on this approach. The Treasury Report highlighted concerns about the lack of transparency and oversight in Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs). Suggestions were made for DAF sponsors to provide more information on account distributions, investment fees, and administrative costs. There are differing opinions on the need for reporting on individual DAF accounts to improve understanding and regulation. The Treasury Report raised concerns about transparency and oversight in Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs), suggesting more information on investment fees and administrative costs. Evaluating the impact of DAFs on charitable giving policy goals is crucial, considering the balance between increasing contributions and potential reduction in current charitable giving. DAFs, while legally different from foundations, function similarly in practice. The data for this report is sourced from the 2008 IRS Statistics of Income Form 990 public use file, which includes information on tax-exempt organizations. Sampling weights are used to adjust for smaller organizations, and organizations are asked if they maintained donor advised funds on their Form 990. In the 2008 IRS SOI Form 990 public use file, 599 organizations reported maintaining DAFs. Data was cleaned to remove reporting errors before further analysis. After cleaning the data, 51 observations were dropped for reporting zero DAFs and assets, and 2 observations were dropped for not reporting any DAF contributions or grants. The sample now consists of 541 observations from 1,828 DAF sponsoring organizations. Summary statistics are provided in the report, along with a separate examination of 21 commercial DAFs identified in the sample. The 21 observations represent 31 sponsoring organizations with commercial DAFs, based on information from 2008 IRS Form 990s. Summary statistics are provided in Appendix B, with further details in the main report."
