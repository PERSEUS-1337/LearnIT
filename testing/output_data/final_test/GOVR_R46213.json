    "content": "Economic sanctions, including oil-related ones, are used to influence the behavior of political leaders in other countries. The United States has imposed sanctions on major oil-producing countries like Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, affecting a significant portion of global oil production. The impact of economic sanctions on global oil production has been significant, with estimated oil production volumes affected from Iran and Venezuela. Despite this, the market conditions have not seen significant upward price pressure for benchmark oil prices due to increased production and exports from other countries like the United States and Russia. A sustained global petroleum supply imbalance of 1% to 2% could lead to volatile price movements for crude oil and related petroleum products. Oil sanctions frameworks include production and exports from the United States, Russia, and other countries, trade flow adjustments, indications of slowing global oil demand growth rates, and design elements to mitigate market impacts. Each country's sanctions differ in design and potential market impacts, affecting oil production, trade, and price levels. The frameworks aim to reduce oil sales immediately or in the future. The sanctions frameworks for Iran, Russia, and Venezuela aim to reduce oil sales revenue. Iran's sanctions target oil export revenue, Russia's focus on long-term projects, and Venezuela's prohibit trade with the US. The report assesses the impact of US sanctions on oil production and exports from these countries. The curr_chunk provides an overview of oil-related sanctions frameworks and their impacts on oil production, supply, and trade, specifically focusing on U.S. sanctions. It briefly mentions EU sanctions on Iran and Russia but does not delve into details. The chunk also mentions Iran's significant oil reserves and its membership in OPEC. The detailed assessment of how sanctions affect target countries' economies and contribute to U.S. foreign policy objectives is not within the scope of the report. Iran's oil industry was nationalized in 1951 by Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadeq, leading to a U.S.- and British-sponsored operation that removed him from power in 1953. A consortium of U.S. and European oil companies then took control of Iran's oil production. Iran's crude oil production peaked in the 1970s, ranging between 5 million and 6 million barrels per day. Diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran were generally positive during this period. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Shah of Iran requested President Nixon to eliminate the Mandatory Oil Import Quota system to increase oil revenues. President Nixon declined the offer to buy 1 million bpd of crude oil at $1/barrel. In 1973, Nixon replaced the MOIQ with an import licensing fee system as U.S. oil production levels were not meeting demand. Iran was not part of the 1973 oil embargo by Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. The 1973 oil embargo by OAPEC led to rising petroleum prices and U.S. laws to secure oil supply. Iran's oil revenue increased from 1973 to 1978, with U.S. crude oil imports doubling. However, in 1979, the Iranian revolution resulted in Iran becoming an Islamic republic, leading to a decline in oil production and a significant supply disruption. Sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States have targeted Iran's oil sector for nearly three decades, aiming to deter state-supported terrorism, Iran's regional influence, and its nuclear program. These sanctions include prohibiting imports of Iranian crude oil to the United States and targeting various elements of Iran's oil production, transportation, and exports. Sanctions targeting Iran's oil sector have been in place for nearly three decades to deter state-supported terrorism, Iran's regional influence, and its nuclear program. Legislation enacted in December 2011, such as the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, created a sanctions framework to reduce Iran's oil export revenue through financial sanctions on foreign financial institutions. Sanctions on foreign financial institutions conducting significant transactions with Iran's Central Bank or sanctioned Iranian banks can continue if countries reduce imports from Iran. The framework includes a 180-day wind-down period, exceptions for institutions reducing Iran oil purchases, consideration of global oil prices, and outreach to other oil-producing countries. Financial institutions in countries significantly reducing oil purchases from Iran are exempt from sanctions. The President can grant Significant Reduction Exceptions (SREs) to countries that reduce oil purchases from Iran, valid for 180 days. The Administration has discretion to determine economic pressure levels, considering global oil supply and prices. The President must assess non-Iranian petroleum availability every 90 days and base decisions on reports from the Energy Information Administration. Oil market conditions could lead to price escalation. Market conditions, undersupply situation, escalated prices may lead to sanctions relief, flexibility in determining oil market adequacy, President to encourage oil-producing countries to increase supplies, discussions with Saudi Arabia and UAE for additional oil supply, President issued E.O. 13622 for additional Iran sanctions. President Obama issued E.O. 13622 in 2012 for additional Iran sanctions, which were revoked to comply with the Iran nuclear deal. President Trump reinstated the sanctions with E.O. 13846 in 2018, strengthening the NDAA sanctions framework regarding Iran's oil exports. This includes prohibiting access to the U.S. financial system for foreign financial institutions conducting significant transactions with Iran's National Iranian Oil Company and authorizing sanctions on entities engaging in significant transactions for Iranian petroleum products. International negotiations led to agreements that initially relieved and then waived sanctions on Iran's oil exports. President Trump withdrew from these agreements and reimposed sanctions. The Joint Plan of Action (JPA) was an interim agreement from 2014 to 2016 that removed requirements for Iran's oil buyers to reduce purchases. The Joint Plan of Action (JPA) removed requirements for Iran's oil buyers to reduce purchases. Sanctions on insurance, transportation services, and petrochemical exports were suspended. The United States ended JCPOA participation, re-imposing sanctions on Iran's oil exports. Secondary sanctions targeting Iran's oil exports have significantly reduced Iran's crude oil production and export volumes. Between December 2011 and July 2012, exports declined by 1.2 million bpd, or nearly 57%. Iran's oil production followed a similar trend. SREs were issued to eight countries in November 2018 but are no longer allowed as of May 2019. Following the implementation of the JCPOA, Iran's oil production and exports returned to pre-FY2012 NDAA levels. However, after the United States exited the JCPOA in May 2018, production and exports declined, stabilizing once SREs were granted to eight countries in November 2018. As of May 2, 2019, the Trump Administration no longer intends to grant SREs, leading to a significant decline in observable exports from Iran based on October 2019 volumes. Despite this, Iran's crude oil exports to certain independent refiners in China have continued, with analysts expecting this trade relationship to persist. Russia remains one of the largest oil producers and exporters globally. Russia is one of the largest oil producers and exporters in the world, with crude oil production surpassing that of any other country in 2018. The country also holds the sixth largest proven oil reserves. The oil industry in Russia dates back to the 1870s, with significant growth during the Soviet era. Soviet oil policy decisions in the 1920s and 1950s led to historical developments in the oil industry, including export campaigns and the creation of OPEC in 1960. By 1987, the Soviet Union was the world's largest oil producer, but production declined to 10.3 million bpd in 1991 when the Russian Federation was established. Oil production in the Russian Federation declined after the establishment of the country in 1991 but recovered to 10.8 million bpd by 2013. Approximately 46% of federal revenue in 2018 came from the oil and gas sector. Sanctions were imposed on Russia's oil sector following the invasion of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. Sanctions imposed on Russia's oil sector target access to debt finance and technology for oil exploration and production projects. The Department of the Treasury maintains a list of Russian entities subject to these sectoral sanctions. Directives 2 and 4 prohibit certain transactions with Russian oil companies listed on the SSI list. The Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 created a framework for these sanctions. Directive 4 sanctions under the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 allow the President to impose secondary sanctions on foreign entities investing in special Russian crude oil projects. The Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 strengthened Directives 2 and 4, limiting Russian oil companies' access to U.S. financial institutions. Directive 2 of CRIEEA limits Russian oil companies on the SSI list from accessing U.S. debt with a maturity longer than 60 days, reducing their access to debt capital. This could lead to higher borrowing costs and difficulty in financing company activities, potentially affecting Russia's near-term oil production. However, these companies have been able to secure alternative sources of finance domestically. Directive 4 prohibits U.S. entities from supporting Russian oil projects in deepwater, Arctic offshore, and shale. The sanctions now apply to projects anywhere if owned or controlled by a sanctioned Russian entity. The U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced export restrictions on Russia in July 2014 to prohibit the export of items for complex oil projects. These sanctions aim to hinder Russia's long-term oil resource development plans. The US has a framework for secondary sanctions on non-US entities investing in Russian crude oil projects. The framework includes nine sanctions, with at least three to be imposed if significant investments are made. Despite increasing oil production in Russia, secondary sanctions have not yet been imposed. Russian oil production has been increasing, reaching 11.45 million bpd in December 2018 before declining to 11.1 million bpd in May 2019. Uncertainty surrounds future production due to potential sanctions impacting foreign investment in Russian crude oil projects. Russian oil production declined from 11.45 million bpd in December 2018 to 11.1 million bpd in May 2019. Factors contributing to this decline include a voluntary OPEC+ oil production agreement and oil contamination in Russia's Druzhba pipeline. Despite challenges, Russian oil production has increased during periods of low prices, attributed to factors such as securing alternative finance sources and currency devaluation. Financial sanctions imposed on certain Russian oil companies required them to find alternative capital sources, potentially causing financial stress. Sanctioned Russian oil companies managed to avoid financial stress by using Russia's international currency reserves and securing alternative finance sources. Rosneft, for example, borrowed money from the domestic bond market, sold minority ownership positions to Chinese and Indian companies, raised cash through equity sales, and sold a 19.5% ownership position to the Qatari Investment Authority and Glencore for $11.3 billion in 2016. Following the imposition of sanctions in mid-2014 and declining oil prices, the Russian ruble lost value against the U.S. dollar. The Central Bank allowed the ruble exchange rate to be market-determined, leading to a significant devaluation. This devaluation, while negative for the Russian economy, benefited Russian oil companies as their export sales are in dollars while expenses are in rubles. Russia's oil production increased despite declining oil prices due to factors like currency devaluation and tax policies that support profitability. The country's oil tax framework includes the mineral extraction tax (MET) and export duty (ED), both linked to benchmark oil prices. This incentivizes oil companies to maintain and increase production even at low oil price levels. The Russian government's tax and duty structure for oil production is designed to shift financial risk from low oil prices to the government and benefits from high prices. This system motivates Russian oil companies to increase production regardless of market prices. The tax maneuver will gradually eliminate export duty and increase the mineral extraction tax by 2024. The Russian government plans to gradually eliminate export duty and increase the mineral extraction tax by 2024 for crude oil production. Uncertainty surrounds Russia's ability to maintain or increase oil production post-2019 under U.S. and EU sanctions. Forecasts suggest oil production will rise through 2021 and then slightly decline by 2024. Russian oil companies may need to develop new resources to sustain production levels beyond 2024. Some projects have been impacted by sanctions, such as Exxon withdrawing from joint ventures. Exxon and European oil companies have withdrawn from joint venture projects with Russian companies due to oil sector sanctions. This includes projects in deepwater, Arctic offshore, and shale locations. Russian shale oil resources are significant, but development has slowed since 2014 sanctions. The future of oil production growth in Russia will depend on Russian companies' ability to acquire necessary technology. Russia has been developing plans to reduce reliance on oil production equipment imports since the imposition of sanctions in 2014. Venezuelan oil reserves are the largest globally, estimated at 303 billion barrels. U.S. oil companies sought agreements to explore and produce oil in Venezuela as early as 1919. In 1976, Venezuela nationalized its oil industry, creating PdVSA. U.S. oil companies reduced investments but remained active in a limited role. Oil production declined from 3.7 million bpd in 1970 to 1.6 million bpd by 1988. In the 1990s, PdVSA initiated the apertura petrolera program, allowing international oil companies to control certain operations. In the 1990s, international oil companies like Exxon and Conoco were allowed to control oil field operations in Venezuela, increasing oil production to 3.4 million bpd by 1998. President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez threatened to reverse this program and enacted the Hydrocarbons Law of 2001, requiring PdVSA to have majority ownership of oil developments and raising royalty payments. This reduced the financial attractiveness of investing in Venezuela's oil sector. In response to the Hydrocarbons Law of 2001, some oil companies complied with new ownership requirements by PdVSA, while others like Exxon and Conoco ceased operations and sued for damages. Oil production in Venezuela remained stable around 2.5 million bpd from 2007 to 2013. After Ch\u00e1vez's death, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro became president, leading to sanctions by the US due to antidemocratic actions and human rights violations. In 2017, President Trump imposed financial sanctions on PdVSA, limiting its access to US debt finance and prohibiting dividends and cash distributions. The United States imposed sanctions on PdVSA in 2017, limiting its access to US debt finance and prohibiting dividends and cash distributions. In January 2019, the US recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3 as interim president of Venezuela and imposed further sanctions aimed at reducing Venezuela's oil revenues, effectively terminating US-Venezuela petroleum trade. These sanctions make it difficult for PdVSA to purchase oil-related services and equipment, sell crude oil, and obtain petroleum products from non-US entities. The US imposed sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector, including PdVSA, through executive orders and Treasury designations. These actions restrict US persons from engaging in transactions with entities involved in deceptive practices or corruption related to the Venezuelan government. The US imposed sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector, including PdVSA, through executive orders and Treasury designations. The Secretary of the Treasury determined that persons operating in Venezuela's oil sector are subject to sanctions, with PdVSA added to the Specifically Designated Nationals (SDN) list. GLs issued by the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) authorize certain transactions with PdVSA for specific periods, affecting U.S. companies in areas like debt, financial transactions, oil field services, and oil production activities. E.O. 13884 blocks property and interests in the US for entities assisting PdVSA and the Venezuelan government, effectively ending US-Venezuela petroleum trade. GL 12 allowed U.S. companies to continue purchasing crude oil and petroleum products from PdVSA until April 28, 2019, with payments deposited in a U.S.-based blocked account. Exporting diluents from the U.S. to Venezuela was prohibited immediately. Chevron and four oil service companies were granted a GL to continue operating in Venezuela. The GL allowing U.S. companies to purchase oil from PdVSA has been extended multiple times and is set to expire on April 22, 2020. Treasury guidance and E.O. 13884 may lead to sanctions on non-U.S. entities dealing with PdVSA. OFAC FAQs prohibit non-U.S. entities from petroleum purchases involving the U.S. financial system. This could make it challenging for PdVSA to find alternative buyers for oil previously destined for the U.S. E.O. 13884 allows for blocking property of entities determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. The potential for sanctions on entities transacting with PdVSA in the U.S. may complicate their oil sales and procurement efforts. Venezuelan oil production declined by 50% between August 2017 and January 2019 due to aging infrastructure and sanctions on PdVSA. U.S. imports of Venezuelan oil have decreased significantly. Sanctions imposed on PdVSA in 2017 led to a 50% decline in Venezuelan oil production between August 2017 and January 2019. This made it challenging for PdVSA to access financial resources and affected its ability to pay for oil-related services and equipment. The production decline accelerated after the sanctions, although production had been decreasing since 2014. Oil production in Venezuela had been declining since 2014, reaching approximately 1 million bpd in January 2019. US imports of Venezuelan crude oil dropped by 50% between January and February 2019, eventually reducing to zero due to sanctions. Venezuela sought alternative buyers like India and China, with exports to these countries increasing by 49%. Venezuela's crude oil exports to India and China increased by 49% and 34% respectively between January and February 2019. Sanctions on PdVSA prohibit transactions involving the U.S. financial system after April 28, 2019, impacting oil markets and making it challenging for PdVSA to find alternative buyers for oil previously destined for the United States. The impacts of Iran and Venezuela supply reductions on oil markets have been reflected in price relationships and trade flow patterns. Despite potential price escalation, an increase in oil production in other countries, trade flow adjustments, and slowing oil demand growth rates have helped avert significant price increases. Higher oil production and export volumes from the United States, Russia, and other oil-producing countries have helped mitigate upward price pressure. Considerations for sanctions that impact oil and petroleum product prices have been explicit and implied. Enacted sanctions legislation targeting Iran's oil exports requires the Administration to certify adequate global oil supply and coordinate with other oil-producing countries to minimize price impacts. Wind-down periods allow markets to adjust for trade constraints, minimizing potential price increases for oil buyers and consumers. Existing oil-related sanctions policy lacks considerations for possible oversupply, which could lead to sharply lower oil prices under certain sanctions. The potential relief of certain sanctions could lead to lower oil prices, benefiting U.S. consumers temporarily but negatively impacting exploration, production, and exports. Benchmark prices reflect the value of crude oil and are used to establish baseline prices adjusted for quality and transportation costs. Brent crude oil represents North Sea prices. Brent crude oil, a benchmark price for global oil, saw a significant drop in prices from August 2019 to December 2011. However, this price behavior is not solely attributed to oil sanctions but is influenced by various factors such as global supply and demand balances, production outages, economic forecasts, and OPEC decisions. Benchmark prices are volatile and can quickly change due to market variables. The Trump Administration's announcement in May 2018 regarding the US exiting the JCPOA led to expectations of sanctions on Iran's oil exports, causing Saudi Arabia and Russia to increase oil production. However, the Administration granted waivers to eight countries in November 2018, resulting in a temporary oversupply and a decline in oil prices. The Trump Administration's announcement in May 2018 regarding the US exiting the JCPOA led to expectations of sanctions on Iran's oil exports. This caused Saudi Arabia and Russia to increase oil production. However, waivers were granted to eight countries in November 2018, leading to a temporary oversupply and a decline in oil prices. The oversupply created market conditions that required Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other OPEC+ members to manage. Additionally, petroleum sanctions imposed on Venezuela prohibited petroleum trade with the United States, resulting in U.S. refiners seeking alternative suppliers during the 90-day wind-down period. This led to an increase in prices for medium and heavy crude oils. The price impact of the sanctions on Venezuela led to an increase in prices for medium and heavy crude oils, narrowing the price differential between different crude oil types. U.S. refiners had to source substitute crude oil from other suppliers and adjust refinery operations to process other crude. Sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have affected global oil logistics, leading to adjustments in oil export and trade. Countries like the United States, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have provided alternative oil supplies to compensate for the constraints. U.S. refiners have modified operations to process different crude oil types, while crude oil exports from the United States have helped maintain adequate global oil supply. The growth in U.S. crude oil exports has been enabled by increasing production and the repeal of a 40-year export prohibition. Monthly export volumes have reached 3 million bpd in 2019. South Korea reduced imports from Iran and turned to U.S. crude oil following the U.S. decision to exit the JCPOA. Following the U.S. decision to exit the JCPOA, South Korea reduced imports from Iran and increased imports of U.S. crude oil. Similarly, China's oil trade flows adjusted as imports from Iran declined, leading to increased imports from Saudi Arabia and Russia. China also saw a decline in imports of U.S. crude oil, potentially influenced by trade negotiations and tariffs imposed in September 2019. Sanctions on PdVSA have halted U.S.-Venezuela petroleum trade, leading PdVSA to seek new buyers and suppliers. Venezuela's crude oil exports to the U.S. ceased in 2019, but exports to China and India have remained steady. Oil exports to other countries have increased since the sanctions. Sanctions on entities transacting with PdVSA through the U.S. financial system could impact non-U.S. entities' purchases of Venezuelan crude oil. PdVSA has turned to Russia for diluent products after U.S. sanctions, leading to lower diluent imports and potentially lower crude oil production. Sanctions on Iran, Russia, and Venezuela have had global effects on oil markets, prices, and trade flows. Sanctions on Iran, Russia, and Venezuela have global effects on oil markets, prices, and trade flows. U.S. foreign policy objectives may impact supply, prices, and the U.S. oil production sector. Sanctions relief for Iran could lead to lower oil prices and affect U.S. oil production and exports. Additional sanctions on Russia could also impact its oil sector. The Administration has strengthened oil-related sanctions on Venezuela. The Administration has strengthened oil-related sanctions on Venezuela through the use of E.O.s and administrative actions. Legislation introduced in the 116th Congress would codify some of these sanctions. Iran oil trade sanctions are the most stringent of the three frameworks discussed in this report, with explicit considerations for economic impacts on oil supply and potential high oil prices. The framework lacks provisions to assess the potential for global oil market oversupply if these sanctions are relieved. Iran's potential reentry into the oil market post-sanctions relief could lead to a significant increase in supply, causing oil prices to decrease. This could pose challenges for oil producers, as sustained low prices may impact their business and financial conditions. In 2018, the United States surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia in total petroleum production. Low oil prices could lead to reductions in U.S. oil production and challenging business conditions. OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, has at times not adjusted production levels, causing declining prices and financial strain on U.S. oil producers. In response, OPEC, Russia, and other non-OPEC countries entered into a production agreement in 2016 to address oversupply and low prices. The No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels (NOPEC) Act was introduced in December 2016 to address market oversupply and low oil prices. The United States, as the world's largest petroleum consumer, is also one of the largest and fastest-growing oil producers. Economic sensitivity to oil price levels has been rebalanced to reflect the interests of consumers and producers. If oil export sanctions on Iran are lifted, the market would need to adjust to additional Iranian barrels reentering the market, potentially leading to lower prices or OPEC+ production restraint. Global benchmark oil prices could be affected depending on market conditions and the volume of Iranian oil reintroduced. If oil export sanctions on Iran are lifted, global benchmark oil prices could face downward pressure due to the reentry of Iranian oil. This could impact all oil producers, including U.S. companies. The uncertainty remains on whether OPEC and other OPEC+ countries will adjust production levels to accommodate the additional Iranian barrels. One possible solution to mitigate downside price risk from sanctions relief could involve communication with other oil producers. Congressional interest in imposing sanctions on Russia's energy sector, including oil production, has been growing. The current Russia oil-sector sanctions framework has not affected near-term oil production but may impact future production. Comparing with Iran's oil export sanctions, exploring the potential applicability of Iran's framework to Russia is of interest. Considerations include the size of oil production, pipeline integration with Europe, and U.S. institutional investor ownership of Russian oil companies. Transneft, Russia's state-controlled oil pipeline company, transports 83% of crude oil produced in Russia, including the Druzhba pipeline. The Druzhba pipeline network in Russia supplies crude oil to European refineries optimized for Russian oil. Implementing Iran-like sanctions on Russian oil buyers could be challenging due to pipeline logistics and limited access to alternative suppliers. Unlike Iran, accessing non-Russian oil supplies through pipelines is complex. This poses difficulties in applying Iran's oil trade sanctions framework to Russia's oil sector, which also involves U.S. institutional investor ownership. Sanctions targeting Russia's oil sector could impact U.S. investors with ownership in major Russian oil companies like Rosneft and Lukoil. Legislation in the 116th Congress aims to impose additional sanctions on Russia's energy sector, potentially affecting the value of Russian oil companies and investments held by U.S. investors. The bill proposed mandatory sanctions on persons/entities investing in or supporting Russian energy export pipelines, including Transneft, which transports 83% of Russia's oil. Sanctions could impact oil flows and prices for European refineries reliant on Russian crude oil. Provisions related to export pipeline sanctions were removed from the bill in December 2019. The bill proposed sanctions on investments in Russian energy sector, including oil production, and required sanctions on foreign firms investing in Russia's energy sector. It also mandated sanctions on individuals/entities supporting energy projects outside Russia backed by Russian-owned entities. The existing sanctions framework extends to any crude oil development in the Russian Federation, not just limited to deepwater, Arctic offshore, and shale developments. Sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector prohibit transactions with PdVSA, potentially targeting non-U.S. entities supporting the Venezuelan government. Despite the elimination of petroleum trade between the U.S. and Venezuela, enforcement actions have mainly focused on companies and vessels transporting oil to Cuba. Venezuela's crude oil exports to India and China have continued despite U.S. sanctions imposed in January 2019. Trade reports indicate that Venezuela's oil exports are managed by a Rosneft trading office, which has provided PdVSA with diluent cargos and participates in joint venture oil production projects in Venezuela. The potential violation of U.S. sanctions by these activities is under review by the Administration, with Rosneft arguing that it is not a sanctions violation. No enforcement action has been taken yet. Legislation enacted in December 2019 requires international cooperation to impose sanctions on the Maduro government. The U.S. legislation P.L. 116-94 expresses concern about PdVSA transactions with Rosneft, particularly a loan collateralized by 49% ownership of Citgo. Sanctions targeting oil sectors in Iran, Russia, and Venezuela have impacted oil markets, causing supply reductions, price changes, and trade flow adjustments. Current oil-related sanctions frameworks aim to prevent price increases from sanctions but do not consider potential oversupply and price decreases if sanctions are lifted. Potential sanctions-related price escalation has been counterbalanced by increased global supplies, lower demand growth rate expectations, and market adjustments. Sanctions relief could be considered to increase oil supply and rebalance markets if benchmark prices become too high for U.S. consumers, but this may conflict with broader foreign policy objectives."
