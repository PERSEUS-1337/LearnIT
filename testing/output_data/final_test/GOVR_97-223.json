Permits are issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA under the Clean Water Act, Rivers and Harbors Act, and Marine Protection Act. The Corps issues general permits for minor actions and individual permits for significant actions. Nationwide permits authorize activities nationwide under specific conditions. Nationwide permits, authorized under the Clean Water Act and Rivers and Harbors Act, cover a range of activities in U.S. waters. These permits are issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA for a maximum of five years and cannot be extended. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA issue nationwide permits for activities in U.S. waters, valid for up to five years. The permits automatically expire if not modified or reissued within five years. In 2017, the Corps reissued and modified the permits, sparking debate on balancing regulatory protection for aquatic resources and maintaining an efficient regulatory system. Industry groups have criticized the program's effectiveness in achieving these objectives. The Corps' regulatory authority under the Clean Water Act covers waters of the United States, including navigable waterways, tributaries, wetlands, and isolated waters. Public concern about the nationwide permit program often focuses on projects impacting wetlands, leading to controversies and disputes between industry groups and environmental advocacy groups. The nationwide permit program under the Corps' regulatory authority has drawn controversies and disputes, especially regarding its assessment of minimal environmental impacts. Critics argue that the Corps lacks an effective tracking system to evaluate impacts, leading to inadequate information for assessing the program. Congress has previously addressed issues with the program, including in oversight hearings in 1997 and directives to the Corps in 1999 and 2000. Stakeholder interest groups are concerned about program complexity and coordination. General permits, such as nationwide permits, aim to reduce the burden and delay of the Corps' regulatory program by allowing landowners or developers to proceed with covered activities without obtaining individual permits. These permits have an average processing time of 40 days in FY2016, compared to individual permits which involve longer processing times due to public notice, review, and evaluation requirements. Permits under CWA Section 404(e) require Corps approval with an average processing time of 40 days, contrasting with individual permits that take 217 days on average. General permits aim to have minimal adverse environmental impact and can be issued on a State, regional, or nationwide basis for similar activities. The Corps authorizes an average of 63,000 activities per year, with 97% approved by nationwide and general permits. Some activities require advance notification and written verification, while others can proceed without application unless certain conditions apply. Examples of nationwide permits include placement of aids to navigation and stream or river bank stabilization. Activities authorized by nationwide permits include installation according to U.S. Coast Guard requirements, stream or river bank stabilization to prevent erosion, minor dredging of up to 25 cubic yards, restoration of wetlands and riparian areas with a net increase in aquatic resource functions, and discharges for residential development construction or expansion. Specific conditions and terms, such as maximum acreage limitations, apply to many permits, along with general conditions like avoiding adverse effects on navigation and protecting threatened or endangered species. The Corps issues nationwide permits for activities such as installation, bank stabilization, dredging, and wetland restoration. These permits require avoidance of sensitive areas and mitigation of impacts on the aquatic environment. Coordination with other agencies may be necessary for projects impacting specified acreage of waters or stream bed. The Corps considers agency comments on compliance and mitigation but is not obligated to adopt recommendations. NWPs encourage minimizing environmental impacts. The Corps issues nationwide permits for activities like installation, bank stabilization, dredging, and wetland restoration, requiring avoidance of sensitive areas and mitigation of impacts on the aquatic environment. NWPs encourage minimizing environmental impacts to qualify for authorization, as standard individual permits have no acreage limits. Compliance with NWP regulations and conditions is necessary for project proponents seeking authorization. The Corps issues nationwide permits for activities like installation, bank stabilization, dredging, and wetland restoration, requiring avoidance of sensitive areas and mitigation of impacts on the aquatic environment. NWPs encourage minimizing environmental impacts to qualify for authorization. Compliance with NWP regulations and conditions is necessary for project proponents seeking authorization. The Corps first issued regulations for general permits in the mid-1970s, and Congress codified the concept in amendments to the Clean Water Act in 1977. Nationwide and other general permits are valid for five years and were reissued in 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997. In the 1992 revisions, district engineers were given greater authority to modify, suspend, or revoke nationwide permits for specific activities. In 1992, district engineers were given discretionary authority to revoke nationwide permits in high value aquatic areas, requiring individual permits. Preconstruction notification to the Corps was necessary for some permits, with a wetlands delineation required. The Corps had 45 days to approve or require an individual permit. The reissued nationwide permits in 1992 did not cause much controversy. In 1997, the Corps modified permits to minimize adverse effects on wetlands, regionalize the program, and restrict NWP 26 due to concerns about unmonitored wetland losses. In 1997, the Corps modified permits to minimize adverse effects on wetlands, regionalize the program, and restrict NWP 26 due to concerns about unmonitored wetland losses. In 2000, NWP 26 was repealed and replaced with five specific activity-based permits, along with added general conditions for projects in critical resource waters and wetland fills in the 100-year floodplain. The entire NWP package was reissued in 2002. The Corps reissued the NWP package in 2002, 2007, and 2012, adding new permits and general conditions. New authorizations include permits for discharges in ditches, coal mining activities, and renewable energy facilities. Each reissuance led to new issues and controversies, such as modifications to residential development permits in 2007. Industry groups criticized changes, while environmental groups called for stricter acreage thresholds. Environmental groups pushed for stricter acreage thresholds under the permit, particularly focusing on NWP 21 for surface coal mining activities. The Corps modified NWP 21 in 2012 to address concerns about aquatic resource protection. Industry groups opposed the restrictions, while environmental groups wanted to halt its use. The Corps reissued and modified the NWPs in 2016, with final revised permits taking effect in 2017 and expiring in 2022. The reissued permits include 50 existing NWPs, with modifications to 29 of them and the addition of two new permits. The reissued permits include modifications to 29 of the 50 existing NWPs and the addition of two new nationwide permits. One of the new permits, NWP 53, authorizes the removal of low-head dams to restore rivers and enhance public safety. The new permit NWP 27 authorizes removal of larger low-head dams for aquatic habitat restoration activities, with estimated usage of 25 times per year impacting less than 1 acre of waters of the United States. NWP 54 allows construction of living shorelines for erosion control using nature-based techniques like vegetation or oyster reefs. The Corps believes a nationwide permit is necessary for constructing living shorelines using nature-based techniques like vegetation or oyster reefs for added stability in sheltered coasts. This permit would be used approximately 200 times per year, impacting about 27.5 acres of waters of the United States, including wetlands. The agency estimates that under the reissued permits, about 492 additional activities per year could be authorized by NWPs. The Corps prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis for the proposal and decision documents related to the reissued Nationwide Permits (NWPs). These documents contain environmental assessments for each proposed NWP to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The decision documents provide a national-scale analysis of environmental impacts, statutory authority, alternatives, public interest review factors, and cumulative effects analysis for activities authorized by the permits. The NWPs could authorize 492 additional activities per year compared to the 2012 NWPs. The Corps' estimates for each NWP usage, impacts on waters of the United States, compensatory mitigation acreage, and requirements for activities with adverse effects on the aquatic environment are detailed in the documents. Some NWPs will have limited impact, while others will impact hundreds of acres with compensatory mitigation. The Corps estimates that the 2017 NWPs would authorize 63,437 activities annually impacting 20,346 acres, with 2,374 acres of required compensatory mitigation. Interest groups argue that the nationwide permit program fails to meet its objectives, with environmental advocacy groups expressing concerns. The nationwide permit program aims to balance minimal impacts on aquatic resources with a fair regulatory system for permit applicants. However, the program has become increasingly restrictive and complex, straying from the streamlined process Congress intended. The program waivers between providing relief and imposing red tape, making it difficult for projects to qualify. The NWP program has become severely limited over time, with eligibility restrictions consistently tightening. Industry groups support the program but criticize aspects like the Corps' attempt to expand jurisdiction and inflexible thresholds. Environmental groups argue that the permit package lacks proper administrative support, citing concerns about the impact on aquatic resources and the absence of scientific evidence to justify the permits. They criticize vague PCN requirements, excessive authority granted to Corps district engineers, and an overreliance on waivers for permit limits. The current nationwide permit NWP 12 authorizes utility line activities in waters of the United States, including the construction, maintenance, or repair of utility lines for various purposes. This permit has been controversial with environmental critics and has drawn attention from tribal organizations in relation to oil and natural gas pipeline projects. The Corps' regulatory authority under the CWA and RHA applies to areas where pipeline or utility line activities cross waters of the United States or federal real property managed by the Corps for flood control and navigation projects. Verification for NWP 12 authorization is required before work can begin, with additional steps needed if threatened species, endangered species, critical habitat, or historic properties are involved. The Corps has jurisdiction over a small portion of pipelines for flood control and navigation projects. NWP 12 is used approximately 14,000 times per year nationally, impacting 1,750 acres of waters, including wetlands regulated under the CWA. Some pipeline activities are not covered by NWP 12. Some pipeline and utility line activities do not qualify for a nationwide permit and require individual Corps permits due to significant environmental impacts. The Corps lacks a centralized database for tracking individual permits issued for these projects. General Condition 17 of the nationwide permit program ensures minimal adverse effects on tribal rights and resources. General Condition 17 of the nationwide permit program ensures minimal adverse effects on tribal resources, historic properties, and endangered species. Activities that may impact these areas require written verification from the Corps before proceeding. No activity can be authorized if it jeopardizes threatened or endangered species or critical habitats without consultation under the Endangered Species Act. Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act requires federal agencies to consider the effects of projects on historic properties. The Corps initiates Section 106 review and consultation with state, tribal, or Native Hawaiian preservation officials when properties are identified in a PCN. Consultation also occurs with federally recognized Indian tribes for projects affecting historic properties on tribal lands. Activity cannot proceed under General Condition 20 until a site-specific analysis is completed by the district engineer. The district engineer must complete a site-specific analysis and verify that the activity will not impact any eligible historic site before proceeding. The Advisory Council on Historical Preservation may be consulted for significant impacts, but does not have veto power. General Condition 21 requires immediate notification of any newly discovered historical remains, with coordination with tribes and agencies to determine if recovery efforts are needed. The Corps evaluates pipeline and utility line water crossings in a segmented fashion, using nationwide permits for each individual crossing, leading to criticism for not assessing the overall impacts of multiple crossings in a project. The Corps' segmented evaluation of pipeline and utility line water crossings using nationwide permits has faced criticism for not considering the cumulative environmental impacts of the entire project. Critics argue that this approach fails to account for the potential adverse effects on aquatic resources, but legal challenges have been largely unsuccessful. The nationwide permit process for NWP 12 does not allow for project-specific environmental review or public input. The Corps' environmental assessment for NWP 12 is a preauthorization of similar activities every five years, with the belief that environmental impacts will be minimal. Critics argue that private project proponents can determine their own project-specific impacts under nationwide permits. Under nationwide permits, private project proponents can determine impacts on endangered species or historic properties through a PCN submission. The Corps only responds to information in the PCN and recent legal controversies involve Corps' compliance with NHPA for pipeline permits. Applicants must show efforts to minimize impacts on aquatic resources and provide compensatory mitigation for unavoidable impacts. Compensatory mitigation is required for activities impacting wetlands, streams, or aquatic resources under nationwide permits. Mitigation can include restoration, creation, enhancement, or preservation of aquatic resources. District engineers may require compensatory mitigation to offset authorized impacts. Mitigation requirements have become more specific over time and are considered important by environmental advocates. Compensatory mitigation is required for wetland losses exceeding 1/10-acre and needing preconstruction notification. The Corps revised the mandate in 2002 to allow waivers on a case-by-case basis for alternative forms of mitigation, such as vegetated buffers. Mitigation for impacts is based on a watershed approach, involving a mix of vegetated buffers and other non-wetland area mitigation. The Corps allows district engineers to require mitigation for project impacts that best protect the aquatic environment. Environmentalists criticize the Corps' reliance on mitigation, citing reports showing that mitigation projects are not fully successful in compensating for wetlands lost to permitted fills. Critics argue that mitigation does not fully compensate for wetlands lost to permitted fills, questioning the Corps' reliance on mitigation without sufficient evidence of its success in replacing lost functions and values. They believe that activities requiring mitigation have more than minimal adverse effects, which should only be authorized by individual permits under the Clean Water Act. Additionally, they point out that relying on mitigation to assume impacts are reduced below significance violates the National Environmental Policy Act. The Corps acknowledges the varying success of mitigation but emphasizes its importance in ensuring minimal adverse impacts from nationwide permits. The Corps emphasizes the importance of mitigation in ensuring minimal adverse effects from nationwide permits. Compensatory mitigation is required for wetland losses exceeding 1/10-acre under NWPs, with industry criticizing the Corps for prioritizing compensation over other forms of mitigation. Environmental groups oppose waivers from mitigation requirements and discretion given to district engineers, citing a lack of criteria or performance standards in NWPs. In 2008, the Corps and EPA established regulations for mitigating wetland and aquatic resource loss under the Section 404 permit program. The rules require developers to provide compensatory mitigation plans with 12 fundamental components. The regulations emphasize avoiding impacts to aquatic resources and only allowing mitigation when impacts are unavoidable. The Corps also modified some language in the nationwide permits in 2012. In 2012, the Corps modified language in nationwide permits to conform to regulations. The use of permits for coal mining, especially NWP 21, is controversial due to environmental concerns. Critics argue coal mining has greater impacts than allowed, while the industry sees permits as necessary for flexibility and economic viability. The Corps has adjusted NWP 21 to enhance environmental protection for projects. The Corps has modified NWP 21 to strengthen environmental protection for projects it authorizes, adding limits on stream bed loss. Environmentalists argue NWP 21 allows disposal of coal mining waste, impacting water quality and habitats. Mitigation may not adequately offset these impacts, contradicting the goal of minimal adverse effects on the aquatic environment. The Corps has allowed mountaintop mining activities using NWP 21, which involves removing mountain tops to access coal seams. Environmentalists want stricter regulations due to environmental concerns, while the mining industry argues it is necessary for economic reasons. The Corps suspended the use of NWP 21 for mountaintop mining in Appalachia in 2010 to evaluate impacts through individual permits with increased public involvement. In 2010, the Corps suspended the use of NWP 21 for mountaintop mining in Appalachia to evaluate impacts through individual permits. In 2012, acreage limits were added to NWP 21 outside of Appalachia, and permits 49 and 50 were introduced to incentivize coal remining and underground mining activities. Permittees meeting specified terms and conditions can gain faster authorization under an NWP, benefiting the environment by encouraging coal remining. The Corps estimates that permits 49 and 50 will authorize 18 activities annually impacting 55 acres of wetlands and waters, requiring 39 acres of compensatory mitigation. NWP 21 will authorize seven surface coal mining activities impacting 1.3 acres per year. Environmental critics argue that surface coal mining activities have significant impacts on waters and wetlands, requiring compensatory mitigation. They claim that coal mining waste contains toxic chemicals harmful to aquatic life, with cases of spills causing more than minimal harm. Critics also highlight the destructive nature of underground mining, leading to loss of stream and wetland functions. They question the appropriateness of the general permit process for large-scale activities and raise concerns about the nationwide permit program's balance between administrative simplicity and environmental protection. The Corps faces challenges in balancing administrative simplicity and environmental protection in the nationwide permit program. Industry stakeholders question the administrative requirements of permits, while the Corps can apply special conditions or revoke permits in high-value aquatic environments. Regional conditioning is used to protect wetlands and water resources at the local level. Regional conditioning is utilized to protect wetlands and water resources at the local level, with Corps division engineers and other entities imposing specific conditions to address concerns for the aquatic environment in different geographic regions. This may involve revoking NWP authorization for certain areas or watersheds, requiring landowners to obtain individual project-specific permits. The NWP program relies on regional conditioning to adjust to local watersheds, allowing division engineers to add special conditions or require individual permits. Stakeholders have concerns about the discretionary authority process, with some calling for more restrictive national standards on NWPs. The discretionary authority in the NWP program leads to complexity and unpredictability for regulated entities. Environmental groups doubt the Corps' ability to impose meaningful conditions, while developers fear overly burdensome restrictions. The Corps relies on regional conditioning to ensure minimal impacts, but critics question its effectiveness. Industry groups argue that regional conditions make NWPs more complex and burdensome for both the Corps and permit applicants. The implementation of the Corps' regulatory program, including nationwide permits, requires coordination between federal and state governments. States and tribes have a coordinating responsibility under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act to certify that proposed projects will not violate water quality standards. This coordination aims to minimize duplication and overlap in wetlands management and protection programs. The 34 states and territories operating under the Coastal Zone Management Act must provide concurrence for activities consistent with their CZM program. This process ensures water quality concerns are considered in federally licensed activities, allowing states to impose conditions or deny permits. Coordination between the Corps and states can lead to tensions, especially when certification or CZM concurrence is denied. Coordination for the issuance or reissuance of NWPs typically begins 12 months in advance. The Corps begins the process of issuing or reissuing NWPs approximately 12 months before expiration. A proposal is drafted and reviewed by federal agencies, followed by a 60-day public comment period. States are requested to issue, deny, or waive certification of the NWPs. District offices also solicit comments on proposed regional conditions and potential suspension or revocation of NWPs. The public comment period for district notices is typically 45 days. The 60-day public comment period for reviewing draft permits is necessary for states and tribes to issue their own certifications. The Corps reissues NWPs before expiration to avoid permit holders needing individual permits. Final NWPs are reviewed by federal agencies before becoming effective 60 days after publication. During the 60-day post-publication period, Corps division engineers approve regional conditions for final NWPs and issue decision documents certifying minimal adverse effects on the aquatic environment. States and Indian Tribes complete their 401 water quality certification and CZMA consistency decisions, which may include conditions or denials for specific NWPs. Conditions from certifications automatically become part of nationwide permits in that state. Many states have opposed certain nationwide permits, such as NWP 29 for residential developments, since 1997. About one-third of states have denied 401 certification due to inconsistencies with state water quality standards. Some states have prohibited the use of NWPs in critical areas or attached additional conditions to minimize water quality impacts. The Corps generally believes activities authorized by NWPs will comply with state water quality standards and CZM plans. If a state denies certification, the Corps may disagree on the consistency with state CZM programs. The Corps may deny authorization for activities within a state if they are not consistent with the state's CZM program. Provisional verification letters are issued for activities that meet NWP terms, contingent on obtaining necessary state certifications. States have concerns about the Corps not necessarily denying permits if a state denies certification. The Corps issues provisional verification of NWP authorization, putting pressure on states to certify projects. States want a 401 denial of an NWP to be treated as a veto, but the Corps may not always deny the permit based on state denial. The Corps believes state denial should not be the sole basis for requiring an individual permit. The Corps prefers that the burden of conditioning or restricting a project be with the state through issuance of a project-specific 401 certification or CZM consistency determination, unlike other Clean Water Act permits. States can seek approval of a programmatic general permit if qualified. The Corps prefers states to have regulatory authority through project-specific 401 certification or CZM consistency determination. States can seek approval for programmatic general permits, which streamline the regulatory process. Some states have PGP programs that replace federal permits, while others have full assumption of the 404 program. However, not all states are interested or able to seek these authorizations. Most states will continue to conduct 401 certification reviews, leading to potential conflicts over water quality certification. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires federal agencies to consult with FWS or NMFS if a planned action may harm endangered species or critical habitats. After consultation, a written biological opinion (BiOp) is provided detailing the impact on species. The Endangered Species Act mandates consultation with FWS or NMFS for actions that may harm species or habitats. A BiOp outlines impacts, with RPAs suggested if jeopardy is found. The Corps' regulatory programs must comply with ESA requirements to avoid harm to endangered species or critical habitats. The Endangered Species Act requires consultation with FWS or NMFS for activities that may harm species or habitats. General condition 18 of the NWP mandates ESA Section 7 consultation and preconstruction notification if listed species or critical habitat may be affected. The responsibility lies with the project proponent to determine the presence of listed species or critical habitat. The Corps' legal position is that issuing or reissuing NWPs does not directly impact listed species or critical habitat, as ESA consultation will occur on an activity-specific basis. Controversy surrounds the Corps' compliance with ESA requirements, especially since the NWPs were reissued. The Corps' compliance with ESA requirements has been questioned since the reissuance of NWPs in 2012. NMFS issued a BiOp in 2012 identifying jeopardy to marine species, but a new BiOp in 2014 reversed this finding due to Corps' plans for species protection. The Corps then provided guidance for coordination with NMFS local offices and requirements for permit applicants submitting a PCN. In 2012, NMFS raised concerns about Corps' compliance with ESA regarding the NWP program. Environmental advocates also expressed worries about endangered species. The Center for Biological Diversity threatened a lawsuit over ESA compliance, but it was not filed. Congress has shown interest in CWA permitting issues related to the NWP program in the past. In response to concerns raised about the nationwide permit program, hearings were held where witnesses criticized proposed changes as costly and potentially causing project delays. Administration witnesses defended the modifications, stating they would make the program fairer, more flexible, and responsive to environmental protection needs. Congress later addressed program costs and permit processing times in appropriations legislation. The Corps was directed by Congress to study the workload impacts and costs of compliance with the 2000 nationwide permits. Reports in March 2000 and August 2001 acknowledged increases in processing time and individual permit applications. Congress has not examined the nationwide permit program in over 15 years, despite ongoing concerns among stakeholders and interest groups. The Obama Administration's initiatives on nationwide permits have drawn congressional attention, particularly regarding surface coal mining activities in Appalachia. Recent controversies surrounding NWP 12 and its use in pipeline and utility line projects may increase congressional interest in the program. The list of nationwide permits issued in January 2017 will be effective from March 19, 2017, through March 18, 2022. More information is available at http://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/RegulatoryProgramandPermits/NationwidePermits.aspx. The list of nationwide permits issued in January 2017 includes various activities such as structures in artificial canals, maintenance, fish and wildlife harvesting, scientific measurement devices, outfall structures, oil and gas structures, bank stabilization, hydropower projects, response operations for oil and hazardous substances, and aquatic habitat restoration activities.
