    "content": "Electricity generation is crucial for the functioning of the United States. The electric power grid includes power plants, transmission lines, and distribution systems. The grid connects various utility companies across different states. While the grid has been reliable, it is vulnerable to natural, operational, and cybersecurity threats. Digital technologies have improved efficiency but also raised concerns about cybersecurity. The electric grid relies on internet-connected digital technologies to regulate and report on electricity flow, posing cybersecurity risks. The grid's industrial control system network manages power plant controls, transmission, and distribution substations. In 2015 and 2016, cyber attacks on distribution utility substations in Ukraine caused power outages affecting over 225,000 customers. The attacks targeted industrial control systems, including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which control geographically dispersed assets in the electric power industry. Foreign hackers have targeted the U.S. electric power system and critical infrastructure, including ICS networks of energy, manufacturing, communications, and nuclear entities. Cyber intrusions on the SCADA systems of the Bowman Dam in New York led to federal indictments against hackers linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Concerns have risen over the potential for damaging cyber attacks in the future. Foreign hackers have targeted electric company ICS networks in a reconnaissance campaign attributed to North Korea. US-CERT issued an alert about cyber intrusions at critical energy and manufacturing infrastructure companies. Russian government hackers conducted a multi-stage intrusion campaign on ICS networks. Further attacks on U.S. critical energy infrastructure are expected. This report discusses the current state of electric grid cybersecurity and efforts to ensure reliability. Efforts to ensure electric sector reliability are highlighted, including potential grid vulnerabilities and mutual dependency on critical infrastructure. Technologies and actions to address future threats are described, along with risks to technology-based cybersecurity defense systems. The need to build resilience into the grid for quicker recovery from cyber or physical security attacks is discussed, with FERC overseeing bulk-power system reliability under EPACT05. The Federal Power Act (FPA) aims to ensure reliable operation of the bulk power system to prevent instability or cascading failures. FERC has jurisdiction over users, owners, and operators, approving or sending back reliability standards proposed by NERC for Critical Infrastructure Protection. NERC updates standards considering reliability and cybersecurity concerns, addressing issues like vegetation clearances and policies for grid operation. The Federal Power Act gives FERC jurisdiction over reliability standards proposed by NERC for critical infrastructure protection, including cyber and physical security for power plants. Violators may face fines up to $1 million per violation. FERC's authority is limited to wholesale power sales and interstate transmission, while states oversee retail sales by distribution systems. EPACT05 excluded local regulation. In 2012, FERC approved NERC's criteria for defining the bulk electric system, including all Transmission Elements operated at 100 kV or higher. The increase in cyber attacks on U.S. critical energy infrastructure has raised federal government concerns. A cyber attack on the U.S. grid similar to those in Ukraine could have severe consequences. The U.S. grid faces potential financial and economic disruption from cyber attacks, prompting President Trump to issue Executive Order 13800 to strengthen cybersecurity. The order called for an assessment of the readiness to manage consequences of a cyber incident in the electric subsector, highlighting vulnerabilities in the cyber supply chain and information sharing. The FAST Act grants DOE new authority to order electric utilities and NERC to implement emergency security actions. DOE is the lead agency for the Energy sector's security, with a focus on cybersecurity. A new Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) has been established to enhance cybersecurity and energy security efforts. CESER will coordinate preparedness and response to threats to energy infrastructure security, following a five-year strategy to reduce cyber risks in the U.S. energy sector. The strategy focuses on strengthening energy sector cybersecurity preparedness through CRISP activities, coordinating cyber incident response, and accelerating research and development of resilient energy delivery systems. DOE's national laboratories will provide specialized cyber resources to help energy companies respond to cyber attacks. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released a revised voluntary Cybersecurity Framework in April 2018, focusing on a risk-based approach applicable to industries using IT technologies. The energy sector is designated as critical infrastructure, with the goal of strengthening and maintaining secure systems. The energy sector, including electricity, oil, and natural gas, is recognized as critical infrastructure under policy directive PPD-21. The National Research Council highlighted the vulnerability of the electric power delivery system to cyber and physical attacks, warning of potential widespread outages that could lead to chaos and public fear. A terrorist attack on the power grid could result in significant economic impacts, potentially costing hundreds of billions of dollars. The National Research Council warned about the vulnerability of the electric power delivery system to cyber and physical attacks, which could lead to widespread outages and chaos. Hackers could manipulate SCADA systems to disrupt electricity flow and disable protective systems. Cyber attacks may not cause long outages, but the combined cyber and physical attack could have severe consequences. A targeted cyber attack on the power grid could result in significant economic impacts, costing between $243 billion and $1 trillion. The attack could leave 15 states and 93 million people without power, leading to direct damage to assets, revenue loss for electricity companies, and disruption to the supply chain. The 2013 attack on the Metcalf substation in California highlighted the physical vulnerabilities of the grid. The 2013 attack on the Metcalf substation in California exposed physical vulnerabilities in the grid. Snipers targeted the substation, causing a blackout scare. The incident prompted FERC to direct NERC to develop a physical security standard. Concerns over cybersecurity have increased since a 2015 cyber attack in Ukraine. Increased concerns over the cybersecurity of interconnected U.S. electric power systems have been raised following the 2015 Ukraine cyber attack and blackouts. The potential for a well-planned cyber and physical attack on the grid could be complicated by the cost and vulnerability of critical components, such as high-voltage transformers. Strategic destruction of these transformers could lead to long-lasting power outages, as they are large, difficult to move, and have limited spare units available. Replacing them could take months or years due to their unique specifications. The availability of large components like high-voltage circuit breakers could hinder recovery efforts. NERC has mandatory standards for electricity reliability to protect the bulk electric system. The current standards, CIP Version 6, focus on increased security for BES assets and training for utility personnel. Regulatory approval is pending for several standards. NERC's CIP Version 5 mandated utility companies to focus on improving the security of critical assets by categorizing them as low or high impact and implementing encryption of grid command signals. It also required multiple levels of compliance based on potential impacts, monitoring of remote access connections, multiple-factor authentication, and incident response plans for BES cyber assets. NERC organizes GridEx every two years to test grid security response to cyber and physical attacks. The 2017 GridEx IV drill had over 6,500 participants from the US, Canada, and Mexico. NERC released a public report with lessons learned and recommendations to enhance grid security. The 2017 GridEx IV drill had over 6,500 participants from the US, Canada, and Mexico. A report was released with recommendations to enhance grid security, including increasing coordination between utilities and governments, enhancing information sharing capabilities, and promoting the Cyber Mutual Assistance Program for cybersecurity experts to share expertise during emergencies. NERC recommended more utilities participate in the program. NERC proposed increased participation in the CMA program by ESCC and E-ISAC to enhance information sharing for cybersecurity. The grid faces daily cyber threats, with attacks targeting industrial control systems connected to the Internet. ICS-CERT and private companies issue reports on vulnerabilities and cyber intrusions. For example, in 2017, Dragos reported on security issues. In 2017, the security firm Dragos found 163 new security vulnerabilities in industrial control devices, stating they were \"insecure-by-design\" and could cause severe operational impact. About 15% of these vulnerabilities could be used to gain initial access into a control network. Cyber intrusions on the electric grid have deposited malware on ICS networks, capable of causing damage or taking over system control. Mandiant reported responding to cyber attacks. The Mandiant consulting company responded to a cyber intrusion at a critical infrastructure organization involving malware targeting industrial safety systems. The malware, named TRITON, was designed to interact with Triconex Safety Instrumented System controllers, indicating a potential nation-state threat preparing for a high-impact attack with physical consequences. FireEye stated that the intrusion was not typical of a regular cyber attack. The cyber attack on Schneider Electric's Triconex equipment involved a zero-day vulnerability in the safety system firmware. Hackers used a remote access trojan in the second stage of their exploitation, a first for industrial control systems malware. The malware, named \"Industroyer\" or \"Crash Override,\" targeted a transmission system control center in Ukraine in 2016. The malware CrashOverride targets ICS systems by abusing their legitimate control system protocols. While not U.S.-focused, its tactics could be adapted for U.S.-based critical infrastructure. This is the second known malware designed to disrupt physical systems after STUXNET in 2010. All critical infrastructure organizations should assess their systems for vulnerabilities. In 2010, the STUXNET computer worm destroyed centrifuges in Iran for uranium enrichment. It later spread to other networks but only targeted specific equipment. In 2015, cyber attackers used BlackEnergy 2 malware to cause a grid failure in Ukraine. BlackEnergy malware targets routers, collects intelligence, and can render devices inoperable, posing a threat to critical infrastructure. BlackEnergy is a potential vulnerability for critical infrastructure companies as it is used in Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks to gather information and interact with industrial control systems. Cyber threats to the grid can also come from IoT devices targeted by botnet malware for cyber attacks. If IoT attacks access electric utility systems, they could impair operations or manipulate power networks. The electric utility industry relies on Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) systems for safe and efficient electricity production and delivery. IoT threats, such as false power demand readings from thermostats, can be mitigated through deliberate device design and maintenance practices. However, the global nature of hardware and software procurement poses security vulnerabilities in design, manufacture, and patch management practices, requiring consistent oversight to prevent compromised functionality. Managing cyber supply chain risks is crucial for ensuring grid security. Managing cyber supply chain risks is essential for ensuring the integrity, security, quality, and resilience of the supply chain and its products. Risks include insertion of counterfeits, unauthorized production, tampering, theft, and insertion of malicious software and hardware. Smart grid devices are vulnerable due to components sourced internationally, particularly from Taiwan, Singapore, China, and South Korea. The reliable operation of semiconductor and microprocessor-based devices relies on low-level firmware controlling basic functions. Firmware in electronic devices like programmable controllers can be covertly tampered with during manufacturing, affecting their reliability. Random testing of firmware in smarter grid products may not be sufficient to detect all impairments. Legacy systems are also at risk from potential supply chain vulnerabilities. Legacy systems pose supply chain vulnerabilities due to potential lack of security-focused patches during upgrades and repairs. In 2016, FERC directed NERC to develop a reliability standard for critical infrastructure protection, including security controls for industrial control system hardware, software, and services. The standard should address software integrity, vendor remote access, information system planning, and vendor risk management. FERC emphasizes the need for responsible procurement controls without a one-size-fits-all requirement. According to FERC, NERC submitted a petition for approval of the new Reliability Standard CIP-013-1, addressing supply chain risk management and proposed revisions to existing reliability standards. The new standards aim to establish cybersecurity risk management processes, identify vendor remote access sessions, and verify software integrity. The gaps in cybersecurity for electric power and energy systems, including regulatory jurisdiction and cost complexities, require further attention due to the potential impact of a major grid cybersecurity event. OT systems used by electric utilities are increasingly interconnected with IT systems, posing cybersecurity risks. OT networks often lack the same level of cybersecurity focus as IT systems, with OT systems sometimes directly connected to the Internet for remote access by third-party vendors. OT systems in electric utilities are often connected to the Internet for remote access, lacking modern security features. Economic challenges and human error, like falling for phishing attacks, contribute to cybersecurity breaches. Ukraine's case involved malware-carrying emails. Hackers in Ukraine used malware-carrying emails to gain access to control systems and cause blackouts at utilities. Better tools for securing email systems could reduce cyber threats. A new adversary named \"Covellite\" has been targeting electric utilities in the U.S., Europe, and East Asia with spear-phishing attacks similar to the Lazarus Group. Multi-factor authentication is a security method focused on the human factor. Multi-factor authentication requires two or more credentials to verify an individual's identity before accessing a network. FERC has authority over wholesale power sales and interstate electricity transmission, while states regulate retail sales. FERC's 2012 definition expanded BES regulation to include larger distribution system components. The distribution utilities are not under FERC's jurisdiction, and most distribution systems do not comply with NERC CIP cybersecurity standards. Electricity production relies on critical infrastructure sectors for fuel and support. NERC's GridEx III report prioritizes restarting generation and energizing transmission systems after a major grid disruption. Other critical infrastructure necessary for the electric power sector lacks mandatory physical and cybersecurity rules. The electric power sector faces cybersecurity risks similar to the pipeline sector, with a consensus that threats are increasing. Grid and pipeline cybersecurity are interconnected due to physical interdependency. Smart grid technologies improve efficiency and control of power production and distribution systems. Congressional recognition of the intertwined nature of grid and pipeline cybersecurity is growing. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is utilized to mitigate cybersecurity risks in the electric power system. AI allows computer systems to learn from inputs, simulate human learning, and make decisions using real-time data. AI algorithms analyze information from various sources instantly to act on derived insights. AI systems can analyze data from various sources instantly, make decisions based on alternative scenarios, and adapt over time to improve efficacy. Machine learning algorithms enable computers to learn and respond to cyber attacks more quickly than human operators, providing protection for critical networks. AI can respond to cyber attacks faster than humans by analyzing big data collected from ICS networks and customer-information systems. Big data refers to the volume, speed, and scope of data collected from multiple sources and formats. Data analytics techniques can turn big data into useful information, providing insights into customer behavior and identifying patterns or trends in new threats to the grid. High performance computing can process data from Smart Grid systems quickly to recognize potential cybersecurity threats. The use of AI systems in cybersecurity for the grid presents potential vulnerabilities due to the processing speed of Smart grid devices. Machine learning decisions are based on biased data, which can lead to limited effectiveness in defense. AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on, potentially crystallizing biases or falsehoods. The application of AI in cybersecurity opens up new attack vectors based on data vulnerabilities. AI in cybersecurity introduces new attack vectors based on data vulnerabilities. Adversaries can manipulate AI surveillance systems to act as double agents, exploiting biases in programming. AI can be used offensively to create situation-aware malware that mimics human attackers, evading detection and targeting systems. Cybercriminals may leverage AI to develop smarter malware for future attacks on critical infrastructure, potentially overwhelming defenses. Future developments in swarm or distributed AI may lead to strategic botnets with small malware payloads but devastating effects. The Aurora simulation in 2007 demonstrated the vulnerability of power plants to cyber attacks, specifically the AURORA attack which can damage AC equipment. The Stuxnet attack on an Iranian nuclear plant further highlighted the threat to industrial control systems. The warning against cyber threats to electric utilities emphasizes the need for preparedness. Cybersecurity threats can come from various sources including hackers, disgruntled employees, industrial spies, and organized crime groups. NERC plans to increase monitoring of the electric system and staff the E-ISAC 24/7. NERC proposes 24/7 staffing for E-ISAC to enhance timely analysis and information sharing on cyber incidents. FERC calls for increased reporting of cyber incidents, directing NERC to expand reporting requirements beyond compromising reliability tasks. NERC plans to expand the CIP-008 standard to include reporting any attempts to breach a company's networks, not just incidents compromising critical operations. Responsible entities must report cyber security incidents affecting Electronic Security Perimeter or associated systems. Reports will be standardized for better quality and comparison, sent to E-ISAC and ICS-CERT for threat assessment and communication. The DOE and NERC have established mandatory reporting requirements for electric utilities experiencing emergency incidents. Form OE-417 alerts the Department of Energy to electrical emergencies, with timely filing being crucial for quick response to energy emergencies. Different criteria exist for reporting electric power incidents and outages, with an Emergency Alert required within one hour for major interruptions or impacts to critical infrastructure facilities. The Department of Energy (DOE) and NERC have established reporting requirements for electric utilities during emergency incidents. Form OE-417 is used to alert the DOE to electrical emergencies, with different criteria for reporting incidents and outages. Major interruptions or impacts to critical infrastructure facilities, cyber incidents affecting electrical system operations, and uncontrolled loss of 300 Megawatts or more of firm system loads for 15 minutes or more require immediate notification. The data collected is used for national security response and reporting on electric power emergency incidents. The Department of Energy (DOE) uses data from monthly Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports to develop legislative recommendations and reports to Congress. Cybersecurity actions are reactive to threats, with experts debating whether the focus should be on attackers or the attacks themselves. Some utilities are improving security in modernization programs, while others face limitations for cost recovery under state government jurisdiction. Improvements in cybersecurity for the electricity industry must be justified as \"used or useful\" in utility rate cases. The sophistication of cyberthreats often depends on their origin, with many threats coming from foreign entities. Information from the federal government's national security apparatus is crucial for understanding and addressing these threats. The electricity industry provides expertise in assessing the risk to the grid and determining appropriate responses. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) informs the electricity industry of cyber and physical threats to the grid. It coordinates with the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (E-ISAC) to gather and analyze security information, communicate mitigation strategies, and run the NERC Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program. The CRISP program deploys passive sensors on participant company networks to share threat information in real-time and protect critical infrastructure. As of the end of 2015, 75% of U.S electricity customers were covered by companies using CRISP. The ESCC has called for the E-ISAC to be the central source of information sharing between the electricity sector and the government. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) is exploring new technologies to enhance the resiliency of the electric power transmission and distribution system. These technologies aim to improve recovery efforts from potential cyber attacks on the grid, including the use of plug-in electric vehicles and solar photovoltaic systems as backup power sources. EPRI is researching technologies to enhance grid resiliency, including plug-in electric vehicles and solar systems as backup power. Smart Grid solutions like Dynamic Circuit Reconfiguration use sensors to isolate faults and restore service. These practices must be tailored to different types of disruptions. The use of fast sensors and tools for information gathering and analysis in a resilient cybersecurity strategy may require controls in central and distributed locations. Distributed data centers with independent energy supplies could be necessary to ensure recovery from cyber attacks. New York is working on deploying distributed resources to modernize its energy systems, including microgrids that can operate independently in emergencies. The grid has potential in a cyber attack or other emergency, power can be generated by fossil fuel, combined heat and power plants, or renewable energy systems. Microgrids are being investigated by the DOE for a modern energy future. Distributed generation is growing and could be a source for black start power in a grid failure, but must be protected against cybersecurity attacks. Large, high voltage electric power transformers (LPTs) are critical components targeted in attacks, with few reserves due to high cost and long lead time for manufacturing. The investor-owned electric utilities have had a transformer sharing program in place since 2006. Section 61004 of the FAST Act required DOE to evaluate the feasibility of establishing a Strategic Transformer Reserve for spare large power transformers. In March 2017, DOE submitted a report to Congress on the strategic reserve, suggesting that supporting enhanced industry programs for spare transformer sharing might be a better way to achieve a strategic reserve. The electric power industry lacks intelligence gathering capabilities to address cyber and physical threats to the grid, which often originate internationally. The U.S. government analyzes intelligence on grid threats and shares information with the electricity sector. The electric power industry lacks intelligence gathering capabilities to address cyber and physical threats to the grid. The U.S. government analyzes intelligence on grid threats and shares that information with the electricity industry. The energy sector is subject to critical infrastructure protection rules for cyber and physical security under FERC's reliability mandate. The question of whether other critical infrastructure sectors should have similar mandatory standards to support the electric power sector may be an issue for Congress to consider. The evolving electric power system in the United States may face inconsistencies across sectors and regions, impacting cybersecurity. Policy options, such as the Grid Cybersecurity Research and Development Act (H.R. 4120), aim to enhance grid cybersecurity through collaboration with the DOE, other agencies, and the private sector. This initiative seeks to mitigate the consequences of cyber attacks on the electric grid and improve overall sector cybersecurity. The ESCC would develop a strategic plan to advance grid cybersecurity capabilities. The Pipeline and Liquefied Natural Gas Facility Cybersecurity Preparedness Act would ensure security of natural gas pipelines and facilities. The DOE would coordinate response to cyber incidents and demonstrate advanced cybersecurity projects. The Cyber Sense Act of 2018 (H.R. 5239) and the Enhancing Grid Security through Public-Private Partnerships Act (H.R. 5240) aim to establish voluntary DOE programs for testing product cybersecurity and technologies for the bulk-power system, as well as promote physical and cybersecurity of electric utilities. These bills authorize the DOE to provide technical assistance to mitigate cybersecurity vulnerabilities and develop voluntary implementation methods for assessing physical and cybersecurity. The Promoting Cybersecurity for Rural Electric Utilities Act (S. 2991) aims to enhance the cybersecurity of electric utilities by providing training, sharing best practices, and advancing the cybersecurity of third-party vendors. It would also amend the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to make cybersecurity and grid security improvements eligible for electric loans and guarantees."
