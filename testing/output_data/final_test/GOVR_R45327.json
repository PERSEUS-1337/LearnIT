There is no minimum service time required. Serving in a public agency in an official capacity qualifies for benefits.

Chaplains are eligible if they are recognized members of a fire or police department and were performing chaplain duties.

Emergency medical services workers authorized by law and engaging in rescue services may be eligible for PSOB benefits. This includes rescue workers, ambulance drivers, paramedics, and others trained in emergency medical services.

The lump-sum PSOB death and disability benefit for FY2019 is $359,316, adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. If a public safety officer receives a disability benefit and later dies from the same injury, the officer's survivors may not receive a PSOB death benefit. The payable benefit amount is based on the date of the officer's death or the date of the injury that caused the disability. The PSOB program provides death and disability benefits to public safety officers, with death benefits being offset by certain other benefits. PSOB death benefits are payable to the eligible spouse and children of a public safety officer. The PSOB program provides death benefits to the eligible spouse and children of a public safety officer, including same-sex spouses. Children are defined as natural, adopted, or stepchildren under 18, full-time students aged 18-23, or over 18 with disabilities. Death benefits are paid to the spouse first, followed by eligible children. The death benefits for a public safety officer are distributed as follows: 1. If the officer has a spouse, 100% of the benefits go to the spouse. 2. If the officer has a spouse and children, 50% goes to the spouse and 50% is divided among the children. 3. If the officer only has children, the benefits are equally shared among them. 4. If there is no surviving spouse or children, the benefits go to the designated beneficiary or individuals listed in the officer's life insurance policy. 5. If there are no surviving spouse or eligible children, and no life insurance policy, the benefits are paid accordingly. The death benefits for a public safety officer are distributed based on specific criteria. If the officer has no surviving spouse, eligible children, or parents, the benefits are payable to surviving adult, nondependent children of the officer. PSOB disability benefits are only for permanent and total disabilities, not partial or short-term disabilities. A disability is considered permanent if there is medical certainty it will remain constant or deteriorate over the person's lifetime. The Public Safety Officer Benefits (PSOB) program provides death and disability benefits. To be considered totally disabled, the officer must be unable to perform any gainful work. Benefit applications must be filed within specific deadlines to determine eligibility and commence payment. Death benefits must be filed within three years of the death or within one year of the agency's decision on benefits. Disability benefits are only for permanent and total disabilities.

Disability benefits must be filed within three years of the injury or one year of the agency's decision. An interim payment of up to $3,000 may be made if a PSOB death benefit will \"probably be paid,\" which reduces the final payment amount. If death benefits are denied, the interim payment must be returned unless waived due to hardship. The USA PATRIOT Act allows expedited payment of PSOB death and disability benefits for officers injured in connection with terrorism. PSOEA program provides financial assistance for higher education to eligible family members of public safety officers. Eligibility for PSOEA benefits requires marriage to an eligible public safety officer. To be eligible for PSOEA benefits, a spouse must have been married to an eligible public safety officer at the time of the officer's death or injury. A child can receive benefits until the age of 27, with possible extensions in certain circumstances. The spouse or child must also be enrolled at an eligible educational institution to qualify for benefits, which can only be used for higher education expenses. The PSOEA benefit can be used for higher education expenses, including tuition, room, board, books, and supplies. The monthly benefit amount is based on the GI Bill DEA program and is adjusted annually for cost of living. The maximum duration of benefits is 45 months for full-time education. A person may be ineligible for PSOEA if in default on a federal student loan or ineligible for federal benefits due to a drug conviction. The Attorney General can discontinue benefits for lack of satisfactory progress in education. Dissatisfied claimants can request a reconsideration for disability benefits denial, but not for denials of death or education benefits. A de novo hearing can be requested for benefit denials, with the director's determination being final. The PSOB Office director's determination is final and can be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Attorney fees for PSOB representation are limited to 3-6% of the total benefit paid. Congress funds PSOB and PSOE benefits through the annual Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. Funding for PSOB death benefits and administrative expenses is mandatory, with Congress appropriating necessary sums. PSOB disability and PSOEA benefits are discretionary and subject to specific appropriations. The Attorney General can transfer funds for emergent circumstances requiring additional funding for these benefits."
