    "content": "Reinforcement learning often requires well-designed reward functions to teach desired behavior. A new reward estimation method uses optimal state trajectories from expert demonstrations to guide an agent in mimicking expert behavior. By learning a model of \"good\" states distribution from these trajectories, the agent can compute a reward signal based on the difference between actual and predicted next states. This inferred reward function improves performance in various tasks compared to standard reinforcement learning with engineered rewards. Reinforcement learning (RL) involves teaching an agent to achieve a task by learning from a reward signal. Recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning have shown success in incorporating deep models. A new method utilizes expert player videos to enable agents to learn optimal actions directly from game demonstrations like Super Mario Bros and Flappy Bird. This approach outperforms standard RL with engineered rewards. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning have shown success in utilizing deep neural networks for approximating Q-value functions and training agents to play Atari games. Choosing a well-designed reward function is critical for successful learning in RL, but hand-tuning can be necessary, defeating the benefits of automated learning. Imitation learning methods in reinforcement learning involve mimicking expert demonstrations to improve learning algorithms. Examples include inverse reinforcement learning, behavior cloning, and curiosity-based exploration. In this work, a reward estimation method is proposed to estimate the underlying reward based on expert demonstrations of state trajectories for a given task. This estimated reward function can be used in reinforcement learning algorithms to learn a suitable policy. The method allows training agents based solely on visual observations of experts performing the task. The paper proposes a reward estimation method based on expert demonstrations of state trajectories for a task. It uses a model to penalize actions deviating from expert behavior and presents two methods: a generative model and a temporal sequence prediction model. Experimental results show the effectiveness of estimating the reward function from raw video input. Model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods learn a policy \u03c0(a t |s t ) that produces an action from the current observation. BID12 showed that a q-value function q(s t , a t ) can be approximated with a deep neural network, trained using hand-engineered scalar reward signals. Actor-critic networks in Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) enable state-of-the-art continuous control, e.g. in robotic manipulation. Other methods like Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have been proposed as further improvements for model-free RL in continuous control problems. In the standard case, hand-tuning reward functions for each environment is a difficult task. Behavior cloning based on supervised learning offers an alternative that does not require reward hand-tuning, learning actions from states in a supervised manner. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to recover the optimal reward function from expert demonstrations using linear programming methods. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to recover the optimal reward function from expert demonstrations using linear programming methods. It demonstrated successful estimation of the reward function in simple environments like the grid world and the mountain car problem. Expert demonstrations can also be used to initialize the value function and compute the suitable reward function by maximizing entropy. Additionally, a method was proposed for recovering the cost function based on expected feature matching between observed policy and agent behavior. Recent work has extended imitation learning using deep neural networks for policy and reward functions. The imitation learning problem was formulated as a competitive game with a discriminator network guiding the agent's behavior. Various methods like model-based and robust imitation learning have been explored, but most rely on both state and action information from expert demonstrations. In contrast, this approach learns only from expert state trajectories. In contrast to previous work relying on both state and action information from expert demonstrations, this approach learns solely from expert state trajectories. The agent is trained using a combination of intrinsic curiosity and a hand-engineered reward signal, successfully navigating games like Mario and Doom without any expert demonstrations. The proposed methods outperform curiosity-based approaches in terms of learned behaviors, although they require state demonstrations as expert data. The curr_chunk discusses an incomplete Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the goal is to find a reward signal that enables the agent to learn a policy maximizing expert trajectories. The reward function is inferred based on current and next state information. The goal is to find a reward function that maximizes the likelihood of next step prediction based on expert demonstrations, leading to maximizing future rewards in a deterministic task. The reward signal is estimated from expert state trajectories to guide the agent in learning a policy. The goal is to estimate a reward signal from expert state trajectories to guide a reinforcement learning algorithm in learning a suitable policy. Two approaches are evaluated: training a generative model to estimate rewards based on state similarity, and using a temporal sequence prediction model to predict the next state value. The latter approach considers the temporal order of states for estimating state transition probabilities. A temporal sequence prediction model is trained to predict the next state value based on expert trajectories. The reward value is estimated using the similarity measure between the predicted next state and the one visited by the agent. A deep generative model is used to minimize reconstruction loss and estimate the reward value as a function of the difference between actual state values. The reward value is estimated based on the difference between the current state value and the generated output. The approach involves learning a temporal sequence prediction model to maximize the likelihood of the next state given the current state, using specific networks mentioned in the experiments sections. The network is trained to predict the next state based on the current state using an objective function minimizing mean square error. The estimated reward guides the agent's actions towards expert trajectories, shaping its policy. The process of reward shaping guides the agent to learn an optimized policy based on expert demonstration trajectories. Algorithm 1 outlines the proposed methods, including observing states, selecting actions, and updating the reinforcement learning network. Experiments were conducted across various environments, including tasks like robot arm reaching, controlling a point agent, and learning in the Flappy Bird video game. The curr_chunk discusses learning a robot arm to reach a target point using joint angles and continuous action values in a physics engine environment. The robot arm has two linked arms with specific joint values and lengths. Two settings are considered: fixed point target and random target. The actions are clipped within a range and the task is enabled in the roboschool environment. In the roboschool environment, a robot arm is trained to reach a fixed target point using DDPG. The state vector includes arm position, joint values, velocities, target position, and end-effector position. Reward functions include dense and sparse rewards, with environment-specific rewards incorporated. The generative model with action uses DISPLAYFORM4 to calculate environment-specific rewards based on the cost of the current action. Regularization is necessary for finding the shortest path to the target. The dense reward is the distance between the end-effector and the target, while the sparse reward provides a bonus for reaching the target. The generative model parameters are trained using trajectories from an agent, with specific network architecture and training details outlined. The generative model \u03b8 2k,+a is trained with pairs of state and action for 2000 episodes. A tanh nonlinear function is used for the estimated reward to maintain a bounded value. The \u03b1, \u03b2 parameters control the sensitivity of distance or reward. Results are compared with behavior cloning method BID20. The reacher task environment involves reaching the endeffector to the target point. Performance differences are shown using different reward functions. The proposed method \"GM with r env t\" achieves a score close to dense reward, outperforming sparse reward settings. The generative model's performance is better with dense rewards compared to sparse rewards. Learning curves based on rewards estimated with the generative model show faster convergence. However, without environment-specific rewards, convergence takes longer due to the inability to account for action regularization. GM reward based on \u03c4 2k outperforms \u03c4 1k due to lack of demonstration data. Demonstrations data are biased by robot trajectories, requiring normalization to improve. In an experiment, the generative model \"GM [state, action]\" performed poorly when using both state and action information. The target point was initialized randomly outside the robot arms' reaching range, making the task more difficult. The state vector included values for position, angles, and the target point. Expert trajectories' states were expected to align with the reward structure, but changes in the target position affected this alignment. In this experiment, the reward structure is evaluated with a temporal sequence prediction model. The RL setting remains the same, but the total number of steps per episode is changed to 400. Different reward functions are used, including sparse reward and LSTM reward. Expert demonstrations are obtained from 2000 episodes, and a model called NS predicts the next state. The LSTM model uses Long short-term memory as a temporal sequence. The LSTM model in the experiment uses Long short-term memory as a temporal sequence prediction model with three layers and one fully-connected layer. The forward model based reward estimation predicts the next state given the current state and action. Performance comparison with baseline behavior cloning method shows that estimated rewards outperform sparse rewards. The LSTM prediction method yields the best results, approaching the performance of dense hand-engineered reward functions. However, the GM based reward estimation does not work well in this complex experimental setting. The GM based reward estimation fails in the complex experimental setting. The NS model and LSTM based prediction model have comparable performance initially. The FM based reward function also performs poorly. Direct BC works relatively well, indicating behavior cloning is better than reward prediction when both state and action information is available. The experiment evaluates using only temporal sequence prediction method, using a finite history of state values to predict the next state value. Predicting a part of the state related to a given action allows for a better estimate of the reward function. Former work predicts a function of the next state rather than predicting the state itself. In this experiment, a new environment with an obstacle is introduced for a reaching task using a two-dimensional point. The agent's goal is to reach the target while avoiding the obstacle. The state value includes the agent's position, velocity, target position, and obstacle position. The proposed method for reward estimation is compared with different non-linear functions, showing robustness. The experiment introduced a new environment with an obstacle for a reaching task using a two-dimensional point. The RL algorithm used was DDPG for continuous control, with reward functions including LSTM reward and dense reward composed of target distance cost and obstacle distance bonus. The optimal state trajectories contained 800 \"human guided\" demonstration data. The LSTM network had two layers with ReLU activations, and different estimated or hand-engineered reward settings were compared for performance. The LSTM based prediction method outperforms dense reward in reaching the target faster, with the best overall performance using human-guided demonstration data. The agent in the Flappy Bird game aims to pass through pipes without collision, with rewards given for passing through and penalties for collisions. The RL algorithm used is DQN, with the update frequency of the deep network set at 100 steps. The LSTM reward is based on the absolute position of the bird in the game. The LSTM model predicts the absolute position of the bird in Flappy Bird using images, outperforming the baseline behavior cloning method. The LSTM reward teaches the optimal bird transitions, leading to better convergence compared to behavior cloning. The experiment compares the LSTM reward with a \"hand-crafted\" reward, showing superior results. In a more complex environment, the proposed reward estimation method is evaluated using only state information in the Super Mario Bros video game. The method estimates rewards based on expert gameplay video data, benchmarked against a curiosity-based method. The experiment uses the A3C RL algorithm with Mario making 14 types of actions in a discrete control setup. The state information consists of sequential input of four 42 x 42 gray image frames. In this experiment, the A3C RL algorithm was used with gameplay of stage \"1-1\" in Super Mario Bros. The objective was for the agent to travel far and achieve a high score. Rewards functions were based on position, score, and screen images. A 3D-CNN was used for temporal sequence prediction, with expert demonstration data from 15 game playing videos. The demonstration data consisted of 25000 frames, with a skip frame length of 36. The study used the A3C RL algorithm in Super Mario Bros. gameplay to train an agent to achieve a high score. A 3D-CNN with 4 layers was used for temporal sequence prediction. Two reward estimation methods were implemented, one being a naive method and the other using a threshold value to prevent trivial solutions. The study utilized the A3C RL algorithm in Super Mario Bros. gameplay, training an agent with a 3D-CNN for temporal sequence prediction. Different reward functions were tested, showing that the 3D-CNN method learned faster compared to curiosity-based agents. Future work aims to enhance performance using deeper RL networks and larger input image sizes, allowing agents to learn policies directly from raw video data. The study explored reward estimation methods in video game settings using raw video data. Two variations were proposed based on state prediction using autoencoder-based generative models and LSTM for calculating similarities between actual and predicted states. The models aimed to enhance performance in training agents directly from raw video data. The study compared reward estimation methods in video game settings using state prediction models. The proposed method showed faster convergence than conventional reinforcement learning, especially with expert trajectories from humans. The temporal sequence prediction model outperformed the generative model, and the method could be applied to video demonstrations. However, the effectiveness varied across different environments, requiring adjustments to the reward definition for optimal performance. The proposed method in the study showed faster convergence compared to conventional reinforcement learning, especially with expert trajectories. The actor and critic networks in the DDPG model have specific layer configurations and activation functions. Various parameters such as exploration policy, reply memory size, and optimizer were utilized in the experiments conducted using Keras-rl, Keras, and Tensorflow libraries. The DDPG model used specific layer configurations and activation functions for the actor and critic networks. The exploration policy was Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, reply memory size was 500k, and optimizer was Adam. Initial weights were set from a uniform distribution U(-0.003, 0.003)."
