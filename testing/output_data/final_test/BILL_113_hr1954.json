The Comptroller General evaluates Executive department programs annually and recommends abolishing redundant agencies. The President oversees the winding down of abolished departments, with the possibility of extension by Congress. Congress can authorize the continued existence of an Executive department scheduled for abolishment by approving or rejecting legislation containing recommendations from the Comptroller General. Approval does not prevent the department from being abolished in the next cycle. After February 1 of each year, legislation with the Comptroller General's recommendations for Executive departments is introduced. The Comptroller General's report on Executive departments is introduced as a \"wasteful expenditures bill\" in Congress. If not introduced as such, any member of Congress can introduce the bill after five days of session. The wasteful expenditures bill introduced in Congress must be referred to the appropriate committee for review and comment within 60 legislative days. The committee may report the bill to the respective House without amending it. The wasteful expenditures bill must be referred to a committee for review within 60 legislative days. If the committee does not report the bill within this time frame, it will be discharged from further consideration, and the bill will be placed on the House calendar. An expedited procedure allows for consideration of the bill within 5 legislative days. After a wasteful expenditures bill is reported by a committee or discharged, the Majority Leader of the Senate or the Speaker of the House, or their designees, can move to proceed to its consideration. Any member of the Senate or House can also move to consider the bill after a 5-day period. Motion to proceed to consider a wasteful expenditures bill is privileged in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, not debatable, and not subject to amendment or postponement. If agreed to, immediate consideration of the bill follows without any intervening business. The wasteful expenditures bill is the unfinished business of the Senate or House of Representatives until disposed of. Debate on the bill and related motions is limited to 10 hours, divided equally between supporters and opponents. Motion to further limit debate is allowed and not debatable. The wasteful expenditures bill allows for 10 hours of debate, with no amendments permitted. Following the debate, a vote on final passage will take place, and other motions are not allowed. The wasteful expenditures bill allows for 10 hours of debate with no amendments permitted. Other motions such as postponing consideration, proceeding to other business, or reconsidering the vote are not in order. If the other House passes a wasteful expenditures bill, the receiving House must consider it before passing its own bill. The wasteful expenditures bill from the other House shall only be considered for final passage in the receiving House. The procedure for the bill in the receiving House remains the same as if no bill had been received. The final passage vote will be on the wasteful expenditures bill from the other House. The wasteful expenditures bill received from one House cannot be considered in the receiving House. The term \"legislative day\" refers to a day when either House of Congress is in session. This section is part of the rules of each House regarding the procedure for wasteful expenditures bills. The wasteful expenditures bill supersedes other rules to the extent of inconsistency and recognizes the constitutional right of each House to change rules related to their procedures."
