The Director of the Institute will make grants or contracts for the development of two centers to improve infertility prevention methods. The centers will conduct research, including clinical trials for new infertility treatments. The text chunk discusses the development of centers for infertility diagnosis and treatment, training programs for healthcare professionals, stipends for professionals enrolled in training programs, and dissemination of information to professionals and the public. The Director of the Institute coordinates information among assisted centers, which use single institution facilities or consortiums. Support for a center may last up to 5 years, with possible extensions after review by a peer group. Authorization of Appropriations: $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2003, with additional funding as needed for 2004 and 2005 to carry out the section on coordinating information among assisted centers. A loan repayment program for research on infertility prevention is added to the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary will establish a program for qualified health professionals to conduct infertility prevention research in exchange for up to $20,000 repayment of educational loans per year. Provisions from other loan repayment programs will apply, and funding will be appropriated for this program. Funding for the infertility prevention research program will remain available for two fiscal years after appropriation."
