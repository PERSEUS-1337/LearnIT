Congress finds that high-speed passenger rail technology is new in the United States and requires specific skills and expertise. Unlike other transportation modes, high-speed rail needs unique rights of way and integration with other systems to succeed. To ensure proper development, a dedicated office at the highest levels of the Federal Government is crucial. The Federal Government needs to coordinate relationships between different levels of government and industrial interests for successful high-speed rail. Resources for transportation infrastructure are scarce, and the current system's capacity threatens the competitiveness of the United States. Investment in new, faster transportation modes like high-speed rail is essential. Investment in intercity high-speed passenger rail is crucial for the United States to improve its economic condition and regain leadership roles domestically and internationally. Placing the development of a national high-speed rail system under the supervision of the Secretary of Transportation will ensure an efficient launch and operation of this new transportation modality. The Secretary of Transportation will oversee the rapid development and implementation of intercity high-speed passenger rail.
