    "content": "Human-driven climate change has shifted from a scientific topic to a policy debate, with Congressional proposals focusing on observation, pollution control, financial assistance for technology, and adaptation. Federal funding for climate change activities was $6.37 billion in FY2008, reaching $7.73 billion with tax incentives. Funding for FY2009 remains at or below these levels under a Continuing Resolution. The report highlights that federal funding for climate change programs in FY2009 may have been sustained at a higher level than President Bush's request, with tax incentives for renewable energy also being passed. The 111th Congress is evaluating past funding and future priorities to address climate change, as President Obama has outlined new policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. President Obama aims to reduce emissions by 80% below 1990 levels by 2050 through emission caps and trading. He appointed Carol Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change. President Bush had a goal to cut U.S. greenhouse gas intensity by 18% by 2012 and directed programs to reduce uncertainties and promote energy-efficient technologies. President Bush announced a national goal to halt increases in U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases by 2025, with emissions declining thereafter as technology advances. Regulatory measures and market incentives would be used to encourage the use of clean technologies to achieve this goal. Performance targets have been set for some programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but specific funding requests have not been directly tied to climate change policy goals. The Obama Administration and the 111th Congress may consider clearer relationships among programs, funding, and contributions to measurable climate change goals. Congressional appropriations alter the total funding requested by the President for climate change across agencies. The appropriations process has not facilitated a broad view of climate change policy goals and priorities across agencies and activities. The report describes federal funding of climate change activities across 14 agencies, with a focus on changes from FY2007 and FY2008 levels to President Bush's FY2009 request. Funding for climate change efforts has evolved since 1990, with Congress enacting a scientific research program in response to evidence of human influence on the Earth's climate. The report discusses federal funding for climate change activities, highlighting the challenges in funding information availability and political agreement. There is an emphasis on research activities, which may not fully capture the evolving priorities in addressing climate change, such as GHG abatement and impacts assessment. Funding for climate change research in the U.S. has fluctuated over the years, with a consensus on the importance of continued scientific research. Despite concerns about uncertainties, there is a need for more concrete actions to address climate change. Funding levels increased from 1989 to 1995 but have generally declined since then. Major changes in energy and policy are necessary to effectively avoid human-induced climate change. Major changes in energy and technologies are needed to address human-induced climate change. Federal support for clean technologies has been a key component of climate change efforts, with programs like the Climate Change Technology Initiative and Climate Change Technology Program receiving significant funding. Developing countries also require financial and technical assistance to transition to lower greenhouse gas-emitting societies. In 1992, the United States and other developed countries committed to providing financial and technical assistance to developing countries to adopt less emitting economic paths. President George H.W. Bush established a $25 million Country Studies Program to help countries assess and implement climate change policies. Funding for international assistance, mainly through US AID, has decreased since the late 1990s due to various reasons. The report analyzes federal funding for climate change programs and activities, highlighting overlaps and gaps in program areas. It suggests alternative ways to categorize funding for better decision-making. Legislative issues related to federal funding are identified, with data on budget authority from FY2001 to FY2008. The report also mentions a Continuing Resolution for FY2009. The Continuing Resolution (CR) extended FY2008 enacted levels through March 6, 2009 for climate-related programs, with funding grouped into three major program areas. Funding levels have fluctuated over the years, with notable increases in FY2008 and FY2009 for new satellites, nuclear energy, and international technology financing. Understanding the funding trends is challenging due to changes in aggregation levels and budget accounting methods. The federal government offers tax incentives to encourage reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, with an estimated total of $1.52 billion in climate change-related tax expenditures in FY2008 and FY2007. These tax expenditures are projected to decrease to $1.44 billion in FY2009. Examples include credits for cleaner automobiles and renewable electricity generation. Table 1 shows the total impact on the federal budget from FY2001 to FY2008 and the FY2009 request due to climate change programs and tax expenditures. The budgetary impact of these activities has increased by nearly 85% from FY2001 to FY2008. Over 60% of the $4.3 billion increase is attributed to expansion. The federal budget saw a $4.3 billion increase from FY2001 to FY2008, with over 60% attributed to technology research and development expansion. Another $1.5 billion was due to tax incentives for greenhouse gas reductions. Climate change science funding increased by $0.1 billion in actual dollars, but decreased when accounting for inflation. President Bush's FY2009 budget request aimed to bring funding back to FY2001 levels. Budget authority for climate change activities in FY2008 was $5.44 billion. President Bush's budget request for FY2009 aimed to increase funding for climate change activities by 12.3%, to $7.15 billion. A Continuing Resolution extended FY2008 enacted levels through March 6, 2009. Changes requested for climate change purposes included increasing funding for nuclear energy research and demonstrations, as well as uncertainties in tax incentives for greenhouse gas reductions. The FY2009 budget request aimed to increase funding for climate change activities by $7.15 billion. Changes included boosting energy research by $302 million, fossil energy R&D by $133 million, and satellite sensors by $177 million. Additionally, $400 million was allocated to a new Clean Technology Fund hosted by the World Bank. The emphasis on researching climate change impacts and adaptation was highlighted in the proposal. The FY2009 budget request aimed to increase funding for climate change activities by $7.15 billion, with a focus on boosting energy research, fossil energy R&D, and satellite sensors. However, the proposed increases mainly support observational capacities and technological basic research, not applied policy or management research. Some programs dedicated to impacts and adaptation may receive less funding, and certain programs previously funded by Congress were not continued in FY2009. The FY2009 budget request aimed to increase funding for climate change activities by $7.15 billion, focusing on energy research, fossil energy R&D, and satellite sensors. The funding is grouped into three program areas: Climate Change Science Program ($2.08 billion), Climate Change Technology Program ($4.42 billion), and International Climate Change Assistance ($0.66 billion). The categories of science, technology, and international assistance provide a broad understanding of federal climate change programs. The most recent growth in funding for climate change focuses on technology research, demonstration, and deployment, with a proposed increase of almost $1 billion for FY2009 compared to FY2007. The majority of the funding growth within the Climate Change Technology Program is for nuclear energy research. If the requested $400 million for the Clean Technology Fund had been approved, international assistance would have seen a 325% increase over the FY2008 enacted budget authority. Understanding the specific uses of climate change funds can be challenging due to the aggregation of publicly available funding information. The FY2009 funding request for climate change includes significant amounts for various applications, with a large portion of the funding request remaining unclear. Nuclear energy research and demonstrations would receive the largest share of climate-related funding, estimated at $1.40 billion (19.6%) in the FY2009 request. Satellite-based observations would constitute about 11.8% of all federal funding. The FY2009 funding request for climate change includes significant amounts for various applications, with a large portion of the funding request remaining unclear. Satellite-based observations would constitute about 11.8% of all federal climate change funding, at the level of $843 million proposed for FY2009. This funding does not cover most data quality assurance, management, accessibility to researchers, or analysis needed to create value from the observations. The Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Space and Aeronautics Administration (NASA) receive the majority of climate change budget authority. The FY2009 funding request for climate change includes significant amounts for various applications, with a large portion of the funding request remaining unclear. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) has been the umbrella organization for informal reporting by OMB for the FY2003 through the FY2009 request for the 14 federal departments and agencies that administer the three major climate change program areas. The report briefly describes each of the three major climate change program areas, including science, technology, and international assistance, as well as tax provisions that may encourage reductions in greenhouse gases. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) has been managing scientific research on climate change since 2003. President Bush requested $2.08 billion for climate change science in FY2009, an increase from previous years. The research aims to reduce uncertainties in climate science. NASA receives the largest share of funding for the CCSP. The FY2009 budget request for climate change science allocated 58% to NASA and 16% to NOAA, 11% to NSF, and 7% to DOE. In constant dollars, the CCSP budget decreased by 11% from FY2001 to FY2008, but the FY2009 request aimed to bring funding back to FY2001 levels. The shifting of funds within agencies has led to a decline in climate change-related budgets, with NASA's budget decreasing by 24% from FY2000 to FY2008. Only NOAA saw an increase of 217% in their budget during this time period. This has caused tension among agencies over funding for climate change science. Federal funding for climate change science has fluctuated over the years, with a peak of $2.28 billion in FY1995 and a decline to $1.83 billion in FY2008. Tension among agencies persists over funding for this cross-agency objective. The Global Change Research Act (GCRA) established the U.S. Global Change Research Program (US GCRP) in 1989, leading to rapid growth in funding for climate change science. The absence of a program to support policy and management decision-making has created tension over the goals and balance of federally supported climate change science today. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) aims to improve understanding of uncertainties in climate science and expand global observing systems. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) aims to improve understanding of uncertainties in climate science, expand global observing systems, and communicate findings broadly among scientific and stakeholder communities. However, it has been criticized for focusing mainly on basic Earth system processes and neglecting behavioral, economic, and ecological aspects of environmental problems. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) has been criticized for lacking ecosystem-scale research, adaptation research, and integrated assessments. Critics argue that structural fixes may be necessary as efforts have been largely unsuccessful for 15 years. Proposals to restructure and expand climate change research are being considered within and outside of the U.S. Congress. The US GCRP and CCRI were established to address climate change research, with little distinction between them in the CCSP. The CCSP is not formalized through legislation, with the GCRA serving as the legal framework. Efforts to amend or replace the GCRA are expected in the 111th Congress. The CCSP is outlined in the Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan, published in 2003 with ongoing reviews by the National Academy of Sciences. The 2003 and 2008 CCSP Strategic Plans grouped research into seven elements: atmospheric composition, climate variability and change, global water cycle, land use/land cover change, global carbon cycle, ecosystems, and human contributions and responses. The 2008 Strategic Plan did not substantially change the organization of the existing CCSP. The proposed FY2009 funding for each goal is provided below: Goal 1 ($410.6 million): Improve knowledge of the Earth's past and present climate and environment. Goal 1 ($410.6 million): Improve understanding of Earth's climate and environment, Goal 2 ($314.8 million): Quantify forces driving climate changes, Goal 3 ($279.8 million): Reduce uncertainty in future climate projections, Goal 4 ($160.0 million): Study ecosystems' sensitivity to climate change, Goal 5 ($143.8 million): Manage risks and opportunities related to climate variability and change. The CCSP activities include research on health risks and funding for human health effects of ultra-violet radiation. Some reporting issues stem from the absorption of the Global Change Research Program. The main applications of proposed funding are satellite-based observations, basic science research, and climate models. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 requires scientific assessment reports to Congress every four years. The Bush Administration aimed to meet this requirement with a series of Synthesis and Assessment Products (SAPs). However, there were concerns that these reports would not fulfill the statutory requirement or address the needs of policy-makers, leading to legal action by environmental groups. The Bush Administration faced legal action to produce a revised research plan and national scientific assessment. A Court Order in 2007 mandated the release of the Revised Research Plan in 2008. The plan focused on the period from 2008 to 2010, with plans for a new strategy by 2010 covering 2013 to 2023. The report retained the same goals and structure as the 2003 Strategy, emphasizing the importance of understanding Earth's climate. The CCSP focuses on understanding Earth's climate, including natural variability and causes of observed changes at various scales. It aims to research the impacts of climate change on ecosystems, human health, infrastructure, and economic systems. The program supports decision-making for managing climate risks and opportunities, with an emphasis on regional and local scales and improved communication with users. The CCSP emphasizes communication with users and stakeholders for input and accessibility of research results. Legislative options may be considered for clarifying goals and processes of federal climate change research. The program will produce integrative scientific assessments and a Unified Synthesis Product. The CCSP will produce the Unified Synthesis Product (USP) to analyze climate change science, summarize contributions, and identify gaps. Weaknesses in leadership and budget coherence are common concerns. Multiple agencies seek reviews and advice from external bodies like the National Academy of Sciences. The CCSP lacks sufficient over-arching authority to overcome agencies' individual interests and make budget consistent with cross-cutting priorities. There is no general consensus on strengthening central leadership through legislative actions, with options including various federal entities like the Office of Science and Technology Policy or the National Science Foundation. Some experts suggest creating a \"climate czar\" in the White House to lead all climate change programs, including science programs, adaptation, policy analysis, and international strategies. President Obama appointed Carol Browner as Assistant for Energy and Climate Change, but the role's functions and authority are undefined. The CCSP faces challenges due to lack of clearly defined and measurable goals, which hinders prioritization and evaluation of programs. This also leads to tension between funding for fundamental knowledge and resources for applied research to achieve climate change policy objectives. The National Academies panel highlighted challenges in measuring progress for the CCSP due to broad program objectives and lack of success measures. Developing metrics for the program was deemed costly and challenging, with short-term impacts measurable but long-term contributions taking decades to assess. The 2008 review emphasized the need for detailed management metrics to evaluate the CCSP effectively. The 2008 review of the CCSP by a National Academies panel highlighted the absence of detailed management metrics, leading to unclear and inconsistent reporting of programs and funding. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found challenges in determining actual levels of climate change funding in 2005, with recommendations implemented by late 2006. However, fundamental problems with lack of clarity and consistency persist, hindering understanding of how climate change funds are utilized and evaluated for efficiency and value. The 2008 National Research Council report evaluated priorities for space-based observations within the CCSP, highlighting the need to address the imbalance between space-based and other research components to improve the value of observations for science and society. The 2008 National Research Council report emphasized the importance of integrating observations from land, sea, air, and space into forecast models for decision-making. It identified weaknesses in current observation systems and prioritized continuous observations over individual space missions. The panel stressed the need for strong observation systems to be effectively analyzed, interpreted, and applied to realize their potential. Resources should focus on sustained observations, complementary non-space-based observations, turning observations into knowledge, and sustaining that knowledge. The NRC panel emphasized the need to address funding imbalances for satellite-based observations and prioritize analysis of gathered information. Some critics argue that the focus of the USGCRP has been more on acquiring new knowledge rather than providing practical benefits for policy makers. The CRS analysis of the CCSP budget reinforces the agencies' focus on supporting basic research according to their specific missions. Oversight committees for carbon cycle science primarily consist of practicing scientists, with Congress members generally hesitant to challenge the belief in the societal benefits of unfettered basic research. The processes governing research prioritization stem from the scientific community's norms and are suitable for curiosity-driven research. If the community wants to shift the research agency towards societal needs, changes in operating norms are necessary. Studies suggest involving users in determining priorities and designing products for societal benefits. The CCSP may need adjustments to balance science and applications for addressing climate change effects. Various interest groups have proposed restructuring the CCSP, but details are not covered in the current report. Alternative proposals for restructuring the CCSP include centralizing authority in one agency or the White House, increasing budget control, enhancing input from science users, and improving budget decision-making. Some suggestions involve expanding the science program to include more applied research, increasing public outreach, and creating a separate institutional structure for certain activities. Bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to implement some of these proposals, recognizing the importance of federal research in energy technologies and carbon storage for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. President Clinton and President Bush both initiated climate technology programs in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The U.S. Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) was established in 2005 under the Energy Policy Act to promote the deployment of greenhouse gas reducing technologies. The Committee on Climate Change Technology was tasked with integrating federal climate reports and developing a strategy for implementing these technologies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established the Climate Change Technology Program to promote the deployment of greenhouse gas reducing technologies. A CCTP Strategic Plan was published in 2006 with a $3 billion program envisioned. The program requires updating every five years or more frequently. EPAct 2005 also established the Climate Change Technology Program within the Department of Energy to carry out the authorized programs. The programs authorized under \u00a71610 focus on preparing inventories and evaluations of GHG intensity-reducing technologies, identifying technology demonstration projects, developing standards for calculating GHG intensity, supporting demonstration projects, and entering into research agreements. These activities are narrower in scope compared to President Bush's CCTP, which involved programs administered by multiple agencies and overseen by the Department of Energy. The CCTP objective is to accelerate technological advances for reducing man-made greenhouse gas emissions. The strategic goals include developing technologies to reduce emissions, capture carbon dioxide, and improve monitoring capabilities. Federal funding for climate change technology has increased. Federal funding for climate change technology has significantly increased from $845 million in FY1993 to $4.53 billion in FY2008, with President Bush's FY2009 budget requesting $4.41 billion. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) would constitute 62% of federal funding on climate change. However, the actual increase in funding may be lower due to redefined initiatives over time, making it challenging to track specific efforts and funding evolution. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has noted discrepancies in technology funding trends over the years, leading to uncertainty in tracking and comparing funding levels. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) funding is presented by agency and program, with data analyzed for the FY2009 funding request showing preliminary results. Reported CCTP funds do not encompass all financial incentives for technology research, development, and deployment. According to data analyzed for the FY2009 funding request, 29% of the funds for the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) would support nuclear energy, which is more than twice the amount requested for any other technology category. The next largest categories are mixes of technologies and renewable energy technologies other than biomass and biofuels. The Administration's priorities for specific technologies planned for development by DOE and EPA under the CCTP are highlighted in the funding table provided in Appendix F. The DOE and EPA are planning specific technologies for development under the CCTP, aiming for radical technological change to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. technology strategy involves federal sponsorship of research on specified technologies. The CCTP supports technological advance at all stages of research, development, demonstrations, and deployment, with more than two-thirds of funding allocated for these purposes in FY2009. The CCTP funding supports research, development, and deployment of technologies. Programs encourage commercialization and deployment of promising technologies through various measures. Only a small portion of funding goes towards technology deployment in the United States. The CCTP funding supports research, development, and deployment of technologies through various programs. DOE would represent 87% of the new budget authority for CCTP in FY2009, with USDA, DOD, NASA, EPA, and NSF also receiving funding. President Bush's climate change strategy included the International Climate Change Assistance program to encourage other countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Negotiating international commitments post-2012 is a key challenge, with developing countries linking their participation to industrialized nations fulfilling their UNFCCC commitments. Financial and technological assistance is crucial for lower-income and affected countries. President Bush's request would have more than tripled federal funding of climate change-related international programs, with a proposed $400 million \"first installment\" to a new Clean Technology Fund managed by the World Bank. The U.S. Treasury committed $2 billion for the Clean Technology Fund, with a first installment of $400 million in grant money to be provided once appropriated by Congress. At a meeting, several countries pledged up to $6.14 billion for the Climate Investment Funds of the World Bank, including the Clean Technology Fund and the Strategic Climate Fund. These funds aim to support developing countries in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for climate change through grants and concessional loans. The Clean Technology Fund focuses on low-carbon technology projects with long-term greenhouse gas savings potential, while the Strategic Climate Fund has a broader scope. The Strategic Climate Fund, part of the Climate Investment Funds, aims to test innovative approaches to climate change and increase climate resilience in developing countries. It will supplement existing commitments of financial assistance to developing countries and encourage engagement in new GHG mitigation commitments. In the current round of climate change negotiations, there is a need to increase assistance to developing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Debates have arisen over which technologies to finance, which countries should receive assistance, and how the Climate Investment Funds fit into existing funds for GHG mitigation. President Bush proposed increasing international climate change assistance through USAID by $50 million. President Bush proposed increasing international climate change assistance through USAID by $50 million, from $115 million enacted for FY2008 to a proposed $165 million in FY2009. A Continuing Resolution extends the FY2008 funding level through March 6, 2009. The FY2009 requested amount would still be lower than the level of $190 million enacted for FY2006, with a decrease due to $28 million eliminated for \"modern energy services\" in Afghanistan. USAID does not distinguish funding for measuring, monitoring, reporting, verification, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from other activities in relevant sectors. In the FY2009 request, the international assistance category included $52 million for the Department of State, $37 million of which would support the APP. Reported in other agencies under the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) and intended for the APP were another $15 million requested. The Asia Pacific Partnership (APP) requested $15 million for the Department of Energy, $2 million for the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration, and $5 million for the Environmental Protection Agency for FY2009 appropriations. Both the House and Senate rejected the funding request for the APP, consistent with past appropriations. The partnership aims to advance technologies to reduce greenhouse gas intensity in partner nations. The Asia Pacific Partnership (APP) requested funding for various departments for FY2009 appropriations. The initial projects focus on sectoral assessments, capacity building, best practices, and technology research. Critics argue it diverts from UN cooperation, but technological advancement in developing countries is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The UNFCCC requires wealthier parties to provide financial resources for developing countries to meet obligations. International assistance for climate change funding is $26 million for FY2009. Federal climate change funding of $26 million was reported for FY2009 as the United States' contribution to the Global Environment Facility (GEF), managed by the World Bank. The GEF supports projects for clean energy production and efficient energy use. Additionally, the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDC Fund) was established to assist the poorest countries in adapting to climate change, with eligibility restricted to Least Developed Countries and projects required to be short-term, urgent, and derived from completed National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). The Senate-passed bill for foreign operations in FY2009 would have allocated $20 million for the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDC Fund), but it was not enacted into law. The Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) was established by UNFCCC Parties to support adaptation, technology transfer, and economic diversification in developing countries, with the United States not contributing. Additionally, the Adaptation Fund (AF) was set up by Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, with funding sources including a 2% levy. The Adaptation Fund (AF) was established by Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, with funding sources including a 2% levy on emission reduction credits. The United States is not obligated to contribute but may face pressure to make voluntary contributions. The degree of assistance provided to developing countries by Congress will influence the Department of State's ability to enhance U.S. credibility and engage developing countries in new GHG mitigation commitments. However, providing assistance alone may not guarantee that developing countries will consider it measurable, reportable, and verifiable finance, technology, and capacity-building as called for under the Bali Action Plan of 2007. The United States encourages countries to conserve tropical rainforests to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect carbon dioxide removal by trees. This is done through debt restructuring for tropical forestry conservation under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act. The FY2009 request included $20 million for this purpose. The Treasury Department allocates funds for debt restructuring for tropical forestry conservation to address climate change. Tax provisions also support climate activities by incentivizing investments in technologies that emit less greenhouse gases. OMB reports a significant increase in tax expenditures from $580 million in FY2003 to $1.52 billion in FY2007. Tax expenditures rose sharply from $580 million in FY2003 to $1.52 billion in FY2007, primarily due to expected revenue loss from tax incentives in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. OMB projected a decrease to $1.4 billion in FY2009, with further declines through 2013. The extension of incentives for renewable energy in 2008 altered these projections, raising policy issues regarding the continuity of tax provisions for long-term capital projects like wind and renewable energy installations. Tax provisions for energy installations may not be available predictably for new facilities, reducing the effectiveness of tax incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The incentives aim to stimulate new technologies rather than support non-commercially viable markets. Tax incentives for both low and high-GHG-emitting technologies may counteract each other, masking the true cost of energy to consumers. Federal funding related to climate change has expanded over the past two decades to support a variety of programs aimed at developing technologies, planning for adaptation, assisting lower income countries, and addressing additional needs. The debate over appropriate strategies to address climate change continues, with evolving needs and priorities for funding. Federal funding for climate change lacks an overarching policy goal, leading to a fragmented approach with separate goals for science, technology, energy, foreign assistance, and trade. The current federal effort is pieced together from various programs and initiatives without a unified strategy. President-elect Barack Obama emphasized the need for coordination across the government to address climate change. President Obama has designated Carol Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change. He aims to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and by 80% from 2005 levels by 2050. However, the funding proposals and program alignment for these goals remain uncertain. In FY2008, there was no legislative requirement for the Executive Branch to report a cross-cut budget for climate change activities, leading to a lack of consolidated annual reports on climate change funding. The Global Change Research Program did produce its annual report, Our Changing Planet, but with limited budget information. The absence of a requirement for a cross-program, cross-cut budget continues into FY2009. Agencies vary in identifying and explaining climate-related activities in their budget justifications. OMB's cross-cut spreadsheets may include activities not noted in agency justifications, making it difficult to construct an accurate overview of climate change funding without OMB assistance. Congress may choose to maintain separate agency budget reports or reinstate a reporting requirement for climate change funding and tax incentives. The Congress may consider reinstating a reporting requirement for climate change funding and tax incentives to improve transparency and decision-making. Presidents historically categorized agencies' climate change efforts into science, technology, and international assistance programs. The Office of Management and Budget also provides estimates of annual tax incentives. The Office of Management and Budget provides estimates of annual tax incentives, but the traditional reporting by three broad programs may not meet the needs of Congress. A different organization of budgetary information aligned with climate change legislation in the 111th Congress may be more useful for oversight and appropriations functions. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) has been evaluated extensively, but the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) and international assistance efforts lack similar evaluation. This is a gap in oversight and appropriations functions for the 111th Congress. Federal funding and tax incentives for climate change activities have increased by about 85% since FY2001, totaling $7.73 billion for FY2008. The increase is mainly attributed to technology research and development, as well as new tax incentives for greenhouse gas reductions. Scientific research funding also saw a slight increase. However, comparisons over time should be viewed with caution due to reporting issues. Federal funding for climate change science increased by $0.1 billion from FY2001 to FY2008, but after adjusting for inflation, there was a 23% decline in funding. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) received $1.86 million in FY2008, constituting 29% of federal funding for climate change. Satellite-based observing systems received the largest share of funding. The decrease in funding led to reduced support for satellite-based observations and other types of research. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) is undergoing revisions for its strategic plan, with suggestions for improvements in leadership, budget coherence, progress metrics, reporting, and balance among research elements. Legislative options may be considered to clarify goals and organization of federal climate change research, including setting performance objectives for technology and regulatory programs to control greenhouse gas emissions. The federal investment in the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) has more than doubled since FY2001, from $1.68 billion to $4.30 billion enacted for FY2008. Funding for nuclear energy research is the largest component among all climate change-related programs, with broad support for advancing low-emitting technologies. Stakeholders emphasize the need for continuity of programs, incentives consistent with business cycles, and stimulating demand for less-emitting technologies. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) has received increased federal investment, with a focus on advancing low-emitting technologies. There is a need to stimulate demand for these technologies and explore opportunities for revolutionary advancements. Efficiency improvements can be made by strategically reviewing existing programs and evaluating technologies that may aggravate greenhouse gas emissions. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) has received increased federal investment to advance low-emitting technologies and stimulate demand. Efficiencies could be gained by evaluating identified technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a package, considering cumulative effects and alternative policy instruments. Climate change funding includes international programs, with the FY2008 enacted amount at $202 million. President Bush proposed a $2 billion increase over five years to achieve global participation in emission abatement and climate change adaptation. A major policy challenge is negotiating international commitments post-2012 and gaining global engagement in GHG mitigation. Developing countries' participation depends on industrialized countries fulfilling their commitments. The industrialized countries, including the United States, have commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to provide financial and technological assistance to lower-income countries. The US, as a leading emitter of greenhouse gases, is seen as having a significant responsibility in addressing climate change. Many believe that the US and other wealthy nations should take a leading role in global efforts, given their resources and standard of living. The US committed in 1992, along with other wealthy countries, to address climate change. In 1992, the United States, along with other wealthy countries, committed to providing financial and technological assistance to emerging economies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. The US has contributed to the Global Environmental Facility but not to special funds for the least developed countries. In 2008, the US Treasury committed $2 billion to the Clean Technology Fund, with other countries pledging up to $6.14 billion for the Climate Investment Funds. The United States has committed to providing financial and technological assistance for climate change mitigation through various funds and bilateral channels. Congress has not yet appropriated funds for the Climate Investment Funds due to concerns about promoting coal use. Cooperation with developing countries will depend on future federal programs and private partnerships. Congressional appropriations will impact the Department of State's ability to enhance U.S. credibility and engage developing countries in new greenhouse gas mitigation commitments. Providing assistance alone cannot guarantee that developing countries will consider it measurable, reportable, and verifiable finance, technology, and capacity-building as called for under the Bali Action Plan of 2007. Controversy may arise over whether financial assistance provided outside of the UNFCCC's financial mechanisms fulfills commitments under the Convention. Issues also include the management of multilateral funds, the criteria for financing to be considered \"new and additional,\" and the adequacy and predictability of funds. Tax provisions have been enacted to promote technologies emitting fewer greenhouse gases, with a policy issue being the continuity of these provisions over planning and construction periods. Tax provisions aimed at promoting technologies emitting fewer greenhouse gases may not be predictably available for long periods, affecting the effectiveness of incentives for renewable energy investments. The delay in renewing expiring incentives in 2008 led to uncertainties and reduced investor confidence, potentially hindering efforts to reduce GHG emissions. In the current economic situation, tax credits may not be as effective due to decreased profit potential and difficulty in obtaining financing. Additionally, individuals or entities that do not pay enough taxes may not benefit from these tax credits. Tax incentives for low and high GHG-emitting technologies may counteract each other, masking the true cost of energy to consumers. Executive Branch reports only focus on tax incentives that stimulate GHG reductions, while data on other policy objectives like energy security and employment are not provided. Revising conflicting tax provisions could lead to overall efficiencies in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Obama Administration is expected to provide more action-oriented leadership in aligning climate-related programs and funding into an effective cross-agency mission. There are overlaps and gaps among climate-related program areas as policy needs have evolved. There are overlaps and gaps among climate-related program areas in the U.S., including gaps in governance infrastructure and underfunding for economic evaluations and policy analyses. Stakeholders argue that programs for assessing climate change impacts and adaptation planning are not adequately funded. Despite promises for increased emphasis on researching climate change impacts and adaptation in the FY2009 proposal, this was not evident in available documentation. Multiple agencies manage programs for issues like carbon sequestration and vegetation development. Opportunities exist to improve efficiencies in climate change-related programs, with constraints on funding potentially weakening effectiveness. Administrative requirements such as contract use, financing entities in foreign countries, and job mobility barriers for federal personnel can impact program success. Expertise of federal officials and recruitment policies also play a role in program effectiveness. The mobility of federal personnel across programs and departments may hinder development and collaboration. Finding funds for interagency teams can be challenging, leading to calls for structural fixes in federal programs. Proposals to restructure and expand climate change programs may be debated in the 111th Congress to encourage integrated strategies and minimize fragmentation of legislative measures. Some Members of Congress and others are interested in how federal funding can support a strategy to address climate change. However, expanding funding for this purpose may face challenges in demonstrating program benefits amidst budget pressures. The new President's pledges and evolving Congressional debate on climate change policies may lead to changes in funding priorities. Improved reporting of funding and better alignment with strategic policy goals are recommended for climate change activities. The Congress is interested in federal funding to address climate change, but may face challenges in demonstrating program benefits amidst budget pressures. Improved reporting of funding and better alignment with strategic policy goals are recommended for climate change activities. The Congress did not include statutory language in FY2008 appropriations law or FY2009 Continuing Resolution requiring the Administration to report on federal expenditures for climate change activities. Previous years had specific language in annual appropriations bills for foreign operations mandating the President to report on all federal agency obligations and expenditures for climate change programs. Language was not included in the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY2007, but agencies were still required to adhere to the same reporting requirements as FY2006. The President is required to report on climate change obligations and expenditures in FY2007, as mandated by various appropriations acts in previous years. The most recent reporting requirement is outlined in Section 585(b) of P.L. 109-102, which requires a report to Congress on climate change expenditures within 60 days after the President's Budget is transmitted. The President must report on climate change expenditures for FY2007 as per Section 585(b) of P.L. 109-102. The report must detail federal agency obligations and expenditures for climate change programs in FY2006, as well as estimated expenditures and requested funds for FY2005, FY2006, and FY2007 by the United States Agency for International Development. Development of clean energy and efficiency technologies, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, carbon capture, meeting climate change responsibilities, and vulnerability assessments were key goals under President George W. Bush's climate change initiatives. The aim was to cut U.S. greenhouse gas intensity by 18% by 2012 and reduce scientific uncertainties. U.S. programs under President George W. Bush aimed to reduce scientific uncertainties, promote energy efficient technologies, set performance targets for emissions reductions, and halt increases in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 through regulatory measures and market incentives. President Bush's 2002 strategy aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through regulatory measures and market incentives. The plan included a proposal for future international agreements, but faced criticism for its approach to capping emissions. A new Cabinet-level Committee on Climate Change Science and Technology Integration was established to oversee research programs, with accountability and leadership distributed across agencies. The Bush Administration's strategy for science and technology programs involves decentralized accountability and leadership within relevant agencies, leading to concerns about collaboration and accountability for climate change goals. Inter-agency working groups facilitate communication and coordination, with budget levels determined through agency-OMB dialogue. President Bush's Climate Change Research Initiative supplements the U.S. Global Change Research Program, emphasizing long-term scientific research. The US Global Change Research Program (US GCRP) was established by Congress in 1990 to focus on long-term scientific research. In 2002, a Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) was created alongside the science research program, including the National Climate Change Technology Initiative (NCCTI) and clean energy research. The Department of State leads international cooperation efforts. Funding details for the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) are provided, including FY2008 enacted funding by agency and President Bush's FY2009 requests. These issues are likely to be revisited in the 111th Congress. Funding for NASA's contributions to the CCSP increased by 12% in FY2008 to $1.20 billion. President Bush's FY2009 proposal included a $125.6 million increase for NASA's CCSP funding, with approximately 58% of all CCSP funding allocated to NASA. $666 million of NASA's FY2008 funding was for satellite-based observations, with a proposed $102.3 million increase for satellite observations in FY2009. President Bush's FY2009 proposal included a $102.3 million increase for satellite-based observations, boosting the satellite share to $769 million (64% of NASA's total). Key climate-related data would be ensured through the restoration of the Total Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS) and placement of the Clouds and Earth Radiant Energy System (CERES) on the NPOESS Preparatory Project. These sensors would help determine solar variability's impact on climate and how atmospheric changes influence the Earth's energy balance. The Earth's energy balance and climate may be influenced by technologies cut from NASA's budget in 2006. Earth Sciences have been low priority, with funds shifted to other programs. An NRC report in 2006 found the proposed space and Earth science program lacking balance and sustainability. Under the FY2009 proposal, the Earth System Science Pathfinder, including the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) and Aquarius, would have seen changes. NASA's FY2009 budget proposal includes a 22% funding decrease for the Earth System Science Pathfinder, which consists of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) and Aquarius. The budget also allocates $910 million for the development of the SMAP mission for soil moisture mapping and a second generation ICESat mission to measure ice topography. Additional missions are planned by 2013 in response to the NRC Decadal Survey, with revisions in NASA's accounting methods making budget comparisons challenging. NASA's FY2009 budget proposal includes a 22% funding decrease for the Earth System Science Pathfinder, which consists of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) and Aquarius. The budget also allocates $910 million for the development of the SMAP mission for soil moisture mapping and a second generation ICESat mission to measure ice topography. NASA supports satellite-based climate-related observations through various satellite systems, including the Landsat Data Continuity Mission and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). Other agencies like NOAA and the Department of Defense also contribute to satellite-sensor systems for climate monitoring. NASA's FY2009 budget supports evaluation of policy, market, and technology approaches for climate change adaptation. Funding for satellite-based observations has decreased, while research and analysis funding has declined even faster. The NRC recommended correcting reductions in research programs, but cutting research from existing missions has been noted to reduce benefits. The National Research Council (NRC) has highlighted the importance of maintaining research and analysis of observations from existing missions to maximize the return on investment in acquiring satellite-based data. There is a need for better access to data for NASA users, rather than new modeling or data analysis tools. Coordination between NASA's applied research efforts and program agencies' needs for missions related to climate change adaptation or mitigation remains unclear. NOAA, the second largest agency in the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), receives about 14% of total funding and plays a significant role in directing the program. NOAA has the lead on the Capstone Synthesis and Assessment Product of the CCSP, with a proposed budget increase of $20 million for climate change science in FY2009. The emphasis is on observational capacities, not applied research or planning. Funding redistribution within NOAA is on hold due to a Continuing Resolution until March 6, 2009. The FY2009 budget includes a request for a $74 million increase to support climate sensors like the CERES and TSIS sensors, which were de-manifested in 2006 but are now seen as key for calibration of measurements. The FY2009 budget includes a $74 million increase to support climate sensors like CERES and TSIS, responding to Decadal Survey recommendations. This is the first budget request for the CCSP including funding for these items to provide an accurate picture of climate funding. The increase would raise NOAA's budget authority by $7 million for FY2007 and FY2008, and by $81 million for FY2009. Proposed reductions include cutting $5.4 million for Regional Climate Centers and $19.1 million for \"Archive, Access, and Assessment.\" NOAA's FY2009 budget justification aims for the development of an integrated system. NOAA's FY2009 budget justification includes objectives such as developing an integrated earth system analysis capability, creating a high-quality record of the atmosphere and ocean since 1979, enhancing carbon cycle research, quantifying climate forcing and feedbacks, assessing abrupt changes in a warming climate, and ecological forecasting. Funding proposals include $74 million for CERES and TSIS radiation sensors, $1.0 million for research on \"Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation\" (A-MOC), and $0.6 million to $2.1 million for ecological forecasting. The FY2009 proposal includes funding increases for Climate Data and Information, National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS), and Water Vapor Process Research. This includes $8.3 million for Climate Data, $2 million for NIDIS, and $880 thousand for Water Vapor Research to improve understanding of water vapor distribution in the atmosphere. The funding would also be used to improve computer models for analyzing greenhouse gas, aerosol, and cloud effects on climate. The proposed National Climate Service aims to improve seasonal to multi-annual forecasts and data products, including drought information, to enhance prediction and response to drought, hurricanes, fires, floods, and weather extremes. It focuses on greenhouse gas, aerosol, and cloud effects on climate, distinct from the debate over human-induced climate change. The FY2009 proposal for the Department of Commerce's contribution to the CCSP included NIST activities for the first time as a distinct line item, with a requested increase of $5.0 million to $5.2 million. The funds would be used to resolve discrepancies in satellite measurements of radiation and provide critical information about aerosols and atmospheric components related to global climate change. The National Science Foundation (NSF) funding for climate change research in FY2008 was just over $205 million, constituting about 11% of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP). NSF's funding was only 3% of total federal funding for climate change in FY2008. President Bush's budget proposed an increase of $16 million to $220.6 million (8%) in FY2009, with proposed increases for Geosciences and Office of Polar Programs. Climate change science programs invest in fundamental discovery, research infrastructure, and educational activities. High priorities include data acquisition, information management, model enhancement, development of new Earth observing instruments, and new research methods. NSF also has a program for research on organizational processes for identifying and evaluating policies for mitigation, adaptation, and other responses to environmental conditions. DOE's funding for the CCSP was $128.3 million in FY2008, proposed to increase to $145.9 million in FY2009, with a focus on research on climate forcing. The contribution to the CCSP in FY2009 would increase by $3.2 million to $81.2 million. $52.6 million would support research on Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) to study the roles of clouds, aerosols, and solar radiation in climate change prediction. $14.8 million would fund research, while $37.8 million would support the ARM infrastructure. An additional $2.6 million would support a new mobile facility. $13.0 million would fund research on atmospheric aerosols, and $13.6 million would support Ameriflux for measuring carbon dioxide, energy, and water exchanges. In FY2009, AmeriFlux received $13.6 million to measure carbon dioxide, energy, and water exchanges in North America. The Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Center (CDIAC) was supported with $1.9 million. The DOE's Office of Science proposed $45.4 million for climate change modeling, including work on Earth System models and abrupt climate change. The Climate Change Response program would have received $19.4 million under President Bush's request. The Climate Change Response program would have received $19.4 million under President Bush's request, with $13.2 million for experimental studies on the effects of warming, precipitation changes, and CO2 increases on ecosystems. Research on carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) was proposed to increase to $17.4 million in FY2009, with $12.3 million supporting biological sequestration and $4.7 million supporting soil sequestration for ethanol production. The USGS restructured its climate change science research in 2007, with a FY2009 budget of $31.4 million for CCSP-related activities. The FY2009 budget for CCSP-related work included $31.4 million, with $26.6 million consolidated into one Global Change activity account. Additional funding supported the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive and Biological Research and Monitoring activities. USGS introduced a new climate change science strategy, the National Climate Effects Research and Monitoring Network, focusing on long-term monitoring, field study sites, regional surveys, and space-based remote sensing. The FY2009 budget for CCSP-related work included $31.4 million, with a focus on long-term monitoring, field study sites, regional surveys, and space-based remote sensing to track environmental changes. USGS proposed expanding adaptation-oriented projects to develop decision tools for resource managers and policy makers to address future climate change. The Bureau of Reclamation also reported climate change-related activities, with funding levels for impact assessment and adaptation expected to be higher than other agencies. The Bureau of Reclamation's funding for climate change activities in FY2009 was $31.9 million, with $19.0 million allocated to the Water for America Initiative. They are examining how climate change information can be integrated into water and power operations through project-specific studies and collaborative research with other agencies and entities. Another $12.9 million would fund projects for endangered species recovery activities. Reclamation's funding for climate change activities in FY2009 was $31.9 million, with $19.0 million allocated to the Water for America Initiative. An additional $12.9 million would fund specific projects for endangered species recovery activities and investigation programs. The focus is on two of the Initiative's strategies: Plan for Our Nation's Water Future and Expand, Protect, and Conserve Our Nation's Water Resources. The third strategy, Enhance Our Nation's Water Knowledge, will be handled by USGS. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is engaged in work on climate change impacts on health, focusing on understanding potential health effects and developing adaptation strategies. CDC identified 11 priority health actions and developed a policy statement in response to the need for additional scientific research on the health effects of global climate change. The World Health Organization (WHO) released an agenda of research priorities in October 2008 to address the health effects of climate change globally. The priorities include interactions with other health determinants, better characterization of long-term climate change effects, comparing effectiveness of short-term interventions, assessing health impact of policies of non-health sectors, and strengthening public health. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) research on climate change impacts has faced funding reductions, with a proposed cut of $2.8 million in FY2009 from the FY2008 level of $19.6 million. Despite declining funding, EPA's research has been commended for its important role in the Federal program. The EPA's budget for research on climate change impacts is compared to \"eating the seed corn,\" posing a risk of inadequate problem-solving in the future. The lack of understanding could lead to costly mistakes in regulatory responses. The SAB recommended long-term GHG reduction objectives to guide EPA's research portfolio, reflecting the ongoing debate on climate-related research priorities among agencies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) faced a decrease in funding for climate change science from $64.4 million in FY2008 to $60.3 million in FY2009. Most of the reduction came from cuts to various climate change programs in the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), resulting in a FY2009 request of $35.7 million. ARS conducts intramural research, including carbon cycle activities like GRACEnet and Agriflux network to understand soil carbon sequestration. The USDA's funding for climate change science decreased from $64.4 million in FY2008 to $60.3 million in FY2009. The ARS requested $35.7 million for FY2009, with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and studying climate change impacts on agricultural ecosystems. Funding for Forest Services research on climate change would be reduced, while funding for CSREES would increase for research on land use and ecosystems. The USDA's funding for climate change science decreased from $64.4 million in FY2008 to $60.3 million in FY2009. The research focused on land use, land cover, and managed ecosystems in terms of carbon and greenhouse gas fluxes. Funding for Forest Services research on climate change would be reduced, while funding for CSREES would increase for research on land use and ecosystems. The FY2009 request proposed increased funding for research on ultraviolet radiation effects on plant and animal physiology and ecosystems, as well as the carbon cycle. President Bush's FY2009 request for the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) included changes to funding for the Department of Energy (DOE), with a proposed reduction for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The FY2009 budget justifications provided descriptions of ongoing programs and priorities approved by OMB, but it remains to be seen how President Obama may modify these proposals. The FY2009 budget includes reductions for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, while proposing increases for geothermal systems, biofuels, vehicle, building, and industrial technologies. There are significant increases in funding for Fossil Energy Research and Development/Efficiency and Sequestration, nuclear energy supply and conservation, and nuclear fusion research. Both the House and Senate passed bills in 2008 covering most of the CCTP appropriations. The House and Senate passed bills in 2008 for CCTP appropriations, deviating from FY2008 levels and FY2009 request. DOE weatherization grants were preserved, with a special provision adding $250 million for weatherization in the Continuing Resolution. DOE's budget authority for CCTP rose from FY2003 to FY2004, focusing on clean coal power efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Funding for nuclear energy also increased significantly. Funding for nuclear energy has increased significantly, becoming a large share of CCTP funding. The FY2009 request would further increase nuclear energy funding, making it more than half of the NCCTI funding. The nuclear energy R&D program aims to develop new technologies to meet energy and climate goals, but critics argue it provides wasteful subsidies to an industry they believe should be phased out. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) focuses on recycling uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) aimed to develop technologies for recycling uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel without creating pure plutonium for nuclear weapons. However, nuclear opponents disputed the technology's proliferation resistance. In 2008, the House Appropriations Committee criticized GNEP as rushed and expensive, eliminating its funding. President Obama supported harnessing nuclear energy safely as part of a strategy. President Obama has expressed support for safely harnessing nuclear energy to address climate change. The US Department of Agriculture's contributions to the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) include both mandatory and discretionary funding, with estimated funding levels increasing from $48 million in FY2007 to about $205 million in FY2008. The mandatory funding share is expected to rise from $14 million in FY2007 to $151 million in FY2008 under President Bush's proposals. President Bush's FY2009 budget projected a $22 million funding level. The new Farm Bill will alter the CCTP funding of the USDA, with President Bush's FY2009 budget projecting a $22 million decrease. This decrease is small compared to the significant increases in funding from FY2007 to FY2008, primarily for bioenergy, biobased products research, forest wood to energy, renewable energy grants, and loans. These increases were included in the Administration's recommendations for the 2007-2008 farm bill debate. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized, modified, and expanded programs in Conservation, Energy, and Rural Development titles. USDA programs indirectly affect U.S. climate change initiatives, but the impact on overall funding levels for climate change programs is uncertain. DOD funding for CCTP rose from $100.9 million in FY2007 to $109.6 million enacted. DOD funding for the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) increased from $100.9 million in FY2007 to $109.6 million in FY2008. President Bush's budget proposed a further increase to $131.0 million in FY2008, with varying allocations to different services. The FY2009 appropriations were signed into law on September 30, 2008, but specific changes to CCTP funding levels are unclear. The Administration requested to raise Air Force funding by $81.7 million in FY2009, while decreasing funding to the Army and Navy. The DOD accounted for 97% of all U.S. Government fuel consumption in 2005, costing over $8 billion. The Defense Science Board warned in 2008 that current energy consumption patterns put military operations at risk due to high fuel demand and dependence on a fragile electricity grid. The DOD had not implemented key recommendations from a 2001 task force to address these issues. The 2008 report highlighted that DOD had not implemented key recommendations from a 2001 task force on energy, emphasizing the need for leadership oversight and accountability to address scattered decision-making on energy demand. Senior leadership was urged to establish oversight and ongoing measurement of progress across the organization. The 2008 report recommended that DOD establish a strategic plan with measurable goals to achieve business process changes. Decisions on energy security could impact greenhouse gas emissions, with controversy over using alternative fuels. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 constrained agencies from procuring alternative fuels with higher emissions, affecting the DoD. The DSB recommended that the DoD invest in low carbon synthetic fuel technologies to address climate change implications and reduce carbon emissions. They advised avoiding processes that exceed the carbon footprint of petroleum and focusing on producing fuel at forward deployed locations using renewable or waste feedstock to reduce transportation needs. The DoD should invest in research for alternative, renewable fuels to reduce carbon emissions. DARPA has been praised for its technological advancements and there are calls for expanding its energy technology program. Funding for DARPA-E was proposed to be eliminated in FY2009, but Congress amended the DOD authorization to consider the effects of fuel production on the environment. The Department of Defense (DOD) is required to consider the effects of climate change on its facilities, capabilities, and missions. Military planners must assess risks, update defense plans, engage with allies on climate mitigation, and develop capabilities to reduce future impacts. The next quadrennial defense review will assess DOD's capacities to respond to climate change consequences, including extreme weather events. The Department of Defense is mandated to assess the impact of climate change on its operations and facilities. The Secretary of Defense must submit a plan to Congress for improving interagency coordination on national security strategy, including addressing climate change impacts. The Environmental Protection Agency's funding for the Climate Change Technology Program is decreasing, with a budget authority of $105 million in FY2007, $108 million in FY2008, and a requested $98 million in FY2009. EPA's role includes evaluating greenhouse gas emissions and running voluntary programs. Funding will continue at FY2008 levels until March 6, 2009. The EPA evaluates greenhouse gas emissions and runs voluntary programs to reduce emissions. President Bush's proposal would cut funding for Energy Star programs and the Industrial Carbon outreach program. The agency also assesses options to reduce emissions from vehicles. The EPA evaluates options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, including biofuel mandates. President Bush's FY2009 proposal would cut funding for a greenhouse gas reporting registry. President Bush's FY2009 proposal would not continue funding for a national Greenhouse Gas Registry, leading to backlash from Senators. Consistent reporting of GHG emissions is crucial for effective emission reduction programs. Various initiatives are being developed to guide reporting of emissions and reductions in anticipation of mandatory requirements. EPA's budget justification acknowledges these efforts. The FY2009 budget proposal does not include funding for a national Greenhouse Gas Registry, causing concern among Senators. EPA is reviewing data to improve efficiency and reduce overlaps in climate technology initiatives. NASA's funding for CCTP is set to decrease from $139.0 million to 2.6%. NASA's CCTP funding is proposed to decrease from $139.0 million to $116.1 million for FY2009. The largest portion of the funding is for the Fundamental Aeronautics Program, aimed at developing environmentally friendly aircraft. The FY2009 request would reduce the level by $19.5 million to $100.5 million, in line with a provision in the 2009 defense reauthorization law requiring NASA to support research for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. President Bush's request for FY2009 would reduce Exploration Technology Development Program projects to advance lithium-ion batteries, regenerative fuel cells, and nuclear fission. Funding for measuring surface radiation for solar heating would remain constant at $1.6 million. Climate Change Technology Priorities were designated as \"high priority\" by the Bush Administration, with funding evolution provided in a table. The status of these priorities in funding decisions is unclear."
