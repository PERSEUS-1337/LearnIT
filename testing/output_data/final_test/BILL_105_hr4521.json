The amendment to the \"Family Business and Family Farm Preservation Act of 1998\" limits estate tax deduction for family-owned business interests, excluding interests in a business owned by a single family. If the deduction exceeds $675,000 due to subsection (a)(4), failure to meet the reinvestment requirement will result in a 10 percent tax. The adjusted tax difference for qualified family-owned business interests is determined based on the excess of adjusted net earnings over the reinvestment amount. Tax is imposed only if the value of the business interests involved in the event exceeds a certain threshold. The tax on qualified family-owned business interests is determined by the excess of adjusted net earnings over the reinvestment amount, only imposed if the value exceeds a certain threshold. The 10-year period can be extended if the reinvestment amount is increased due to audit or impossible to meet due to unforeseen circumstances. The Secretary may extend the 10-year period for meeting the reinvestment requirement in case of unforeseen circumstances. The reinvestment requirement is met if the reinvestment amount is not less than the adjusted net earnings for the taxable year. The term 'reinvestment amount' refers to the increase in net asset investment and working capital of the same trade or business during a taxable year. The increase in net asset investment is determined as the excess of the net asset investment for the year. The term 'net asset investment' refers to the excess of the aggregate adjusted bases of qualified assets over the aggregate outstanding amount of indebtedness incurred for their acquisition. The term 'qualified asset' refers to tangible or intangible property, excluding certain types of property. 'Adjusted net earnings' for this purpose means taxable income increased by certain interest amounts. The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying after the date of enactment of this Act."
