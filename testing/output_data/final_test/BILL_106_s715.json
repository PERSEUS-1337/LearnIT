The Hanford Reach, the last free-flowing nontidal segment of the Columbia River in the US, has been preserved due to its location within the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. Public Law 100-605 required an analysis of protection alternatives for the Hanford Reach, leading to a recommendation for its designation as a recreational river under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The area serves as a vital migration corridor for anadromous fish. The Hanford Reach is a vital habitat for anadromous fish and other wildlife, providing spawning areas for salmon and steelhead trout. It also offers recreational opportunities such as hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation in a scenic and pristine environment. The Hanford Reach in Washington, near Richland, Pasco, and Kennewick, has been important to Native Americans for over 10,000 years with 150 archaeological sites. The area also holds historical significance for the Manhattan Project, cold war defense production, and early Euro-American settlement. The White Bluffs area is rich in fossilized remains from the Pliocene period. Designation of the Hanford Reach as a recreational river under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act would enhance local revenues and economic investment in Richland, Pasco, and Kennewick, Washington. Existing economic activities along the river corridor are compatible with this designation, and it can only be changed by a subsequent Act of Congress. The Hanford Reach can be designated as a recreational river under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which would facilitate the cleanup of contaminated areas at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. It also holds significance as an outdoor laboratory and classroom, offering a unique opportunity for partnerships focused on education and interpretation of its natural and human history. The Act aims to protect the natural, cultural, and recreational resources of the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River by designating it as a recreational river under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. It also seeks to encourage education and interpretation of the area and protect the land adjacent to the Hanford Reach. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act designates the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River in Washington as a recreational river from river mile 346.5 to river mile 396. Special requirements apply to this area under section 3A of the Act. The Hanford Reach recreational river in Washington is designated as a recreational river and managed by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with relevant laws. The designation of the river cannot be altered, and there is a 15-member management commission for the river. A 15-member management commission for the Hanford Reach recreational river includes representatives from various government departments, Washington state agencies, local counties, Indian tribes, and the public interested in conservation, recreation, and business. The 15-member management commission for the Hanford Reach recreational river is responsible for developing a management plan. Commission members are nominated by local residents and appointed by the Governor of Washington. All decisions require a supermajority vote of at least 10 members. The commission must involve public participation and prioritize recreation as a key value of the river. The 15-member management commission for the Hanford Reach recreational river is responsible for prioritizing recreation as a key value of the river. They aim to coordinate with various entities for educational programs, develop an interpretive center, and coordinate recreational tourism efforts through a community-based bureau. The Hanford Reach recreational river management commission aims to prioritize recreation and coordinate with entities for educational programs and tourism efforts through a community-based bureau. Public land adjacent to the river can be included, but privately owned land is prohibited unless acquired through specific strategies outlined in the management plan. Access corridors for the river must be retained. The designation of the Hanford Reach recreational river will not affect existing laws, agreements, or facilities, allowing for the operation and maintenance of energy, transmission, water intake, and outfall facilities as long as they do not substantially impact the natural resources of the area. The designation of the Hanford Reach recreational river will not impose more restrictive remediation requirements, prohibit construction of temporary facilities for remediation, or relieve the Secretary of Energy from any liability at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation under environmental laws. The Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with other agencies, will develop a plan for improving levees and rivershore areas downstream of the Hanford Reach recreational river. This includes habitat restoration, recreation, river access, and aesthetics. Amendments will remove duplication in the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is being amended to remove a paragraph related to Elkhorn Creek, Oregon, and designate the remaining paragraphs as (157), (158), and (159) respectively. This is part of a plan to improve levees and rivershore areas downstream of the Hanford Reach recreational river, focusing on habitat restoration, recreation, river access, and aesthetics. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Energy will study consolidating Bureau of Land Management parcels at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation for a land exchange. The objectives include clearing title for industrial development, protecting wildlife and plants, and preserving Native American cultural sites."
