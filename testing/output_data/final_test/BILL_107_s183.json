    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Small Business Employment and Education Enhancement Act of 2001\". The authorizations for Federal aid to elementary and secondary education programs expired during the 106th Congress. The reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is expected during the 107th Congress. Federal grants for elementary and secondary education, as outlined in the Dissemination and Improvement Act of 1994 and the National Education Statistics Act of 1994, are crucial. The business community, especially small businesses, emphasize the importance of students graduating with basic skills in reading, writing, math, and science to succeed in the workplace. A 1999 survey by the American Management Association highlighted concerns about students' lack of essential skills for the workforce. Workplace testing revealed that 36% of employees lacked basic skills in reading, writing, and math. Small businesses had higher deficiency rates than the national average. 60% of American Management Association member companies faced a shortage of skilled manpower, with 67% expecting the shortages to continue. Additionally, a 1999 National Federation of Independent Business report showed that 18% of members found qualified labor to be their top concern, while a poll of the United States Chambers of Commerce found that 83% reported difficulties in finding skilled workers. According to a survey, 83% of members are concerned about finding qualified workers, and 53% believe education is the most pressing public policy issue. High-skilled job growth is surpassing other fields, and small businesses are vital to the economy.

The Secretary of Education will disseminate information to help small businesses collaborate with school systems to enhance education. This includes providing guidance materials, best practices, and checklists through various channels such as the World Wide Web and Department of Education publications. Additionally, the Department of Education will serve as a clearinghouse for information. The Secretary of Education will establish a centralized database as a clearinghouse for information on successful initiatives involving small businesses in education.
