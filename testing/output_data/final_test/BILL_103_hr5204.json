This credit is outlined in section 35 of the Act. The Employee Partnership Reward Act of 1994 introduces a tax credit for rewards received from performance-based plans. The credit is 10% of the rewards, not exceeding $500 per employee, with a minimum of $100. Adjustments for inflation apply after 1994. The Employee Partnership Reward Act of 1994 introduces a tax credit for rewards from performance-based plans. Dollar amounts in paragraphs (1) or (2) increase annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment. An eligible employee is defined as a participant in a qualified performance-based reward plan, excluding highly compensated employees and sales staff. A qualified performance-based reward plan is a written plan maintained by an employer with the principal purpose of improving organization performance and rewarding employees based on that improvement. It must meet various requirements outlined in subsections (e) to (i) of the Employee Partnership Reward Act of 1994. A qualified performance-based reward plan must meet plan approval, determination, and allocation requirements outlined in subsections (e) to (i) of the Employee Partnership Reward Act of 1994. The plan must distribute amounts based on a fixed formula tied to measurable indicators of performance. A qualified performance-based reward plan must meet distribution requirements ensuring rewards to nonhighly compensated employees are at least 2 percent of total wages paid by the employer. The antidiscrimination requirements for a qualified performance-based reward plan ensure that the plan benefits employees without favoring highly compensated employees. The plan must meet classification criteria set by the employer and approved by the Secretary to avoid discrimination. In determining compliance with antidiscrimination requirements for a qualified performance-based reward plan, certain employees are excluded from consideration. The plan's benefits must have a uniform relationship to employee compensation. Plan approval by the Secretary is necessary, and specific criteria must be met for plan submission. A qualified performance-based reward plan may include a cash or deferred arrangement without losing its qualified status. Self-employed individuals are not considered employees for plan purposes. Such plans are treated as welfare benefit plans under ERISA. Amendments are made to ensure conformity with the Internal Revenue Code. The item relating to section 35 in subchapter A of chapter 1 is amended by adding new items. SEC. 35. Nondeferred distributions from performance-based reward plans. SEC. 36. Overpayments of tax. Effective Date: The amendments apply to taxable years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 102. Additional deduction to employers for performance-based rewards.
