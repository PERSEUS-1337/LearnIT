    "content": "Recent changes in education policy have focused on the importance of teacher quality for student learning. Research shows that measures of teachers' pedagogical and subject-matter knowledge have a stronger impact on student performance than traditional credentials like degree attainment or certification. While credentials are more commonly used in hiring and policy, there is a shift towards incorporating knowledge-based assessments for teachers. Recent changes in education policy emphasize the importance of teacher quality for student learning. Some states have implemented knowledge-based certification systems, requiring teachers to have a major or minor in a subject. Federal policies, such as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, now mandate that public school teachers demonstrate subject expertise. Elementary teachers must show knowledge of basic curricular areas, while middle and secondary teachers must be competent in all subjects they teach. One major goal of NCLB is to improve student achievement by raising teacher quality standards. Schools are required to hire teachers with subject-matter knowledge and competency, demonstrated through state certification exams. The law prohibits hiring teachers with emergency certification or limited subject knowledge. Research has shown that the shortage of qualified teachers is actually a distribution problem, not a supply issue. The shortage of qualified teachers is a distribution problem, with some schools struggling to maintain staff while others have an oversupply. Reasons for this uneven distribution include seniority rules, late decision deadlines for resigning teachers, and working conditions. Addressing this issue is crucial to improving student achievement under NCLB. The report examines the implementation of the NCLB requirement for highly qualified teachers in public schools to address the student achievement gap. It analyzes data on teacher quality before and after NCLB, and discusses potential teacher quality issues for Congress to consider during the ESEA reauthorization process. NCLB made three key changes to the ESEA: requiring all core academic teachers to be \"highly qualified,\" ensuring equal distribution of teacher quality in poor and minority schools, and establishing accountability measures for teacher quality improvement. States receiving ESEA funding must have a plan to have all core academic teachers meet the HQT definition by the 2005-2006 school year. An HQT must have a bachelor's degree and state teaching certification. Teachers must possess a baccalaureate degree and full state teaching certification. They must also demonstrate subject-matter knowledge in the areas they teach, which can be achieved through passing state tests or completing relevant coursework. Experienced school teachers must meet requirements for new teachers or demonstrate competency in subjects taught using a \"high objective uniform state standard of evaluation\" (HOUSSE), which may include passing state certification or licensing exams. The NCLB amendments set minimum standards for teacher qualifications to ensure equal access to good teachers for all students. States must submit plans to the Secretary to prevent poor and minority children from being taught by inexperienced or unqualified teachers. Progress towards meeting the Highly Qualified Teacher deadline must be reported annually by educational agencies. Each local education agency (LEA) must publicly issue reports on progress towards meeting the Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT) deadline. LEAs failing to meet HQT objectives for consecutive years must submit improvement plans to the State Education Agency (SEA) and may face restrictions on Title I and II funds if objectives are not met. Following the passage of NCLB, the Department of Education (ED) specified the Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT) definition through various means to address concerns about the requirements. Implementation issues included clarifying core subject matter, developing and applying a HOUSSE, differentially applying HQT requirements, and completion deadlines. Questions arose about the applicability of these provisions to all teachers, including vocational education and special education teachers. According to ESEA Section 9101(11), \"core academic\" subjects are defined. The ESEA Section 9101(11) defines core academic subjects as English, reading, mathematics, science, foreign languages, civics, government, economics, arts, history, and geography. Final regulations for the Title I program clarified that these requirements apply to core academic subject teachers only, including vocational education and special education teachers. Additional guidance addressed subject matter issues, such as science teachers teaching multiple fields needing to be highly qualified in each field taught. States have flexibility in determining teacher qualifications. Under new flexibility, states decide if science teachers must be highly qualified in each specific field or in science in general. Changes were included in revised nonregulatory guidance on August 3, 2005. Social studies is not a core subject, and certification in social studies does not guarantee qualification to teach related subjects. States determine if a teacher is qualified to teach a specific subject. NCLB allows experienced teachers to demonstrate subject knowledge. The SEA must set standards for grade-appropriate academic subject knowledge and teaching skills aligned with state academic standards. The HOUSSE must provide objective information about teachers' content knowledge and be applied uniformly statewide. Multiple measures of teacher competency can be used, not primarily based on time teaching relevant subjects. States should consider various factors when developing HOUSSE procedures. When developing their HOUSSE procedures, states have the authority to determine who is considered new to the profession. Teachers with less than one year of experience are classified as new, while those with more than one year are not. States can design procedures for teachers to demonstrate competency in multiple subjects through a single process. NCLB allows for full certification through alternative routes, and teachers in alternative certification programs are considered highly qualified on a provisional basis for up to three years. Teachers in alternative certification programs are considered highly qualified on a provisional basis for up to three years, as long as they are receiving professional development and making progress towards full certification. Concerns about limiting participation in international teacher exchange programs were addressed by allowing states to define their own requirements for certification and make accommodations for foreign teachers. The Secretary clarified that accommodations can be made for foreign teachers in terms of licensure and subject-matter expertise demonstration. Changes were included in the September 2003 guidance regarding middle school teacher competency requirements and the recognition of middle school certified teachers as \"highly qualified.\" States are advised to consider the rigor of subject matter in determining teacher qualifications for grades 6 through 8. In March 2004, the Secretary announced flexibility for small rural school districts in implementing the Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT) requirements. Teachers in these districts teaching core academic subjects have an additional three years to meet the HQT requirements in other subjects they teach. This grace period started in the 2004-2005 school year. The Secretary announced flexibility for small rural school districts in implementing the Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT) requirements. Teachers in these districts teaching core academic subjects have an additional three years to meet the HQT requirements in other subjects they teach, starting in the 2004-2005 school year. Newly hired teachers must be highly qualified in one core subject area when hired. States decide whether to offer this flexibility to eligible rural districts. Each SEA had to submit a plan to meet the HQT deadline along with its Consolidated State Application for State Grants on July 12, 2002. The plan included establishing annual measurable objectives for each LEA and school to ensure annual increases in the percentage of HQTs. LEAs receiving ESEA Title I funding had to ensure all teachers hired after the 2002-2003 school year were highly qualified. States and LEAs had to submit annual reports to ED on progress, with the first data due in January 2005. The Education Department reported widespread problems in state data systems for meeting the Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT) requirement. Regional data workshops were offered to support states in collecting data, with additional flexibility announced in a policy letter dated October 21, 2005. States not reaching the 100% HQT goal by the end of the 2005-2006 school year would not lose federal funds if making a good-faith effort to comply with the law. The Education Department provided additional flexibility for states to meet the Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT) requirement. States falling short of having highly qualified teachers in every classroom were given an extra year to reach the 100% goal. The Secretary requested revised plans from each state to meet the goal for 2006-2007. Most states had their plans approved, with no penalties imposed on those making a good-faith effort to reach the HQT goal. The section examines progress towards the NCLB goal of placing a highly qualified teacher in every classroom. Data from the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) before NCLB will be compared to post-NCLB data to assess the increase in highly qualified teachers. The data on teacher quality comes from the law's reporting requirements. States must submit the percentage of classes taught by highly qualified teachers in their CSPR. The SASS data measures teachers, while the CSPR data measures classes. Despite the different sources and units of analysis, there appears to be an improvement in teacher quality post-NCLB implementation. According to the SASS survey, nearly all public school teachers held a bachelor's degree and most had state teaching certification. Before NCLB, over 80% of teachers met the Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT) requirement. Out of 2.1 million teachers, 1.73 million taught one subject and 339,000 taught two subjects, with the majority holding full state certification in the subjects they taught. 84.5% of single and two-subject teachers held a baccalaureate degree and were certified in their subjects, meeting the HQT requirement under NCLB. 3.1% were in alternative certification programs, while 0.4% taught two subjects but were only certified in one, qualifying for provisional HQT status. According to ED's guidance, teachers in alternative certification programs or in Small Rural School Achievement (SRSA) schools have additional time to demonstrate subject-matter knowledge. NCLB reporting focuses on the proportion of classes taught by highly qualified teachers, not the proportion of teachers who are highly qualified. This data is not completely compatible with estimates from the SASS survey. The 1999-2000 SASS data showed a high proportion of core subject teachers who were highly qualified before NCLB. The CSPR data indicate an improvement in teacher quality over the years of NCLB implementation, with a steady increase in the percentage of core subject classes taught by highly qualified teachers from 2003-2004 to 2012-2013. The CSPR data show a steady increase in the percentage of classes taught by highly qualified teachers from 90.6% in 2004-2005 to 96.6% in 2012-2013. Classes in elementary schools and low-poverty schools were more likely to be taught by HQTs than classes in secondary schools and high-poverty schools. Legislative action to reauthorize and amend the ESEA, including HQT requirements, has been undertaken by Congress. Several reauthorization proposals would amend the HQT requirement. Several reauthorization proposals aim to amend the HQT requirement to accommodate certain teachers or schools, addressing issues such as multiple subject matter teachers, definitions of subject matter, and concerns in rural, urban, and poor schools. Congress is also considering issues related to waivers offered by the Secretary to waive certain NCLB requirements in exchange for reforms in teacher evaluation systems. This may shift focus towards teacher performance rather than qualifications. The report will further discuss these waivers and other ESEA reauthorization issues. The report discusses the challenges of meeting the HQT requirement for teachers who cover multiple subjects. Solutions have been proposed to allow these teachers to demonstrate knowledge in one subject area while providing a second method for other subjects taught. This could help address the issue for teachers in all schools, not just specific types like rural or hard-to-staff schools. The challenges of meeting the HQT requirement for teachers covering multiple subjects are addressed by proposing solutions to allow them to demonstrate knowledge in one subject area. This could help all teachers, not just those in specific types of schools. The issue of multiple subject teachers is partly due to the definition of core academic subjects in NCLB, with some proposing legislative solutions to recognize \"generalist\" certificates as proof of subject-matter knowledge. States have the authority to determine if teachers qualified in one field are also qualified in other related fields. Many middle school teachers face challenges in meeting the HQT standard, as they may have duties similar to both elementary and secondary school teachers. Some teach multiple subjects in self-contained classrooms, while others teach the same subject to different groups of students. NCLB requires middle school teachers to demonstrate subject-matter expertise similar to secondary school teachers, either by being certified in multiple subjects or proving knowledge in each area by other means. The proposals aim to address challenges faced by middle school teachers in meeting the HQT standard, especially those teaching multiple subjects in small, rural schools. Only a small fraction benefit from the SRSA waiver, with suggestions for extending deadlines for rural schools to meet the requirements. Some proposals suggest extending the HQT deadline for rural schools, while others propose waivers for schools facing undue hardship due to population and geographic constraints. Data shows higher HQT rates in non-poor schools compared to poor schools, indicating a need for addressing underqualified teachers in poor neighborhoods. While no specific amendments have been proposed for urban or poor schools, adopting proposals for \"hard-to-staff\" schools could help alleviate the burden of the HQT requirement. However, short-term waivers and deadline extensions may not be sufficient for schools with high turnover rates. The Administration announced flexibility for states to request waivers from specific NCLB requirements, including HQT targets, to improve instructional quality for disadvantaged students in high poverty areas. LEAs failing to meet HQT targets would no longer need improvement plans and could use Title I and Title II funds flexibly. States granted this flexibility would be exempt from roles in implementing LEA improvement plans. The SEA must enter agreements with LEAs on fund usage and provide technical assistance. States must ensure equal teaching standards for all children. Flexibility in waivers weakens teacher qualification requirements. Teacher evaluation system waivers aim to improve instruction quality."
