    "content": "The Act titled \"Bed Bug Management, Prevention, and Research Act\" establishes a research program to control and eradicate bed bugs. The \"Bed Bug Research Program\" under the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 is amended to include a new subsection focusing on bed bug control. Grants will be awarded for developing more effective chemicals and methods for detecting, preventing, and managing bed bugs, as well as for identifying affordable and effective management methods through research projects. The Secretary will appoint a bed bug task force within 90 days of the Bed Bug Management, Prevention, and Research Act enactment to assist in awarding grants. The task force will include members from the pest management and hospitality industries. The Secretary will publish a request for grant proposals for research projects related to bed bug management, prevention, and research within 180 days of the enactment of the Bed Bug Management, Prevention, and Research Act. The grants will be awarded to various groups and industries impacted by bed bugs, as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will evaluate grant proposals in consultation with a task force and award grants for meritorious research projects. Notification of awards must be given to the task force within 30 days. Subsequent grants will be evaluated by the Secretary in consultation with the task force. The Secretary will award grants for promising research projects identified through evaluation, notifying the task force within 30 days. Coordination is required for expedited approval of methods under specific sections of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. The Rodenticide Act requires consultation and coordination with the EPA for grants and research project evaluations. Matching funds requirement can be waived for projects involving pests of public health significance. The Rodenticide Act designates pests of public health significance, requiring consultation with the EPA. Amendments include changes to subsections (a) and (b)(2) of the Act. Amendments to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act aim to improve efforts in controlling and eradicating bed bugs. Amendments to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act include adding bed bugs to the definition of vector organisms and expanding the definition of adverse effects to consider various factors such as the availability of alternative pesticides and the impact on pest resistance. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act is amended to require efficacy data for exempted pesticides used for public health pests. Additionally, a pilot program for bed bug prevention and mitigation is introduced. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act is amended to include a new section after section 20, requiring efficacy data for exempted pesticides used for public health pests. \"SEC. 20A. BED BUG PREVENTION AND MITIGATION PILOT PROGRAM.\" The Administrator will award grants to three State agencies for a pilot program to supplement bed bug prevention and mitigation activities. One grant must go to a State agency that previously requested a public health exemption for pesticide use against bed bugs. The grant funds will be distributed to political subdivisions and housing authorities to address persistent bed bug infestations for residents lacking financial resources. Grants will be awarded within 180 days of fund appropriation, with recipients required to start disseminating grants within 120 days of receiving funds. Funds can be used for hiring commercial applicators and purchasing mattress covers for effective bed bug control. The grant funds will be used to effectively control bed bugs by purchasing mattress covers, conducting monitoring activities, and treating used mattresses and furniture. Data will be collected on the number of recipients, funds awarded, criteria for awarding funds, success in reducing infestations, and intervention results. The Administrator will report data on intervention efforts and infestation rates to Congress by January 1, 2017. Grant authority under subsection (a) expires after September 30, 2017."
