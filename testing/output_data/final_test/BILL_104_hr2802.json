The President is authorized to negotiate with free trade area countries to modify NAFTA and the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, specifically regarding antidumping and countervailing duty determinations. These determinations would no longer be exclusively reviewed by binational panels and would be subject to judicial review like determinations for non-free trade area countries. The President can negotiate with free trade area countries to modify NAFTA and the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, specifically regarding antidumping and countervailing duty determinations. The negotiations will not affect the rights of the United States or a free trade area country to apply domestic antidumping and countervailing duty laws. Within 150 days of the enactment of this Act, if an agreement is reached, the President must submit a draft implementing bill to Congress for approval and necessary modifications to US law. The agreement entered into under subsection (a)(1) will only take effect in the United States if the implementing bill described in subsection (a)(3)(A) becomes law. Fast track procedures will be extended to the implementing bill by amending certain sections of the Trade Act of 1974. If a draft implementing bill is not submitted within 150 days, certain provisions will cease to apply, and the review process will be modified. If a draft implementing bill is not submitted within 150 days, the President shall notify the government of each free trade area country of the modifications, and any pending determinations will be transferred to the United States Court of International Trade for review. The President shall notify free trade area countries of modifications and transfer pending determinations to the United States Court of International Trade for review. Definitions for determinations and antidumping duties are provided. The terms \"free trade area country\", \"relevant FTA Secretary\", and \"United States Secretary\" are defined in section 516A(f) of the Tariff Act of 1930. SEC. 5. APPLICATION TO CANADA AND MEXICO. This Act applies to goods from Canada or Mexico under NAFTA and other trade agreements. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. Administering authority, Commission, and NAFTA are defined for the purposes of this Act."
