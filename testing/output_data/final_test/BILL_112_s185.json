    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Protection Compact Act of 2011\" and includes findings and purposes. Congress finds that the global use of children for commercial sexual exploitation is a widespread issue, affecting millions of children worldwide. Many countries lack the resources to effectively protect and rescue these children, despite having the political will to do so. The Department of State's 2010 Trafficking in Persons report ranked 132 countries on Tier 2 or Tier 2 Watch List. The United States pledges to establish policies and programs to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, protect victims, and share information with other states parties. The purpose of the Act is to provide incentives to Tier 2 countries and Tier 2 Watch List countries to protect and rescue children from trafficking through Child Protection Compacts. The United States aims to address weaknesses in government institutions to protect children from trafficking, increase local capacity to apprehend traffickers, and ensure transparency in achieving goals outlined in the Compact. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms such as Ambassador, Appropriate congressional committees, Child protection, Compact, and Minor. The curr_chunk defines terms related to national action plans for trafficking and national child protection strategies. These plans aim to reduce trafficking victims, increase prosecutions of traffickers, and provide rehabilitation for survivors. Child Protection Compact outlines short-term and long-term goals for improving child protection and preventing exploitation, designates responsible government ministries, and details coordination between implementing ministries. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of State. Severe forms of trafficking include sex trafficking induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or involving individuals under 18, as well as recruitment, harboring, and transportation. The term \"Tier 2 countries\" and \"Tier 2 Watch List countries\" refer to countries listed by the Secretary of State under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. These countries do not fully comply with minimum standards but are making efforts to do so in combating human trafficking. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE. The Secretary is authorized to provide assistance for countries entering into Compacts with the US to eradicate child trafficking. Assistance will be coordinated with other agencies and provided in the form of grants, agreements, or contracts, not loans. The eligible entities for assistance in eradicating child trafficking include the national government, regional or local governmental units, and NGOs or private entities with expertise in child protection. The Secretary will determine the number of Compacts based on established need, with each Compact not exceeding $15,000,000 in funding. Disbursements will be made annually. Annual disbursements will be made to eligible entities on an annual basis as per the terms of the Compacts. SEC. 5. ELIGIBLE COUNTRIES.

SEC. 6. CHILD PROTECTION COMPACTS.

The Child Protection Compact agreement includes objectives, funding allocation, outcome indicators, a multi-year financial plan, and processes for proposal consideration. The Secretary may consider unsolicited proposals from government units, sustain progress after the Compact expires, and partner with civil society organizations for child protection. The Secretary can provide assistance for developing Compacts with eligible countries through contracts or grants. The term \"program or initiative\" in this section may include various components. The \"program or initiative\" may involve evaluating legal standards, training anti-trafficking personnel, empowering NGOs to educate vulnerable populations, establishing victim-friendly courts, providing after-care facilities for rescued victims, and maintaining data collection systems to monitor victims. Development and maintenance of data collection systems to monitor victims, regional cooperative plans with neighboring countries to prevent cross-border trafficking of children and child sex tourism, and programs addressing demand through educational curricula, social marketing campaigns, and law enforcement activities targeting demand. SEC. 7. SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION OF ASSISTANCE. The Secretary can suspend or terminate assistance for a country or entity if they engage in activities contrary to US national security interests, show a pattern of inconsistent actions, or fail to adhere to their responsibilities under the Compact. Assistance can only be reinstated if the country or entity demonstrates a commitment to correcting the conditions for which assistance was suspended or terminated. (c) Congressional Notification.--Within 3 days of suspending or terminating assistance for a country or entity, the Secretary must report to congressional committees the decision and reasoning. SEC. 8. CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION AND ANNUAL REPORT. Prior to negotiating a Compact with a country, the Secretary must consult with congressional committees and outline negotiation objectives. After a Compact is signed, the Secretary must notify congressional committees within 10 days and provide a detailed summary of the Compact. Additionally, an annual report must be submitted within 180 days of the enactment of the Act and annually thereafter. The President must submit an annual report to congressional committees on the assistance provided under section 4 of the Act for the next 5 years. The report includes obligations and expenditures for each eligible country, progress made towards Compact objectives, and the effectiveness of assistance provided. The assistance provided under section 4 has been effective in helping the country achieve its objectives. Congress believes that up to $30,000,000 of the total appropriations for the Department of State and foreign operations for fiscal years 2012 through 2014 should be allocated for the purposes of this Act."
