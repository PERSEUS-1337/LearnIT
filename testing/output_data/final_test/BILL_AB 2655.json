    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1305 of the Penal Code is amended to state that a court must declare bail forfeited if a defendant fails to appear for arraignment, trial, judgment, or any other required court appearance. However, if the case is dismissed or no complaint is filed within 15 days of arraignment, the bail will be released from all obligations. The court's jurisdiction to declare forfeiture and release bail may be extended for up to 90 days from the arraignment date if requested by the prosecutor or the defendant in writing or in open court. The defendant can request an extension in writing or in open court for the forfeiture notice to be mailed to the surety or depositor of money exceeding $400 within 30 days. The court must also notify the bail agent named on the bond, extending the 180-day period by five days for mailing. If the surety is an authorized corporate surety, the notice of forfeiture must be mailed to the surety at the address on the bond and to the bail agent. Failure to mail the notice within 30 days or to the correct addresses releases the surety from obligations under the bond. If the defendant appears in court within 180 days of forfeiture, the court will vacate the order of forfeiture and exonerate the bond. If the court fails to do so, the surety's obligations will be immediately vacated. The order can be made on just terms not exceeding those imposed in similar situations. If the defendant is surrendered or arrested within 180 days in the county where the case is located, the court will vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the bond if the defendant is released prior to appearing in court. If the court fails to act, the surety's obligations will be immediately vacated. If the surrender or arrest occurs outside the county, the court will also vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the bail. In cases of permanent disability, the court may vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the bail if the defendant is deceased or unable to appear in court, and the absence is not due to the bail's involvement. The court may order the tolling of the 180-day period in cases of temporary disability, if the defendant is unable to appear in court due to illness, insanity, or detention, and the absence is not with the connivance of the bail. The tolling period can be extended after the disability ceases to allow for the defendant's return to court jurisdiction. When a defendant is in custody outside the court's jurisdiction and extradition is not pursued, the court will release the bond and forfeit it on fair terms, not exceeding those for other pretrial release situations. In cases of forfeiture where a defendant is not in custody and is beyond the state's jurisdiction, the court will vacate the forfeiture and exonerate the bond if the prosecuting agency chooses not to seek extradition after the defendant is detained and positively identified by a law enforcement officer. The terms of release will be fair and not exceed those for other pretrial release situations. In cases where additional time is needed to return the defendant to court, the 180-day period for vacating forfeiture may be tolled if both the bail agent and prosecuting agency agree. The court can order tolling for an agreed-upon length of time. The definition of \"arrest\" includes holding the defendant in custody for other charges. A motion filed within the 180-day period can be heard within 30 days after expiration, extendable for good cause, and can be made by the surety insurer."
