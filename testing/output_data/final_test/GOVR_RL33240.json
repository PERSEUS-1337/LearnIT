Various kinetic energy BMD programs have been pursued, resulting in numerous flight tests and some operational experience. This report examines the U.S. investment in hit-to-kill technology for BMD and highlights technological differences in attacking short or medium-range ballistic missiles. This report distinguishes between theater missile defense (TMD) and national missile defense (NMD) programs based on historical flight test data from the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) in June 2005. The flight tests had multiple objectives to maximize benefits, with results determined by relevant agencies or military branches. Flight test results in the report are from the MDA's Flight Tests Results memorandum. The analysis of historical flight test data from the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) in 2007 shows mixed results in the development and deployment of U.S. ballistic missile defense systems. The performance of deployed systems like the Patriot PAC-3 is ambiguous, and the operational effectiveness of the National Defense System against long-range threats is still uncertain. The United States has pursued four major kinetic energy interceptor programs since the 1980s. The Army developed the Overlay Experiment (HOE) in the late 1970s to test hit-to-kill technology. Despite three failed intercept tests, the fourth was successful. The program led to the Exoatmospheric Reentry Interceptor Subsystem (ERIS) in 1991, with the first intercept test considered successful. The NMD program conducted a series of eight flight tests from 1997 to 2001. Three fly-by tests had no intercept attempts, with one failing to launch. Of the five planned intercept attempts, three intercepted their targets, one failed due to the interceptor kill vehicle not deploying, and another failed because the on-board sensors malfunctioned. Officials concluded that 17 of the 20 primary objectives were achieved. The GMD program, successor to NMD, began flight testing in 2002. Six flight tests have taken place, with 80% of primary intercept objectives met. A new configuration was undertaken in 2004, with successful integration flight tests. The system was deployed in Alaska and California in 2004 and declared operational after eight missiles were placed in silos. The GMD system was deployed in Alaska and California in 2004 and declared operational after eight missiles were placed in silos. Subsequent intercept flight tests in December 2004 and February 2005 failed to launch, but a successful intercept was achieved in a test in September 2006. Despite delays, the NMD programs have shown some success with a 39% intercept rate in tests since the early 1980s. Various reasons such as hardware and software issues have been cited for the failures in intercept tests. The history of the GMD system deployment and subsequent intercept flight tests show a mix of successes and failures due to hardware and software issues. There is limited evidence supporting the promise of kinetic energy interceptor technology for long-range ballistic missiles, but critics question the realism and success rate of the testing efforts. The effectiveness of developing and deploying kinetic energy interceptor technologies for missile defense remains uncertain. The effectiveness of developing and deploying kinetic energy interceptor technologies for missile defense remains uncertain. Various TMD programs have been developed since the early 1990s, including ERINT, FLAGE/SRHIT, LEAP, Navy Aegis BMD, Patriot PAC-3, and THAAD. The Army's FLAGE/SRHIT program conducted successful flight tests from 1984-1987 to prove lower atmosphere intercept feasibility. The Army's ERINT flight test program (1992-1994) conducted five flight tests, with three planned intercepts successfully achieving their targets. Despite one hardware-related failure, the Army concluded that most primary and secondary test objectives were met in these tests. The Army and Navy conducted non-intercept and intercept flight tests for their LEAP and THAAD programs. The Navy achieved 82% of its primary objectives and all secondary objectives in its tests, while the Army faced challenges with THAAD intercept tests, failing in seven out of nine attempts. The THAAD program faced challenges with intercept tests, failing in seven out of nine attempts. However, recent successful intercepts led to a decision to further develop and revamp the program. The current THAAD program is a redesign of the former system, with a recent successful non-intercept flight test conducted to examine missile functions. The Patriot program, dating back to the 1960s, was given an anti-missile role in the 1980s with the Patriot PAC-2 system using non-nuclear explosive charges for defense. The Patriot PAC-2 system, using non-nuclear charges, had controversial performance during Desert Storm in 1991. However, improvements were made for missile defense, leading to the testing of the Patriot PAC-3 with kinetic energy interceptor in 1997. Out of 27 intercept tests, 21 were successful (78% success rate), meeting 92% of primary objectives. In Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, the Patriot PAC-3 had limited use with four successful engagements, showing promise but uncertain operational effectiveness. The Navy conducted successful intercept tests of its Aegis BMD program using the SM-3 Block 1 missile. The most recent test involved a warhead target separating from the booster rocket. A December 2006 intercept attempt was unsuccessful due to technical issues. The concept of hit-to-kill for TMD appears promising, especially with the Patriot PAC-3 and Navy BMD program. The current THAAD program is based on prior test failures, with no conclusive data on its potential success. The Patriot PAC-3 and Aegis SM-3 systems have been evolving for decades, raising questions about the effectiveness of U.S. ballistic missile defenses. Over $100 billion has been spent on missile defense with a focus on kinetic energy kill concept since the SDI program in the 1980s. The United States has been focusing on the kinetic energy or hit-to-kill concept for its ballistic missile defense programs since the mid-1970s. Progress is being made, with operational effective BMD systems based on this concept on the horizon. Supporters argue that the threat from ballistic missiles and WMDs necessitates the development of effective BMD systems. There is a call for an independent evaluation of the test record to address any challenges impeding the U.S. effort. Some argue for a comprehensive review of the ballistic missile defense test record, while others suggest exploring alternative military strategies like counter-force or arms control. There are also suggestions to increase developmental testing and consider exotic technologies like lasers or space-based weapons. The United States should increase developmental testing before moving to more realistic testing regimes to confirm the validity of the hit-to-kill concept for BMD."
