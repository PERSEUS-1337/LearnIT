    "content": "The \"Lead-Acid Battery Recycling Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to include a section on the recycling of lead-acid batteries. The curr_chunk defines \"lead-acid battery\" as a battery containing lead and sulfuric acid used as a power source, and \"municipal solid waste\" as waste generated by the general public or from various sources including paper, wood, plastics, metal, and glass. The curr_chunk defines \"solid waste\" as waste material from various sources, excluding hazardous waste or waste from environmental response actions. The curr_chunk defines \"rechargeable battery\" as voltaic or galvanic cells designed for recharging, including battery packs. The curr_chunk specifies exclusions from the definition of a rechargeable battery, such as batteries used for starting internal combustion engines, as a primary power source for vehicles, for load leveling, storage of electricity from alternative sources, or as a backup power source for memory or program instruction. The curr_chunk discusses the prohibition of disposing lead-acid batteries in landfills, incinerating them, or disposing of them improperly. It also mentions the exclusion of rechargeable alkaline batteries from the definition of rechargeable batteries. The curr_chunk explains that a collection program receiving lead-acid batteries mixed with municipal solid waste can avoid violating regulations if proper procedures are in place to prevent the disposal of these batteries in landfills or incinerators. Additionally, lawful disposal of spent lead-acid batteries is required by individuals. The curr_chunk outlines authorized recipients for spent lead-acid batteries, including retailers, lead smelters, automotive dismantlers, and state-designated collection facilities. Authorized recipients for spent lead-acid batteries include retailers, lead smelters, and wholesale sellers. Retailers must return spent batteries to authorized recipients. Authorized recipients for spent lead-acid batteries include wholesalers, automotive dismantlers, and collection programs designated by a State. They are responsible for returning the batteries. Manufacturers and individuals must return spent lead-acid batteries to authorized recipients, such as lead smelters or manufacturers of the same type of batteries. Manufacturers and individuals must return spent lead-acid batteries to authorized recipients, such as lead smelters or retailers who sell the same type of batteries. Retailers selling lead-acid batteries must accept spent batteries in quantities equal to those sold, with exemptions for those selling fewer than 5 batteries. Retailers selling lead-acid batteries must accept spent batteries in quantities equal to those sold, with exemptions for those selling fewer than 5 batteries per month. Wholesalers selling lead-acid batteries at wholesale must also accept spent batteries of the same type and provide removal services for retailers. Retailers must notify wholesalers within 90 days of spent lead-acid batteries for removal, or 180 days if less than 5 batteries. Manufacturers must accept spent batteries similar to those sold. Retailers must post a notice about lead-acid battery sales. Retailers selling lead-acid batteries must display a written notice in a visible area, at least 8.5 x 11 inches in size, stating that it is illegal to discard these batteries and encouraging recycling. Federal or State law mandates retailers to accept used batteries for recycling when a new one is purchased. Each lead-acid battery manufactured must bear a label with the recycling symbol and the words 'LEAD', 'RETURN', 'RECYCLE'. States can require a similar notice to be posted instead of the federal requirement. The Administrator can certify a different label if it meets international standards and the application is not acted upon within 120 days. The Administrator must publish notice of the requirements within 180 days of enactment. No state can enforce labeling requirements for lead-acid batteries that differ from those in paragraph (3). Manufacturers can include additional recycling or hazard information on battery labels. The Administrator must publish notice of the requirements within 180 days of enactment. No state can enforce labeling requirements for lead-acid batteries that differ from those in paragraph (3). Manufacturers can include additional recycling or hazard information on battery labels. Export for recycling purposes is allowed, and non-compliance may result in a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation. The Administrator can take civil action for violations, seeking relief such as injunctions. Orders must specify the violation, and penalties consider seriousness and compliance efforts. Orders become final unless a hearing is requested within 30 days. The Administrator can take civil action for violations, seeking relief such as injunctions.
