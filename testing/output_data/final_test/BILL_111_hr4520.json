    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tanning Bed Cancer Control Act of 2010\". Congress finds that one million Americans, with 70 percent being girls and women, visit tanning salons daily. The World Health Organization classified UV-emitting tanning devices as carcinogenic to humans, placing them in the same category as tobacco smoke, asbestos, and uranium. The risk of cutaneous melanoma increases by 75 percent when tanning device use starts before the age of 30. Over 120,000 new melanomas were diagnosed in the US in 2009, with an estimated 8,650 deaths. The FDA is reviewing modifications to warning labels for indoor tanning devices to better inform consumers about the risks associated with sunlamp products. Performance standards are determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure safe and effective performance of drugs or devices. The FDA may reclassify tanning devices if they do not ensure safe and effective performance, with safeguards for consumer access. The FDA will study the classification of ultraviolet tanning lamps and may reclassify them as class II or class III devices based on the results. The FDA will conduct a study on performance standards for ultraviolet tanning lamps and may revise the standards to be more stringent based on the study results. The FDA will implement recommendations on labeling requirements for ultraviolet tanning lamps as per the report submitted under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. SEC. 5. NO LIMITATION ON RECALL AUTHORITY. The Commissioner's authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding ultraviolet tanning lamps is not limited by this Act. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.
