    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Freedom to Improve Educational Achievement Act\". The Congress emphasizes the importance of providing effective educational services to all citizens, especially disadvantaged and underserved populations, for national security and global leadership. Local school authorities face challenges in improving public schools due to excessive paperwork and regulatory constraints from various government programs. Schools need to adapt and innovate to meet the changing needs of students and society in an increasingly complex world. Educational funding flexibility at the State and local level has proven effective for educational reform nationwide. This flexibility should be expanded to cover Federal requirements that hinder educational achievement. School reform initiatives based on professional knowledge and research will bring about real and fundamental change in the structure of schools and education. The Act aims to provide flexibility for States, local educational agencies, and schools to combine funds to improve educational achievement for all students, including those with disabilities, disadvantaged backgrounds, and limited English proficiency. Certain statutory and regulatory requirements can be waived to help schools meet National Education Goals, while maintaining protections for civil rights, discrimination, and safety. The Secretary of Education can waive federal requirements for education reform efforts to meet National Education Goals. Waivers can also be requested for programs like the Head Start Act, Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, and others. The Secretary of Education can waive federal requirements for education reform efforts to meet National Education Goals, as well as for programs like the Special School Milk Program, Summer Food Service Program, and Community Services Block Grant Program. The Secretary consults with other Federal agencies when considering waivers and must obtain their approval for final project approval. SEC. 5. APPLICATIONS. (a) General Requirements for receiving a waiver under this Act include indicating which Federal requirements to be waived, describing proposed educational programs and goals, identifying Federal programs to be included, indicating State and local requirements to be waived, setting specific educational improvement goals for all students, outlining methods to measure progress, and ensuring programs continue to serve the same populations. The waiver request must describe the student population at proposed schools, including achievement levels of students, limited English proficiency, and children with disabilities. The Secretary of Education may include additional requirements as needed for schools applying for waivers under the Act. Local schools must submit applications to their educational agency, which will then be reviewed and submitted to the State educational agency. Local educational agencies must submit waiver applications to the State educational agency for review, which will then be forwarded to the Secretary of Education. State educational agencies seeking waivers must submit applications directly to the Secretary of Education, unless the waivers are for programs other than education. Local educational agencies must submit waiver applications to the State chief executive for review before forwarding them to the Secretary of Education. SEC. 6. WAIVER RESTRICTIONS. The section prohibits changes that would weaken civil rights, discrimination, and safety protections under Federal laws. Specific requirements that cannot be waived include fund allocations, privacy of pupil records, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and parts A, B, and H under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act includes requirements on maintenance of effort, comparability, equitable participation of private school students, and parental participation. SEC. 7. EVALUATIONS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary of Education evaluates waivers granted to schools or local educational agencies after three years to assess their effectiveness in meeting outlined goals, achieving educational reform, and improving student achievement. If progress is unsatisfactory, technical assistance may be provided, and if this assistance does not lead to improvement, waivers may be terminated. The Secretary evaluates waivers granted to schools every three years to assess effectiveness. Waivers may be terminated if progress is unsatisfactory. SEC. 8. REPORTS. Local educational agencies or schools participating in a flexibility project must submit annual reports to the State educational agency detailing project activities, progress towards goals, and effectiveness of coordinating services for students and families. States participating in the project must submit annual reports to the Secretary of Education evaluating progress towards stated goals. State Educational Agencies review local reports to assess program progress in improving academic achievement for all students. The Secretary of Education receives annual reports on education reform progress and national achievement goals. The Secretary also submits biennial reports to Congress on the impact of flexibility programs on student achievement and disseminates best practices through the National Diffusion Network."
