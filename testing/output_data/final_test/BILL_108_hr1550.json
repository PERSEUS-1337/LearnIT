Congress finds that thousands of communities in the United States, near Federal lands, are at risk of wildfire. Approximately 190,000,000 acres of land managed by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior are at risk of catastrophic fire due to heavy forest fuel loads from disease, insect infestations, and drought. Additionally, over 70,000,000 acres across all land ownerships are at risk of higher than normal mortality from insect infestation and disease, leading to increased fire risk and degraded conditions. Preventive treatments like removing fuel loading, ladder fuels, and hazard trees, planting proper species mix, and restoring early successional habitat can reduce fire risk, loss of old growth, and degraded watershed conditions. These treatments create a mosaic of species-mix and age distribution, improving forest health and reducing susceptibility to insect outbreaks, disease, and catastrophic fire. Prevention treatments are more successful and cost-effective than suppression treatments for insects, disease, and fire. The United States should promote economic opportunities in using biomass by-products from preventive treatment activities related to hazardous fuels reduction, disease, and insect infestation. Developing markets for underused wood and biomass can serve as an outlet for these by-products. The United States aims to promote economic opportunities by utilizing underused wood and biomass from preventive treatment activities. Biomass includes trees, woody plants, and by-products like wood and brush removed to reduce hazardous fuels or contain disease and insect infestation. The definition of \"Indian tribe\" and \"person\" is also provided in this section. The term \"preferred community\" refers to a town, township, municipality, or similar local government unit with a population of not more than 50,000 individuals, as determined by the Secretary concerned. This includes communities, Indian tribes, small businesses, corporations incorporated in the United States, and nonprofit organizations. The term \"preferred community\" refers to a town, township, municipality, or similar local government unit with a population of not more than 50,000 individuals, as determined by the Secretary concerned. Any county not within a metropolitan statistical area, where the land is at significant risk of wildfire, disease, or insect infestation, may also be considered a preferred community. The Secretary concerned, either the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior, may provide grants to facilities using biomass for energy production. Grants cannot exceed $20 per green ton of biomass delivered. The Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior may provide grants to facilities using biomass for energy production, not exceeding $20 per green ton. Grant recipients must keep records as required and allow access for monitoring. Additionally, grants may be given for projects to improve biomass use or add value to it. The Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior may provide grants up to $100,000 for projects that improve biomass use or add value to it. Preference is given to persons in preferred communities, and selection is based on public benefits such as energy resource development, small business opportunities, and job creation. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2014 for this purpose. The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, must submit a report by October 1, 2010, to relevant Senate and House committees detailing the results of grant programs for biomass use. The report should include information on the size, type, and use of biomass by grant recipients, the distance between biomass sources and facilities, and the economic impacts, including job creation."
