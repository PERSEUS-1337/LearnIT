    "content": "Paraguay is a landlocked South American country with a population of about 6.5 million, mainly concentrated in and around the capital city of Asunci\u00f3n. The majority of the population is of mixed Spanish and Guaran\u00ed Indian descent, with both languages being official. The country has a low per capita income, with high levels of poverty and extreme poverty. The political landscape has been shaped by a turbulent history, with the dominance of the Colorado Party in the late 19th century. The Colorado Party became the dominant political force in Paraguay between 1887 and 1904 after the country's defeat in the War of the Triple Alliance. This led to a period of political instability, with civil wars and the Chaco War with Bolivia. The Liberals ruled from 1904 to 1940, followed by military control and then the return of the Colorado Party in 1946. The party has remained in power since, exerting control over state institutions and requiring party membership for civil service positions and military promotion. General Alfredo Stroessner, a member of the Colorado Party, seized power in a 1954 coup, establishing a repressive military dictatorship that lasted 35 years. The regime's longevity was maintained through an alliance with the military, economic elites, and the party. Stroessner's rule was marked by political repression, authoritarianism, nationalist and anti-communist rhetoric, and widespread corruption. He was ousted in a 1989 coup and fled to Brazil, where he lived until his death in 2006. A Truth and Justice Commission was established in 2004 to investigate human rights abuses during his regime. The overthrow of the Stroessner regime in 1989 led to a process of democratization in Paraguay, with a new constitution enacted in 1992 and competitive elections held in 1993. Despite the transition to democracy, the dominance of the Colorado Party and its control over the state apparatus have persisted. The political culture remains tainted by corruption and clientelism, with weak democratic institutions. In 1996, Army Commander General Lino Oviedo revolted against President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, leading to his resignation. Oviedo later attempted to run in the 1998 presidential elections. In 1998, General Lino Oviedo's candidacy for the presidential elections was nullified due to a 10-year prison term for his barracks revolt. His running mate, Ra\u00fal Cubas, became President and freed Oviedo from prison, leading to impeachment proceedings against Cubas. The rivalry between Vice President Luis Maria Arga\u00f1a and President Cubas/Oviedo escalated, culminating in Arga\u00f1a's assassination in 1999. President Cubas resigned, and both he and Oviedo fled the country, with Luis Gonzalez Macchi completing the presidential term. Nicanor Duarte Frutos of the Colorado Party was elected president in 2003, promising institutional reforms and anti-corruption measures. The election was deemed free and fair, with the Colorado Party winning the majority of seats in the Chamber of Deputies and Senate. The opposition PLRA also secured seats in both houses. President Duarte promised institutional reforms, prioritized fighting corruption, and established a transparent government. He enacted reforms targeting tax evasion and corruption, but his popularity declined due to concerns about rising crime and unemployment. To maintain support, he used more populist rhetoric. Corruption remains a significant obstacle to Paraguay's democratic institutions and economic development. Duarte's anti-corruption measures included harsher penalties for tax evasion, increased tax revenue, oversight of government spending, and cracking down on contraband. He also removed corrupt members of the Supreme Court. President Duarte enacted reforms targeting tax evasion and corruption, including harsher penalties and oversight of government spending. He also removed corrupt members of the Supreme Court. Despite these efforts, Paraguay's ranking in Transparency International's corruption perceptions index improved in 2006 but dropped in 2007. The opposition criticized the anti-corruption measures for not addressing clientelism and the dominance of the Colorado Party in governmental institutions. President Duarte's attempt to overturn the constitutional ban on consecutive re-election was met with strong opposition. In the 2008 presidential election in Paraguay, President Duarte faced strong opposition to his re-election bid and eventually abandoned it. The three major candidates were Blanca Ovelar of the Colorado Party, Fernando Lugo of the Patriotic Alliance for Change, and Lino Oviedo of the National Union of Ethical Citizens. Duarte supported Ovelar in the primary elections, causing divisions within the party. The election was also marked by an outbreak of yellow fever, highlighting the government's struggles with poverty. Blanca Ovelar's position in the 2008 Paraguayan presidential race was initially weakened by the yellow fever outbreak, but gained support from the Colorado Party and some former Castiglioni supporters. She emphasized combating corruption and promoting an independent judiciary. Lino Oviedo, a potential candidate, was conditionally released from prison in 2007. In a controversial November 2007 ruling, the Supreme Court absolved Lino Oviedo of plotting a coup to oust President Juan Carlos Wasmosy in 1996 and annulled pending charges against him by a military tribunal. Oviedo's release from prison and subsequent court decisions were seen as part of a pact between President Duarte and Oviedo to split the opposition vote in the elections. Oviedo, founder of UNACE, ran his political party from prison and appealed to the same rural poor constituency as Fernando Lugo in the 2008 presidential campaign. Most polls showed Lugo as the frontrunner, although his support gradually decreased. In the 2008 presidential campaign, Fernando Lugo was endorsed by various left-wing labor unions, social organizations, and the PLRA, Paraguay's main opposition party. He formed the APC electoral coalition with the PLRA and seven smaller parties, with Federico Franco as his vice-presidential running mate. Lugo's campaign focused on empowering the poor, agrarian and health reform, fighting corruption, and renegotiating hydroelectric dam treaties with Brazil and Argentina. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Fernando Lugo faced accusations of ties to Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Reports surfaced of Ch\u00e1vez's plans to increase influence in Paraguay by seeking out sympathetic political leaders. Polls showed Lugo leading with 34.5% support, followed closely by Ovelar and Oviedo. Concerns about potential electoral fraud arose before the election. During the 2008 presidential campaign in Paraguay, concerns about potential electoral fraud were raised by the opposition due to outdated electoral registry and tribunal bias. Despite these concerns, free and fair elections were held on April 20, 2008. Fernando Lugo won with 41% of the vote, followed by Blanca Ovelar with 31% and Lino Oviedo with 22%. International observers praised the successful conduct of the elections, calling it historic. The 2008 presidential election in Paraguay marked a historic moment as Fernando Lugo won with 41% of the vote, ending over 60 years of Colorado Party rule. The Electoral Tribunal's quick announcement of results and President Duarte's peaceful transfer of power were praised. Lugo pledged to fight corruption, distribute resources equitably, reduce poverty, and renegotiate hydro energy agreements with Brazil. President-elect Lugo, victorious in the 2008 Paraguayan election, faces challenges ahead due to his coalition's lack of majority in Congress. The final party makeup remains uncertain, requiring cooperation with other parties to pass legislation. Oviedo's UNACE party could sway decisions, while internal divisions within the APC coalition, particularly with the conservative PLRA, add complexity to governance. President-elect Lugo's APC coalition holds the largest bloc of seats in Congress, with support from the PLRA, PPS, and MPT. The Colorados and UNACE also have significant representation, posing challenges for passing legislation. President Lugo faces challenges from entrenched government bureaucracy controlled by the long-ruling Colorado Party. Observers believe the party could hinder Lugo's ability to fulfill campaign promises. However, Lugo's victory is seen as an opportunity to strengthen Paraguay's democratic transition. Lugo is expected to govern as a moderate, with political views between Presidents Ch\u00e1vez and Morales and the more moderate stances of Presidents Lula and Bachelet. President Lugo's victory in Paraguay is seen as an opportunity to strengthen the country's democratic transition. Lugo aims to govern as a moderate, maintaining good relations with all countries, including the United States and Venezuela. He has positioned himself as a candidate sought by many, not aligning strictly with the left or right. U.S. Ambassador to Paraguay James Cason congratulated Lugo on his victory and expressed a commitment to work together. The U.S. Embassy in As\u00fancion congratulated Lugo and the APC on their victory and pledged $500 million in support for health, education, and infrastructure. Brazilian President Lula da Silva hinted at renegotiating the price for Paraguay's electricity exports from the Itaip\u00fa hydro-electric plant. Paraguay's economy, reliant on agricultural exports, grew by 4.3% in 2006 and 6.4% in 2007, driven by soybean production. In 2007, Paraguay's economy was fueled by soybean production and remittances from Paraguayans living abroad. The country lacks significant mineral and petroleum resources but has vast hydroelectric resources, including the Itaip\u00fa Dam. President Duarte inherited a government in 2003 that had defaulted on $138 million in debt, but under his leadership, the economy rebounded due to reforms and anti-corruption initiatives. Paraguay's economy has been positively impacted by anti-corruption initiatives, leading to increased revenue and a more favorable environment for foreign investment. The country's industrial sector remains underdeveloped, with a large informal sector employing over 40% of wage-earning workers. Economic growth is constrained by imports of manufactured and capital goods needed for industrial and investment purposes. Paraguay's commercial sector heavily relies on importing goods from the United States and Asia for re-export, with a significant portion going undeclared at customs to avoid taxes. Counterfeit trade and smuggling are common in border regions. The country has good relations with the United States, collaborating on counternarcotics and counterterrorism efforts. President Duarte is seen as pro-U.S., being the first Paraguayan head of state to visit the Oval Office. The United States has strong bilateral relations with Paraguay, with U.S. exports totaling over $1.2 billion in 2007. Intellectual property rights protection is a concern, with efforts made by the Duarte government to improve enforcement. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 2003 and revised in 2007 to strengthen legal protection of intellectual property rights in Paraguay. The United States provided financial aid to Paraguay in FY2007 and FY2008, with a requested amount of $11.8 million for FY2009. Assistance includes support for Child Survival and Health, Development Assistance, International Military Education and Training (IMET), International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, and Peace Corps programs. Paraguay previously faced restrictions in receiving Economic Support Funds (ESF) and IMET assistance due to the lack of a bilateral immunity agreement. In 2006, President Bush waived Article 98 restrictions for Paraguay, allowing for foreign assistance funding. Paraguay signed agreements with the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the United States for debt relief and conservation efforts. The country is a transit point for illegal drugs, particularly in the Chaco region. Paraguay is a major transshipment point for illegal drugs, especially in the Chaco region and the tri-border area with Argentina and Brazil. The United States has been providing assistance to strengthen the country's National Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD) by offering training, equipment, and technical support. SENAD has achieved record seizures of drugs, disrupted criminal networks, and arrested high-profile traffickers with the help of international cooperation. The U.S. also helped build a helicopter pad to enhance SENAD's capacity in combating drug trafficking. The United States is concerned about illicit activities in the tri-border area (TBA) due to porous borders, weak law enforcement, and corruption. They have worked with TBA countries on counterterrorism through the \"3+1\" regional cooperation mechanism and provided anti-terrorism support to Paraguay. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) investigated trade-based money laundering in the region in 2006. The United States has assisted Paraguay in developing a Trade Transparency Unit to combat customs fraud, money laundering, and terrorism financing. Efforts include workshops to involve the banking sector, training for local investigators, and concerns about Hezbollah and Hamas fundraising in the region. The 2007 terrorism report stated that Paraguay lacked strong anti-money laundering and counterterrorism legislation, hindering its judicial system. Despite approving anti-money laundering laws in December 2007, pending counterterrorism legislation is crucial for meeting international obligations. Effective immigration and customs control were also highlighted as areas needing improvement. The 2007 terrorism report highlighted Paraguay's lack of effective immigration and customs control on its borders, with efforts to address illicit activity in the TBA hindered by a lack of resources and corruption within customs, police, and the judiciary. The government's Secretariat for the Prevention of Money Laundering showed improvement in progress during the second half of 2007."
