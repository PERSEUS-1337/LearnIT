    "content": "In January 2019, the House adopted H.Res. 6, which outlined rules for the 116th Congress. Amendments to House rules in the 116th Congress included changes to floor proceedings, voting procedures, and rules regarding Delegates and the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico. Additionally, H.Res. 6 allowed religious headdress in the House chamber and prohibited tabling motions related to the War Powers Resolution. Rule IX was amended to specify that a resolution declaring a vacancy in the Office of the Speaker must be offered by a party caucus to qualify as a question of the privileges of the House. Rule IX was amended in the 116th Congress to specify that resolutions raising a question of the privileges of the House must be offered by a party caucus. These resolutions affect the rights, safety, dignity, and integrity of House proceedings. They have precedence when offered by the majority or minority leader, and are scheduled by the Speaker within two legislative days if offered by other Members. The Consensus Calendar, a new addition to House rules, lists certain measures not reported by committees. The Consensus Calendar, a new addition to House rules, allows for consideration of unreported, broadly supported legislation with at least 290 cosponsors. Measures meeting this threshold can be placed on the calendar by the sponsor, providing an opportunity for a vote that may not otherwise occur under regular procedures. The Consensus Calendar allows for unreported, widely supported legislation with 290 cosponsors to be placed on the calendar by the sponsor. The motion is submitted in writing to the Clerk, retained in their custody, and printed in the Congressional Record. The Clerk maintains a list of Consensus Calendar motions publicly available on their website. A measure remains on the calendar even if it falls below the cosponsor threshold until considered by the House or reported by the primary committee. The Consensus Calendar allows unreported, widely supported legislation with 290 cosponsors to be placed on the calendar by the sponsor. A committee may report a bill to prevent it from being placed on the Consensus Calendar or to remove it. The new rule did not create special procedures for floor consideration of a measure on the Consensus Calendar. Measures may be considered in any manner available under the rules, including suspension of the rules or under a special rule reported by the Committee on Rules. The Speaker will designate a measure for consideration by making an announcement before the floor consideration. The \"discharge rule\" allows unreported measures with majority support to be raised on the floor if a discharge petition is signed by a majority of House members. Any Member can submit a motion to discharge a committee from considering a measure that has been before it for 30 legislative days. The discharge rule allows unreported measures with majority support to be raised on the floor if a discharge petition is signed by a majority of House members. A Member may submit a motion to discharge the Committee on Rules from considering a special order of business it has had before it for seven legislative days or more if the measure has been in committee for at least 30 legislative days. Once a majority of the House membership signs the discharge petition, the motion is placed on the Calendar of Motions to Discharge Committees. The discharge rule allows unreported measures with majority support to be raised on the floor if a discharge petition is signed by a majority of House members. H.Res. 6 amended Rule XV to allow the Speaker to call a private bill on any day the House is in session if it has been on the Private Calendar for seven days. The Speaker may direct the Clerk to call a specific measure on other days after a seven-day period. Official Objectors appointed by each party examine measures on the Private Calendar. If two Objectors or Members object to a measure when called, it is recommitted to the reporting committee. The summary of H.Res. 6 includes a requirement for a 72-hour review period for certain legislative text and committee reports, as opposed to the previous \"third calendar day\" review period. The amendments also allow the layover period to begin when the proposed text of each report is available. The new 72-hour availability requirement for legislative text allows for a review period before measures may be considered in the House. This requirement applies to committee reports, unreported bills, joint resolutions, conference reports, and amendments. The review period starts when the text is posted electronically. H.Res. 6 amended House rules to allow the Speaker to postpone votes on amendments considered in the House, including the previous question to end debate. This change expands the Speaker's ability to cluster and postpone votes by electronic device. The Speaker can postpone and cluster votes by electronic device for various measures like bills and resolutions. The voting period is typically 15 minutes, but can be reduced to 5 minutes at the Speaker's discretion. The amended rule allows for a reduced voting period if Members have adequate time to vote. The 116th rules package amended voting rules to give the chair of the Committee of the Whole more discretion to reduce electronic voting time. The chair can now reduce the voting period to not less than two minutes if the vote occurs in a series, with no intervening business or debate allowed. H.Res. 6 amended voting rules to allow a two-minute voting period without intervening business or debate. It also expanded floor privileges to include Delegates-elect, the Resident Commissioner-elect, and contestants in elections for Delegate and the Resident Commissioner. Governors of territories can now be admitted to the Hall of the House during recess or adjournment. H.Res. 6 amended voting rules to allow a two-minute voting period without intervening business or debate. It also expanded floor privileges to include Delegates-elect, the Resident Commissioner-elect, and contestants in elections for Delegate and the Resident Commissioner. Additionally, H.Res. 6 reinstated voting rights for Delegates and the Resident Commissioner in the Committee of the Whole, with recorded votes within their margin to be re-conducted in the House. In the House, Delegates and the Resident Commissioner now have voting rights in the Committee of the Whole, with their voting status changing based on the majority party. They voted in certain Congresses when Democrats held the majority, but not when Republicans were in power. In the House, Delegates and the Resident Commissioner now have voting rights in the Committee of the Whole, with their voting status changing based on the majority party. The House adopted a marginal vote provision allowing Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to be counted for quorum and recorded votes in the Committee of the Whole during the 116th Congress. H.Res. 6 amended House rules to include Delegates and the Resident Commissioner in voting procedures. A quorum in the committee now requires 100 Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner. Recorded votes need support from at least 25 Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner. Members can now wear religious headdress in the House chamber, clarifying that non-religious headwear is prohibited. The 116th Congress rules package included a section on \"separate orders\" with the same force as House rules. H.Res. 6 clarifies that the House may not table a motion to discharge a measure introduced under the War Powers Resolution. This resolution governs House consideration of measures introduced after U.S. Armed Forces engage in hostilities without a prior declaration of war. Measures introduced in compliance are referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee for reporting within a specified time frame. The War Powers Resolution requires measures introduced after U.S. Armed Forces engage in hostilities to be reported by the House Foreign Affairs Committee within a specified time frame. A separate order in H.Res. 6 clarifies that the House cannot table a motion to discharge a measure, providing certainty for all Members on this procedure."
