    "content": "The General Services Administration (GSA) manages federal real property with 11 regional offices overseeing owned and leased buildings nationwide. GSA's inventory includes offices, courthouses, and land ports of entry. The agency is known as \"the government's landlord\" and was granted construction authority for federal buildings through the Public Buildings Act of 1926. The Public Buildings Act of 1949 authorized the planning, acquisition, and design of federal buildings outside of Washington, DC. The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 established the General Services Administration (GSA) to manage federal real property. Congress later amended the Public Buildings Act to allow the Administrator to acquire titles and construct federal buildings through lease-purchase contracts. Title to the property was vested in the federal government at the end of the contract period, which could range from 10 to 30 years. Congress approved the Public Buildings Act of 1959 to replace lease-purchase contracts, allowing for direct federal construction of public buildings. The act authorizes the Administrator to construct, own, lease, operate, maintain, and renovate buildings for civilian agencies. GSA works with executive branch agencies and the judiciary but not the legislative branch for real property functions. GSA is responsible for designing, constructing, and maintaining its buildings and courthouses. GSA is responsible for the design, construction, and maintenance of buildings and courthouses, including repairs and alterations. Funding for new projects is requested through the President's budget submission to Congress, with appropriations authorized through the prospectus approval process. The Public Buildings Act requires GSA to submit a prospectus to authorize and appropriate funds for real property projects. Each prospectus must include a brief description of the building, its location, estimated project cost, statement of need for new space, current housing costs, and future energy performance. A prospectus is required for projects meeting a specified cost threshold set by GSA annually. GSA adjusts cost thresholds annually based on the Building Cost Index. Prospectus approval by committees is required for projects meeting the threshold. Resolutions must be passed within one year, or approval may be rescinded. Congress appropriates funds for GSA projects through the appropriations bill each fiscal year. The GSA's Public Buildings Service contracts private firms for design and construction work for funded projects. GSA prioritizes energy efficiency and renewable energy goals when leasing space. During emergencies, GSA can enter into emergency lease agreements without a prospectus for up to 180 days. The cost of real property projects, especially new building construction, can often increase. The GSA is required to resubmit an amended prospectus for congressional approval if the project cost exceeds the approved amount by more than 10%. This process allows Congress to oversee GSA's real property activities, which include managing a multi-billion dollar budget and thousands of buildings. Congressional oversight of GSA's proposals, such as consolidating the Department of Homeland Security headquarters or constructing new courthouses, has significant implications. The GSA-controlled buildings in Washington, DC, Rockford, IL, and San Diego, CA, play a central role in helping federal agencies fulfill their missions. The prospectus process allows Congress to evaluate GSA's proposals for cost and space projections, with projects costing hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Poor project planning can lead to cost escalation and unneeded space, as seen in the construction of 33 courthouses between 2000 and 2010. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked by Congress to audit courthouse construction projects due to widespread cost overruns totaling $835 million. The lack of data comparing leasing versus owning space hinders Congress from determining the most cost-effective option for meeting agency real property needs. This could lead to wasteful spending and cost escalation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified federal real property management as a high-risk area since 2003 due to the government's increasing use of leases over constructing or purchasing buildings. Despite leasing often being less cost-effective, GSA's portfolio has more leased than owned space since 2008. One study estimated that long-term leases could cost $866 million more than owning comparable space. However, GSA's lease prospectuses do not compare the costs of leasing versus owning space over time. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has flagged federal real property management as high-risk due to the increasing use of leases over building ownership. GSA's portfolio has more leased than owned space since 2008, despite leasing being less cost-effective. GSA lease prospectuses lack comparative cost data, making it difficult for Congress to determine the most cost-effective option. Leasing costs go beyond rent and operating expenses, as agencies may need to modify leased space to meet their needs. These alterations are often not included in lease cost estimates as the actual building is not selected when GSA submits a prospectus. GSA submits prospectuses for leases, but alterations to leased space can significantly increase costs and impact agency decision-making. Congressional approval is required if a project exceeds its cost estimate by more than 10%, with amended prospectuses submitted for approval. GSA submitted amended prospectuses for courthouse construction projects exceeding authorized cost estimates by more than 10%, as required. However, there is evidence that GSA does not consistently submit amended prospectuses for leased space when costs increase by more than 10%. Representative Lou Barletta introduced H.R. 2612 to make GSA's real property activities more cost-effective and transparent. Representative Lou Barletta introduced H.R. 2612, the Public Buildings Service Savings and Reform Act, co-sponsored by Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, Representative Bill Shuster, and Representative Nick Rahall. The bill aims to reform the Public Buildings Service by changing how space is constructed and leased, reporting on GSA's portfolio size and cost, and tracking administrative expenses. The bill was referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and then to the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management. The Public Buildings Service Savings and Reform Act, introduced by Representative Lou Barletta, aims to reform the Public Buildings Service by changing how space is constructed and leased, reporting on GSA's portfolio size and cost, and tracking administrative expenses. The bill includes provisions related to prospectus approval process, such as requiring details of space elimination and prohibiting GSA from increasing leased or owned space compared to FY2012 inventory. It establishes mechanisms for Congress to verify GSA's compliance with offset requirements. Additionally, the bill prohibits GSA from entering leases below a certain threshold without notifying authorizing committees. The proposed language in the Public Buildings Service Savings and Reform Act aims to prevent GSA from signing leases with rental rates higher than comparable properties in a specific geographic area. It applies to leases below a certain threshold without authorizing committee approval, aiming to avoid paying above-market rates on smaller leases. GSA would be required to submit a list of all leases entered into during the previous fiscal year to the authorizing committees, including details like size, location, tenant agency, total annual rent, and authorized annual rent for prospectus-level leases. If H.R. 2612 is enacted, it could lead to significant changes in GSA's management of real property. The bill includes provisions such as requiring GSA to explain why space couldn't be obtained from existing federal properties in prospectuses and limiting scope changes to 10%. Additionally, GSA would need to notify authorizing committees of any cost increases or scope changes beyond 5%. The most notable change would be the prohibition on GSA increasing space requirements. H.R. 2612 would prohibit GSA from increasing its portfolio size above FY2012 levels. Any new space must be offset by reducing existing space, with details included in project prospectuses. GSA must dispose of unneeded federal building space to obtain new space, aligning with efforts to streamline property disposal. The disposal process for unneeded federal property, as outlined in H.R. 2612, faces timing challenges due to statutory requirements and market conditions. Agencies must first offer the property to other federal agencies, then to state or local governments and non-profits, before finally offering it for sale to the public. Each step can take weeks or months as interested parties assess the property, submit applications, and establish financial and legal terms. The disposal process for unneeded federal property, as outlined in H.R. 2612, faces timing challenges due to various factors such as the condition of the building, available space, and costs of remediation. The bill lacks clarity on how to address the unpredictable nature of disposition and tracking proposed disposals. Congress may need to require GSA to report on the status of all offset activities for better accountability. The bill H.R. 2612 aims to increase transparency in GSA's decision-making process regarding space acquisition. It requires GSA to justify why it needs space from private landholders instead of federal agencies in its prospectuses. However, the bill lacks specific criteria for this justification, potentially limiting its effectiveness as an oversight mechanism. The bill H.R. 2612 aims to increase transparency in GSA's decision-making process regarding space acquisition. It requires GSA to justify the need for space from private landholders in its prospectuses. However, the lack of specific criteria could limit its effectiveness as an oversight mechanism. The bill also includes provisions to monitor and control real property acquisition costs, with a new requirement for GSA to notify Congress of significant cost escalations. The bill H.R. 2612 aims to increase transparency in GSA's decision-making process regarding space acquisition by requiring justification for space from private landholders. GSA must notify Congress of significant cost escalations over 5% to prevent further escalation and work on cost containment measures. Identifying factors driving cost escalation allows for revisions to project management plans and implementing new asset management planning methods. The bill H.R. 2612 aims to increase transparency in GSA's decision-making process regarding space acquisition and implement cost containment measures to prevent further escalation. It requires GSA to notify Congress before entering into certain leases below the prospectus threshold to ensure cost-effectiveness in obtaining suitable space. Periodic audits may be requested to assess GSA's compliance with paying above the local market rate for leased space. H.R. 2612 aims to increase transparency in GSA's decision-making process regarding space acquisition and implement cost containment measures. The bill requires additional reporting on GSA leases, including data on size, address, tenant agency, and rental rate. GSA's current lease inventory reports already provide some of this information, but do not include the amount authorized for leases exceeding the prospectus threshold. The bill H.R. 2612 aims to increase transparency in GSA's decision-making process regarding space acquisition and implement cost containment measures. It requires additional reporting on GSA leases, including data on size, address, tenant agency, and rental rate. Congress may consider requiring GSA to provide additional data on projected and actual costs invested in each lease, any increases beyond authorized parameters, and whether an amended prospectus has been approved.

Congress may consider requiring GSA to provide additional data on projected and actual costs invested in each lease, any increases beyond authorized parameters, and whether an amended prospectus has been approved. GSA controls approximately 422 million square feet in buildings, representing about 12.6% of the government's total building square footage. Committees are considering real property reform bills with similar objectives of reducing inventory, increasing transparency, and controlling costs, but applying to a broader range of federal landholders. Several bills propose increased public reporting of agency real-property data or providing public access to GSA's Federal Real Property Profile, an existing database which contains a great deal of information about owned and leased properties government-wide. A publicly accessible, government-wide real-property database, if established, might be able to incorporate additional information as proposed in H.R. 2612, such as lease data, as well as data that are not specifically required by H.R. 2612 or other reform bills but which might be a valuable cost-assessment tool\u2014an alternative analysis of all proposed leases which would compare the cost of leasing versus owning new space. The analysis will compare the cost of leasing versus owning new space over a 20- or 30-year period."
