Government policies like commodity support, conservation programs, and ethanol incentives can raise feed prices, impacting the portion of the U.S. corn crop going to ethanol. Animal producers are concerned about a possible energy title in the next farm bill that could further increase feed grain demand and prices. Unlike major crops, animal products do not receive commodity price and income support program benefits, except for milk producers who benefit from federal milk marketing orders, surplus dairy product purchases, and milk income loss payments. Some cattle and hog producers in a few states also participate in support programs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency administers livestock revenue insurance programs for cattle and hog producers in some states. The new farm bill may include milk price and income support, as well as expand revenue insurance for livestock producers. Animal producers in disaster areas may receive federal payments to help with feed costs. The government is considering assuming more disaster risks for livestock and poultry producers, similar to crop farmers. There is a debate on establishing a permanent aid program for disasters instead of ad hoc legislation. Changes in the livestock sector show a trend of fewer but larger farms, with big firms dominating animal product processing. Large firms in the animal products industry are increasingly controlling all production and marketing phases to meet retail chains' demands for lower-cost products. Critics argue this has harmed smaller family farms by reducing their power and forcing many out of business. However, others see these changes as positive due to technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and global competition. Proposed bills aim to address competition issues, such as regulating meat packer ownership and giving farmers more dispute options. Proposed bills aim to address competition issues in the animal products industry, including regulating meat packer ownership and giving farmers more dispute options. Outbreaks of animal diseases like avian influenza, foot and mouth disease, BSE, brucellosis, and tuberculosis are seen as major threats to animal production, with potential economic devastation and impacts on consumer confidence. The U.S. FDA is considering a rule to ban higher-risk cattle parts in animal feeds to prevent diseases like BSE. The industry is concerned about the economic costs of this proposal. Many producers support a nationwide animal ID system for disease control and to meet foreign market demands. The U.S. is facing challenges in implementing a universal animal traceability system despite efforts and funding. Policy makers are debating various questions about the design and purpose of the system, including whether it should be mandated, who should hold the data, and the extent of producer record privacy. Legislation such as H.R. 1018 is being considered to address these concerns. The U.S. is debating the implementation of a universal animal traceability system, with questions about design, mandates, data ownership, and producer privacy. Legislation like H.R. 1018 is being considered to address these concerns. Possible farm bill items include Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy safeguards, animal identification, meat traceability, and country-of-origin labeling for livestock and poultry products. Bills have been introduced to require country-of-origin labeling implementation by September 30, 2007. The United States faces challenges in the livestock and poultry export market from competitive foreign exporters like Brazil, Australia, India, Argentina, and New Zealand. Trade barriers such as high import tariffs and differing food safety measures hinder U.S. exporters. Recent issues include Russia's restrictions on beef and pork exports, Japan and Korea's slow increase in beef imports due to mad cow disease concerns, and the EU's ban on meat from animals treated with growth hormones. The EU has approved a ban on importing meat from animals treated with growth hormones, which is a concern for U.S. farmers and ranchers as they seek assurances that new trade agreements will not favor foreign animal products over U.S. products. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is set to expire on June 30, 2007, making its renewal a topic in the 110th Congress. The Administration has used TPA to pursue bilateral and regional free trade agreements as well as participate in negotiations for new multilateral trade rules under the World Trade Organization (WTO). Questions have been raised about the impact of federal environmental laws on livestock and poultry operations as animal agriculture becomes more concentrated. Concerns include effects on surface water, groundwater, soil, and air quality. Large feedlots are primarily regulated under the Clean Water Act due to potential contamination from manure affecting water quality and human health. Operations emitting air pollutants may be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Concerns about Superfund regulations for livestock and poultry operations are growing. Bills to exempt animal manure from Superfund requirements may resurface in the 110th Congress. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees play a role in environmental issues, such as providing financial assistance through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program to protect resources, with 60% of funds going to livestock. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversee food safety, including meat, poultry, eggs, and other foods. Congress monitors efforts to address microbial contamination in food, with a focus on effectiveness and potential policy changes. Various proposals related to meat safety have been offered in recent years, including clarifying USDA's use of microbial performance standards, allowing state-inspected meat and poultry products to be sold outside the state, giving USDA more authority to recall suspect products, and tightening regulations on antibiotic use in food-producing animals. Some argue that antibiotic overuse can lead to drug resistance in humans, while others believe restrictions would increase production costs and harm product quality. Biotechnology, including genetic engineering and cloning, is promoted to improve animal productivity and quality, introduce new products, and protect the environment. Criticisms include concerns about food safety, social resistance, animal welfare, and ecosystem impacts. In the 110th Congress, there is interest in reorganizing federal food safety responsibilities and regulating nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in livestock. In the 110th Congress, there is early interest in FDA's draft risk assessment on the safety of meat and milk from cloned animals. Legislation such as S. 414 and H.R. 992 calls for labeling of foods from cloned animals, while H.R. 1396 and S. 536 aim to restrict organically labeled foods from such animals. Farm animals are not covered by the Animal Welfare Act, raising concerns about animal health and oversight of biotechnologies. Animal activists push for new legislation to regulate on-farm animal activities, including bills to ban horse slaughter for human food and require products from animals to meet specific care standards. House and Senate Agriculture Committees prefer voluntary humane care approaches. Smithfield Farms, a major pork producer, recently announced initiatives in this area. Smithfield Farms, the largest U.S. pork producer, announced plans to phase out gestation crates, which are criticized for providing inadequate space for hogs to move."
