    "content": "The \"Senior Investment Protection Act of 2009\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that many seniors are targeted by salespersons and advisers using misleading certifications and professional designations, which often represent limited training or expertise and may lead to financial losses. Seniors have the right to know if their advisers have obtained designations through credible means. Seniors have the right to know if their advisers are qualified and working in their best interest, as many State laws are inadequate in protecting them from salespersons using misleading certifications. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, a \"misleading designation\" refers to using a false certification or credential that suggests special training for advising seniors, excluding legitimate certifications from accredited institutions or meeting standards set by the North American Securities Administrators Association. The NASAA Model Rule defines terms like \"financial product,\" \"misleading or fraudulent marketing,\" \"senior,\" and \"State\" in the context of using senior-specific certifications and professional designations. The NASAA Model Rule defines terms related to senior-specific certifications and professional designations in the context of the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Grants to states for enhanced protection of seniors from false designations. The Attorney General will establish a grant program to help states investigate and prosecute misleading marketing practices and develop educational materials for seniors. Grant recipients must adhere to performance objectives and reporting requirements set by the Attorney General. Grant funds can be used for specified purposes. The grant under this Act can be used to fund staff, technology, equipment, and training for regulators and prosecutors to identify and prosecute cases of misleading marketing of financial products to seniors. It can also be used to provide educational materials on the appropriate use of designations by salespersons and advisers of financial products. The grant under this Act can be used to fund staff, technology, equipment, and training for regulators and prosecutors to identify and prosecute cases of misleading marketing of financial products to seniors. It can also provide educational materials and training to seniors to increase their awareness and understanding of designations, develop plans to combat fraudulent marketing, and enhance state law provisions for senior protection. Grant amounts are capped at $500,000 per fiscal year per State if all requirements are met. State rules on securities designations and suitability must conform to NASAA Model Rule on Senior-Specific Certifications. The sale of securities and insurance products must adhere to minimum suitability requirements set by self-regulatory organizations and state rules on designations, as determined by the Attorney General. State suitability standards for the sale of annuity products require insurers to ensure sales meet requirements, provide sufficient information to prospective senior purchasers, and disclose all associated fees and costs. Insurers and agents must disclose all fees, costs, commissions, and penalties related to annuity transactions. They are also prohibited from recommending a sale to seniors without obtaining sufficient information to ensure suitability. SEC. 5. APPLICATIONS. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, the State or appropriate agency must submit a proposal to the Attorney General outlining how the grant money will be used to protect seniors from misleading or fraudulent marketing in the sale of financial products. This includes identifying the scope of the problem and describing how the program will proactively assist in identifying and prosecuting those using deceptive marketing tactics. The proposal must outline how the grant will be used to protect seniors from misleading marketing in financial product sales, including how the program will deter future fraud. It should also explain how the program will be integrated with existing State efforts. The Act provides assistance funds to States for 3 years, with the option to reapply for more funding. $8,000,000 is authorized annually for the years 2010 through 2014."
