    "content": "During the 109th Congress, 51 bills were introduced to change federal campaign finance law, with a focus on legislation related to 527 organizations. These bills addressed various issues such as regulation of Internet communications, party coordinated expenditures, contributions by Indian tribes, and leadership PACs. The role of 527 organizations in federal elections was a key campaign finance issue examined by the Congress. During the 109th Congress, multiple bills were introduced to amend federal campaign finance laws, particularly focusing on 527 organizations. The Senate Committee reported S. 271 (McCain-Feingold-Lott), the 527 Reform Act of 2005, which added provisions to deregulate aspects of FECA. The House Administration Committee discussed H.R. 513 (Shays-Meehan) and H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn) to address 527 organizations, with H.R. 1316 aiming to loosen funding source restrictions within FECA. During the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to amend federal campaign finance laws, focusing on 527 organizations. H.R. 513 (Shays-Meehan) and H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn) were discussed in the House Administration Committee, with H.R. 1316 aiming to loosen funding source restrictions within FECA. On April 5, 2006, the House passed H.R. 513 (Shays-Meehan) by a 218-209 vote, with an amendment to remove political party-coordinated expenditure limits. The House passed H.R. 4975, incorporating the text of H.R. 513, which removed political party-coordinated expenditure limits. Another amendment allowed leadership PACs' funds to be transferred without limitation to national party committees. The House passed H.R. 4975, incorporating the text of H.R. 513 (Shays-Meehan) and amendments on leadership PACs and party coordinated expenditures. Disagreement over 527 provisions led to no lobby reform or 527 regulation legislation in the 109th Congress. Party coordinated expenditures are subject to limits under the 1974 FECA Amendments. In 2006, parties could make coordinated expenditures in support of House candidates, with limits varying by state. The Supreme Court ruling in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC in 1996 allowed parties to make independent expenditures, reducing the importance of coordinated expenditures. Parties now make both independent and coordinated expenditures for candidates. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) allowed parties to make coordinated and independent expenditures for their candidates. Democratic party committees spent $33.1 million on coordinated expenditures and $176.5 million on independent expenditures in 2004, while Republican party committees spent $29.1 million on coordinated expenditures and $88.0 million on independent expenditures. The Supreme Court struck down a provision in BCRA that limited parties to making either independent or coordinated expenditures for a nominee. This ruling allowed parties to spend unlimited amounts on behalf of their candidates through independent expenditures. Supporters argue for removing limits on coordinated expenditures to strengthen party ties with candidates, while opponents fear it would worsen public perception of money in politics. Party committees raised record amounts in the 2004 election cycle, with a provision allowing leadership PACs to transfer unlimited funds. The Senate added a provision to allow leadership PACs to transfer unlimited funds to national parties in the 2006 appropriations bill. This provision was later removed by the Senate following concerns over campaign contributions by Indian tribes. The committee recommended requiring Indian tribes making federal election contributions to register with the FEC and improving rules for disclosure. There has been debate about whether Internet communications should fall under campaign finance regulations, with a failed attempt to exempt them in 2005. On March 9, 2006, the House Administration Committee ordered the bill favorably reported, but the vote was postponed. The Federal Election Commission approved new regulations for paid advertisements on websites, addressing concerns about regulating blogs under campaign finance law. House Majority Leader Boehner announced the indefinite postponement of consideration for H.R. 1606. Campaign finance bills in the 109th Congress covered various topics. The 109th Congress addressed major campaign finance issues through a wide range of bills organized into 14 subsections. Each subsection focused on proposed changes in campaign finance regulation, with a \"miscellaneous\" category for provisions outside the main framework. The bills were listed based on their primary nature and goal, with detailed summaries of major provisions and actions taken on them. The 109th Congress addressed campaign finance issues through various bills organized into 14 subsections. Each subsection focused on proposed changes in regulation, with a \"miscellaneous\" category for provisions outside the main framework. Many provisions had multiple purposes, such as raising the limit on individual contributions to political parties. The categorization and ordering of bills in the report is for organization purposes only. The first six categories relate to hard money activities regulated under federal election law. The checklist in Table 1 categorizes campaign finance issues addressed by the 109th Congress. The first six categories focus on \"hard money\" activities, including individuals, PACs, parties, candidates, in-state requirements, and independent expenditures. The eighth and ninth categories cover provisions related to soft money, specifically party and non-party activities such as those of unions, corporations, and tax-exempt organizations. The 109th Congress addressed various campaign finance issues, including election-related advocacy, public financing, enforcement improvements, campaign advertising, and presidential public funding. Bills proposed changes to limits and incentives for individual citizen involvement in federal campaign financing. Notable bills included H.R. 4759, H.R. 1316, and H.R. 4664. The 109th Congress addressed campaign finance issues with bills like H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn) and H.R. 4664 (Capuano) that aimed to restrict or empower PACs in funding roles. Most PACs are \"nonparty multicandidate committees,\" with separate segregated funds sponsored by organizations. H.R. 4819 (Leach) proposed lowering PAC contribution limits to $1,000 if a ban was unconstitutional. H.R. 4664 (Capuano) and other bills in the 109th Congress aimed to regulate PAC funding, including limits on candidate receipts and transfers to national parties. Some bills proposed banning federal leadership PACs and restricting foreign involvement in PAC decisions. Some bills in the 109th Congress aimed to regulate PAC funding, including limits on candidate receipts and transfers to national parties. The bills proposed banning federal leadership PACs and restricting foreign involvement in PAC decisions. Other bills focused on spending and loans by candidates from personal or family wealth, including repayment of candidate loans from campaign funds and permissible use of campaign funds. H.J.Res. 13 (Leach) proposed a bill requiring a minimum level of candidates' funds to come from residents of their state or district. H.R. 4819 (Leach) focused on independent expenditures for House and Senate candidates, which are not subject to spending limits but have source restrictions and disclosure requirements. H.R. 3099 (Tierney) aimed at \"clean money\" candidates, while H.R. 4694 (Obey) addressed fast-track consideration of a constitutional amendment for House elections. The provisions in H.R. 1316 and H.R. 3099 address coordination under FECA, defining contributions and expenditures with limits. Soft money influences elections indirectly outside federal law, while H.R. 1316 allows federal candidates to assist state and local candidates. H.R. 3099 exempts party spending for \"clean money\" candidates. Since the enactment of BCRA, the issue of party soft money has become largely irrelevant. Bills in the 109th Congress aimed to adjust existing restrictions on soft money, such as allowing state parties to file reports with the FEC and requiring copies of state party reports to be filed. Bills in the 109th Congress aimed to adjust existing restrictions on soft money, such as allowing state parties to file reports with the FEC and requiring copies of state party reports to be filed. Non-party soft money pertains to direct spending by groups, as opposed to donations to parties, and has particular relevance to election-related issue advocacy. Non-party soft money traditionally referred to spending from union and corporate treasuries on exempt activities for specified restricted classes. Tax-exempt organizations' election-related activities have come under scrutiny for potential indirect election influence. Since 2000, there has been a focus on \"political organizations\" defined by Section 527 of the tax code. Debate has arisen over whether election-related activities of these groups should be fully regulated under federal election law. The issue stems from election-related issue advocacy and concerns about communications that promote political issues without explicitly endorsing or opposing candidates. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) addressed issue advocacy by creating the term \"electioneering communication\" for political advertisements that refer to a federal candidate and are broadcast close to an election. BCRA prohibited certain entities from spending treasury funds on these communications and required disclosure of donors. Concerns remain about BCRA's narrow response to issue advocacy. Some believe BCRA's response to issue advocacy was too narrow, leading to calls for repeal or more regulation. Various proposals address issue advocacy directly or through regulating organizations involved. Multiple bills such as H.R. 2753, H.R. 4759, H.R. 5374, S. 271, H.R. 4975, S. 1053, S. 2511, H.R. 513, H.R. 914, H.R. 471, H.R. 1942, H.R. 2204, and H.R. 1316 aim to address issue advocacy and non-filing penalties. H.R. 2204 (Shaw) adds penalties for non-filing by certain organizations. Various bills, including H.R. 1316 (Pence-Wynn) and H.R. 5374 (Linder), aim to provide campaign spending limits or public financing benefits to candidates. These proposals respond to the Buckley v. Valeo ruling and address issue advocacy concerns. Options for campaign spending limits and public financing benefits include voluntary limits with inducements, mandatory limits through a constitutional amendment, or \"benefits only\" provisions. Various bills such as H.R. 3099, H.R. 5281, H.R. 2753, and H.R. 4694 propose different approaches like subsidies, matching funds, and limits on individual contributions. These proposals aim to address concerns raised by the Buckley v. Valeo ruling. Several bills, including H.J.Res. 76, S. 2434, H.R. 5676, and S. 3560, aimed to improve enforcement and disclosure provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) by proposing changes to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) structure and allowing administrative law judges to impose penalties for violations. Several bills, such as S. 3560 (McCain-Feingold) and H.R. 5676 (Shays-Meehan), proposed penalties for violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act, including civil penalties, cease-and-desist orders, and restraining orders. Additionally, there were provisions for submitting budgets directly to Congress and requiring 24-hour notice of contributions in the last 90 days. Bills introduced in the last 90 days aimed to change regulations on candidate communication methods, including rates, disclaimers, and media regulation. Some bills focused on push polls, phone banks, robocalling, and pre-recorded messages. News media exemption for Internet communications was also proposed in certain circumstances. Several bills introduced aimed to change rules for public financing in presidential elections, including increasing match rates and total amounts matched, setting uniform dates for general election subsidies, and adjusting dates for primaries and general elections.

S. 3740 (Feingold) and H.R. 5905 (Meehan-Shays) propose indexing for future inflation and regulations on campaign financing by various entities. H.R. 3099 (Tierney) and H.R. 4759 (Doolittle) address the impact of campaign finance regulation, while H.R. 4692 (Kaptur) and H.R. 4696 (Rogers, MI) focus on funding requirements for unincorporated tribes. H.Con.Res. 333 (Kaptur) is also mentioned in the context.

The 527 organization would be exempt if their voter drive activities were focused on state/local candidates, non-federal elections, or non-elected officials. However, this exemption would not apply if the organization spent over $1,000 on public communications supporting or opposing a federal candidate within a year of the general election.
