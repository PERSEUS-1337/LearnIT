    "title": "AB 2695",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 709 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to address the mental competency of minors in juvenile proceedings. If the court doubts a minor's mental competence, all proceedings will be suspended. A minor is considered mentally incompetent if they cannot understand the nature of the proceedings or assist in their defense. This applies to minors alleged to be under the court's jurisdiction. During juvenile proceedings, the court may receive information on the minor's ability to understand the proceedings. If there is doubt about the minor's competency, the court must suspend the proceedings and appoint an expert to evaluate the minor's mental condition. The expert evaluating juvenile competency must have expertise in child and adolescent development, forensic evaluation, and training in conducting such evaluations. The expert evaluating juvenile competency must personally interview the minor, review all available records, consult with the minor's counsel and gather a developmental history. They must administer age-appropriate testing and provide a written report on the minor's ability to consult with their counsel. The expert evaluating juvenile competency must assess the minor's ability to consult with counsel and understand the proceedings. If the minor is found incompetent, the expert must recommend remediation services and assess the likelihood of the minor attaining competency within a reasonable time. The Judicial Council, along with various stakeholders, will establish training requirements for experts conducting forensic evaluations of juveniles. Statements made during competency evaluations cannot be used against the minor in any other court hearing. The district attorney or minor\u2019s counsel can hire additional experts for the competency hearing, but their report and qualifications must be shared with the opposing party in advance. Failure to disclose may result in the expert not testifying unless good cause is shown. A continuance may be granted if the opposing party needs more time to prepare after receiving the expert's report. If a minor is believed to be developmentally disabled, the court appoints the director of a regional center to evaluate eligibility for services under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act. This appointment does not delay competency proceedings. An expert's opinion on a minor's developmental disability does not override the regional center's determination of eligibility for services under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act. This section does not authorize placing an incompetent minor in a state facility without a regional center's approval, nor does it allow the regional center to make competency determinations for minors. The minor's competency is determined at an evidentiary hearing unless there is a stipulation by the parties. The minor has the burden of proving incompetence, with a presumption of mental competence unless proven otherwise. If found competent, proceedings will continue according to the court's jurisdiction. If a minor is found incompetent by the court, proceedings are suspended until competency is determined or the court loses jurisdiction. The court can issue orders for services and rule on certain motions without the minor's involvement, such as motions to dismiss or change placement. Upon a finding of incompetency, the court refers the minor to services to attain competency. Services must adhere to standards and be provided in the least restrictive environment. Minors in custody receive priority, with services reviewed every 30 days. If competency is unlikely within a reasonable period, the minor returns to court promptly. Upon receipt of the recommendation by the remediation program, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on whether the minor is remediated or able to be remediated. The burden of proof shifts depending on the recommendation, with the minor having to prove incompetence if deemed competent, and the prosecutor having to prove remediability if deemed incompetent. The court shall hold an evidentiary hearing to determine if the minor is competent, with specific provisions applying at this stage of the proceedings. If the court finds the minor has not been remediated but is likely to achieve competency within a reasonable time, they will be ordered to return to the remediation program. If the minor will not achieve competency within a reasonable time, the court shall reinstate the proceedings. If the court finds the minor has not achieved competency within a reasonable time, the petition will be dismissed. The court may invite relevant persons and agencies to discuss available services for the minor after jurisdiction is terminated. If necessary, the court will refer the minor for evaluation. In cases involving felony offenses, remediation cannot exceed two years or the maximum term of detention for the most serious charge. For misdemeanor offenses, remediation cannot exceed one year or the maximum term of detention provided by law. The presiding judge and various agencies must develop a protocol for the competency process and ensure minors found incompetent receive appropriate services. Reimbursement for costs mandated by the state in this act will be provided to local agencies and school districts as per the Government Code."
