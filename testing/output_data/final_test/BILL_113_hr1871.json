The Baseline Reform Act of 2014, also known as the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, is amended to include Section 257 which outlines the preparation of annual baselines for new budget authority, outlays, receipts, and surplus/deficit projections for the current year and the following nine years based on existing laws. Estimates for direct spending in the baseline are calculated based on laws in place, with exceptions for certain programs. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 stipulates that programs with estimated outlays over $50,000,000 will expire in the budget year or outyears. New programs exceeding this threshold will be scored by the Committees on the Budget or OMB. Consultation between OMB, CBO, and the Committees on the Budget will occur for scoring discrepancies. Additionally, programs under suspension will continue to operate after expiration. The program shall continue to operate as it did before the suspension, veterans' compensation increase assumed to be the same as required by law, excise taxes dedicated to trust funds assumed to be extended, and programs under expiring laws with outlays over $50,000,000 will continue to operate as before expiration. The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund receipts and disbursements are included in all calculations required by the Act. Discretionary spending baseline calculations for the budget year and nine outyears assume estimated appropriations and current-year appropriations for budgetary resources. The current-year appropriations for budget accounts are calculated based on the assumption that continuing appropriations cover the entire fiscal year. Up-to-date concepts and definitions are used in calculating the baseline for the budget year and outyears. Amounts realized from asset sales are also included in the calculations. The CBO shall submit the Long-Term Budget Outlook annually to the House and Senate Budget Committees, covering the fiscal year and the following 40 years. Amounts from asset sales that result in a financial cost to the Government are excluded from budget estimates. The House of Representatives passed the bill on April 8, 2014. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
