    "content": "Since 1924, the US has allowed foreign students to study in higher education programs, with exceptions for public high schools. Foreign students must pay tuition and are not eligible for federal financial aid, but many receive assistance from their institutions. They contribute to cultural diversity and enhance the reputation of US universities. Congress is reviewing INA provisions related to foreign student admissions. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provisions governing foreign student admissions in the US are being reevaluated following the 9/11 attacks. There are three main nonimmigrant visa categories for students to study in the US temporarily. The three main nonimmigrant visa categories for foreign students in the US are F visas for academic study, M visas for vocational study, and J visas for cultural exchange. The most common visa is the F-1 visa, tailored for full-time academic education. To obtain an F-1 visa, students must be accepted by an approved school, show sufficient funds for expenses, and maintain a foreign residence. Foreign students on an F visa must show scholastic preparation, English proficiency, and financial support for 12 months. They are generally not allowed off-campus employment, except for extreme financial hardship or with an international organization. On-campus employment is allowed if it does not displace a U.S. resident, and practical training related to their degree program is permitted. Accepting unauthorized employment violates the terms of the visa. Foreign students on an F visa must meet certain requirements and are generally not allowed off-campus employment, except in specific circumstances. On the other hand, individuals on a J-1 visa, including scholars, professors, and others, must participate in a cultural exchange program designated by the U.S. Department of State. Their spouses and children may accompany them as J-2 nonimmigrants. Responsible officers of sponsoring organizations must be U.S. citizens. Foreign students on an F visa must meet specific requirements and are generally not allowed off-campus employment. Individuals on a J-1 visa must participate in a cultural exchange program designated by the U.S. Department of State. Sponsoring programs for J visas must be bona fide educational and cultural exchange programs, have at least five exchange visitors annually, provide cross-cultural activities, be financially stable, and ensure participants have accident insurance. Foreign students on J visas must have a foreign residence they do not intend to abandon and may have to return abroad for two years if they wish to adjust their status or become a legal permanent resident in the United States. This requirement applies to those whose participation was financed by a government agency, those pursuing skills needed in their home country, or those coming for medical training. States to receive graduate medical training. Foreign residency requirement for J visa holders, even if they marry U.S. citizens. Work restrictions similar to F visa for foreign students with J-1 visa. M visa for non-academic study, least used foreign student visa. Requirements include acceptance by approved school, financial means, scholastic preparation, and language skills. Spouses and children can accompany as M-2 nonimmigrants. Foreign students with M visas are not allowed to work in the United States and must maintain a foreign residence. They are admitted for \"duration of status\" as long as they are full-time students. Monitoring their stay is challenging as there is no fixed termination date for their status. The former-INS issued regulations in 1978 and 1981 allowing for longer visa validity periods. In 1983 and 1987, reporting requirements were reduced, establishing the \"duration of status\" policy. Foreign students are processed by four federal agencies, including DOS and CBP, during their time at US higher education institutions. Upon entry to the US, foreign students undergo inspection by CBP and their arrival is reported to ICE for entry into SEVIS. The student's academic institution updates SEVIS with relevant information, which is then shared with DOS, CBP, and USCIS. USCIS handles visa status adjustments. Foreign students must meet criteria to prove visa eligibility, including security, health, and criminal history checks. Some criteria may be waived in certain cases. Foreign students entering the US undergo inspection by CBP and their arrival is reported to ICE for entry into SEVIS. USCIS handles visa status adjustments and checks for security, health, and criminal history. Consular officers check the Terrorist Screening Database before issuing visas, identifying potential inadmissible nonimmigrants on criminal, security, or terrorist concerns. In FY2006, DOS identified 15 potential nonimmigrants as inadmissible due to student visa abuse and 4,924 on criminal, security, or terrorist concerns. In FY2006, 15 potential nonimmigrants were identified as inadmissible due to student visa abuse, and 4,924 were flagged for criminal, security, or terrorist concerns. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 originally required fingerprinting for all visa applicants, with exceptions for diplomats and representatives of international organizations. The requirement was repealed in 1986, but the Attorney General can still request fingerprints for nonimmigrant visa applicants for identification and investigation purposes. In 1995, the former-INS initiated a review of foreign student admission and monitoring, prompted by concerns that terrorists could exploit student status to enter the US. Possible terrorists could exploit foreign student status to enter the US, as highlighted by concerns over the security risks of the foreign student visa. Former INS Commissioner Doris Meisner emphasized the need to automate a foreign student reporting and monitoring system in 1995. The National Commission on Terrorism also identified the vulnerability of the foreign student visa in its June 2000 report, recommending the automation of the monitoring system. The former-INS recommended enhancing and expanding the automated system to monitor foreign students, following concerns over security risks of foreign student visas. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act mandated the development of a program to collect data on F, J, and M nonimmigrants from at least five countries by 1998, expanding to all countries by 2003. This provision requires DHS to collect various data elements on nonimmigrants. The former-INS implemented a pilot program called CIPRIS to monitor foreign students at various educational institutions and airports. The program required educational institutions to report information on foreign students to DHS, including visa details, academic status, and disciplinary actions. The second phase of the monitoring system was announced in July 2001. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) monitoring system began at 12 Boston area institutions. There are currently 9,012 SEVIS-approved schools with 996,263 active international non-immigrant students. Some university officials initially opposed SEVIS, fearing confidentiality breaches, but now support it post-9/11. However, many institutions find SEVIS burdensome and lack proper training from DHS. SEVIS was fully implemented in 2003 under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) at ICE. There has been little legislative activity on foreign student monitoring since then. SEVIS has remained relatively unchanged due to high-profile incidents that have improved its public image. Notably, SEVIS data helped detect unaccounted alien students, such as 11 Egyptian visa holders who never attended classes at Montana State University in 2006. University officials reported the absence of 11 students to DHS, leading to their apprehension. SEVIS is seen as working effectively, but ICE believes it needs improvement for security. The proposal for SEVIS II aims to address security vulnerabilities. Concerns persist about balancing security with attracting foreign students, especially in STEM fields crucial for research institutions and the U.S. economy. The U.S. economy has a high demand for skill-sets in STEM fields, and foreign students are seen as a link between academia and the labor market. The Bush Administration has made regulatory changes to facilitate pathways for immigration for these students. The number of F, M, and J visas issued has more than doubled over the past two decades. In FY1989, the number of F, M, and J visas issued grew to 373,932, constituting 5% of all nonimmigrant visas. By FY2008, DOS issued 767,266 visas to F, J, and M nonimmigrants, making up 11% of all nonimmigrant visas. J cultural exchange visitors led with 392,089 visas, followed by F academic students with 364,423 visas. Asia was the largest sending region for F and M student visas, with 244,737 visas issued in FY2008. Europe had the second largest portion with 66,965 visas issued. In FY2008, Africa and Oceania accounted for 5.2% and 0.7% of F and M nonimmigrant visas issued, respectively. The majority of foreign students in 2007-2008 were in graduate degree programs (44.4%), followed by undergraduate degree programs (28.5%). Optional practical training participants made up 9.1% of international students. The fields of study chosen by foreign students were diverse. The fields of study chosen by foreign students are diverse, with business and management being the largest category at 17.8%. Engineering, physical and life sciences, mathematics and computer sciences, and social sciences also have significant representation. Optional practical training has seen a notable increase, now accounting for 9% of foreign students' major study fields. Other fields of study make up 9.8% of the foreign student population. Nonimmigrant visitors are generally allowed to attend schools in the United States, with their coursework being incidental to their primary purpose for being in the country. Nonimmigrant visitors in the United States, except for certain categories, may attend school as long as it is incidental to their primary purpose. Spouses and minor children are also allowed to attend school. However, visas cannot be extended for completing a course of study. Nonimmigrant students on F, J, or M visas can attend school part-time or full-time, even at schools not approved by SEVP. Changing status to F, J, or M categories is allowed for most nonimmigrant categories. Nonimmigrant students can pursue course work at schools not approved by SEVP as long as it aligns with their visa category. ICE agents investigate visa violations, and nonimmigrants are encouraged to apply for F, J, or M visas for education. Work authorization requires a change of status to a qualifying visa. SEVIS reporting is not required for non-educational visa holders. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, Congress increased monitoring of educational visas through SEVIS, but nonimmigrant visa holders on non-educational visas are not required to submit documentation. SEVIS serves as a monitoring system for foreign nationals with F, J, or M visas, but does not monitor foreign students as a whole. The application process for SEVP and non-SEVP-certified programs varies by school, with documentation requirements set by the school. After the September 11 attacks, Congress increased monitoring of educational visas through SEVIS for foreign nationals with F, J, or M visas. However, nonimmigrant visa holders on non-educational visas are not required to submit documentation. Universities have focused on attracting foreign students in high-demand fields of study, with some schools enrolling nonimmigrants on \"E\" visas without SEVP certification. These schools have reporting requirements unrelated to immigration, such as data on legal operations and student funding distribution. If students do not receive federal funds and are not on F, J, or M visas, the school has no incentive to report on its foreign student population to immigration authorities. Universities are focusing on attracting foreign students in high-demand STEM fields to boost revenue streams. STEM graduates earn higher salaries, leading to increased alumni donations. This emphasis on STEM-related skill development is part of a broader movement in higher education. Foreign students in STEM fields are seen as a lucrative demographic for universities. Foreign students in STEM fields are a significant source of revenue for universities, paying full tuition and making up a large portion of the STEM student population. Data from the NSF and IIE show that in 2004 and 2005-2006, foreign students accounted for a high percentage of doctorates in the sciences and engineering. Availability of fellowships and teaching positions remains a point of contention for both STEM and non-STEM students. The availability of fellowships and teaching assistantship funding for foreign graduate students has been a source of controversy. A 2004 study found that a higher percentage of financial support for doctoral students goes to non-U.S. citizens compared to U.S. citizens. U.S. minority groups argue that they are particularly disadvantaged by university support. U.S. minority groups argue that university support for foreign students may disadvantage them financially. Complaints have been made about the lack of English competence among foreign graduate students, with cases of identity fraud occurring during English proficiency tests like the TOEFL. Some universities struggle to detect fraudulent TOEFL scores, leading to challenges in verifying English-language competency. In response, certain programs have implemented stricter admission procedures for students from countries with a history of score fraud. Employers in STEM fields are increasingly interested in hiring foreign graduates due to a shortage of U.S. citizens in STEM-trained roles. Students on F-category visas are affected by these changes. For STEM-trained graduates on F-category visas, the optional training period allows them to intern with a U.S. firm for up to 12 months post-graduation without adjusting their visa. This option is attractive to firms seeking skilled workers without H-1B visa restrictions. The training period can lead to a relationship with an employer for potential permanent residency sponsorship. Employers can petition for foreign nationals with STEM degrees to extend their optional practical training period by 17 months. Only STEM students working for E-Verify enrolled employers are eligible. The student must request an extension from their designated school official. The new OPT extension allows F-1 students to apply for OPT during the 60-day departure preparation period after completing their course requirements. Students must report employment-related information to the DSO and verify it every six months during the extension. USCIS also made technical changes to post-completion OPT, clarifying when unemployment violates F-1 status requirements. The interim final rule specifies that F-1 students on OPT can have a maximum of 90 days of unemployment during a 12-month OPT period, which increases to 120 days for a 17-month OPT extension. This allows for job searches and breaks when switching employers. The USCIS rule change also addresses the \"cap-gap\" for H-1B nonimmigrant employment authorization, providing extensions for students in this situation. USCIS can now automatically extend status and employment authorizations for F-1 students with pending H-1B petitions, removing previous limitations. ICE also raised program fees and established SEVIS recertification procedures for participating schools. ICE has increased fees for exchange visitors to $35 and raised the school certification petition fee to $1,700. Additionally, schools must undergo a mandatory site review with a fee of $655. The fee increase is to finance enforcement activities and develop SEVIS II, a new automated system for tracking individuals. The FY2008 budget for ICE included $56 million for SEVP, while the FY2009 budget requested $120 million, a 113% increase. The funding increase would go towards equipment, services, and personnel for enforcement and SEVIS transformation. A new subcategory for J visa exchange visitors called \"Student Interns\" was created by the Department of State, allowing foreign students to participate in internships with private sector organizations. Foreign nationals eligible for internships in the private sector must be currently enrolled in an academic institution or a recent graduate. They can participate in a structured internship program in their academic field without prior work experience. Legislation in previous Congresses focused on attracting more students in STEM fields, indicating potential future legislation in the 111th Congress."
