The \"Extradition Treaties Interpretation Act of 1998\" is the short title for Title II. Congress recognizes the prevalence of parental abduction as a criminal offense in the United States and the need to combat international parental kidnapping through Federal law. The United States does not consider parental abduction as kidnapping under older extradition treaties, but newer treaties with dual criminality provisions allow for extradition if both parties consider it a felony. This has created a disparity in extradition law that needs to be addressed to better protect against international parental kidnapping. Extradition law in the United States should be revised to enhance protection for children and parents. The United States authorizes the interpretation of extradition treaties to include parental kidnapping."
