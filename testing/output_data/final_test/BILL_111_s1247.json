The \"Orphans, Widows, and Widowers Protection Act\" provides relief for orphans and spouses of United States citizens and residents by amending the Immigration and Nationality Act to include provisions for aliens married to a citizen for less than 2 years at the time of the citizen's death. The Orphans, Widows, and Widowers Protection Act allows alien children to file a petition before turning 21 years old, and provides a special rule for orphans and spouses to file a classification petition within 2 years of the relative's death. Eligibility for parole is granted to aliens previously excluded due to lack of immediate relative classification. The Orphans, Widows, and Widowers Protection Act allows alien children to petition before turning 21, with a special rule for orphans and spouses to file within 2 years of the relative's death. If an alien's citizen relative dies, they may be eligible for parole into the US and their adjustment of status application will be considered. SEC. 3. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS. Surviving spouses, parents, and children may apply for adjustment of status even after the death of the qualifying relative under an amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act. This applies to immediate relatives, family-sponsored immigrants, and derivative beneficiaries of employment-based immigrants. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows surviving spouses, parents, and children of refugees or asylees to apply for adjustment of status even after the death of a qualifying relative. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows surviving spouses, parents, and children of refugees or asylees to apply for adjustment of status even after the death of a qualifying relative. Additionally, there is a transition period outlined in Section 4. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows renewal of adjustment of status applications for aliens whose qualifying relative died before the enactment of the Act. Eligibility for parole into the United States is granted to excluded, deported, or voluntarily departed aliens under certain conditions. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows renewal of adjustment of status applications for aliens whose qualifying relative died before the enactment of the Act, and eligibility for parole into the United States is granted to excluded, deported, or voluntarily departed aliens under certain conditions, notwithstanding section 212(a)(9) of the Act. SEC. 5. PROCESSING OF IMMIGRANT VISAS AND DERIVATIVE PETITIONS. Section 204(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allow immigrant visa applications to be adjudicated even if the qualifying relative has passed away before completion of processing. The issued visa remains valid after the relative's death. The subparagraph specifies categories of aliens eligible for immigrant visas, including immediate relatives, family-sponsored immigrants, derivative beneficiaries of employment-based immigrants, and spouses or children of refugees or asylees. A transition period allows visa applications to be processed even if the qualifying relative has died before enactment. The Act allows for renewal of visa applications if the qualifying relative died before enactment, without fees. The Act also states that an alien's application for an immigrant visa will be considered even if they were excluded, deported, removed, or departed voluntarily before the enactment date. SEC. 6 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include provisions for naturalization of spouses of deceased U.S. citizens. SEC. 7 states that the amendments apply to pending petitions or applications as of the enactment date, or those denied but would have been approved under the new amendments."
