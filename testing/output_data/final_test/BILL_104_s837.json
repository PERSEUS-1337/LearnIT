    "content": "The \"James Madison Commemorative Coin Act\" authorizes the minting of 800,000 $1 silver coins to commemorate James Madison's 250th birth anniversary. The coins will weigh 26.73 grams, have a diameter of 1.500 inches, and contain 90% silver and 10% copper. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The Secretary will obtain silver for minting coins from stockpiles established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act. The design of the coins will be determined as per the Act. The design of the coins minted under this Act for the 250th anniversary of James Madison's birth will include inscriptions of value, year, and words like \"Liberty\" and \"In God We Trust\". The design will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with relevant organizations. The design of the coins for the 250th anniversary of James Madison's birth will be reviewed by various organizations including the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. SEC. 5 of the Act specifies that coins will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities from a single mint facility starting January 1, 2001, with minting ending on December 31, 2001. SEC. 6 of the Act outlines the sale of coins, including pricing details, bulk sales at a discount, acceptance of prepaid orders with discounts, and a $10 surcharge per coin. SEC. 7 of the Act waives procurement regulations for goods and services needed for the Act, except for equal employment opportunity laws. SEC. 8 of the Act directs all surcharges from coin sales to the National Trust for Historic Preservation for an endowment and restoration projects at Montpelier, James Madison's home. The Comptroller General can audit the Trust's expenditures. SEC. 9 of the Act ensures that minting and issuing coins will not cost the government. Coins can only be issued if full payment, security, or a guarantee of payment is received by the Secretary."
