Efforts to reauthorize it have been ongoing, with the 110th Congress passing its own version of a bill. The Improving Head Start Act of 2007 (H.R. 1429) was introduced by Representative Kildee on March 9, 2007. The House Committee on Education and Labor debated, amended, and approved the bill (42-1) the following week. The bill was then taken to the House floor on May 2 and approved with nine amendments by a vote of 365-48. The Head Start for School Readiness Act (S. 556) was introduced by Senator Kennedy on February 12, 2007, and approved by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on February 14. The Senate passed the bill on June 19. The Senate passed its bill (S. 556) on June 19, 2007, adopting the bill number of the House reauthorization bill (H.R. 1429) with some changes.
