    "content": "The United States upholds the principle of not returning foreign nationals to countries where their life or freedom is at risk, as outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act. Aliens seeking asylum must show a well-founded fear of persecution based on specific characteristics. They can apply for asylum with USCIS or seek asylum before an immigration judge. Aliens arriving at a U.S. port without proper immigration documents or engaging in fraud are placed in expedited removal. If they express fear of persecution, they receive a \"credible fear\" hearing and may be referred to an immigration judge for asylum consideration. The Attorney General has discretion in granting asylum, but those involved in persecution are excluded. Mandatory denials can occur for serious crimes, danger to the community, firm resettlement elsewhere, or national security concerns. The INA also outlines specific grounds for excluding aliens based on criminal and terrorist activities. During the Cold War, the U.S. asylum policy was mainly for those fleeing communist or socialist countries. From 1946 to 2000, 3.5 million refugees received legal status, with a majority from Vietnam, Cuba, and the former Soviet Union. In FY2001-FY2004, refugees from Cuba, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ukraine, and Vietnam made up over half of all new legal permanent residents. There are differing views on revising U.S. asylum laws, with concerns about potential terrorist exploitation. Some express concern that potential terrorists could exploit asylum for entry into the United States, while others argue that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the persecuted and persecutors. Asylum is seen by some as an alternative immigration pathway rather than a humanitarian protection, with current laws lacking adequate safeguards for those fleeing human rights violations or gender-based abuses globally. The report is divided into four sections, summarizing the legislative history of U.S. asylum policy and major immigration laws. The curr_chunk discusses major immigration laws related to asylum policy, current policy concepts like \"credible fear\" and \"well-founded fear,\" asylum data analysis, major bills with asylum provisions in the 108th and 109th Congresses, and the U.N. Refugee Protocol. It highlights the issues of current debate and alternative views on asylum. The U.N. Refugee Protocol ensures rights and protections for refugees. The Refugee Act of 1980 established asylum provisions in the INA and allowed for asylum seekers to become legal permanent residents. The Refugee Act of 1980 added provisions to the INA for refugees and asylees to become legal permanent residents after meeting certain requirements. Up to 5,000 refugee admissions numbers could be used to grant LPR status to asylees and their families who have been physically present in the United States. The Immigration Act of 1990 aimed to address backlogs in asylee adjustments to LPR status due to the increasing number of asylum claims, which surpassed 100,000 in 1989. Many asylees from Eastern Europe were concerned about no longer qualifying as refugees under the law due to improved conditions in their native countries. The Immigration Act of 1990 aimed to address backlogs in asylee adjustments to LPR status by increasing the annual limit to 10,000 and allowing those who filed before June 1, 1990, to adjust status outside of numerical limits. It also granted LPR status to those who qualified before November 29, 1990, but were hindered by prior limits and improved country conditions. The Act was influenced by the crumbling of communism in Eastern Europe and the Arias Peace talks in Central America, which gave hope for fewer asylum seekers in the future. The policy before the Immigration Act of 1990 allowed aliens to request asylum in the US if lacking proper documents, with the possibility of seeking administrative and judicial review if denied. Critics argued that illegal aliens were abusing the system with frivolous claims and work authorizations. Concerns arose over lengthy backlogs and potential abuse by international terrorists entering with false documents. Supporters of the then-current asylum system argued that regulatory reforms had addressed bureaucratic issues, emphasizing the US commitment to the UN Refugee Protocol and nonrefoulement principle. They defended the right of aliens without proper documents to a full hearing, citing concerns about those fleeing dangerous situations using fraudulent documents. The Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) made significant changes to the asylum process, including establishing expedited removal proceedings and limiting judicial review in certain circumstances. The goal was to address perceived abuses of the asylum process by restricting the hearing, review, and appeal process for aliens at the port of entry. The IIRIRA amendments to the INA allow for summary exclusion of aliens without proper documentation or credible fear of persecution. Those expressing fear of return must be detained pending credible fear determination. If found not to have credible fear, they are removed; if they meet the threshold, they may be released for further immigration judge review. The IIRIRA amendments to the asylum process require applicants to file within one year of arrival, with exceptions for changed conditions or extraordinary circumstances. It also bars asylum for those who can be returned to a \"safe-third country\" and have been denied asylum in the past. The U.S. must have an agreement with the country for return. The IIRIRA reforms established consequences for frivolous asylum applications, including permanent bar from benefits for offenders. Changes include a 150-day waiting period for work authorization after filing asylum application. USCIS has 30 days to grant or deny work authorization requests. The IIRIRA reforms added provisions for refugees and asylees to request asylum based on persecution from coercive population control policies, limited to 1,000 individuals annually. Assessing asylum cases relies on credibility and likelihood of persecution upon return. \"Credible fear\" and \"well-founded fear\" are key standards, along with the concept of \"mixed motives\" for persecution. The term \"credible fear of persecution\" is defined in the INA. The credible fear concept in expedited removal serves as a pre-screening standard broader than the well-founded fear of persecution required for asylum eligibility. Judicial decisions have shaped the \"well-founded fear\" standards, including criteria such as fear based on race, religion, nationality, social group membership, or political opinion. The regulations for asylum seekers require demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution based on political opinion, the possibility of suffering persecution if returning to their country, and an inability or unwillingness to return due to fear. It is not necessary for the applicant to prove individual persecution if there is a pattern or practice of persecution in their country. The regulations for asylum seekers require demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The persecutor's intent can have multiple motives, as long as one is based on the statutorily enumerated grounds. It is not necessary for the applicant to conclusively prove why persecution occurred, but they must provide evidence that the harm was at least partially motivated by one of the enumerated grounds. The asylum seeker must show that harm was motivated by a protected ground like race or religion. There are two avenues to seek asylum: affirmative and defensive applications, depending on the applicant's status in removal proceedings. The affirmative and defensive asylum applications follow different procedural paths but rely on the same legal standards. The burden of proof is on the asylum seeker to establish meeting the refugee definition. An asylum seeker in the US not in removal proceedings files form I-589 with USCIS. USCIS conducts non-adversarial interviews with Asylum Officers who determine asylum eligibility based on the application and interview information. Asylum applicants in the affirmative process are not subject to mandatory detention requirements while their applications are being adjudicated. If the asylum officer approves the application and the alien passes background checks, asylum status is granted. Denied asylum claims are referred to EOIR immigration judges for formal proceedings. Defensive applications are raised in removal proceedings as a defense to removal. EOIR's immigration judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals handle these cases. In the defensive application process, asylum seekers raise their claims as a defense to removal. Immigration judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals have exclusive control over these claims. Asylum issues are typically raised at the beginning of the removal process and litigated in immigration court. If not raised initially, asylum claims can only be made after a successful motion to reopen the case. The immigration judge's decision on removal and asylum can be appealed to the BIA. Applicants may be detained until a ruling is made, not specifically due to their asylum claim. When expedited removal was implemented in 1997, it initially applied to \"arriving aliens\" but can also be used for those illegally present in the US for less than two years. Customs and Border Protection officers must ask specific questions to identify those afraid of returning to their home country. The expedited removal process involves questioning individuals about their fear of returning to their home country. If an alien expresses fear, they are detained and interviewed by an asylum officer to determine credible fear. Those with credible fear are referred to an immigration judge for asylum consideration. EOIR completed 91% of expedited removal asylum cases in 180 days or less in FY2003. Aliens arriving by sea who are not admitted or paroled are placed in expedited removal proceedings and detained due to national security concerns. The Attorney General ruled that immigration judges must consider national security interests when making bond determinations for unauthorized migrants arriving by sea. This ruling was prompted by a case involving a Haitian who arrived in Florida and was released on bond, which was later vacated by the Attorney General. All asylum seekers undergo multiple background checks in various databases. Those entering legally are screened by consular officers, while those entering illegally are screened by Border Patrol or ICE agents. Asylum seekers have their fingerprints scanned and undergo a full background check by the FBI. A \"safe third country\" agreement was signed between Canada and the US for asylum claims at land border ports of entry. A \"safe third country\" agreement was signed between Canada and the US for asylum claims at land border ports of entry. It states that individuals making asylum claims will be returned to the country from which they are being removed if their claim has been rejected. The final rule to implement this agreement has not yet been issued by DHS. The Torture Convention prohibits the return of individuals to a country where they may be tortured. To establish torture, three elements must be met: severe pain or suffering, intentional infliction, and involvement of a public official. Applicants for non-removal under Article 3 bear the burden of proof. Generally, an applicant for non-removal under Article 3 must prove it is likely they would be tortured if removed. Testimony may suffice without corroboration. If a reliable diplomatic assurance is obtained, the claim for protection will not be considered further. The number of affirmative asylum claims has varied over the past 30 years due to repression and civil unrest. The number of affirmative asylum claims has fluctuated over the past 30 years due to repression, civil unrest, and changes in asylum policy. In FY2004, there was a drop in claims to 27,551, enabling USCIS to reduce the backlog of pending cases. By FY2005, there were 98,499 pending cases, down from a high of 393,699 in FY1997. The number of approved asylum cases also varied, with 12,454 cases approved in FY1995, 16,693 in FY2000, and 31,202 in FY2002. In FY2002, 31,202 asylum cases were approved, dropping to 10,101 in FY2004. The approval rate decreased from 44% in FY2000 to 32% in FY2004. The number of cases filed decreased from 74,127 in FY2002 to 55,067 in FY2004. Over two-thirds of asylum cases received by EOIR are affirmative cases referred to immigration judges. EOIR asylum approvals have gradually increased. In FY2002, 31,202 asylum cases were approved, dropping to 10,101 in FY2004. The approval rate decreased from 44% in FY2000 to 32% in FY2004. The number of cases filed decreased from 74,127 in FY2002 to 55,067 in FY2004. Over two-thirds of asylum cases received by EOIR are affirmative cases referred to immigration judges. EOIR asylum approvals have gradually increased. Asylum cases granted by EOIR judges rose from 5,131 in FY1996 to 9,170 in FY2000, reaching a high of 13,365 approvals in FY2003 and 10,796 cases in FY2004. The percentage of EOIR asylum cases approved ranged from 32% in FY1991 to 40% in FY2001, leveling at 34% in FY2004. Just over half (55%) of all affirmative asylum claims filed with USCIS were from the top 10 source countries in FY2004. In FY2004, Haiti became the top source country for asylum seekers, with numbers comparable to FY2003. The People's Republic of China saw a decrease in asylum seekers from 4,750 in FY2003 to 2,839 in FY2004. Mexico's asylum claimants dropped significantly from 3,846 in FY2003 to a number below disclosure standards in FY2004. Five source countries had over 50% of their cases approved by USCIS in FY2004, including Burma, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Iran, and Pakistan. In FY2004, the top 10 source countries for defensive asylum claims comprised 62% of cases filed with EOIR. Asylum claimants from the top five countries made up 43% of all defensive claims. The percentage of approved asylum cases by EOIR varied, as shown in Table 2. In FY2004, EOIR had a higher approval rate than USCIS asylum officers, with approval rates of 34% and 32% respectively. The top 10 source countries for EOIR cases had approval rates ranging from 54% for Albania to 6% for El Salvador. In FY2003, six countries had over 50% of their cases approved by EOIR, while in FY2004, ten countries met this criteria. Asylum seekers come from all over the world, with regional distribution differences between USCIS and EOIR claims. In FY2004, the regional distribution of USCIS asylum claimants differed from EOIR claims. The top source regions for USCIS were Africa (26.4%), Asia (19.1%), and South America (19.1%). For EOIR, Central America and the Caribbean were first at 29.1%, Asia second at 24.7%, and South America third at 16.3%. The number of individuals granted asylum declined in FY2005 for both USCIS and EOIR cases, with a total of 25,257 individuals receiving asylum, down from 38,641 in FY2001. In FY2003, USCIS and EOIR granted conditional asylum status to 2,353 aliens based on resistance to coercive population control policies, with all grantees originating from China. USCIS issued 194 conditional grants of asylum, and EOIR issued 2,159 conditional grants. At the end of FY2003, there were at least 7,665 principal conditional grantees on the waiting list. At the end of FY2003, there were 7,665 principal conditional grantees on the waiting list for final approval authorization numbers, comprising 6,401 EOIR cases and 1,264 USCIS cases. The number of people granted asylum each year exceeds those adjusting to LPR status. By FY2004, there were 182,015 cases pending for asylees to adjust to LPR status, with a backlog growth in the late 1990s. The number of pending asylum adjustments decreased from 185,890 in FY2005 to 101,193 in FY2006. Critics argued that the 10,000 annual limit on asylee adjustments to LPR status was arbitrary and unfair, leading to an 18-year wait for asylees to obtain the \"green card\" by the end of FY2004. They also criticized the 1,000 cap on asylees fleeing coercive population control policies as arbitrary and unfair. Supporters of numerical limits on asylum adjustments argue that unlimited adjustments would encourage unauthorized migration, while those who obtain asylum are allowed to stay in the US. In the 108th and 109th Congresses, 83 bills related to asylum were introduced, with some major bills receiving action in one or both chambers. Notably, H.R. 4011, S. 710, and House-passed S. 2845 were among the bills with asylum provisions that received action. The House passed H.R. 10 as a substitute for S. 2845, which included provisions to expand authority for expedited removal and revise asylum law by increasing the prior continuous U.S. physical presence required for exemption from removal from two years to five years. The House-passed H.R. 10, a substitute for S. 2845, aimed to increase the prior continuous U.S. physical presence required for exemption from removal from two years to five years. It also sought to establish standards of proof for asylum seekers, placing the burden on the applicant to prove persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. The testimony of the asylum seeker could be sufficient to meet this burden if credible, persuasive, and supported by specific facts demonstrating refugee status. The House-passed H.R. 10 aimed to increase the prior continuous U.S. physical presence required for exemption from removal and establish standards of proof for asylum seekers. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 included a provision pertaining to asylum for nationals of North Korea. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported S. 710, Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act, which included a provision to bar aliens who commit acts of torture or extrajudicial killings from obtaining asylum. Language similar to S. 710 was added to House-passed S. 2845 and included in the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458). Several bills introduced in the 109th Congress addressed asylum provisions, with one bill, the REAL ID Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-13, Division B), enacting substantive revisions to asylum law. Asylum provisions from the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 that were dropped were included in H.R. 418 introduced by House Committee on the Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner. The asylum provisions in H.R. 418 introduced by Sensenbrenner included establishing standards of proof for asylum seekers based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. It required the burden of proof to be on the asylum seeker to meet the refugee definition and provide corroborating evidence if requested by the trier of fact. H.R. 418 would have required aliens applying for withholding of removal to undergo credibility determinations and burdens similar to those applying for asylum. It aimed to prevent courts from reversing determinations on the availability of corroborating evidence unless it was deemed truly unavailable. Additionally, it sought to repeal a section of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act related to weaknesses in the asylum and removal systems that could be exploited by individuals connected to terrorist activity. The Manager's Amendment to H.R. 418 eliminated the annual cap on asylee adjustments to LPR status. H.R. 418 passed the House of Representatives on February 10, 2005. The Real ID Act, included in H.R. 1268, passed the House on March 12, 2005. The asylum provisions were modified to establish standards of proof for asylum seekers. The House passed H.R. 1268, which eliminated numerical limits on asylee adjustments and caps on asylum based on persecution from coercive population control policies. It was considered \"must pass\" legislation and signed into law on May 11, 2005. H.R. 4437 had provisions concerning expedited removal for aliens near international borders, causing concern for asylum seekers' advocates. Title II of H.R. 4437 proposed upgrading illegal presence from a civil offense to a criminal offense, potentially impacting asylum seekers near international borders. Concerns were raised about mandatory detention, barring from asylum, and potential arrest by state and local law enforcement. Despite retaining protections for those expressing fear of persecution, the bill's fate remained uncertain as the 109th Congress closed. Critics are concerned about terrorists seeking asylum in the US among pending cases. They argue for restricting asylum relief for national security reasons, while others highlight the multiple security screenings asylum seekers undergo. The debate centers on balancing security risks with humanitarian concerns in asylum cases. Some argue for limiting judicial review in asylum cases to protect national security, while others believe it would undermine due process and freedom from persecution. Concerns are raised about the training of Customs and Border Protection officers and ICE agents in handling asylum seekers. Some argue for limiting judicial review in asylum cases to protect national security, while others believe it would undermine due process and freedom from persecution. Concerns are raised about the training of Customs and Border Protection officers and ICE agents in handling asylum seekers, questioning their ability to recognize bona fide asylum seekers and the communication among key immigration agencies. Proponents of expanding expedited removal argue that aliens expressing fear of persecution are given adequate opportunities for asylum consideration. Aliens expressing fear of persecution are given opportunities for asylum consideration. Critics of expedited removal argue against low-level immigration officers having the authority to order removal. Critics argue that low-level immigration officers' unchecked authority in expedited removal can lead to the loss of substantive rights and erroneous removal of individuals with valid claims. Reports of abuse have surfaced since its implementation, with cases of asylum seekers being refused the opportunity to apply for asylum and pushed back at primary inspection. Detention of asylum seekers in expedited removal is criticized as psychologically damaging, especially for a vulnerable population escaping imprisonment. Critics argue that mandatory detention of asylum seekers in expedited removal is inappropriate and unwarranted, while proponents maintain it is essential for immigration control and homeland security. They suggest alternatives like electronic monitoring, but warn that releasing asylum seekers undermines the purpose of expedited removal and creates opportunities for bogus claims. Critics argue that loosening policies on mandatory detention of asylum seekers in expedited removal diverts CBP and ICE officers from homeland security duties. Supporters believe current law deters aliens from using asylum claims to enter illegally. U.S. policy towards asylum seekers from Cuba and Haiti is compared due to their repressive governments and history of sending asylum seekers by boats. Special laws and agreements apply to Cubans and Haitians, but treatment differs between the two groups. Cuban migrants receive more generous treatment under U.S. law than Haitians or foreign nationals from any other country. A \"wet foot/dry foot\" practice towards Cuban migrants allows those who reach the shore to stay and adjust under the Cuban Adjustment Act. Critics argue that the forced return of Cubans interdicted at sea violates U.S. asylum and refugee law, while Haitians face more restrictive treatment. Haitian asylum seekers face more restrictive treatment in the United States compared to Cubans. The Administration argues that paroling Haitians may lead to mass migration and poses a national security risk. Some advocate for amending refugee and asylee definitions to include gender-based persecution. Proponents argue for amending population control policies to include gender-based persecution in asylum cases, citing the need for better protection for those fleeing acts like female genital mutilation, rape, honor killings, and domestic violence. They believe adding gender as a basis would clarify judicial ambiguities, speed up asylum adjudication, and strengthen the policy. Some argue that current asylum laws already protect those fleeing gender-based violence, citing legal guidance from 1995. They believe adding gender as a basis for asylum could impose western cultural norms and attract women from male-dominated cultures."
