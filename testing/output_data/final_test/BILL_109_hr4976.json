    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"NSA Oversight Act\". Congress finds that on September 11, 2001, treacherous acts of violence were committed against the United States, necessitating the exercise of self-defense to protect US citizens at home and abroad. The Federal Government has a duty to pursue enemies like al Qaeda using all available tools, including electronic surveillance, to prevent future attacks and destroy the enemy. The President has the authority to engage in electronic surveillance of the enemy outside the US as Commander-in-Chief under Article II of the Constitution. The Fourth Amendment guarantees the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures, requiring warrants based on probable cause. The Supreme Court considers monitoring private conversations as a search and seizure. Congress has the authority to regulate electronic surveillance within the US. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and specified provisions of the Federal criminal code were enacted to provide legal authority for the Federal Government to engage in searches of Americans for criminal investigations, intelligence gathering, and counterintelligence. Warrantless electronic surveillance of Americans without congressional authorization may impact civil liberties. United States citizens, including journalists, are affected by such surveillance. United States citizens, including journalists, academics, and researchers studying global terrorism, who have made international phone calls post-9/11 attacks, may fear being surveilled. The secretive nature of the NSA program raises concerns for Americans making international calls for various reasons. The President has signed legislation to enhance surveillance tools in the fight against terrorism. The USA PATRIOT Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act have expanded authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. Amendments may be necessary to address new challenges in the Global War on Terrorism. The President can request legislation from Congress to modify electronic surveillance authority. The Authorization for Use of Military Force allows military action against those responsible for terrorism. The USA PATRIOT Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection Act have expanded authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The Authorization for Use of Military Force allows military action against those responsible for the attacks on September 11, 2001, but does not approve of domestic electronic surveillance not authorized by relevant laws. SEC. 3 reiterates that electronic surveillance must be conducted exclusively through chapters 119 and 121 of title 18, United States Code, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. Any future authorization for electronic surveillance must be through specific statutory means. SEC. 4 outlines disclosure requirements. SEC. 4 of the Act mandates the President to submit a classified report to specific congressional committees within 14 days, identifying U.S. persons subjected to unauthorized electronic surveillance and the reasons for their selection. SEC. 5 defines \"electronic surveillance\" as per the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978."
