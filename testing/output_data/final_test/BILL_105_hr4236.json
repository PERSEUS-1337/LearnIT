    "content": "The Act titled \"Shipping Relief for Agriculture Act of 1998\" is also known as the Shipping Relief for Agriculture Act. It includes findings related to the shipping industry. The Congress finds that promoting efficient waterborne cargo transportation is crucial for American agriculture and the national transportation system. The high cost of building ships in the US hinders the growth of the Jones Act fleet. The decline in large ships and seamen in the fleet reduces emergency sealift capacity. The domestic deepwater fleet in the US has significantly decreased in size in recent decades. The United States domestic deepwater fleet has significantly shrunk to only 118 self-propelled oceangoing vessels over 1,000 tons and 59 vessels in the Great Lakes. This has led to shipping shortages, higher prices, and commercial transportation inefficiencies. Increasing competition in domestic deepwater shipping can alleviate these issues without cost to the taxpayer, benefiting American businesses and potentially creating domestic jobs. The lack of access to deepwater commercial waterborne transportation alternatives suppresses economic activity, causing annual losses of $4.2 billion to $10 billion and the loss of tax revenue. Allowing domestic transportation service providers to purchase vessels internationally will lower operating expenses, leading to cost savings for customers and improved efficiency. Expanding the Jones Act fleet will create more jobs for U.S. seamen and longshore workers. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON APPLICATION OF COASTWISE TRADE RESTRICTION ON TRANSPORTATION OF CERTAIN AGRICULTURAL, BULK, OR FOREST PRODUCT CARGO BY FREIGHT VESSELS. Amendment to the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 allows for exemption from US construction requirement for deepwater transportation of qualified cargo by a US-documented vessel owned by US citizens. The amendment exempts US vessels from construction requirements for transporting qualified cargo on the Great Lakes and within the Boundary Line to US ports. Qualified cargo includes agricultural, bulk, and forest products. The terms 'bulk cargo' and 'forest products' are defined under the Shipping Act of 1984, while 'Boundary Line' and 'freight vessel' are defined under Title 46, United States Code. Amendment to Title 46, United States Code allows non-US built freight vessels to be endorsed for coastwise trade if eligible and meet US laws. Coastwise trade under this endorsement is limited to deepwater transportation of qualified cargo."
