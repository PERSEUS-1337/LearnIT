    "content": "The \"Healthy Hospitals Act of 2007\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. The findings section of the Act highlights important information. Health care costs in the United States are rising, with medical costs for a four-person household increasing by 9.1 percent to $12,214 from 2004 to 2005. Health care-associated infections contribute to over $50 billion in annual medical costs, with 2 million cases and 90,000 deaths related to such infections each year. Health care-associated infections, including various types such as surgical site infections and MRSA, are transmitted to patients due to inadequate adherence to sanitation and safety procedures in hospitals. Only six states require hospitals to report infection rates, and only one state makes this information publicly available. Hospital procedures, not patient sickness upon admission, are the primary cause of infections. Strict sanitation techniques, including handwashing, equipment sterilization, and pre-testing patients, have significantly reduced infection rates in healthcare settings. The National Surgical Infection Prevention Project emphasizes the importance of infection control measures in hospitals. The National Surgical Infection Prevention Project found that a high percentage of patients did not receive timely antibiotic doses, and many healthcare workers do not follow handwashing protocols. Hospitals have reduced infections by improving patient safety through staff education and training, resulting in significant cost savings. The hospital in St. Louis reduced central line infections with an educational program, saving $1,500,000. Mercy Health Center in Oklahoma had 400 infection-free surgeries. Public reporting of healthcare-associated infections can improve patient safety, reduce costs, and save lives. Public reporting of healthcare-associated infections data by hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers is required. Hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers are required to report data to the Secretary in accordance with specific subsections of the Social Security Act. Hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers must report rates of health care-associated infections to the Secretary quarterly, along with relevant risk factors. The Secretary selects health care-associated infections and posts reported data on the Department of Health and Human Services website for comparison among hospitals and surgical centers. An annual report to Congress is also required. The Secretary submits an annual report to Congress summarizing rates of health care-associated infections in hospitals and surgical centers, factors contributing to infections, measures taken to reduce infections, and the impact on healthcare costs. The Secretary may impose a civil money penalty of up to $10,000 for each knowing violation of infection prevention regulations by hospitals or surgical centers. The penalty will be collected similarly to other civil money penalties, with the possibility of a pilot program being implemented. The Healthy Hospitals Act of 2007 allows for a pilot program on health care-associated infections. Amounts recovered will be used for the program. State laws on disclosure of infection information are not preempted. Health care-associated infection is defined by the CDC. Health care-associated infection is defined by the CDC as a condition resulting from an adverse reaction to an infectious agent or its toxin, present after admission but preventable with patient safety measures. This includes surgical site infections and ventilator-associated infections. The text chunk discusses various types of infections, including surgical site infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-related blood infections, urinary tract infections, MRSA infections, clostridium difficile infections, and others specified by the Secretary. It also mentions that critical access hospitals are included in the term \"hospital\" for this subsection. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2008 through 2010 to carry out this section. MEDICARE PILOT PROGRAM TO REDUCE HEALTH CARE-ASSOCIATED INFECTION RATES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can implement a pilot program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide incentives to hospitals and surgical centers that reduce health care-associated infections. Selected facilities must be able to monitor and report infection rates accurately. The pilot program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act offers financial incentives to hospitals and surgical centers for reducing health care-associated infections. The program aims to achieve the greatest scientific and health benefit by reducing infection rates, with a limitation that incentives cannot exceed 10% of reduced Federal expenditures. The term \"health care-associated infection\" is defined as per section 1866(k)(6) of the Social Security Act, and critical access hospitals are included in the program. Authorization of Appropriations for fiscal years 2008 through 2010 is provided to carry out the program, including critical access hospitals. Congress authorizes funding for the program, including critical access hospitals. Congress urges healthcare providers to reduce healthcare-associated infections to zero for patients they serve."
