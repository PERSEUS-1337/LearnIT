Initially conceived in 2003, the program aimed to construct a net zero-emission fossil-fueled power plant with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology to combat climate change. The FutureGen program aimed to develop a net zero-emission fossil-fueled power plant with CCS technology to combat climate change. In 2008, DOE withdrew from the partnership due to rising construction costs and restructured the program to focus on demonstration projects at different power plants. The Obama administration introduced FutureGen 2.0 in 2010, retrofitting an existing power plant in Illinois with CCS technology. The project was originally a cost-share between the federal government and the private sector, with Congress appropriating $174 million between FY2004 and FY2008. Between FY2004 and FY2008, Congress appropriated $174 million to the original FutureGen project. Under the Obama Administration, Congress allocated nearly $1 billion in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for FutureGen 2.0. DOE has obligated nearly $60 million towards FutureGen 2.0 since FY2010, with total expenditures for the project reaching between $110 and $120 million by early 2014. The FutureGen Industrial Alliance estimated the total cost of the FutureGen 2.0 program to be nearly $1.3 billion, with a significant portion allocated for retrofitting and repowering Ameren Corporation's power plant in Illinois. FutureGen 2.0 project in Meredosia, Illinois involves constructing a CO2 pipeline, storage site, and research center. It is estimated to create 1,000 construction jobs and 1,000 supplier jobs. A report predicts 620 permanent jobs and $12 billion in business volume by 2037 for Illinois. The project aims to capture CO2 emissions to combat climate change caused by human activities. The DOE's Office of Fossil Energy oversees major CCS programs like CCPI and ICCS, aiming to develop new technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Despite some projects withdrawing due to cost and regulatory concerns, the DOE continues to invest in active projects, with a total share of $1.0 billion out of $6.1 billion. Additionally, the DOE is collaborating with industry on 31 projects in the ICCS program to support R&D in industrial CCS and beneficial CO2 use. FutureGen 2.0 is DOE's comprehensive CCS demonstration project, with a DOE share of $1.422 billion out of $2.0 billion. The project includes capturing and separating CO2, compressing and transporting it, and injecting it into geologic formations. In October 2010, Phase 1 began with a Pre-FEED report, showing an estimated project cost increase to $1.65 billion. Cost reduction measures were implemented, including setting the plant gross output at 168 MW. In late 2011, Ameren announced the closure of its power plant in Meredosia, Illinois, and the discontinuation of its agreement with DOE for the FutureGen 2.0 project. The Alliance is now negotiating to purchase parts of the Meredosia Energy Center to continue project development, which includes capturing and storing CO2 underground. In late 2011, Ameren announced the closure of its power plant in Meredosia, Illinois, and the discontinuation of its agreement with DOE for the FutureGen 2.0 project. The project faced challenges with rising costs and negotiating a power purchasing agreement with Illinois. However, in December 2012, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved a power procurement plan requiring utilities to purchase electricity from FutureGen 2.0 for 20 years. This decision cleared a major hurdle for the project, allowing costs to be collected from the state's electric suppliers. DOE approved Phase 2 of the project in February 2013. In February 2013, DOE approved Phase 2 of the FutureGen 2.0 project, which involves final permitting and design activities before construction. Despite delays during redesign, FEED activities achieved a 70%-90% design completion, exceeding the industry standard. The final environmental impact statement was issued on October 25, 2013, proposing DOE funding of approximately $1 billion for project completion. EPA published a notice of availability on November 30, 2013, and DOE issued a notice on January 16, 2014. After obtaining approval from DOE for Phase 2 of the FutureGen 2.0 project in February 2013, the project faced delays in resolving issues with the power plant. Despite completing drilling and geologic analysis at the storage site in Morgan County, IL, challenges remain in securing private sector funding, purchasing the Meredosia power plant, and obtaining permission from DOE for further progress. The issuance of a favorable record of decision in January 2014 clears the last hurdle in the NEPA process, allowing the project to move forward pending approval of a permit for CO2 injection wells and meeting financial requirements. FutureGen faced increasing costs and challenges in purchasing the Meredosia power plant, obtaining DOE permission for retrofitting, and achieving 90% CO2 capture. The DOE restructured FutureGen in 2008 due to rising costs, postponing the program. FutureGen 2.0, announced in 2010, had an estimated cost of $1.3 billion with DOE covering 80% and industry partners 20%. Initially funded with $590 million from ARRA, the project awaited approval for Class VI well permits. The FutureGen 2.0 project received approximately $590 million in ARRA funds for a power plant retrofit and $459 million for a CO2 storage project. Total project costs are estimated at $1.65 billion, with construction projected to finish by 2017. The Alliance may face challenges due to rising construction costs and the need to spend nearly $995 million in ARRA funding before September 30, 2015. The FutureGen 2.0 Alliance has spent $73.97 million of the $994,729,000 ARRA funds as of October 2013. Construction is expected to start in spring or early summer of 2014, with a need to spend approximately $921 million over 19 months to exhaust all funding by September 2015. The DOE may allow the Alliance to accelerate cost-sharing to cover capital costs before using private funds. The DOE may require increased oversight over the FutureGen project to safeguard public investment and has the authority to suspend funding if progress is insufficient. The partnership between the federal government and the private sector in funding FutureGen has faced setbacks, with critics citing a lack of incentives for industry leaders to invest in clean coal technologies. Government investment and leadership in carbon capture technologies are deemed necessary according to a report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2007. Since the MIT report was published, Congress has allocated nearly $7 billion for CCS research and development, including FutureGen. However, without a carbon charge in place, private firms lack economic incentives for such projects. Ameren Corporation, a partner in the FutureGen 2.0 project, ceased operations at the Meredosia Energy Center due to compliance costs with EPA air pollution rules. DOE has also collaborated with industry on six other commercial-scale CCS projects through the Clean Coal Power Initiative program. The DOE's Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) program aimed to have five major CCS projects operational by 2016, but three industry partners have since pulled out. The EPA re-proposed a standard to limit CO2 emissions from new fossil-fueled power plants under the Clean Air Act. The EPA re-proposed a standard to limit CO2 emissions from new fossil-fueled power plants under the Clean Air Act. New natural gas-fired power plants can meet the standard without additional cost, while new coal-fired plants would need carbon capture technology to comply. The proposed standard allows for a seven-year compliance period for coal-fired plants, with a more stringent CO2 emissions limit. EPA published the re-proposed rule in the Federal Register, starting a 60-day public comment period. The EPA re-proposed a standard to limit CO2 emissions from new fossil-fueled power plants under the Clean Air Act. The final rule is expected after the public comment period ends. President Obama directed the EPA to issue proposed standards for existing plants by June 1, 2014. Congressional interest in the future of coal as an energy source is linked to the future of CCS. The history of CCS research at DOE and the FutureGen program raise questions about widespread CCS deployment in the US. The EPA re-proposed a rule to regulate GHG emissions from power plants, potentially requiring CCS technology. Congressional debate ensued on whether this rule would hinder new coal development. The effectiveness of the rule in promoting CCS deployment remains uncertain. Multiple analyses suggest that there will be retirements of U.S. coal-fired capacity, but coal will still play a significant role in electricity generation. The debate over EPA regulations focuses on whether CCS is the best emissions reduction system for coal plants. EPA cites ongoing CCS demonstration projects as justification for separate determination of BSER for coal-fired plants. The EPA noted that advanced coal-fired power plant projects justify a separate standard, while FutureGen 2.0 was not included in the proposed rule. The increase in natural gas supply has led to a shift in electricity production from coal to natural gas due to cost and abundance. The EPA re-proposed rule highlights that power companies are opting for natural gas over coal for electricity generation due to cost and regulations on CO2 emissions. This shift may impact the need for CCS demonstration projects like FutureGen. The EPA re-proposed rule aims to accelerate CCS development for coal-fired power plants despite the shift towards natural gas. EPA considers technology as a key factor in promoting CCS deployment, which some argue against citing concerns about technology demonstration and legal provisions. The Electricity Security and Affordability Act, introduced in 2014, imposed requirements on EPA before issuing greenhouse gas emission regulations. Congressional discussions focused on the adequacy of CCS technology in meeting Clean Air Act requirements and balancing energy sources with GHG emission reduction. The 109th and 110th Congresses focused on advancing carbon capture technologies to reduce CO2 emissions and mitigate global warming. Congress allocated funds for FutureGen, a project demonstrating the feasibility of using CCS technology. The Obama Administration revived FutureGen as FutureGen 2.0, sparking increased scrutiny of integrated CCS technology on a commercially viable scale. Rising costs remain a challenge for FutureGen 2.0 development. The challenges facing the development of FutureGen 2.0 include rising construction costs, project development issues, lack of private sector investment incentives, and time constraints. Despite commitments from Congress and the Obama Administration, questions persist about the project's success. The Congressional Budget Office highlighted the importance of reducing technical costs, ensuring CCS effectiveness, and implementing policies to incentivize industry adoption of high-cost demonstration technologies. Adoption of regulations, tax credits, or carbon pricing mechanisms could make CCS technology more competitive. If electricity from conventional power plants is used, CCS technology may become competitive for private sector investment. Industry might opt for natural gas or other low CO2 emitting sources over coal. The timeline below outlines the history of FutureGen since 2003."
