    "content": "President Bush decided not to use $5.1 billion in emergency spending allocated by Congress as part of a $28.9 billion FY2002 Supplemental Appropriation. This decision, announced on August 13, effectively acts as a \"pocket veto\" by the President. The funds that will not be utilized include money for DOD funding and veterans' medical care. The President decided not to use $5.1 billion in emergency spending allocated by Congress, including funds for DOD, veterans' medical care, foreign assistance, and HIV/AIDS funding. The decision changes policy priorities endorsed by Congress, with DOD losing $1 billion in contingency funds but maintaining a 56% share of total funding. The enacted appropriation of over $750 million had two-thirds designated as contingent emergency funds, with $1.9 billion allocated for security of infrastructure and personnel, two-thirds of which is contingent emergency money. Resources for preparedness and security purposes accounted for 9% of the cleared appropriation but now represent only 4% of available funds due to the President's decision not to use the contingent emergency funds. The FY2002 supplemental appropriation decreased from $28.9 billion to $23.9 billion, including funds for defense, foreign aid, New York, homeland security, and Pell grants. The FY2002 supplemental appropriation request for combating terrorism totaled $28.4 billion, with $14 billion allocated to the Department of Defense and $14.4 billion to other agencies. The request included funding for the war in Afghanistan, New York City, and airport security, with less emphasis on bioterrorism and investigative activities. Additionally, new funding proposals and policy provisions were included in foreign assistance. The FY2002 supplemental appropriation request included $14 billion for defense, mainly for the war in Afghanistan, security enhancements, munition stockpiles, and intelligence upgrades. The request also included provisions for granting new authorities to the Department of Defense to administer funds for foreign governments supporting the \"global war on terrorism.\" On the non-defense side, $5.5 billion was provided for additional aid. The request for the FY2002 supplemental appropriation included $5.5 billion in additional aid for New York City to fulfill the President's pledge for recovery from the terrorist attacks. The aid would be used for disaster recovery, rebuilding infrastructure, and community development. Additionally, $4.4 billion was requested for the Transportation Security Administration to upgrade aviation security. The Administration requested $28.4 billion for various purposes, with 49% going to the Department of Defense and the rest split among non-defense agencies. This funding would support ongoing war efforts in Afghanistan, homeland security activities, and stockpiling of munitions. The Administration's request includes funding for various agencies such as the Transportation Department, FEMA, HUD, and the Labor Department. Additionally, $1.6 billion is allocated for foreign assistance initiatives focused on countries involved in the war against terrorism. The Administration's February budget included $1.3 billion for Pell grants to be offset by rescissions in Labor, HHS funding. President Bush decided not to designate $5.1 billion in contingent emergency funding. The Administration had requested $1.3 billion for FY2002 supplemental Pell grants in its regular FY2003 budget submission. The FY2002 supplemental funding request included various activities related to homeland security and combating terrorism, as well as funds for election reform and HIV/AIDS. The funding proposal could be grouped into several major categories to identify significant policy priorities. The FY2002 supplemental funding request included activities for homeland security, terrorism response, election reform, and HIV/AIDS. The request prioritized defense, recovery, and infrastructure security, with increased funding for DOD compared to the FY2001 Emergency Terrorism Response supplemental. The FY2002 supplemental funding request prioritized defense, recovery, and infrastructure security, with increased funding for DOD compared to the FY2001 Emergency Terrorism Response supplemental. The second supplemental for FY2001 allocated resources for prosecuting the war, enhancing security at military bases, and investing in surveillance and reconnaissance, with a focus on aviation security and recovery needs of New York City. The second supplemental funding for FY2001 prioritized security assistance for front-line states cooperating with U.S. efforts to combat terrorism. Both the House and Senate proposed significant changes to the policy priorities and total funding amount, with the Senate bill allocating $31.5 billion, $3 billion higher than the Administration's request. The House and Senate proposed different policy choices and funding priorities in the second supplemental funding for FY2001. The House allocated 55% of the total funding for defense, $1.8 billion more than requested by the Administration, due to concerns about the cost of activating reservists. Both houses provided higher funding for security, including enhancing security at Department of Energy facilities and securing nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union. Both houses fully funded the Administration's request for recovery funds. Both the House and Senate allocated additional funds for international security assistance, with extra aid for Israel and the Palestinians. They also reduced funding for aid to dislocated workers. The Senate provided significantly more funding than the Administration and the House for homeland security activities, including bioterrorism preparedness and security measures. In the final version of the bill, Congress increased security funding threefold, allocating $1.8 billion for various agencies, including nuclear weapons, DOE facilities, international safeguard activities, the Coast Guard, and port security measures. They also provided additional funding for international security assistance and first responder programs, but reduced funding for victim relief by $400 million. Congress maintained a similar priority to the Administration for Defense. Congress accorded similar priority to Defense and aviation security as the Administration. Policy priorities are defined in the box \"Spending Category Definitions.\" Sources include the Administration request of March 21, 2002, and House and Senate reports. Table 2 shows policy priorities in the FY2002 Supplemental and the Emergency Terrorism Response Act. 'Other' spending includes VA medical care and election reform. The FY2002 Emergency Supplemental request was transmitted by President George Bush to Congress on March 21, 2002. The spending categories included in the request were defined in the box, with various versions of H.R. 4775 and reports from the House and Senate providing additional information. The total discretionary budget authority allocated for policy priorities may not add up due to rounding. President Bush's decision excludes $5.1 billion in emergency funding, including $1.1 billion for additional disability payments for veterans. The Administration's request for the Transportation Security Administration was reduced to $3.4 billion. Other funding includes election reform, HIV/AIDS/VA medical care, and disaster assistance. Sources: Letter from President George Bush to Speaker of the House, March 21, 2002. During congressional debate on the President's request for emergency supplemental spending of $28.4 billion, various issues arose regarding the amounts and composition. While there was support for defense requests, Congress made significant adjustments to the total amount and types of spending requested. Some Members offered amendments to add funding in different areas and raise the debt ceiling, but concerns were raised about increases above the total requested. During congressional debate on the President's request for emergency supplemental spending of $28.4 billion, Congress made significant adjustments to the total amount and types of spending requested. Concerns were raised about increases above the total requested. The House and Senate passed their versions of the bill, but agreement was not reached in the conference. The Administration expressed general agreement with the House version but opposed the overall spending level in the Senate bill and several policy provisions. The House passed a freestanding increase of $450 billion in the debt ceiling, matching the Senate's action earlier, resolving one of the issues that had deadlocked the conference. The President threatened to veto the supplemental if the total exceeded the House level of $28.8 billion. After returning from the July 4th recess, the conferees reached agreement on total spending. After the July 4th recess, conferees agreed on a $30.4 billion spending level, but the Administration opposed it, proposing cuts to reduce the total to $28.8 billion, including reductions in defense, transportation security, Pentagon renovation, AMTRAK, embassy security, and aid for Pakistan and Jordan. Administration also suggested savings from capping the airline emergency loan program. The Administration proposed $250 million in savings from unspent funds appropriated in the Emergency Terrorism Response supplemental. Senate appropriators developed a $28.8 billion package using some of the proposed cuts, which was rejected by the House Appropriations Chair. Congressional appropriators also rejected OMB's estimate of $1.1 billion in savings from the airline loan program. OMB Director Mitch Daniels stated that the Administration would veto any bill exceeding $28.8 billion, considering reducing the request to $18 billion. DOD Comptroller Dov Zakheim warned of potential cutbacks in operations without the supplemental. Senator Lott suggested shifting funds from other accounts to accommodate a smaller supplemental. Appropriators faced pressure to add $1 billion in funding. The House and Senate reached a spending compromise of $28.9 billion to combat wildfires, droughts, and floods. The bill was signed into law on August 2, with funding levels set between the House and Senate and including rescissions and offsets of about $3 billion. The conference version of the bill includes $14.5 billion for the Department of Defense, $6.7 billion for homeland security, $3.85 billion for the Transportation Security Administration, and various other funding allocations. The conference version of H.R. 4775 includes $175 million for the FBI, $5.5 billion for New York, $2.1 billion for foreign assistance and embassy security, and about $3 billion in savings and offsets. The controversial estimate of savings from halting the emergency loan program for airlines is not included. In the FY2002 supplemental bill, there is a provision where the President must accept all Congressional designations of non-defense funding as emergency in order to spend any of those funds. The funding is split into two parts: about $24 billion with the same emergency designation as the President's request, and about $5.1 billion designated as \"contingent emergency\" spending where the President can choose to designate all or none of the funding as emergency. If the President wants to spend any of the $5.1 billion, all of it must be designated as emergency funds. President Bush decided not to use the $5.1 billion contingent emergency funding allocated by Congress, resulting in a \"pocket veto\" of the funds. The funding included various allocations such as aid to Israel, aid for the Palestinians, election reform, AMTRAK, medical care for veterans, and international aid for HIV/AIDS/malaria and tuberculosis. Despite this decision, the Administration may still seek around $1 billion of the $5.1 billion. The Administration may seek about $1 billion of the $5.1 billion as an amended FY2003 appropriation request, including funds for Israel, the Palestinians, international HIV/AIDS, and the Transportation Security Agency. The President's request included some funding for certain programs, with amounts exceeding the request designated as contingent emergency spending. The conference version of H.R. 4775 bill also includes a change in the Highway Trust Fund Formula. The conference version of H.R. 4775 bill includes a change in the formula for highway spending, increasing funding by $4.4 billion. It does not address the $34 million for international family planning, which the Secretary of State decided not to provide to the UNFPA. The conferees made changes to the Rural Medicare formulas and textile trading preferences in the H.R. 4775 bill. They rejected provisions for more generous Medicare payments to rural doctors but closed a loophole benefiting South American exporters. The House passed the bill totaling $28.8 billion after markup. The House passed H.R. 4775 totaling $28.8 billion at 2:30 a.m. on the 24th by a vote of 280 to 138. The bill included $1 billion for Pell student financial assistance, $15.8 billion for defense, $5.8 billion for homeland security, and $1.6 billion for foreign assistance. The decrease in the total amount was due to changes in the scoring of savings for airline loans and the deletion of the proposal to end the grant program for airlines. The House passed H.R. 4775 totaling $28.8 billion, including $1.6 billion for foreign assistance. This funding includes $200 million for global HIV/AIDS, $200 million for Israel, and $50 million for Palestine. Additionally, $175 million was allocated for grants to first responders through the Justice Department. The Committee also agreed to move funds from the Office of Homeland Security to the Justice Department and dropped a proposal to double the tax on airline tickets. The House passed a bill totaling $28.8 billion, with funding for foreign assistance, global HIV/AIDS, Israel, and Palestine. Additional funds were allocated for grants to first responders through the Justice Department. The Committee included rescissions and offsets to offset $2 billion in non-emergency spending. Some fiscal conservatives were upset with the total bill exceeding the Administration's request, including an additional $1.8 billion for the Defense Department, which Secretary Rumsfeld said was not needed. The Rules Committee adopted a resolution setting overall spending levels for FY2003. The Rules Committee adopted a resolution setting overall spending levels for FY2003 at $759 billion as provided in the House budget resolution. Democratic members of the Budget Committee tried to attract moderate Republicans with a proposed floor amendment to couple an immediate increase in the debt ceiling with a new requirement for the President to submit a proposal to balance the budget by 2007. During floor debate, specific provisions were controversial, including adjustments in Medicare payments for hospitals and physicians in certain counties in New York and Pennsylvania, a revision of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, and a provision allowing the Postal Service to use the bypass mail system in Alaska. The Committee also adopted policy amendments, such as increasing funds for highways by voiding a $4.4 billion reduction required by current statute. The curr_chunk discusses potential controversy over increasing highway funding to the authorized level, specifically regarding the formula tying funding to revenues. It also addresses limiting DOD's responsibility for water use under the Endangered Species Act to its own installations. Some may argue this provision is unnecessary due to a recent court case in Arizona. The curr_chunk discusses the bill's revisions on reimbursing allies in the global war on terrorism and providing military aid to foreign nations. It also includes the original language giving sole discretion to the Secretary of Defense to reimburse key cooperating nations. The bill gave sole discretion to the Secretary of Defense to reimburse key cooperating nations, including Pakistan and Jordan, up to $420 million for logistical and military support in the global war on terrorism. It also exempted U.S. military forces participating in peacekeeping operations from prosecution in the International Criminal Court for war crimes. Additionally, the Committee softened controversial amendments during markup, including adopting report language opposing the cancellation of the Army's Crusader howitzer. The bill required the Administration to report by July 31 on releasing international family planning funds after investigating allegations of forced abortion in China. House debate included controversy over raising the debt ceiling indirectly without a direct vote. The House Concurrent Resolution 353, part of H.R. 4775, would guide appropriations committees with a total discretionary budget authority of $759 billion for FY2003. Some Members raised concerns about inadequate funding. The Senate version of the supplemental bill did not include similar provisions. The House version of the supplemental bill did not include \"deeming\" language and raised concerns about provisions benefiting specific areas or altering trade rules. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up the FY2002 emergency supplemental bill totaling $31.0 billion in discretionary budget authority, $2.2 billion above the House level and $2.6 billion above the request. Additional mandatory benefit payments to veterans were also included. The Senate passed H.R. 4775, a bill totaling $31.5 billion, after debates and amendments. The bill included increased funding for disability payments and differed significantly from the Administration's request and the House-passed bill in funding levels and policy language. The Senate debated significant issues during the conference on H.R. 4775, including the provision for emergency designation of spending. The provision required the President to designate all funds as \"emergency spending\" in order for them to be available, limiting the President's discretion in making such designations. This provision was opposed by the Administration and was not included in the House bill. The Senate proposed a provision for the confirmation of a Director for Homeland Security, which was not included in the House bill. Senator Byrd requested Tom Ridge to testify before congressional committees, but the Administration refused, stating Ridge's role as an advisor to the President. This provision became less controversial with the Administration's plan to establish a new cabinet-level Homeland Security agency. The Administration expressed concerns about the Senate bill's funding levels, particularly for homeland defense, which exceeded their request by $2.5 billion. There were significant differences in funding for various agencies and programs, including the Transportation Security Administration receiving $4.4 billion in S. 2551. The Senate bill, S. 2551, allocated $4.4 billion for the Transportation Security Administration, double the amount requested by the Administration. It also included $1 billion for First Responders, nearly $1 billion for Port Security and Coast Guard, additional funding for Bioterrorism and Water Safety, and increased funding for Nuclear Safety efforts. The House and Senate allocated $450 million for election reform with differing provisions. Both houses also increased funding for highways and Pell grants. The Senate debated S. 2551 on June 3 and 4, adopting an amendment to cap emergency loans after a terrorist attack. The Senate passed a cloture motion on June 4 to limit debate and amendments on a bill increasing to $31.5 billion. An amendment to set spending limits for 5 years and reinstitute budget enforcement mechanisms was rejected. Congress lacks overall spending targets for FY2003 due to the absence of a concurrent resolution on the budget. The Senate passed amendments increasing total spending in H.R. 4775 to $31.5 billion, including funding for HIV/AIDS, flood recovery, and removing the cap on the airline credit program. They also added the American Servicemembers' Protection Act to shield U.S. service members from the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction. The proposed legislation prohibits U.S. service members from participating in U.N. peacekeeping missions under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. The President can waive restrictions in the Act with reporting requirements. The U.S. signed the ICC Treaty but withdrew support in 2002. An amendment allows cooperation with the court for pursuing war criminals like Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. The funding issues in the bill were challenging to resolve, with discrepancies between the Senate and House levels. The House provided additional funding for the Department of Defense, which the Administration deemed unnecessary. The President had the authority to decide whether to spend the funds allocated on a \"contingent emergency\" basis. The House and Senate had differences in funding levels for homeland security activities, with the Senate bill including an additional $3 billion. The total funding discrepancy between the two bills was complicated by scoring differences between OMB and CBO. The House reported $28.8 billion, but using CBO's numbers, it would be $30.1 billion, closer to the Senate level. Congress generally uses CBO's estimates, but the House used higher OMB estimates for offsets. Conferees agreed on a total spending level of $30.4 billion after returning from the July 4th. The Administration objected to the total spending level of $30.4 billion and proposed cuts to reduce it to $28.8 billion, which was rejected by Congressional appropriators. The White House also threatened to veto the bill if the \"all or none\" provision in the Senate bill was included. The President would not have the prerogative to spend only some of the \"contingent emergency\" funds as stated in the bill. Both the President and Congress must agree that spending is emergency for funds to be exempt from budgetary controls. If Section 2002 is adopted, the President would no longer have the ability to select emergency spending, and all non-emergency spending must be offset by cuts in other programs. Senator Byrd mentioned a similar provision in the 2001 Supplemental. Some members suggested that the FY2002 supplemental should include budgetary controls on spending levels for FY2003 through FY2007 and an increase in the debt ceiling desired by the Administration. The House and Senate were $19 billion apart in total discretionary spending for FY2003. Negotiations are ongoing to resolve the $19 billion difference in total discretionary spending for FY2003 between the House and Senate. The House adopted placeholder language for conferees to include a debt ceiling increase. If the Senate's proposal to allocate $10 billion for non-defense spending is accepted, a supplemental request for war costs in FY2003 would be necessary. Reaching a common total for discretionary spending would facilitate the resolution of FY2003 appropriations bills. The Senate passed a $450 billion increase in the debt ceiling, resolving the issue. There was a $2.3 billion difference in recommended spending levels for the Transportation Department between the House and Senate. The Senate added more funding for the Coast Guard and aviation security, while the House included a cap on emergency airline loans. The Senate eliminated the cap, resulting in a $1 billion difference in funding between the two houses. The Senate bill provided $328 million, $80 million more than the House, for securing Department of Energy nuclear facilities and safeguarding nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union. Policy issues for conference included U.N. family planning assistance, with the Senate requiring release of $34 million to UNFPA for family planning activities if China is not engaging in coercive practices. The House and Senate bills differed on the role of the Department of Defense in administering military aid, with the Senate giving control to the State Department and the House giving control to DOD. The House also provided $100 million for reimbursing foreign governments for goods and services supporting U.S. operations against terrorism. The Senate bill did not include a provision for narrower restrictions on DOD's ability to cancel the Crusader program, which has sparked controversy in Congress and the White House threatening a veto. OMB Director Mitch Daniels reiterated the President's stance on vetoing any bill that restricts the cancellation of the Crusader artillery program. The Senate bill did not include language on the Crusader program, while the House version retained funding for it. The House and Senate differed in funding for first responders, with the Administration wanting FEMA to administer grants, while the House and Senate also allocated funds to the Department of Justice. The House and Senate allocated $450 million for election reform, with the House placing funds in the Executive Office of the President and the Senate in the Justice Department. Both houses disagreed on the administration of funds, with the House objecting to the Justice Department's involvement. Several policy areas showed agreement between the two bills. Both the House and Senate bills allocated $450 million for election reform, with disagreement on fund administration. They agreed on providing $250 million in foreign assistance split between Israel and Palestine, $200 million for HIV/AIDS, and included the American Servicemembers' Protection Act regarding the International Criminal Court. The U.S. requested $14 billion for the Department of Defense in the FY2002 emergency supplemental, with an additional $20.1 billion requested for FY2003 to continue the \"global war on terrorism.\" The funding includes support for the war and other initiatives. The FY2002 emergency supplemental for the Department of Defense requested $14 billion, with an additional $20.1 billion for FY2003 to continue the \"global war on terrorism.\" The funding includes support for increasing industrial capacity, purchasing smart munitions and unmanned aerial vehicles, erecting barriers for security, and providing support to allies. The FY2002 emergency supplemental for the Department of Defense requested $14 billion, with an additional $20.1 billion for FY2003 to continue the \"global war on terrorism.\" This funding includes support for various initiatives such as increasing industrial capacity, purchasing smart munitions, and retaining additional Air Force personnel needed for the war on terrorism. Other costs include setting up a new Homeland Commander in Chief, maintaining prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, and upgrading strategic missiles as part of DOD's proposed new nuclear policy. Unspecified costs in the FY2002 request also account for potential increases in fuel prices. DOD requested $11.3 billion to be appropriated to the Defense Emergency Response Fund for flexibility in responding to changes in the war in Afghanistan. Congress has concerns about the use of the DERF as it makes tracking emergency funds difficult. The remaining $2.7 billion would be in regular appropriation accounts requiring consultation with Congress for re-allocations. The Administration's proposal includes new authorities for DOD to dispense funds to nations aiding in the war on terrorism. Concerns were raised in appropriations hearings on foreign operations. The second emergency supplemental focuses on the war in Afghanistan and mobilizing reservists, with less emphasis on command, control, and communication programs. DOD also requests $20.1 billion in the DERF account for continued operations in the war on terrorism. The Administration's proposal includes $10 billion for the war on terrorism, with no details provided. An additional $10.1 billion is requested for various categories. The cost of military deployments in Afghanistan is estimated at $10.4 billion, with an additional $6.7 billion requested for the remainder of the year. The Department of Defense estimated that wartime military operations in 2002 would cost about $865 million per month, including resources for deploying and supporting units, operating equipment at a higher tempo, rotating forces, paying active duty forces at higher levels, and repairing equipment. This cost did not include expenses for activating reservists or replacing munitions expended during the war. The cost of the war in Afghanistan in the second half of FY2002 is estimated to be about $750 million per month, with potential to drop to $600 million per month if operations slow down. The difference between DOD and CBO's estimates is due to additional costs included in CBO's numbers, such as replacing munitions and activating reservists. The DOD's FY2002 supplemental request included $4.1 billion to pay for activated reservists for the last eight months of the year, assuming 80,000 reservists. Some Members of Congress expressed concern that this amount may not be enough for the current number of reservists on active duty. DOD assumed that the number of reservists would decrease as combat air patrols are reduced and guard duties at military installations are trimmed. Many activated reservists are currently serving as guards, but this number could be reduced as security enhancements are completed. Using civilians instead of military personnel could also help reduce costs. In the first emergency supplemental, DOD sought to reduce costs by using civilians instead of military personnel for security duties. They requested lifting the provision on contracting out security functions to use private guards, which would be more cost-effective. Additionally, DOD requested $2.6 billion in FY2003 to improve physical security at military installations, with the possibility of reservists no longer being used as guards. If approved, DOD would receive a total of $3.9 billion over two years for enhanced security measures. The DOD requested $4 billion for weapons and munitions in the ETR, FY2002 supplemental, and FY2003 request, including funding for JDAMs to increase production capacity. This funding also supports the increase in Global Hawk and Predator drones used for surveillance in Afghanistan. The DOD plans to increase missile production capacity to 2,800 missiles per month by August 2003, purchasing an additional 17,900 missiles. The military leadership believes doubling capacity in about a year is possible, dependent on funding. Expenditure rates for JDAMs have decreased as the war shifted towards surveillance. DOD's FY2002 request includes replacing drones and accelerating Predator UAV production. The DOD plans to increase missile production capacity to 2,800 missiles per month by August 2003. They also plan to purchase additional Predator UAVs with funds from the first emergency supplemental and the FY2003 budget. If approved, DOD would receive an additional $11.2 billion for command, control, communications, and classified programs to combat terrorism. Many of these programs are classified, with little visibility on the details. The DOD requested $2.6 billion for classified programs and $540 million for continuity of operations. Additionally, up to $550 million was allocated for Coalition Support, with $420 million for countries providing military support in the war on terrorism. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $15.808 billion for the Department of Defense. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $15.808 billion for the Department of Defense, an increase of $1.786 billion. The additional funds were requested as contingent emergency funds, with the President having the final say on their necessity. The committee also allocated $378.4 million for Department of Energy defense-related activities, an increase of $352 million, and $30 million for military construction, despite no initial request for these funds. The majority of the defense funding was provided in the Defense Emergency Response Fund to allow flexibility in allocation. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $15.808 billion for the Department of Defense, with additional funds allocated for reserve mobilization costs and additional support in the Defense Emergency Response Fund. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld opposed the extra funds for reserve mobilization, but the committee made changes to the bill to address this issue. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $15.808 billion for the Department of Defense, with additional funds allocated for reserve mobilization costs and support in the Defense Emergency Response Fund. Additional funding includes $604 million for counter-terrorism operations, $117 million for Army overseas operations, $100 million for chemical demilitarization, $36.5 million for F-15 radio upgrades, $20 million for chemical-biological weapons detection research, $30 million for classified projects, $30.5 million for military construction projects, $125 million for security at nuclear weapons facilities, $128 million for security at Corps of Engineers facilities, $5 million for international non-proliferation measures, $67 million for security at environmental cleanup sites, and $16.6 million for facility security. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $15.808 billion for the Department of Defense, with additional funds allocated for various operations and security measures. The Committee revised controversial provisions proposed by the Administration, reducing funding for support to indigenous forces and foreign nations in the global war on terrorism to $100 million. Approval from the Appropriations Committees is now required for such funding. The bill also limited reimbursements for support by foreign nations of U.S. military forces. The Senate approved $14.0 billion in funding for the Department of Defense, with $11.3 billion allocated to the Defense Emergency Response Fund for war-related costs. The House provided additional funds for operating expenses and activating reservists, making the overall funding level a conference item. The Senate included different language than the House or Administration regarding aid provision to nations assisting the U.S. The Administration sought $1.28 billion in additional FY2002 Foreign Operations funding to increase economic, military, and counter-terrorism assistance to \"front-line\" states in the war on terrorism. The United States has prioritized assistance to over 20 nations globally that have committed to helping in the war on terrorism. Congress finalized $1.8 billion more in foreign aid funding, exceeding the Administration's request by over $500 million. The Congress approved $1.8 billion in foreign aid funding, surpassing the Administration's request by over $500 million. The President allocated $1.5 billion for Foreign Operations programs from the emergency terrorism supplemental approved after September 11. However, due to the President's decision not to spend contingent emergency funds, $622 million will not be available. This affects aid to Israel, Palestine, Afghanistan, refugees, and the Philippine military. The White House allocated $50 million for Afghanistan aid and refugee relief, $174 million for Philippine military aid, and $30 million for international HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. President Bush may seek additional aid for Israel, the Palestinians, and HIV/AIDS through congressional approval. The $1.28 billion foreign aid supplemental aimed to address new terrorism threats and received criticism for not adequately addressing the issue. The $1.5 billion emergency aid focused on economic support for Afghanistan and neighboring countries, as well as stabilizing security in Pakistan. The proposed $1.28 billion supplemental would provide economic and military assistance to 23 countries worldwide. Initial congressional reaction was critical. The $1.28 billion supplemental budget proposal for FY2003 faced initial congressional criticism for being inadequate in the war on terrorism. It included significant aid for key front-line states like Jordan, Pakistan, and India, while aid for other countries would only see modest increases. The proposal also allocated funds for Afghanistan, with $250 million for economic, military, and counter-narcotics support. The supplemental budget proposal for FY2003 includes $1.28 billion in economic, military, and counter-narcotics support for various countries. This includes $297 million for reconstruction needs, $80 million for Bahrain, Oman, and Yemen, $40 million for the Philippines, $55 million for Africa, $135 million for Central Asia, $228 million for Turkey, and $35 million for Colombia. Table 6 provides details on country and program distributions in the supplemental request. The FY2002 supplemental budget earmarks funds for specific countries and programs, with a requirement for the Administration to report to Congress on fund allocations. The table excludes rescissions totaling $269 million for Foreign Operations programs. The President's decision not to spend designated \"contingent emergency\" funds may impact availability. The supplemental request includes provisions affecting military aid distribution, assistance to Colombia, and conditions for foreign aid transfer. The FY2002 supplemental budget includes provisions for military aid distribution, assistance to Colombia, and conditions for foreign aid transfer. The State Department oversees funding for U.S. military assistance programs, with DOD administering activities under State Department guidance. The Administration proposed granting DOD authority to use funds for combating terrorism and supporting foreign government efforts. A total of $130 million from defense funds would be directed by the Secretary of Defense. The FY2002 supplemental budget includes provisions for military aid distribution, assistance to Colombia, and conditions for foreign aid transfer. A third provision proposed $420 million in DOD Operation and Maintenance funding for payments to Pakistan, Jordan, and other cooperating states for logistical and military support provided to U.S. military operations in the war on terrorism. Critics raised concerns about potential infringement on congressional oversight and the State Department's role in foreign aid policy. The request aims to remove human rights conditions for U.S. security assistance. Deputy Secretary of State Armitage criticized the legislation's broad scope and pledged to work with Congress to protect the Secretary of State's foreign policy prerogatives. Additionally, there were efforts to broaden DOD and State Department authorities to utilize unspent funds for Plan Colombia. The provision would broaden significantly the scope of how U.S. assistance could be used by Colombia - not only for counter narcotics operations, but also for military actions against Colombian insurgents and any other circumstances that threatened Colombian national security. This change would allow helicopters and other military equipment provided over the past two years to fight drug production to be used against any threat to Colombia's security. The U.S. administration did not request Congress to soften two Colombia aid restrictions, including a 400 person limit on U.S. personnel and aid to Colombian military units involved in human rights violations. They are not seeking to remove other conditions on Colombian aid related to human rights and aerial coca fumigation. Critics argue that the U.S. focus in Colombia is shifting towards counter-terrorism and insurgency. The Administration's supplemental submission to Congress requested most economic and military aid funds to be provided without restrictions, a rare move for foreign aid appropriations. Congress has been hesitant to enact such waivers without fully understanding the implications of excluding aid restrictions. The Administration requested aid funds without restrictions, but Congress prefers specific waivers over across-the-board ones. Impediments apply to Afghanistan, Yemen, Ethiopia, and Cote d'Ivoire due to debt payments and a military coup. Congressional action increased foreign aid funding but limited policy provisions and waivers sought by the White House. Additional funding for global HIV/AIDS was added, while a Senate provision on U.S. contributions to the U.N. was dropped. The supplemental bill passed by Congress includes $1.8 billion in new Foreign Operations funds, with additional allocations for Israel, the Palestinians, and combatting HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Congress recommended using $100 million for the Global Fund to Combat HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, cutting in half the President's pledged amount for his initiative in FY2002. The supplemental bill passed by Congress includes increased aid for Afghanistan for reconstruction and security support, with the House adding $120 million and the Senate adding roughly $110 million above the President's request. The conference agreement does not specify a set amount for Afghanistan due to contingent emergency funds. Additionally, the Senate bill allocated $15 million for an international exchange program for students from countries with large Muslim populations, with the total set at $10 million in the conference agreement. The conference agreement for the supplemental bill sets the total at $10 million, with no specific country allocations. The bill directs the executive branch to report on allocations within 30 days. Policy changes include removing certain provisos and waiving the \"Brooke amendment\" for debt payments. The bill allows Colombia to use American foreign aid for anti-narcotics, anti-terrorist, and humanitarian operations, with current restrictions remaining in place. The bill adds new requirements for the Colombian President regarding human rights, military reforms, and financial commitments. Congress denied DOD's request for $30 million to support indigenous forces combating terrorism but approved $390 million for payments to Pakistan, Jordan, and other cooperating states for military support. The law requires notification to Congressional committees 15 days in advance of any reimbursements for goods or services in support of U.S. military operations. The House approved $100 million for foreign government efforts to fight global terrorism, with limited transfers for reimbursements only. The White House has held U.S. contributions to the UN Population Fund due to allegations of coercive family planning practices in China. The House approved $100 million for foreign government efforts to fight global terrorism, with limited transfers for reimbursements only. UNFPA would become ineligible for American contributions if found involved in coercive family planning practices in China. Congress provided $34 million for UNFPA in FY2002, with ongoing debate on its eligibility. A State Department investigation team visited China to assess UNFPA's practices. Amendments were made regarding the transfer of funds to UNFPA based on investigation outcomes. The House approved $100 million for foreign government efforts to fight global terrorism, with limited transfers for reimbursements only. UNFPA would become ineligible for American contributions if found involved in coercive family planning practices in China. The Senate bill included language similar to the Lowey/Kolbe text, which would terminate U.S. support if UNFPA is involved in coercive practices. The President could reduce the U.S. contribution to less than $34 million to express displeasure over alleged coercive family practices in China and UNFPA's involvement. The White House strongly opposed the Senate language, and conferees decided to drop all UNFPA language from the final bill, leaving the decision up to the President. The White House decided to withhold a $34 million transfer following the removal of UNFPA language from the final bill, leaving the decision to the President. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was established in 2001 to oversee transportation security, including airport security. The ATSA may collect fees from passengers and air carriers to fund aviation security enhancements. Controversy surrounds the TSA's ability to meet new security requirements post-terrorist attacks. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act enacted new security requirements post-terrorist attacks, including screening all individuals and replacing contract screeners with federal workers by November 19, 2002. Questions arise about funding adequacy, estimating workforce size, equipment mix for baggage screening, and airport reimbursement for security costs. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandated new security measures post-terrorist attacks, including replacing contract screeners with federal workers by November 19, 2002. Funding concerns arise as fees may not cover the costs of enhanced security measures. The Administration requested emergency appropriations for TSA in FY2002 and FY2003, with concerns about funding approval, deployment deadlines, workforce size, and request adequacy. Some appropriators criticized the $1.9 billion contingent emergency fund proposal for lacking cost details. The Transportation Security Administration's request for emergency appropriations faced criticism for lacking cost details. The agency is uncertain about the number and type of explosive detection systems needed, as well as the total workforce required. One option being considered is a large machine using computed tomography technology, costing $1 million each but requiring fewer screeners compared to a smaller, cheaper machine. The Transportation Security Administration is uncertain about the number and type of explosive detection systems needed, as well as the total workforce required. One option being considered is a large machine using computed tomography technology, costing $1 million each but requiring fewer screeners compared to a smaller, cheaper machine. The new requirements could lead to an additional 25,000 to 30,000 employees needed for aviation security, with estimates suggesting the number of TSA employees could reach 70,000. The cost of reconfiguring airports to make use of the explosive detection systems is estimated at $2 billion, with uncertainties about who would pay for this additional cost and whether enough machines can be manufactured in time to meet the deadline. The House Appropriations Committee reduced funding for the Transportation Security Administration by $550 million to $3.9 billion in response to the Administration's request for $4.4 billion in emergency supplemental funding for TSA. The committee also removed a provision to double the tax on airline tickets and instead cut an additional $150 million from the funding. The supplemental funding included $630 million for explosive detection systems, $850 million for airport remodeling, and $75 million for port security enhancements. The House reduced funding for the Transportation Security Administration by $550 million to $3.9 billion in response to the Administration's request for $4.4 billion. The Senate provided the full amount and expressed concerns about privacy implications of TSA's decisions. Additionally, the Senate allocated $200 million for port security initiatives, bringing the total to nearly $300 million in FY2002. President Bush pledged $21.5 billion in aid to New York City for recovery from the 9/11 attacks, meeting his earlier commitment of over $20 billion. This was in response to concerns raised during Senate debate about emergency loans to airlines and the Emergency Terrorism Response supplemental funding. The Administration requested $20 billion for disaster recovery activities related to the 9/11 attacks, with $5.5 billion allocated for aid to New York City in the FY2002 emergency supplemental. FEMA received $3.1 billion, with $2.75 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) administered by FEMA is used to help communities recover and rebuild after major disasters. A total of $9 billion would be allocated for disaster assistance, with most funds released to New York City within two months of the attack. However, a report stated that the city's economy would sustain a gross loss of approximately $83 billion due to the attack. The Stafford Act limits FEMA assistance to individuals, families, state and local governments, and non-profit organizations. Some argue for amending the Act to include for-profit enterprises, while others prefer relying on other federal programs. The Administration requested $750 million for the Community Development Block Grant program to assist utilities and businesses affected by the September attacks. The Community Development Block Grant program provides funds for disaster recovery efforts, giving state and local governments flexibility in their use. Congress has waived program requirements to support disaster recovery, such as aiding utilities after disasters like the Oklahoma City bombing and the New England ice storm. New York City received $2.7 billion in CDBG funding for disaster recovery after the 2001 terrorist attacks. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) is set to administer $750 million in additional CDBG assistance for disaster recovery activities related to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The funds will be used to assist individuals, non-profits, and small businesses in recovering from economic losses. Additionally, $1.8 billion in transportation grant funds were included in the Administration's FY2002 emergency supplemental for rebuilding Manhattan's infrastructure. The FY2002 emergency supplemental included $1.8 billion for rebuilding Manhattan's public mass transit and $167 million for road repairs. FEMA funds can only be used for debris removal and subway repairs, not for system modernization. New York officials proposed a $7.3 billion plan to modernize Lower Manhattan's transportation system, which may require a mix of FEMA funds and other sources. Congress faced pressure to allocate additional funds to support these plans. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $5.5 billion in aid to New York City as requested, with $175 million for first responder support to the Department of Justice instead of FEMA. The Senate also provided the full aid amount and additional funding may be available for first responder grants. The Administration proposed $750 million for dislocated workers. The Committee reduced the proposed $750 million assistance for dislocated workers to $300 million. $190 million would be for National Emergency Grants linking high-growth sectors with training programs. The House bill provided $300 million aid, limited to specific grants with no funding for demonstration programs. The Senate bill provided $400 million aid, with some funding for demonstration projects. The Senate bill allocated $400 million in aid, targeting assistance to states affected by changes in award formulas and those who have spent most of their funds. The total provided was $350 million below the requested amount. Tables detail the $27.1 billion FY2002 emergency supplemental allocation. The Administration requested $1.3 billion in supplemental funding for FY2002 Pell grants, with equal offsets from reductions in funds added by Congress to Labor, HHS, and the Department of Education. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocated $1 billion for Pell grants with no offset. The FY2002 Supplemental funding included $1.1 billion for veterans' disability payments. Congress extended fund availability for FY2002 in certain accounts. Emergency and contingent emergency spending, rescissions, and offsets were included in the total funding. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocated funds for various purposes, including Pell grants and veterans' disability payments, with emergency and contingent emergency spending, rescissions, and offsets included in the total funding. About $5 billion in H.R. 4775 is designated as contingent emergency funding, with the President required to decide within thirty days whether to designate this as emergency funding. The $5 billion in H.R. 4775 is designated as emergency funding, with $2.9 billion in non-emergency funding offset by rescissions. The funding purposes are based on conference action and include categories developed by CRS. Funding for similar purposes was also provided by the Emergency Terrorism Response supplemental. Table A-2 shows the funding and share of the total for each category in FY2002. The Defense Emergency Response Fund allows DOD to transfer funds without normal reprogramming requirements. The Administration requested a $1.276 billion increase in Pell grants in FY2002, offsetting congressional increases in the Department of Education. The Administration's request for funding for election reform was submitted on March 21, 2002. The House Appropriations Committee proposes that the funding be appropriated to OMB for transfer to other agencies once authorizing legislation is enacted. President George Bush's letter to Speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert, transmits the FY2002 Emergency Supplemental request.
