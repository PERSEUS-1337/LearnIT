Minimum standards for equipment, technology, procedures, personnel, and methods will be set by the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security. The Assistant Secretary will set standards for air cargo screening to ensure security levels similar to passenger checked baggage screening. Coordination with other air cargo security programs will be ensured, and contracts with nongovernmental entities can be made for screening. Additionally, an air cargo screening fee will be implemented. The Assistant Secretary will impose a uniform fee for air cargo screening to cover costs such as personnel salaries, training, and other related expenses.
