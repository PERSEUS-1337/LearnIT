The Fort Presque Isle National Historic Site Act of 2008 designates Fort Presque Isle in Erie, Pennsylvania as a historic site. General Anthony Wayne, a Revolutionary War hero, was associated with the area in 1786. Legend has it that he was nicknamed \"Mad\" by his troops. The original blockhouse of Fort Presque Isle was built in 1795 by 200 Federal troops under General Wayne's army. General Wayne died at the fort in 1796 and was buried there. The original blockhouse burned in 1852, and the current structure was built. The existing blockhouse at Fort Presque Isle was reconstructed in 1880 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a memorial to General Wayne. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission has recognized it as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.
