    "content": "The \"Family and Medical Leave Clarification Act\" is the short title of the Act, with references made to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. The table of contents includes sections on definitions, intermittent leave, request for leave, substitution of paid leave, regulations, and effective date. The Act also includes findings. The Congress acknowledges that the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 is not functioning as intended due to broad regulations causing compliance issues for employers, leading to increased costs, productivity loss, and administrative challenges. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 has compliance issues for employers, conflicts with existing sick leave policies, and results in most leave becoming paid. The Commission on Leave failed to identify many compliance problems due to conducting the study too soon after the Act's enactment.

New regulations must be proposed within 90 days and finalized within 180 days. Transition rules apply to leave requests made before the final regulations take effect. Before the final regulations take effect, employers can rely on the Secretary of Labor's regulations from paragraph (1). These regulations cannot be used as evidence of non-compliance in any pending enforcement actions. SEC. 4. INTERMITTENT LEAVE. Amended to allow intermittent leave in increments of up to one-half of a work day as certified by a health care provider. Employers may require employees to take leave for the duration of work or duty assignments if unable to accommodate intermittent leave requests. SEC. 5. REQUEST FOR LEAVE. Section 102(a) (29 U.S.C. 2612(a)) is amended to allow employers to require timely requests for leave under this title, with consequences for failure to do so. Timeliness is defined for foreseeable leave as providing advance notice and submitting a written application within 5 working days. Employees must notify their employer verbally of the need for unforeseeable leave when it commences and submit any required written application within 5 working days. The 5-day period can be extended if the employee is unable to provide notice or submit the application due to physical or mental incapacity. SEC. 6. SUBSTITUTION OF PAID LEAVE. Employers can require employees to choose between paid absence provided under certain agreements or plans and unpaid leave under this title. SEC. 7. REGULATIONS. SEC. 7. REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Labor must review and revise regulations to implement the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 within 6 months of this Act's enactment. Compliance with previous regulations before the effective date of the revised regulations will be considered full compliance with the Act. The Secretary cannot enforce regulations in effect before the Act's effective date. SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE. The amendments made by this Act will take effect 180 days after its enactment."
