    "content": "Paraguay, a landlocked country in South America, has a population of close to 7 million and a turbulent political history marked by authoritarian leadership and corruption. The country lost territory and population in the War of the Triple Alliance and experienced political instability, including a long military dictatorship under General Alfredo Stroessner. The conservative Colorado Party has dominated politics, but in 2008, Fernando Lugo, a former Roman Catholic Bishop, was elected from a coalition of centrist and leftist opposition parties. Fernando Lugo, a former Catholic Bishop, was elected as Paraguay's president in 2008 with the support of centrist and leftist opposition parties. His presidency marked the first peaceful transfer of power from the dominant Colorado Party. However, Lugo faced challenges in governing effectively and was impeached in 2012 after a violent clash between farmers and police. His impeachment trial, lasting less than 24 hours, was met with skepticism from regional countries. After Fernando Lugo's impeachment in 2012, Paraguay was viewed with skepticism by regional countries. His vice president, Frederico Franco, succeeded him, leading to Paraguay's suspension from Mercosur. In 2013, Horacio Cartes, a newcomer to politics, was elected president with 46% of the vote. Under Cartes, Paraguay was readmitted to Mercosur and UNASUR. President Cartes has implemented a conditional cash transfer program to address poverty in Paraguay, facing political resistance from opposition parties. Despite challenges, Paraguay passed a law on public-private partnerships in late 2013. Paraguay passed a law on public-private partnerships in late 2013 to promote private investment in infrastructure. President Cartes advocates for PPPs to attract foreign investment for long-term growth. The Colorado Party, to which Cartes belongs, is divided in its support for him, with some opposing his policies and appointments. In the 2015 local elections, the party lost several mayoralties, showing internal factionalism. The Colorado Party in Paraguay is divided between traditionalists and Cartistas, who support President Cartes' technocratic approach. This division has hindered the implementation of the PPP law, leading to delays in infrastructure projects. The Paraguayan comptroller-general halted a major PPP project at the capital's airport due to inadequate vetting of the Spanish company Sacyr. The economic growth achieved during the Cartes Administration in Asunci\u00f3n is praised by some in the Colorado Party, forming a coalition (Honor Colorado faction) to support the president. They urged Cartes to run for reelection despite it being prohibited by the constitution. Cartistas approached Frente Guasu to push for a constitutional amendment allowing for reelection. In late 2016, a push for reelection amendment in Paraguay led to rioting in Asunci\u00f3n and the burning of parts of the parliament building. Cartes convinced factions of the largest opposition party to support the initiative, resulting in a secret vote in favor of reelection. In response to the rioting in Asunci\u00f3n, President Cartes announced he would not seek reelection. The Chamber of Deputies rejected the bill to amend the constitution. Finance Minister Santiago Pe\u00f1a and the governor of Itap\u00faa announced their intention to run for the Colorado Party ticket in the upcoming elections. President Cartes is expected to endorse this ticket if it wins the primary. Former president Lugo and President Cartes have also hinted at potential candidacy. Former president Lugo and President Cartes may seek Senate seats in the 2018 legislative elections to retain influence. The rejection of the referendum for reelection raises questions about the Cartista wing of the Colorado Party in the upcoming presidential race. The PLRA, or Liberal Party, is also divided, and the country is experiencing rural-urban disparities and political activism among the younger generation. Paraguay's economy heavily relies on commodities, with agriculture contributing 20% to GDP. In 2012, economic growth contracted due to a drought and foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. However, in 2013, GDP grew by 14.2%, the highest in Latin America. Growth rates fluctuated in the following years, with forecasts predicting growth between 3.2% and 4% in the future. Paraguay's economy is forecasted to grow between 3.2% and 4% in the coming years, which is strong regionally. The country has a dominant agricultural sector, struggling industrial sector, and a large informal economy. Lower demand from Brazil, China, and Russia has affected exports. The government plans to utilize its renewable energy resources for industrial development, including hydropower from dams co-built with Brazil and Argentina. Despite being relatively poor, Paraguay has seen growth. Paraguay has seen significant economic growth despite challenges. Poverty levels decreased from 60% in 2001 to 22.6% in 2014. The country is characterized as an upper-middle-income nation but still faces high income inequality and concentrated land distribution. The government is open to foreign investment and aims to modernize infrastructure. Paraguay is seeking full membership in the Pacific Alliance to attract more outside investment and diversify trade. President Cartes is focused on expanding economic opportunities and increasing international trade. President Cartes focused on expanding economic opportunities and increasing international trade. He secured a favorable trade deal with Taiwan in July 2017, strengthening bilateral ties. Paraguay also signed a trade agreement with the United States in January 2017. Despite challenges like corruption and smuggling, Paraguay has made progress in combating these issues. In 2016, Paraguay improved its ranking in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index by 20 places. Anti-corruption protests have emerged in response to scandals related to nepotistic practices and mismanagement. The Paraguayan attorney general opened a case against former President Franco in 2016 for allegations of money laundering and illicit enrichment. Climate issues and commodity market fluctuations will continue to impact the Paraguayan economy. Severe flooding in 2014 and 2015 displaced 40,000 people in Asunci\u00f3n, partly due to El Ni\u00f1o. In 2016 and 2017, severe wind storms and tornadoes plagued Paraguay, displacing 40,000 people in Asunci\u00f3n. The United States has supported Paraguay's democracy and modernization efforts, providing $8.6 million in foreign assistance in 2016. The assistance focused on combating corruption, favoritism, and fostering sustainable agricultural practices. The Trump Administration's budget request for FY2018, however, may impact future aid to Paraguay. In the Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request, development assistance for Paraguay was reduced to $400,000 to professionalize the military and strengthen border security. The Peace Corps program in Paraguay had 220 volunteers in FY2016, projected to decrease to 210 volunteers with a budget of $4.9 million in FY2017 and FY2018. Concerns about illegal activities in the Tri-Border Area (TBA) include money laundering, drug trafficking, and official corruption. Paraguay faces challenges with official corruption, poor interagency cooperation, and threats from smuggling routes and porous borders. The U.S. supports Paraguay through programs like the Antiterrorism Assistance program and Human Rights Initiative to improve border control and combat criminal activities in the Tri-Border Area. Paraguay is vulnerable to criminal activities in the Tri-Border Area (TBA), with domestic terrorism primarily carried out by groups like the Paraguayan People's Army (EPP) and the Armed Peasant Association. The State Department's 2016 terrorism report highlights ongoing challenges in the TBA, emphasizing cooperation with Brazil and Argentina on counterterrorism efforts. Paraguay faces challenges with criminal activities in the Tri-Border Area, including domestic terrorism by groups like the EPP. The country is a major transit point for illegal drugs, with weak law enforcement due to corruption and limited resources. Drug traffickers exploit porous borders and waterways, making Paraguay a significant hub for drug trafficking. Paraguay has increased efforts to combat drug trafficking, with support from the Cartes Administration and the Paraguayan Congress. Budget increases were approved for counternarcotics agencies in 2014 and 2015. In 2016, authorities captured members of Mexican drug organizations trying to establish trafficking routes for Colombian cocaine. A major trafficker, Jorge Rafaat Toumania, was killed in 2016, leaving behind a network of marijuana and cocaine trafficking that raised concerns among Paraguayan authorities. In 2016, the U.S. government sponsored training events to help Paraguay combat money laundering linked to drug trade, terrorist financing, and arms trafficking. Paraguay faces challenges like weak financial controls, porous borders, bearer bonds, and official corruption. Progress was made in increasing convictions for money laundering prosecutions. President Cartes adopted a more aggressive approach to intellectual property enforcement. However, recent incidents have raised doubts about the government's ability to combat illegality. In Ciudad del Este, 60 armed men stole $40 million from a Spanish security firm, leading President Cartes to call on Paraguay's military for help. The robbery was linked to the Brazilian criminal gang, First Capital Command. Despite some money being recovered and arrests made, the porous border area of the TBA raises concerns about the government's ability to combat illegality and corruption. The disparity in taxation between Brazil and Paraguay creates a lucrative black market for selling cigarettes, with only 10% of Paraguay's production being sold legally. In June 2017, a Paraguayan man was charged in federal court in Miami with conspiring to smuggle cocaine through the Ciudad del Este airport with the intent to sell it in the United States. The individual charged had been extradited to the United States by the Paraguayan government on suspicion of using drug trafficking to raise funds for a Hezbollah network. Paraguay remains a \"Tier 2\" country according to the State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report 2017, being a source, destination, and transit country for sex trafficking and forced labor. The Cartes Administration in Paraguay has faced opposition but has promoted policies to encourage foreign investment, economic stability, and transparency. Despite historically low tax burdens, political stability remains uncertain due to land ownership issues and protests. The economy is projected to grow by 4.3% in 2017, with economic policies likely to remain consistent regardless of the winning party. The outcome of the April 2018 presidential race in Paraguay is unlikely to bring significant changes in economic policies, regardless of whether a Colorado Party ticket or an opposition party candidate wins."
