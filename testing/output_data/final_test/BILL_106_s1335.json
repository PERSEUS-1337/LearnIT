    "content": "AUTHORITY TO EXPAND AND EXTEND MEDICARE SUBVENTION DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR MILITARY RETIREES; INFORMATION REGARDING MEDICARE+CHOICE AND MEDIGAP PROTECTIONS. The Social Security Act is amended to allow for the expansion and extension of a demonstration project benefiting medicare-eligible military retirees and dependents if certain requirements are met. The expansion and extension of the demonstration project for medicare-eligible military retirees and dependents must occur between July 1, 1999, and January 1, 2000. If the administering Secretaries decide to expand and extend the project, they can increase the number of sites from 6 to 15 and jointly designate additional sites after reviewing all TRICARE regions. The administering Secretaries may extend the duration of the demonstration project by 1 or 2 years, but only if they expand the project to include at least 7 sites. They must also revise the operating agreement within 30 days of deciding to expand and extend the project. The administering Secretaries can expand and extend the demonstration project by revising the agreement and submitting it to Congress. The revised agreement must include a detailed rationale for the expansion and extension. The administering Secretaries have the authority to expand the number of demonstration project sites and revise the maximum reimbursement amount for calendar year 2000. If the project duration is extended beyond 2000, the reimbursement amount for that year will be adjusted accordingly. The administering Secretaries have the authority to revise the maximum reimbursement amount for the demonstration project, with the amount not exceeding a determined appropriate limit. If the project duration is extended, the Comptroller General will continue evaluations and reports as required, with the final report due within 6 months. The administering Secretaries will provide information on Medicare +Choice and Medigap protections to medicare-eligible military retirees and dependents in the demonstration project. This information must be given within 6 months after the project ends. The demonstration project no longer allows participation, and applicable statutory protections include open enrollment periods for Medicare+Choice plans and enrollment protections for Medicare supplemental policies. The submission date for the report on the extension and expansion of the project has been changed. The submission date for the report on the extension and expansion of the project has been changed to January 1, 2001. Additional provisions are added for expansion and extension beyond the original demonstration project."
