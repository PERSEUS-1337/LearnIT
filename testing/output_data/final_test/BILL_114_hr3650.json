    "content": "The \"State National Forest Management Act of 2015\" includes sections on short title, definitions, state selection of National Forest System portions, transition provisions, and miscellaneous duties related to transfer. The Act defines key terms such as \"Commissioner\" as the head of the Department of Natural Resources of a State, \"eligible portions of the National Forest System\" as the surface and subsurface lands owned by the United States, and \"Federal obligation\" as any duty of the Forest Service arising from leases or permits. The term \"forest operations\" refers to developing forest operating plans for National Forest System areas, including timber resource inventories and necessary access engineering. The term \"patent date\" is defined as the last day of the selection-transition period, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the relevant department. The term \"selection-transition period\" is defined as the period starting from the selection date when a State elects to acquire portions of the National Forest System, ending no more than one year later on the patent date. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service. The term \"State\" includes all States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The term \"State forest practices law\" refers to laws governing forest management on State or privately owned forest land. The term \"State obligation\" refers to obligations or duties of the State related to selected lands under this Act, such as leases, permits, licenses, and contracts. State selection of eligible portions of the National Forest System for acquisition and management is outlined in Section 3. During a 10-year period, a State can elect to select and acquire eligible portions of the National Forest System by enacting a law through its legislature. The Secretary will then convey the selected portions to the State, subject to valid existing rights. The State can acquire eligible portions of the National Forest System through purchase, exchange, or land selection rights, subject to valid existing rights and acceptance of specified procedures. Acceptance by the State of Alaska of rights and obligations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act regarding acquired lands shall not be infringed. Up to 50% of annual timber harvest from eligible National Forest System portions to be acquired must be offered in 10-year contracts, meeting wood processing operation needs and complying with State forest practices law. During the selection period, a State can enact multiple laws to acquire National Forest System lands, not exceeding 2,000,000 acres. The Secretary will prepare patents for the State's selected lands for conveyance. The Secretary will prepare and convey patents for National Forest System lands selected by the State, with the conveyance being a ministerial duty. The United States Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction to compel actions necessary for conveyance. Additionally, the Secretary will convey all other types of property used for operating and administering the National Forest System. The Secretary will transfer all property used for operating and managing National Forest System lands to the State, including special use permits. During the exchange-transition period, there will be transition provisions in place. During the selection-transition period, the United States remains obligated for all Federal obligations incurred prior to the patent date. Employees affected by this Act will be interviewed for reemployment by the State or placement in an equivalent position within the Federal Government. Management of National Forest System lands acquired by the State will be handled until the patent date. Eligible portions of the National Forest System not yet patented to the State will be managed under applicable Federal law. Receipts from rentals or sales on selected portions will be kept in escrow and transferred to the State on the patent date. SEC. 5. Transition provisions outside the transition period. (a) Eligible portions of the National Forest System conveyed to a State under this Act shall be managed primarily for timber production according to State forest practices law. Land use designations and subsistence uses in Alaska will be retained until the patent date. Access provisions will be in place. Following the conveyance of eligible portions of the National Forest System to a State under this Act, the Secretary shall provide easements for access across lands owned by the United States. The Secretary's duty to deliver patents for easements shall not be withheld or conditioned by any other provision of law. The State, after the patent date, shall issue easements to the United States for reasonable access. After conveying eligible National Forest System portions to a State, the Secretary will grant easements for access across US-owned lands. Federal mining claims on these lands will be subject to US laws but administered by the State, allowing claimholders to patent claims and have reasonable access. During the selection-transition period, the Federal Government will escrow fees and revenues for Federal mining claims on eligible National Forest System portions. On the patent date, these receipts will be transferred to the State for mining claims filed after the selection date, which will be subject only to State laws. Beginning with the fiscal year after the patent date, all land management receipts on eligible National Forest System portions conveyed to the State will be transferred to the State. On the patent date, the State will assume all Federal obligations and duties, except for claims arising before the patent date. SEC. 6. MISCELLANEOUS DUTIES OF THE PARTIES AND OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE TRANSFER include additional responsibilities and provisions related to the transfer of eligible National Forest System portions to the State. The Secretary will provide records on hazardous materials for review by the State, with remediation costs to be borne by responsible parties. Judicial review of land selection under this Act is limited, except where conferred. The Act limits judicial review except in specific cases outlined by the Constitution or the Act itself. No formal rules are required for implementation. State ownership of National Forest System portions does not require a field survey initially but must be completed later. The Secretary will provide a list of encumbrances for a smooth transfer to State management. During the transition to State management, the Secretary will provide a list of encumbrances on the selected lands to the Commissioner. The lands chosen under this Act will be subject to existing encumbrances."
