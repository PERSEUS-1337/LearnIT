    "content": "The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has insured about 34.6 million home loans totaling $2 trillion since 1934. FHA has been an innovator in testing new mortgage products, such as acquiring mortgages to avoid foreclosure in 1959 and insuring loans on condominiums in 1961. In 1968, the Special Risk Insurance Fund was created to insure home loans for low- and moderate-income individuals with credit problems. In 1974, FHA was authorized to insure loans with \"experimental financing\" where borrower payments would increase with income. By 1988, FHA could insure reverse mortgages, becoming the first nationwide provider. By 1995, some argued FHA was no longer necessary due to a mature private market offering various programs. The private market offered 100% financing through \"piggyback\" loans like the \"80 - 20 loan,\" varying mortgage insurance premiums based on borrower risk. FHA's fixed insurance amounts hindered lending to riskier borrowers and those in high-priced communities, losing them to the private market. In 2008, the housing market crisis led to increased interest in FHA as a stabilizing instrument. Various FHA reform measures were debated in Congress, with some provisions included in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. FHA's market share had declined significantly from 16% in 2000 to less than 3% in 2005 and 2006 due to higher pricing than FHA loan limits. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA), enacted on July 30, 2008, contains three Divisions addressing housing finance reform, foreclosure prevention, and tax-related provisions. Title I of Division B, known as the FHA Modernization Act of 2008, aims to make FHA more competitive with private market products by amending the National Housing Act. It increases downpayment requirements for FHA-insured home loans but does not compete with zero downpayment loans. The Act includes the Building American Homeownership Act of 2008, making amendments to the FHA program. The Building American Homeownership Act of 2008 and the FHA Manufactured Housing Loan Modernization Act of 2008 make amendments to the FHA program for insuring loans on single family and manufactured homes. The Act sets FHA loan limits based on area median prices and Freddie Mac conforming loan limits. The FHA loan obligation is capped at a certain percentage of these limits. The Act increases the cash requirement for obtaining an FHA-insured loan to 3.5% of the sales price. Borrowers must contribute this amount in cash or its equivalent. Amounts borrowed from a family member are considered cash, but must be subordinate to the mortgage. Prohibited sources of funding for the 3.5% contribution include the seller, entities benefiting financially from the transaction, and third parties reimbursed by the seller or beneficiary. The Act increases the maximum FHA upfront mortgage insurance premium for borrowers who have not received homeownership counseling from 2.5% to 3% of the mortgage amount, and for those who have received counseling, the premium is increased from 2% to 2.75%. FHA-insured home loans are insured under either the Mutual Mortgage Insurance fund (MMI) or the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance (GI/SRI) fund, depending on the type of property. The Act rewrites the law governing the MMI fund to limit loan commitments, establish HUD's fiduciary responsibility, require annual actuarial studies and quarterly reports to Congress, adjust insurance premiums as needed, set operational goals, and transfer certain programs to the MMI fund. Reverse mortgages allow elderly homeowners to convert home equity into income without immediate repayments. The Act establishes a national HECM loan limit of $417,000 and requires counseling for borrowers entering into HECMs. It also allows HECMs to be used for home purchase. The Act amends current law to allow HECMs for home purchase and cooperatives. It limits origination fees to 2% of the first $200,000 of the mortgage amount, with a total cap of $6,000. FHA can adjust fees based on CPI changes. GAO will study mortgage insurance premiums on HECMs. Lenders cannot require additional products for HECM eligibility. HUD will study consumer protection measures. The Act directs HUD to study consumer protection and underwriting standards for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs) to ensure borrower suitability. An energy efficient mortgage allows for loan increases for energy improvements, capped at 5% of property value or 2% of appraised value. The Act limits energy efficient mortgages to 5% of FHA-insured home loans in the previous fiscal year. The Act establishes a pilot program for providing alternative credit rating information to borrowers without credit histories. HUD and FHA are directed to improve FHA's loss mitigation process and report to Congress. $25 million is authorized for appropriation. The Act authorizes $25 million from the FHA insurance funds to improve technology, processes, staffing, and fraud elimination. HUD must ensure insurance premiums maintain actuarial soundness. A study will gather mortgage industry recommendations for updating procedures. HUD must report progress to Congress within 12 months. The Act extends eligibility for homeownership counseling to those facing income reductions due to various reasons like job loss, divorce, or increased expenses. It also establishes a three-year pre-purchase counseling program to test effectiveness. The counseling program, limited to 3,000 first-time homebuyers with specific loan-to-value ratios, aims to test effectiveness through various counseling methods. HUD must report annually on recipients' payment history and delinquency rates. The Act includes FHA in the list of organizations eligible for insurance premiums. It also limits FHA insurance premium increases for multifamily housing programs unless new appropriations are needed. The Act places a 12-month moratorium on FHA's planned implementation of risk-based premiums to provide adequate funding for FHA-insured manufactured housing. The Act aims to provide funding for FHA-insured manufactured housing loans for low- and moderate-income homebuyers, modernize the FHA Title I insurance program, adjust loan limits for Title I manufactured home loan insurance, and amend the National Housing Act to limit FHA-insured home loans held by lending institutions. The Act increases loan limits for FHA-insured loans on manufactured homes to encourage lenders to make these loans. Loan limits for various purposes are raised, and will be adjusted annually based on manufactured housing price data. The Act increases loan limits for FHA-insured loans on manufactured homes and requires borrowers to pay upfront and annual insurance premiums. HUD is given authority to handle manufactured housing properties in case of loan default, similar to FHA single family home loans. HUD is directed to establish underwriting criteria for the financial soundness of the manufactured housing program. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) prohibits kickbacks and unearned fees for real estate referrals, applying to sales of manufactured homes financed with FHA-insured loans. HUD has authority to grant exceptions and must prohibit unfair practices. Loans for manufactured homes on leased lots carry default risks if the lease is lost. The Act requires that for a mortgage loan to finance a manufactured home on a leased lot in a manufactured home community, the lease must expire at least three years after the loan origination date and be renewable annually thereafter."
