FINDINGS.\" \"Congress finds that hours after the Pearl Harbor attacks, Imperial Japanese forces cut off communication to the Armed Forces and Filipino troops in the Far East. The 200th Coast Artillery Regiment was the first to fire on December 8, 1941. Despite being cut off from supplies, the troops executed a plan to defend the Philippines against the Japanese invasion.\" By April 1942, US and Filipino troops bravely defended Bataan against enemy attacks for over 4 months, facing starvation and disease. Their actions changed the war's momentum, delaying Japan's control of the Southeast Pacific and allowing Allied forces to regroup for the successful liberation of the Pacific and the Philippines. On April 9, 1942, Major General Edward King surrendered starving and poorly supplied troops from the United States and the Philippines to enemy forces. This led to the infamous \"Bataan Death March,\" where prisoners were forced to march 65 miles without food, water, or medical care. Thousands of soldiers died from starvation, exhaustion, and abuse during the march and in the appalling conditions of the prisoner of war camps, with nearly 400 deaths per day at Camp O'Donnell. Between September 1942 and December 1944, survivors of the Bataan Death March were transferred to Camp Cabanatuan where many Filipino prisoners of war died. Subsequently, prisoners were sent north on \"hell ships\" for forced labor, with many perishing due to harsh conditions. The sinking of the Arisan Maru alone claimed nearly 1,800 lives. The veterans of Bataan endured mistreatment, malnutrition, and harsh conditions in camps until their liberation in 1945. They represented diversity and formed support groups, honored in memorials, and their stories were shared across the United States. The US Navy named 2 ships after the battle, including the USS Bataan (LHD-5), in honor of their valor. The USS Bataan (LHD-5) is named in memory of the courageous survivors of Bataan who fought against Japanese forces in World War II. The survivors' stories continue to be told, and their perseverance during years of captivity is honored by the people of the United States and the Philippines.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for a gold medal to be awarded to the troops who defended Bataan and were prisoners of war during World War II. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal, and the Smithsonian Institution will be involved in the process. The gold medal awarded to the troops who defended Bataan and were prisoners of war during World War II will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research. Congress suggests that the medal should also be displayed at other locations associated with the events at Bataan. The Secretary may strike duplicates in bronze of the gold medal and sell them to cover costs. Proceeds go to the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. Medals are considered national medals and numismatic items. Authorization of appropriations is granted. Authorization of up to $30,000 from the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund is granted to cover the cost of the medal authorized under section 2."
