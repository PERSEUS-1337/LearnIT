These pipelines, carrying volatile materials, are vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Pipeline operators are enhancing security measures in response to new threats, with Congress passing legislation to improve security practices and provide federal oversight. The report provides an overview of recent federal activities related to pipeline security, including safety activities with links to security. It describes the U.S. gas and oil pipeline networks, industry's safety record, security risks, and security activities since September 11, 2001. The report also summarizes recent changes in federal pipeline security law and related changes in the security roles of federal agencies, discussing policy concerns such as federal threat information, criteria for identifying critical assets, TSA funding for pipeline security, and federal agency cooperation in pipeline security. The report focuses on federal activities related to pipeline security, with a particular emphasis on TSA and the OPS as lead agencies. It mentions that the report does not cover all safety issues, such as inspection technology, and does not delve deeply into state pipeline agency activities. There are approximately 470,000 miles of oil and gas transmission pipelines in the U.S., connecting energy-producing regions in the South with energy-consuming regions in the Northeast. The United States has around 180,000 miles of oil pipelines, with 180 companies operating interstate lines. The largest pipeline is the TransAlaska Pipeline System, delivering 17% of domestic oil production. The natural gas pipeline network consists of approximately 210,000 miles of interstate transmission and 75,000 miles of intrastate transmission. The natural gas pipeline network in the United States consists of around 210,000 miles of interstate transmission and 75,000 miles of intrastate transmission. There are approximately 80 inter state systems and 60 intra state systems, serving 1.1 million miles of regional lines and 1,300 local distribution networks. These pipelines transport almost all of the natural gas in the country, connecting to electric generation and industrial customers, as well as LNG storage tanks during peak demand. There are 113 active LNG facilities in the U.S., mostly in the Northeast. Oil and gas pipelines in the Northeast have relatively low annual fatalities compared to other transportation modes. Oil pipelines reported an average of 1.4 deaths per year from 1997-2001, while gas pipelines reported an average of 18.6 deaths per year during the same period. Data suggests that pipelines have lower fatalities per ton-mile of general freight moved than truck, rail, or waterborne transport. The environmental safety record of oil pipelines is comparable to other transportation modes, with oil pipelines spilling an average of 0.9 gallons/million barrel-miles of oil from 1995-2000. Accidental pipeline releases can result from various factors. Accidental pipeline releases are caused by various factors such as outside forces, corrosion, mechanical failure, control system failure, and operator error. In 2002, outside forces were the leading cause of gas and oil pipeline accidents, accounting for a significant percentage of failures. Despite the frequency of these releases, the pipeline industry has experience in responding quickly to such incidents. While pipeline releases have caused few fatalities, they occur more frequently than terrorist activities in the United States. While pipeline releases have caused relatively few fatalities, they can be catastrophic. For example, a 1999 gasoline pipeline explosion in Bellingham, Washington killed two children and an 18-year-old man, causing $45 million in damage. In 2000, a natural gas pipeline explosion near Carlsbad, New Mexico killed 12 campers, including 4 children. These accidents led to increased scrutiny of pipeline regulation and highlighted the potential danger of pipelines as terror weapons. Oil and gas pipelines are vulnerable to physical attacks, cyber-attacks, and indirect disruptions like attacks on electricity grids. Terrorists have targeted pipelines outside the US, causing significant economic losses and posing downstream risks. For example, rebels in Colombia have bombed a pipeline multiple times, leading to substantial revenue losses for the government. In 1996, London police foiled an IRA plot to bomb gas pipelines and utilities with 36 explosive devices. Oil and gas pipelines have been attacked in various countries, including Nigeria, Pakistan, Sudan, Myanmar, and Iraq. In Saudi Arabia, a planned pipeline attack by al-Qaeda sympathizers was thwarted in 2002, potentially disrupting 6% of the world's daily oil consumption. In the US, there have been threats and attacks on pipelines, such as a 1997 incident where Texas police prevented a bombing by Ku Klux Klan members. In 1999, a man was arrested in Vancouver for planning to blow up the trans-Alaska pipeline for personal profit. In 2001, a vandal's attack on the pipeline caused a two-day shutdown and extensive damage. Federal warnings post-9/11 have highlighted energy infrastructure, including pipelines, as potential terror targets. In 2001, computer hackers in the Middle East infiltrated sites detailing information about local electricity systems in San Francisco. In June 2003, U.S. intelligence agencies warned of a possible al-Qaeda attack on energy facilities, including pipelines in Houston. Despite efforts to promote security, pipelines are vulnerable, especially at river crossings, control centers, junctions, and storage tanks. Operators focus on enhancing security in these areas and modifying emergency plans for terror response. The Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Act of 1979 specify the federal role in pipeline safety. The Transportation Secretary has primary authority to regulate interstate pipeline safety, including design, construction, operation, maintenance, and spill response planning. Pipeline safety regulations, some with security implications, are covered in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, authorizing inspections, enforcement with fines and penalties, incident reporting, and minimum safety requirements for operators. The Pipeline Safety Act imposes requirements for operator qualifications, oil spill response plans, and drug/alcohol programs. The Office of Pipeline Safety administers regulations and funding through user fees. Security measures include protecting pipeline facilities from vandalism and unauthorized entry. The OPS enforces regulations for pipeline operators, including communication procedures during emergencies and reporting releases to the National Response Center. They conduct emergency response drills with federal, state, and industry partners to prepare for oil spills and deliberate attacks. Since 1997, the OPS has promoted integrity management programs for pipeline segments near high consequence areas to evaluate pipeline condition, assess risks, and take preventive actions. The OPS enforces regulations for pipeline operators, including communication procedures during emergencies and reporting releases to the National Response Center. They conduct emergency response drills with federal, state, and industry partners to prepare for oil spills and deliberate attacks. Integrity management programs prioritize resources based on consequences, not uniform treatment for the entire pipeline network. The OPS made these programs mandatory for most operators with 500 or more miles of regulated oil pipeline. President Bush signed the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 into law, reauthorizing funding for the OPS. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-355) reauthorizes funding for the OPS through 2006, strengthening federal pipeline safety programs and requiring risk analysis and integrity management programs for gas pipelines in high consequence areas. Integrity management focuses on safety but may also have security implications. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-355) requires risk analysis and integrity management programs for gas pipelines in high consequence areas. It also mandates baseline integrity assessments and regular reinspections for these pipelines. The rule does not explicitly address terror risks, but accident risk assessments near population centers could provide valuable data for related terror risk assessments. System safety inspections could also offer useful information for security inspections. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-355) mandates regular reinspections for gas pipelines, authorizes safety actions for potential problems, and increases violation penalties. Criminal provisions deter damaging pipelines, with fines and imprisonment up to 15 years. The act aims to streamline emergency pipeline restoration efforts by establishing an interagency committee. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-355) authorizes $100 million for research and development in pipeline integrity, safety, and reliability. This includes real-time surveillance of pipeline rights-of-way, tools for enhancing pipeline security, and studying ways to limit safety risks from population encroachment. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-355) addresses pipeline safety risks from population encroachment and environmental preservation in pipeline rights-of-way. It includes provisions for public education, grants for community pipeline safety studies, employee protection, qualification programs, and integrity management plans for gas pipeline operators in high consequence areas. OPS is required to review risk analysis and integrity management plans for operators. The OPS faces challenges in reviewing integrity management plans efficiently, as noted by the GAO. State inspectors can be valuable resources due to their familiarity with local pipeline operations. OPS can delegate authority to state offices for overseeing interstate pipeline safety programs within their boundaries. The OPS plans to rely on state pipeline safety inspectors to increase inspection frequency and thoroughness. They aim to hire more federal inspectors to meet regulatory obligations for integrity management. The agency faces challenges in ensuring state resources are sufficient and training state inspectors in integrity management. The President's FY2005 budget request for the OPS seeks $13 million for additional staff. The OPS budget request for FY2005 includes $13 million for 168 full-time equivalent employees, an increase from previous years. Pipeline operators have enhanced security measures post-9/11, including armed guards, controlled access, and surveillance. After the September 11 attacks, natural gas pipeline operators increased security measures to address potential terrorist threats. The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA) formed a security task force to coordinate industry efforts and assess security programs for incident deterrence and recovery. This included designating senior managers for security and developing common risk-based practices. The INGAA and natural gas companies implemented security measures post-9/11, including spare parts exchange, inventory systems, and communication with emergency agencies. Companies strengthened security at critical facilities by enhancing emergency plans, increasing liaison with law enforcement, monitoring pipeline flows, and developing encryption protocols to protect against cyber attacks. Redundancy in the delivery system was also sought for increased security. The oil pipeline industry responded to the September 11 attacks by reviewing procedures, tightening security, rerouting transportation patterns, increasing surveillance, conducting thorough employee background checks, and restricting Internet mapping systems. The Association of Oil PipeLines and the American Petroleum Institute provided guidance on developing a recommended pipeline security protocol. The oil pipeline industry enhanced security measures post-9/11, with 95% of operators implementing new security plans by February 2003. A cooperative Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) was established for real-time threat alerts and security information sharing. The Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) provides access to security information from various sources, including government agencies and technology providers. The energy industry has taken steps to increase ISAC's usefulness and membership. Presidential Decision Directive 63 assigned lead responsibility for pipeline protection to the DOT. OPS issued emergency bulletins post-9/11 to address pipeline security. After the 9/11 attacks, the OPS issued emergency bulletins to oil and gas pipeline companies, emphasizing heightened security measures. They contacted major operators and state safety programs to ensure understanding and adherence to security issues. Detailed pipeline maps were removed from the OPS website due to national security concerns. A vulnerability assessment was conducted to identify critical pipeline facilities. OPS collaborated with industry groups on security measures. The OPS collaborated with industry groups to assess the industry's readiness to respond to a terrorist attack and warned about the vulnerability of critical pipeline facilities. They encouraged operators to voluntarily improve security practices to secure the nation's pipelines without developing new regulations. The OPS collaborated with industry groups to assess pipeline security measures post-9/11. They defined criticality levels, developed response plans, and promoted consensus standards for security measures. Inspections of critical facilities were conducted to ensure security practices were implemented, and communication links were established for emergency information dissemination. The OPS collaborated with industry groups to assess pipeline security measures post-9/11, defining criticality levels and promoting consensus standards for security measures. They began identifying technology to enhance deterrence, detection, response, and recovery, and circulated formal guidance for security program recommendations and implementation expectations on September 5, 2002. The guidance recommended operators to identify critical facilities, develop security plans, implement security measures, and review plans annually, with specific measures suggested for different homeland security threat levels. Compliance was expected from operators. The OPS expected compliance from operators of critical facilities regarding security measures post-9/11. President Bush signed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act establishing the Transportation Security Administration within DOT, giving TSA responsibility for security in all modes of transportation. This placed DOT's pipeline security authority within TSA. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Transportation Security Administration from DOT to the Department of Homeland Security, expanding TSA's focus beyond aviation security to include other transportation modes like pipeline security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Transportation Security Administration to the Department of Homeland Security, broadening its focus to include pipeline security. President Bush issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 in 2003, clarifying responsibilities for protecting critical infrastructure, with DHS as the lead agency for pipeline security. TSA's Pipeline Branch led efforts to collaborate with federal agencies and private sector entities to safeguard critical infrastructure. TSA's Pipeline Branch is implementing security plans for pipeline operators based on industry guidance. They have inspected large operators and plan to inspect major gas distribution systems. TSA evaluates compliance with security guidance and collects information on critical assets. The TSA has found that most pipeline operators have met security guidelines, with some exceeding them. Almost all operators have provided security plans and critical infrastructure information, except for two who were concerned about information protection. The TSA plans to establish pipeline security regulations to move beyond voluntary compliance. The TSA is developing new pipeline security regulations to enhance enforcement authority in security, particularly counter-terrorism. They aim to collaborate with industry to improve asset identification for potential terrorist attacks. The TSA is developing a model to assess assets vulnerable to terrorist attacks across different transportation modes, including pipelines. They are also creating a new tool called TRAVEL to evaluate the vulnerability of critical assets. The TSA is developing a model called TRAVEL to assess the vulnerability of critical transportation assets, including pipelines, to terrorist attacks. The model will evaluate operator security plans based on pre-determined attack scenarios, aiming for a consistent approach across different transportation modes. Additionally, TSA is working on establishing qualifications for personnel with access to critical assets and addressing legal issues related to recovery from terrorist attacks. The government and industry have made significant efforts to improve pipeline security and oversight in response to terrorist threats. Industry executives have implemented new contingency plans following 9/11, with federal agencies acknowledging their progress. The President's 2003 infrastructure protection strategy highlighted the stringent safety measures already in place in pipeline facilities. Senior DHS officials have praised the pipeline industry for its well-proven response and recovery capabilities, stating that pipelines have the best security practices among maritime and land transportation sectors. The pipeline industry faces challenges in implementing security programs due to concerns about the quality of terrorism threat information from DHS and evolving criteria for critical facilities. Limited resources for TSA also hinder the improvement of industry security standards. TSA and OPS collaborate on security inspections, but resource constraints limit their oversight of pipeline security. The pipeline industry's security guidance aligns specific measures with the DHS' five threat levels, but operators feel they need more specific threat information to enhance security decisions and focus protection effectively. Concerns persist about redundant regulations and the ambiguity of DHS threat levels, leading operators to question the uniform response to vague warnings. Operators in the pipeline industry feel that ambiguous warnings may lead to unnecessary security measures at facilities not truly at risk. They believe federal agencies like FBI and DOE are not effectively communicating specific threat information. DHS Secretary Ridge acknowledges the need for a more detailed terror alert system but notes that current information on terrorist movements is too vague for specific warnings. Various industry representatives in the pipeline industry are seeking clear and stable definitions of pipeline asset criticality to know which assets to protect and how to protect them effectively. Despite security guidance from the OPS in 2002, pipeline operators are uncertain about how regulators will identify critical facilities and what protections will be expected. The industry's definition of criticality in 2002 avoided numerical thresholds, aiming to prevent unnecessary security measures and costs for consumers without significant security benefits. The OPS guidance in 2002 avoided numerical thresholds for defining criticality in the pipeline industry, focusing on qualitative metrics like impact significance. However, there is a need for clearer criticality thresholds. The HSPD-7 directive narrows the definition by emphasizing infrastructure and key resources that could cause catastrophic effects. The pipeline industry is concerned about TSA's treatment of pipeline assets and the potential lack of recognition for their unique role in the nation's energy infrastructure. The President's FY2005 budget request for DHS does not include a separate line item for TSA's pipeline security activities. The budget request includes a $146 million line item for \"Transportation Security Enterprise,\" covering security activities in non-aviation transportation modes, including pipelines. TSA's pipeline branch receives a normal allocation from the agency's general operational budget for routine operations. The current budget will fund five full-time staff to maintain TSA's asset database, support risk models, and develop security standards. TSA's Pipelines Branch has limited field presence for inspections and enforcement of security regulations due to staffing constraints and inability to use OPS inspectors. TSA faces challenges in delegating security work and compensating inspectors from other agencies. The TSA faces challenges in delegating security work to state agencies and contractors due to concerns about safeguarding security information. They plan to focus security inspections on the largest pipeline operators to make the best use of limited staff, but the prioritization of inspections for the remaining operators is still debatable. The relationship between the OPS and TSA on pipeline security is evolving, with a cooperative approach. TSA aims to lead pipeline security efforts, but a formal agreement is pending. Operator compliance with security guidance is crucial for overall network security. The OPS and TSA have a cooperative relationship on pipeline security. While TSA aims to lead security efforts, a formal agreement is pending. The OPS emphasizes the link between pipeline security and safety, stating that safety and security are interdependent. OPS acknowledges TSA's access to threat information and broader perspective, believing OPS will always have a role in pipeline security. The OPS plans to ensure pipeline security without compromising safety. In the short term, they will conduct security exercises independently and inspect operator security plans with TSA. However, there is concern about redundant regulations from different agencies. TSA believes a clearer distinction between security and safety activities is necessary to avoid confusion among operators. OPS currently has minimal resources dedicated to security inspections. The OPS and TSA are working together to address pipeline security concerns without formal agreements. While U.S. pipeline operators report no specific threats, protecting assets is crucial. Industry and government face resource limitations in enhancing security, balancing investment needs. The OPS and TSA are addressing pipeline security concerns despite resource limitations and other priorities. The pipeline industry faces challenges in protecting assets, but analysts believe more urgent security challenges lie elsewhere. Government and industry are taking steps to improve pipeline security, with federal activities in this area still evolving. Ongoing dialogue between operators and federal agencies is addressing concerns about federal pipeline security policy. Questions may arise about the TSA's resources and ability to enforce pipeline security regulations. Congress may inquire about funding, prioritization of critical pipeline systems, inspection of pipelines for compliance, and division of responsibility among federal agencies. Congress may also evaluate various elements of U.S. pipeline security. Congress may need to assess how different aspects of U.S. pipeline security align with the overall strategy to protect critical infrastructure. This includes defining asset criticality, clarifying federal threat information, and ensuring that safety programs are not compromised for security measures. Collaboration among various groups involved in pipeline security, such as federal agencies, pipeline associations, operators, and asset owners, could present oversight challenges for Congress. The Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO) was established to address these interagency coordination issues. The Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO) was created in 1998 to coordinate federal critical infrastructure assurance initiatives and raise industry awareness of infrastructure risks, particularly related to information systems. It facilitated private sector input to the national strategy for critical infrastructure and supported the formation of the Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC). The National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) within the FBI was also established in 1998 to detect, prevent, respond to, and investigate malicious acts against critical infrastructures. NIPC provided threat information to the Energy ISAC and collaborated with industry on national critical infrastructure strategy. The Office of Energy Assurance (OEA) was established within the Department of Energy in 2001 to protect against energy supply disruptions. OEA's activities under PDD-63 have implications for oil and gas pipelines, including co-sponsoring guidelines for responding to natural gas supply disruptions. The National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC) was chartered in 2001 to provide new computer modeling. The National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC) was established in October 2001 to provide computer modeling and simulation capabilities for critical infrastructure analysis. Its mission includes assessing interdependencies, vulnerabilities, and complexities in energy, communication, and water infrastructures. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the activities of various offices into the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) Directorate of DHS, which analyzes intelligence and evaluates vulnerabilities in the nation's infrastructure. The IAIP aims to evaluate cross-infrastructure dependencies and offer protection action strategies. It will provide guidance and technical experts to assist infrastructure sector leaders. The Department of Justice has increased enforcement activities related to pipelines. On January 22, 2003, a settlement was reached with Olympic Pipeline Co. and Shell Pipeline Co. regarding the Bellingham pipeline accident, resulting in $92 million in civil fines. Attorney General Ashcroft announced a crackdown on companies failing to protect against terrorist attacks on infrastructure, pledging increased prosecution to ensure compliance with environmental and safety laws. The Justice Department has not initiated any new pipeline cases since March, but on April 1, 2003, announced a $34 million civil penalty against Colonial Pipeline for oil spills. The penalty settlement requires Colonial to treat its entire network as \"high consequence\" under OPS rules, indicating future enforcement of security regulations. The siting approval of new gas pipelines is not under OPS's jurisdiction. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is responsible for approving new gas pipelines and regulating prices for wholesale oil and natural gas in interstate commerce. Companies building interstate gas pipelines must obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity from FERC. FERC also approves the abandonment of gas facilities and may include safety and security provisions. FERC traditionally leaves safety considerations to the OPS. FERC expedited processing applications for cost recovery after 9/11 attacks. Companies could propose surcharges for security costs. 3 pipeline operators requested security cost recovery, with 2 approvals and 1 withdrawal. In February 2003, FERC issued a rule to protect critical energy infrastructure information. The rule defines critical infrastructure as systems and assets that impact security, economic security, public health, or safety. It excludes location information and allows for public requests for critical information. FERC issued new rules in May 2003 (RM03-4) to expedite pipeline restoration after a terrorist attack, allowing owners to rebuild immediately without cost restrictions. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigates major pipeline incidents independently to determine the cause and prevent recurrences. Since 1969, NTSB has investigated over 100 natural gas and oil pipeline incidents, making recommendations for safety improvements. NTSB also evaluates government agencies' safety effectiveness in transportation. For example, NTSB reviewed federal oversight of oil pipeline safety in 1996 and investigated recent pipeline accidents in Bellingham and Carlsbad."
