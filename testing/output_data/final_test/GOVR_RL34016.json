    "content": "The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is a federally funded corporation that provides legal assistance to low-income individuals in civil matters. Governed by an 11-member board appointed by the President, the LSC manages federal funds distributed as grants to local legal service providers across various states and territories. This program has been in place since 1966. The government has administered a program of legal services for the poor since 1966, initially through the Office of Economic Opportunity. In 1974, the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was established to deliver legal services independently. Despite not being reauthorized since 1980, Congress continues to fund LSC annually, supporting local legal services providers known as \"grantees.\" Grantees for legal assistance include nonprofit organizations, private attorneys, state or local governments, and regional planning agencies. In 2015, LSC funded 134 local programs with 812 offices and 4,591 attorneys. Each program sets its own priorities and financial criteria within LSC limits. Clients served must have household income below 125% of federal poverty guidelines. Programs must allocate 12.5% of their grant for pro bono legal aid. Since 1996, LSC grantees are selected through a competitive process to provide high-quality legal services to the poor. Grants are awarded for one to three years, with multi-year awardees required to submit reports for renewal. Federal regulations outline the procedures for awarding LSC grants. The 1998 State Planning Initiative aimed to improve collaboration among LSC grantees by encouraging partnerships with the judiciary, private bar associations, and each other to effectively use funds for legal services for the poor. The LSC's 1998 Initiative made participation in statewide civil legal services delivery systems a requirement for receiving funding. Poor individuals have benefited from this approach, which involves coordination among federally funded legal services providers and other organizations within a state. The legal services program has faced controversy, with Congress imposing restrictions on activities of local attorneys, including lobbying, political activities, and certain types of cases. Under current appropriations law, LSC grantees face restrictions on engaging in partisan litigation, influencing regulatory or legislative actions, participating in class action suits, representing certain aliens or prisoners, conducting advocacy training, and litigating abortion-related cases. Additional restrictions have been added each year, limiting the activities of legal services providers. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) grantees must establish priorities and staff must agree not to engage in activities outside these priorities. LSC funds can only be used for civil legal services for individuals with household incomes below 125% of the federal poverty guidelines. Primary emphasis is placed on routine legal services for various issues such as family-related matters. Legal services attorneys handle a variety of issues including family, housing, income maintenance, consumer finance, health coverage, employment, and more. In 2015, they closed 755,774 cases, with family issues being the most common at 31.9%, followed by housing at 28.3%, income maintenance at 10.6%, and consumer finance at 10.3%. Other issues accounted for smaller percentages. In 2015, Legal Services Corporation (LSC) handled a variety of cases, with family issues being the most common at 31.9%, followed by housing at 28.3%, income maintenance at 10.6%, and consumer finance at 10.3%. Other issues included employment, individual rights, juveniles, education, and miscellaneous categories, totaling 18.9% of cases. LSC resolved most cases through advice and referral, with 14.9% resolved in court, primarily involving family law issues. LSC clients were diverse, including the working poor, veterans, family farmers, people with disabilities, and battered women. In 2015, Legal Services Corporation (LSC) served a diverse group of clients, including family farmers, people with disabilities, battered women, and victims of natural disasters. The majority of LSC clients were females (70%) and between the ages of 18 and 59 (81%). A 2009 report by LSC highlighted that 50% of potential clients were denied assistance due to resource constraints, and 80% of eligible individuals did not receive legal help when needed. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) aims to provide legal services to low-income individuals, with one attorney for every 6,415 poor persons. The initial goal was to have one attorney for every 5,000 low-income individuals, but this was not sustained due to budget cuts. In FY2004, the LSC received less funding than needed for minimum access. The funding per eligible person decreased from $7.54 in 2007 to $5.85 in 2016. Funding for the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) has decreased over the years, with funding per eligible person dropping from $7.54 in 2007 to $5.85 in 2016. The LSC receives funds from the annual appropriation for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS). Current funding remains at $385 million, the same as in FY2016. LSC funding only accounts for 38% of all funding for civil legal services for the poor in the United States. Funds for basic field programs are distributed to states and jurisdictions based on the number of \"poor\" persons in each area, with grantees competing for funding. The Census Bureau replaced the \"long form\" with the American Community Survey (ACS) to collect income data more frequently. The LSC Board recommended using Census Bureau data for poverty determinations and reallocating funding every three years based on updated poverty population numbers. This change was phased in over FY2013 and FY2014. The LSC Board recommended reallocating funding every three years based on updated poverty data from the Census Bureau, which was phased in over FY2013 and FY2014. LSC is the largest funding source for civil legal services but is supplemented by other sources like state and local grants, federal programs, and private grants. In 2015, LSC funding accounted for 38% of the $966.0 million spent in the United States and territories for civil legal services for the poor. Congress increased LSC's appropriation from $91 million in FY1976 to $321 million in FY1981 to provide \"minimum access\" to legal services for low-income individuals. The Reagan Administration opposed the LSC, leading to a 25% reduction in funding for 1982. In FY1982, the LSC's appropriation was reduced by 25% to $241 million. The funding remained at $241 million in FY1983, increased in the following years, reaching $400 million in FY1995. However, in FY1996, Congress funded the LSC at $278 million, with plans for a three-year phase-out. The House Budget Committee recommended appropriations of $278 million in FY1996, $141 million in FY1997, and elimination by FY1998 due to concerns about the focus of LSC-funded lawyers on political causes and class action lawsuits rather than helping low-income Americans with their legal problems. The LSC's funding was gradually increased between FY1996 and FY2001, with Congress allocating $283 million in FY1997, $283 million in FY1998, $300 million in FY1999, and $305 million in FY2000. Despite plans for a phase-out, the House budget resolution did not eliminate LSC funding as initially envisioned. For FY2000, Congress funded the LSC at $305 million, but a government-wide rescission reduced it to $304 million. In FY2001, the Clinton Administration requested $340 million, but the appropriation was reduced to $329.3 million due to a rescission. The Bush Administration requested $329.3 million annually for the LSC from FY2002 to FY2005. In FY2002, the LSC requested $329.3 million in annual appropriations.

For FY2004 and FY2005, Congress funded the LSC at $335.3 million and $330.8 million respectively. Funding levels included government-wide rescissions and provisions for specific programs. For FY2006-FY2008, the LSC funding faced various rescissions and adjustments. In FY2006, the initial request was $318.3 million, but it was set at $330.8 million by P.L. 109-108.
