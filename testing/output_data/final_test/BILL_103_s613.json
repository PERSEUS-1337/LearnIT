    "content": "The \"Child Labor Deterrence Act of 1993\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings, purpose, and policy related to child labor. The Congress finds that Principle 9 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child and Article 2 of the International Labor Convention No. 138 set minimum age requirements for child employment to protect their health, education, and development. According to the International Labor Organization, around 200 million children under 15 are working, with many in hazardous industries like mining and fireworks. Children under 15 make up 11-26% of the workforce in various regions, and despite existing laws and conventions, their numbers and suffering continue to rise annually. In many countries, these children lack the legal protection to prevent exploitation in the workplace. The employment of children under 15, often at low wages, undermines families' stability and economic development in developing countries. Adult workers in developed countries should not lose jobs to imports produced by child labor. The purpose of this Act is to curtail child labor. The Act aims to stop the use of children under 15 in producing goods for export, by ending the US market for such products and encouraging other countries to also ban trade in these goods. The Act urges the President to seek an international agreement to ban trade in products of child labor. It also calls for the identification of foreign industries and their host countries that use child labor in exporting goods. The Secretary of Labor conducts periodic reviews to identify foreign industries and host countries that use child labor in exporting products to the United States. Any person can file a petition with the Secretary to request the identification of a specific industry and country based on allegations. The Secretary of Labor reviews petitions alleging child labor in foreign industries exporting to the US. Within 90 days of receiving a petition, the Secretary decides on further action and consults with relevant departments before identifying the industry and country. The Secretary of the Treasury may revoke the identification of a foreign industry and its host country if deemed appropriate, with a report to Congress required before the revocation takes effect. The Secretary of the Treasury can revoke the identification of a foreign industry and its host country if child labor is not utilized in product exports. The revocation process includes publishing a notice in the Federal Register and considering public comments before preparing a report for Congress. The Secretary is required to publish in the Federal Register the names of foreign industries and their host countries identified, decisions made, and revoked identifications. A current list of all identified foreign industries must be maintained in the Federal Register. SEC. 5. PROHIBITION ON ENTRY. During the effective identification period for a foreign industry and its host country, the Secretary may not permit the entry of any manufactured article that is a product of that foreign industry, except for certain exceptions such as certified articles, personal exemptions, or articles exported from the foreign industry en route to the United States. The Secretary requires documentation to certify that imported articles are not made using child labor, including written evidence of the agreement's terms and conditions. The imported article acquisition or provision must not involve child labor. SEC. 6. PENALTIES. It is unlawful to attempt to enter any manufactured article prohibited under section 5(a)(1) during an effective identification period. Violating regulations under section 7 is also prohibited. Civil penalties for unlawful acts can reach $25,000, and intentional violations can result in fines up to $35,000 or imprisonment for 1 year. These violations are treated as customs law violations. Violations of customs laws can result in search, seizure, and forfeiture under the Tariff Act of 1930. Penalties for entry by fraud, negligence, or informers' compensation may apply. The Secretary will establish necessary regulations for implementing the Act. Manufactured articles are considered products of child labor if they were fabricated, assembled, processed, or extracted by children under certain conditions. The term \"child\" refers to an individual under the age of 15. The term \"effective identification period\" is defined as the period starting from the publication of the identification of a foreign industry or country in the Federal Register and ending with the revocation of that identification. The term \"entered\" refers to goods brought into the United States for consumption. \"Foreign industry\" includes entities producing goods in foreign territories. \"Host country\" is a foreign territory where goods are produced. \"Manufactured article\" encompasses fabricated, assembled, or processed goods, including mineral resources. The term \"processed\" includes mineral resources in a crude state and those subjected to various mechanical or physical processes. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury, except for section 4."
