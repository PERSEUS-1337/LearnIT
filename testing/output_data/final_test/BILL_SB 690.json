    "title": "SB 690",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 51 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to determine the taxable value of real property based on its base year value compounded annually by an inflation factor. The inflation factor for assessment years starting after January 1, 1985, and before January 1, 1998, is based on the California Consumer Price Index. For assessment years starting on or after January 1, 1998, the inflation factor is determined from October to October. The percentage increase cannot exceed 2 percent of the prior year's value. For assessment years starting on or after January 1, 2017, the percentage increase for a qualified veteran aged 65 or older, who was honorably discharged from military service, shall not apply to their principal place of residence. The veteran must meet specific criteria, including a household income of less than $50,000. A qualified veteran aged 65 or older, who was honorably discharged from military service, is eligible for a property tax exemption if their household income is less than $100,000. The veteran must provide necessary information and proof to the assessor to claim the benefit. The property's full cash value is considered for the exemption, taking into account various factors affecting its value. If real property is damaged by disaster and no ordinance is in place, taxable value is based on base year value of land and improvements or full cash value. The base year value of real property does not include value from destroyed portions. The value remains until property is restored or new laws require a new value. If property is damaged by disaster and no ordinance is in place, taxable value is based on assessed value. \"Real property\" refers to units commonly bought and sold separately in the marketplace. For each lien date after the first lien date, property with reduced taxable value must be annually reappraised at its full cash value until it exceeds the original value. Assessor cannot require an assessment appeal for this reappraisal. Section 205.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code exempts the principal residence of a veteran from taxation up to $100,000 if the veteran meets certain disability criteria. For tax exemption purposes, a \"veteran\" is defined as someone who meets specific disability criteria or has died as a result of a service-connected injury while on active duty. For tax exemption purposes, a disabled veteran confined to a hospital or care facility can still have their property considered their principal place of residence if it would be so under normal circumstances, as long as the residence is not rented out. Property owned by the unmarried surviving spouse of a deceased veteran is exempt from taxation on the residence's value up to $100,000 if the veteran qualified for exemption during their lifetime or died from a service-connected disease. The $100,000 exemption applies to the full value of the property for an eligible unmarried surviving spouse with a household income below $40,000. Property owned by the unmarried surviving spouse of a veteran is exempt from taxation on the residence's value up to $100,000. The exemption applies to spouses with a household income below $40,000. Property owned by a veteran or their unmarried surviving spouse is exempt from taxation on the residence's value up to $100,000. The exemption applies to spouses with a household income below $40,000. The property is considered the principal place of residence for the surviving spouse if they are confined to a hospital or care facility, as long as the residence is not rented out. This includes property owned jointly with a spouse or separately. Property owned by a veteran or their spouse is exempt from taxation on the residence's value up to $100,000. This exemption also applies to property owned jointly with one or more persons, including the veteran's surviving spouse. The exemption for property owned by a veteran or their spouse extends to the principal residence of a veteran or their unmarried surviving spouse if they are shareholders of a corporation. This exemption reduces the full value of the corporate property and any reduction in property taxes paid by the corporation must also result in a corresponding reduction in charges to the qualifying individual. Definitions for disability criteria include being blind in both eyes, losing the use of two or more limbs, and being totally disabled as defined by the VA or military service. An exemption granted to a claimant under this section replaces other real property tax exemptions, and if multiple veterans co-own a property, each is entitled to the exemption based on their interest. Starting from January 1, 2002, the household income limit will increase annually based on the California Consumer Price Index. Similarly, starting from January 1, 2006, exemption amounts will also increase annually based on the same index. The amendments to Section 5813 of the Revenue and Taxation Code apply to property tax lien dates on and after January 1, 2017. The taxable value of a manufactured home for each lien date is determined by the lesser of its base year value compounded annually by an inflation factor or its full cash value as of the lien date, considering reductions in value due to various factors. For a qualified veteran aged 65 or older owning a manufactured home as their principal residence, the percentage increase in assessment value does not apply starting January 1, 2017. A qualified veteran is someone honorably discharged from military service who meets specific criteria. Qualified veterans in California may be eligible for property tax exemptions if they meet certain criteria, including income limits. Single veterans with an annual household income of $50,000 or less, or married veterans with a combined annual household income of $100,000 or less, may qualify. Claimants must provide necessary information and may need to provide additional proof to the assessor. The act does not appropriate funds to reimburse local agencies for property tax revenue losses. If the Commission on State Mandates finds state-mandated costs in this act, reimbursement will be made to local agencies and school districts. This act establishes a tax levy and takes immediate effect."
