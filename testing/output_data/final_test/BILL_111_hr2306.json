    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Climate Service Act of 2009\". The Congress acknowledges the impact of weather and climate change on various aspects of society, including public safety, agriculture, and national security. Climate forecasts can help society prepare and reduce costs associated with climate-related events. However, there is a lack of dissemination and utilization of climate information despite increasing predictability. The United States needs to improve research, infrastructure, and communication in this area. Increasing societal resilience to climate impacts requires understanding climate trends, variations, and their effects on human and nonhuman systems. Decision-relevant tools and increased capacity to act on this information are essential for adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climate change and variability. The National Climate Service aims to provide authoritative and timely information on climate, climate change, and variability to help individuals and organizations understand and respond to their impacts. It will focus on delivering user-centric information at local, state, regional, tribal, national, and global scales through observations, modeling, and research activities. The Secretary of Commerce will establish a National Climate Service within the Climate Program Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Service will provide authoritative information on climate impacts at various scales through observation, modeling, and research. The National Climate Service will serve as a clearinghouse for climate information, provide education on climate impacts, design decision-support tools, and facilitate user access to climate experts for technical assistance. The National Climate Service aims to provide climate information to stakeholders, researchers, and experts, integrate observations, develop climate models, conduct research on climate dynamics, and propose adaptation strategies for climate variability and change. The National Climate Service aims to create an operational delivery system, establish an atmospheric monitoring program, maintain a dialog among research teams and stakeholders, and identify climate-related vulnerabilities to increase national resilience. The National Climate Service aims to build national capacity, articulate regional and national climate issues, facilitate communications, and outreach to stakeholder groups. Within 1 year, the Secretary of Commerce must submit an action plan for interpreting and communicating climate data to decision-makers at various levels. The National Climate Service aims to build national capacity, articulate regional and national climate issues, and facilitate communications. It includes designing and operating a national climate observing system, supporting infrastructure for climate data, and establishing a national coordinated modeling strategy. The National Climate Service aims to improve modeling and forecasting capabilities for climate scenarios on various time scales. It also focuses on enhancing integrated modeling and assessment to guide decision-making at national, regional, and local levels. Additionally, it emphasizes regular consultation and coordination with various stakeholders to ensure the effective sharing and use of climate information. The National Climate Service aims to improve climate information and services for risk preparedness, planning, decision-making, and natural resources management. It includes developing standards, evaluation criteria, performance objectives, funding estimates, and supporting research programs through the Climate Program Office. The Administrator appoints a Director to oversee all processes associated with managing the Service. The National Climate Service Advisory Council, appointed by the Administrator, includes diverse members from various sectors to advise the Director on key priorities. The National Climate Service Advisory Council advises the Director on key priorities in climate-related issues and promotes coordination across regional, national, and international concerns. SEC. 5.
