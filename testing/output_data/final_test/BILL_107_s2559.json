    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Expanding Research for Women in Trauma Act of 2002\". Congress finds that most studies on violence against women focus on physical abuse or rape, but psychological abuse is often described as the most harmful. Research has neglected nontraditional populations, such as incarcerated women, those in poverty, minority groups, older women, and women with disabilities, who report high rates of victimization. Victims of violence are at increased risk for physical and mental health problems. Women who have been raped experience more symptoms of illness and negative health behaviors compared to nonvictimized women. Effective screening methods are essential to understand the outcomes of abuse-sensitive medical care, including the impact of medical attention on perceived health, utilization of health services, and patient satisfaction. Violence against women occurs within a sociocultural context, and further research is needed to identify factors that promote and sustain violence. Community-based and legal interventions are also important in addressing violence against women. Research is needed on the effectiveness of legal and community-based interventions for victims of interpersonal violence, especially for different subpopulations of women. Current research focuses on the behavior of perpetrators rather than empowering women to take safety-promoting actions. Research on women's attempts to manage and end violence in their lives is rare, with existing studies mainly focusing on violence against women in the streets or in their homes. Limited attention has been given to violence against women in work-related and educational settings. SEC. 399O. VIOLENCE PREVENTION RESEARCH INITIATIVES. The Secretary, in consultation with various health organizations, will provide grants and contracts to increase research on the psychological effects of violence against women, study special populations at risk for violence, and explore the link between violence against women and mental and physical health issues. Research efforts should focus on developing effective screening methods for violence in healthcare settings, expanding research on sociocultural factors related to violence, creating measurable ways to evaluate treatment and prevention programs, and gaining a better understanding of the experiences of victimized women. The text discusses the complex process victimized women go through in managing and ending violence in their lives, focusing on resilience and coping mechanisms. It also mentions the development of standardized questions on violence in work and educational settings for national surveys. Grants under this section are limited to $500,000 and awarded for a maximum of 5 years. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant. Under this section, applicants must submit an application to the Secretary with necessary information. The application should describe the activities for which assistance is sought and provide assurances for compliance. $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2003, with additional funding for subsequent years to implement the provisions of this section."
