    "content": "\"Definitions.\" In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of General Services. The term \"baseline\" means the highest annual rate of energy use for a building from January 1, 2012, to the year before a deep energy retrofit. A \"deep energy retrofit\" in a Federal building results in energy savings of at least 35-50% compared to the baseline. \"Energy savings\" is the annual difference in energy quantity before and after the retrofit. The calculation of energy savings after a deep energy retrofit in a Federal building involves determining the difference in energy usage compared to the baseline. This calculation includes separate considerations for electricity and other fuels, potential conversions to British thermal units, and adjustments for factors like weather, occupancy, and usage indicators. The term \"Federal building\" refers to a building owned by a Federal agency, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The Deep Energy Retrofit Program is established under SEC. 2. It focuses on improving energy efficiency in Federal buildings. The Deep Energy Retrofit Program, established under SEC. 2, aims to improve energy efficiency in Federal buildings. The Administrator and the Secretary must develop a plan to meet the 2020 goals within a year of the Act's enactment. Federal agencies owning buildings must submit plans for deep energy retrofits of at least 50% of their buildings by July 1, 2018, with technical assistance provided by the Secretary. The Administrator and the Secretary must ensure at least 100 deep energy retrofits and 50 deep energy retrofits in Federal agencies (excluding GSA) by January 1, 2020, with a minimum of 1/3 achieving 50% energy savings. Cost control measures are allowed. The Secretary and the Administrator may select Federal buildings for deep energy retrofit if they are scheduled for renovation or require major system replacement. During the 10-year period starting January 1, 2020, at least 50% of the total square footage of Federal buildings remaining for deep energy retrofits must undergo retrofits, with a minimum of 1/3 achieving 50% energy savings. The Secretary will set goals for deep energy retrofits during the 10-year period starting on January 1, 2030, with waivers and exceptions for historic structures, buildings with high energy use for security purposes, and other special circumstances. The Secretary may adjust the number of deep energy retrofits required based on recent data on technical feasibility and economic justification to achieve positive cashflow over the full life of measures."
