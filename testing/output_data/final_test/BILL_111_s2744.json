    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Carbon Dioxide Capture Technology Act of 2009\". Congress finds that flue gases from coal-fired electric generating facilities have high carbon dioxide concentrations, and it is possible to separate carbon dioxide from dilute sources like the atmosphere. Developing practical separations of carbon dioxide is crucial for future energy technology, and onsite separation can be economical for energy applications such as enhanced oil recovery and geothermal systems. The purpose of this Act is to incentivize the development of technology for capturing carbon dioxide from dilute sources using direct air capture technologies. This includes providing incentives for developing novel technologies needed for the national energy system of the United States. The Carbon Dioxide Capture Technology Prize is established under Section 3 of the Act to incentivize the development of technology for capturing carbon dioxide from dilute sources using direct air capture technologies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include a Carbon Dioxide Capture Technology Prize, defining terms like 'Board', 'dilute', 'intellectual property', and 'Secretary'. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Board, will establish a program to award competitive technology financial awards for carbon dioxide capture from dilute media. The Secretary will develop specific requirements for the competition process, minimum performance standards, and monitoring and verification. The program will offer financial awards for the design and demonstration of promising carbon dioxide capture technologies, with specific requirements for monitoring and verification procedures. Minimum levels for carbon dioxide capture from dilute media must be achieved to qualify for the financial award. The program offers financial awards for designing and demonstrating carbon dioxide capture technologies meeting specific requirements. Recipients must achieve significant reduction in carbon dioxide levels and use operational capture technology on a commercial scale. They must submit annual progress reports to Congress. The program offers financial awards for designing and demonstrating carbon dioxide capture technologies meeting specific requirements. Recipients must achieve significant reduction in carbon dioxide levels and use operational capture technology on a commercial scale. The Board must provide public participation and peer review before awarding financial grants. The Carbon Dioxide Capture Technology Advisory Board is established with 9 members appointed by the President, providing expertise in various disciplines for peer review before awarding financial grants. The Carbon Dioxide Capture Technology Advisory Board, established with 9 members appointed by the President, includes expertise in various disciplines as determined necessary by the Secretary. Board members serve a 6-year term, vacancies do not affect the Board's powers, and vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The Board must hold its initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed. The Carbon Dioxide Capture Technology Advisory Board consists of 9 members appointed by the President with expertise in various disciplines. The Board must meet at the call of the Chairperson, with a majority forming a quorum. Members may be compensated for their duties, and the Board advises the Secretary. The Carbon Dioxide Capture Technology Advisory Board advises the Secretary on duties related to intellectual property for applicants receiving financial awards, requiring them to vest intellectual property in U.S. entities and granting the United States a license to practice the technology. The Carbon Dioxide Capture Technology Advisory Board advises on intellectual property duties for recipients of financial awards, requiring IP to be vested in U.S. entities and granting the U.S. a license. Title to IP cannot be transferred until the first patent expires. Authorization of appropriations is provided, and the Board's authority can be terminated. The Carbon Dioxide Capture Technology Advisory Board's authority will terminate on December 31, 2020."
