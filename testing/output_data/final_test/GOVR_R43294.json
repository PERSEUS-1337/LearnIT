The law defines \"person\" broadly to include entities beyond just individuals. Under federal law, corporations and legal entities can be held criminally liable for the actions of their employees and agents. The Dictionary Act defines \"person\" broadly to include corporations, companies, associations, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals. Corporate criminal liability typically involves offenses committed by the corporation's officers, employees, or agents within the scope of their employment. The judicial test for corporate criminal liability involves determining if the individual's actions were within the scope of their employment and at least partially for the benefit of the corporation. The corporation can be held liable even if it expressly directed its agent not to commit the offense. Courts have ruled that corporations can be held liable for specific intent offenses based on the knowledge and intent of their employees, as long as the actions were within the scope of their employment and intended to benefit the corporation. The law is uncertain when a corporation's liability is based on the cumulative actions or knowledge of multiple employees. Statutes holding a corporation criminally liable do not absolve individual officers, employees, or agents responsible for the violations. There is a debate over whether an individual can be both the violator of a statute and the representation of the corporation that violates it. Conspiracy raises complex issues regarding corporate liability. While a corporation can be held accountable for the actions of its employees, individual officers may also face criminal liability for conspiring to commit federal crimes. However, a corporate officer acting alone on behalf of the corporation cannot be convicted of conspiracy with the corporation. Corporate officials and employees may face criminal liability under federal law for misconduct committed by co-conspirators in furtherance of a common scheme, even if they did not directly participate. Liability can also arise if an official instructs or aids in the commission of a federal offense, or takes actions to conceal it. Participation in the offense before its commission is necessary for aiding and abetting liability. A defendant must associate with the venture, participate in it, and intend to make it succeed to be guilty of aiding and abetting. Unlike conspiracy, aiding and abetting can be committed by a sole stockholder. Misprision and accessory after the fact focus on conduct after the commission of the offense, requiring knowledge and assistance in concealing the crime. The third instance of official liability within a corporation occurs when a corporate official fails to prevent the commission of an offense, even without knowing participation. Prosecution decisions for corporations or employees are made by the Justice Department, with limited court review of their discretion. The Justice Department has guidelines for prosecuting corporations and individuals. Prosecutors decide whether to initiate, decline, or defer a prosecution based on the strength of the case and admissible evidence. Court review of prosecution decisions is limited to protecting constitutional rights. Prosecutors consider initiating a prosecution based on sufficient admissible evidence and factors like federal interests, effective prosecution elsewhere, and alternatives. Federal interests include the nature of the offense and culpability of defendants, with crimes like immigration or fraud warranting federal prosecution. Corporate liability focuses on culpability factors outlined in guidelines. The business organization guidelines outline culpability factors for corporate liability, including the pervasiveness of wrongdoing, history of misconduct, compliance programs, disclosure of wrongdoing, cooperation, absence of obstruction, collateral consequences, and restitution. Prosecutors may charge a corporation for pervasive misconduct but may not charge for isolated acts by rogue employees, especially if the corporation has a robust compliance program. Most cases fall between these extremes. The guidelines for corporate liability consider factors such as the pervasiveness of corruption within a corporation, past criminal conduct, compliance programs, and the past transgressions of subsidiaries or affiliates. A corporation may be held liable for employee misconduct even if it has warned against it. Compliance programs are encouraged to prevent wrongdoing. The Commission's Sentencing Guidelines promote effective compliance programs tailored to prevent offenses in a corporation's operational environment. These programs can reduce the likelihood of prosecution and lessen the severity of charges. The cooperative nature of the guidelines is controversial, as they encourage corporations to cooperate with authorities but raise questions about profiting from employee misconduct. The Department encourages corporations to conduct internal investigations and disclose relevant facts to authorities as part of their compliance programs. Cooperation does not guarantee immunity from prosecution. The guidelines address concerns about interference with Sixth Amendment rights and emphasize the importance of sharing facts about potential criminal misconduct. The guidelines emphasize that corporations should conduct internal investigations and disclose relevant facts to authorities as part of their compliance programs. Prosecutors should not ask for waivers of attorney-client communications, and corporate officials cannot obstruct investigations. Corporations may receive credit for making victim restitution, disciplining employees, or improving compliance programs. Prosecution in another jurisdiction may be more advantageous in some cases. Prosecutors have alternatives to criminal trial for corporations, such as accepting guilty pleas, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements, or civil sanctions. Factors influencing these decisions include the severity of misconduct and potential sanctions. Prosecution in another jurisdiction may be more beneficial based on the interests and potential sentences. The guidelines for deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements address factors like regulatory authority's interest, enforcement ability, and probable sanctions. They emphasize including a basic statement of facts and prohibit negotiating away an agency's right to debar or delist the corporate defendant. Agreements should not shield individual corporate officers and may involve appointing outside experts as monitors for the corporation's behavior. Corporations and legal entities have some constitutional rights during criminal investigations and proceedings. Federal courts analyze ex post facto laws in cases involving corporate defendants without questioning their applicability. The Supreme Court has affirmed that corporations have First Amendment protections, including in political speech and commercial activities. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, including for corporations. Government searches must typically have a warrant based on probable cause. The extent of protection depends on the nature of the activities and the government's purpose. Commercial activities, whether corporate or not, may be subject to reasonable regulations. In a regulatory context, commercial activities, corporate entities may be subject to warrantless inspections or inquiries without probable cause. Courts affirm that corporations can claim Fourth Amendment protection in criminal investigation searches on commercial premises. Fifth Amendment rights like self-incrimination and grand jury indictment do not apply to corporations, but Due Process and Double Jeopardy protect them. The Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause limits federal government powers over corporations, recognizing them as \"persons\" under the Fourteenth Amendment. The courts have recognized corporations as \"persons\" for the Fourteenth Amendment, granting them access to due process rights. However, states and foreign governments are not considered \"persons\" under the Due Process Clause. Corporations are entitled to Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy. The Sixth Amendment guarantees rights to anyone accused of a federal crime, including the right to notice of charges, assistance of counsel, a public and speedy trial, calling witnesses, and confronting accusers. This includes corporations, which have the right to counsel but not at public expense. The accused must be informed of the nature of the accusation, as per Rule 7(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Sixth Amendment guarantees rights to anyone accused of a federal crime, including the right to a public trial regardless of whether the accused is charged by indictment or information. In cases of prejudicial pre-trial publicity, the right to a public trial may conflict with the accused's rights to a fair trial and an impartial jury. The courts use a balancing test to determine if the accused has been denied a speedy trial, considering factors like the length of delay and extent of prejudice. This analysis also applies to corporations asserting their right to a public trial under the Sixth Amendment. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial in serious criminal cases for the accused. Federal criminal trials must be held in the state and judicial district where the crime occurred. The accused has the right to confront witnesses and obtain witnesses in their favor. Testimonial statements of absent witnesses can only be admitted if the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine. The Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive fines, which are considered grossly disproportionate to the crime committed. While the right to compulsory process ensures the government's assistance in compelling witnesses for criminal defendants, the sparse case law suggests these rights may apply to corporations as well. However, corporations cannot be incarcerated, and the question of whether the Eighth Amendment applies to them remains unresolved. Corporations and individuals face similar consequences following conviction, including fines, probation, restitution, property confiscation, and restrictions on commercial activities. Sentencing is guided by federal Sentencing Guidelines, with courts considering factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a). Appellate courts review sentences for abuse of discretion, overturning those that are procedurally or substantively unreasonable. The Sentencing Guidelines for organizations measure punishment based on the offense seriousness, culpability, and history of misconduct. They also consider self-disclosure, cooperation, restitution, and preventive measures. Special corporate sentencing directions include fines, probation, forfeiture, special assessments, and remedial sanctions. Corporate fines aim to strip corrupt corporations of all assets. Corporate fines are imposed based on offense seriousness, culpability, and history of misconduct. Special sentencing guidelines include fines, probation, forfeiture, special assessments, and remedial sanctions. Fines aim to strip corrupt corporations of all assets, with specific standards set for certain crimes like antitrust, smuggling, and gambling offenses. Other offenses are governed by general statutory sentencing provisions. The Guidelines dictate fines for corporations convicted of offenses, based on offense level and culpability. The fine amount ranges from $5,000 to $72.5 million, determined by the offense level. The Guidelines determine fines for corporations based on offense level and culpability score, with ranges from $5,000 to $72.5 million. Culpability score is adjusted by adding or subtracting points. Factors like an effective ethics program influence where within the range a corporation is fined. Circumstances may warrant fines outside the range. The Guidelines recommend fines for corporations based on offense level and culpability score, with ranges from $5,000 to $72.5 million. Fines may be adjusted based on statutory requirements and the need to disgorge illegally obtained gains. Below-range fines may be imposed for restitution or if the corporation cannot afford a higher fine. The Guidelines provide examples of when fines outside the recommended range may be considered for closely held corporations. Upward departures may be warranted for offenses involving risk of death, national security threats, environmental threats, market threats, official corruption, compliance program offsets, or exceeding culpability score limits. Downward departures may be warranted for corporations providing substantial assistance, public entities, or where beneficiaries are also victims. The Guidelines recommend probation for convicted corporations to ensure compliance with obligations such as fines, restitution, and compliance programs. This is especially applicable for offenses committed within five years of a prior conviction or involving senior corporate officials. The Guidelines recommend probation for convicted corporations to ensure compliance with obligations such as fines, restitution, and compliance programs. Mandatory condition of corporate probation is to not engage in further criminal conduct. Discretionary probationary conditions include publicizing the conviction, establishing a compliance program, and notifying employees and shareholders. Corporations convicted of offenses may be placed on probation with various conditions, including notifying employees and shareholders, periodic reporting to the court, undergoing audits, and making restitution payments. Failure to comply may result in resentencing, extended probation, or additional conditions. Special assessments are imposed upon conviction at specified rates. Restitution is required for certain offenses, with varying amounts based on the severity of the crime. Compliance programs are essential for corporations to avoid penalties. A corporation without a compliance program may have one imposed during sentencing or as part of a plea bargain. Having a program can benefit a corporation during investigations and sentencing. The program should promote an ethical culture, involve senior management, minimize unethical participation, train employees, monitor and evaluate the program, and reward compliance. The Guidelines provide that a corporation may be sentenced to perform community service related to the harm caused by its offense as a probationary condition. Other probationary conditions may also be imposed to address the harm caused by the corporation's crime, including the creation of a trust fund in cases of substantial anticipated future harm. Forfeiture is the confiscation of property due to its connection to a criminal offense, governed by statutes. Some statutes are remedial, others punitive, or both. The Guidelines state that corporate property can be confiscated like individual property."
