    "content": "The \"Offshore Fairness Act of 2005\" is the short title of this Act, with the purpose outlined in Section 2. The Act aims to provide equity to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama by extending their seaward boundaries in the Gulf of Mexico to 3 marine leagues, conveying the interest of the United States in submerged land, and ensuring existing mineral leases remain valid. The Act extends seaward boundaries in the Gulf of Mexico for Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to 3 marine leagues. It conveys the United States' interest in submerged land and protects the rights of lessees, operators, and holders of easements on the submerged land. SEC. 3. SEAWARD BOUNDARY EXTENSION. Amends the Submerged Lands Act to extend seaward boundaries for Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama in the Gulf of Mexico to 3 marine leagues. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as \"existing interest,\" \"expanded seaward boundary,\" and \"expanded submerged land.\" The expanded submerged land refers to the area of the outer Continental Shelf located between 3 geographical miles and 3 marine leagues seaward of the State's coast line. The Secretary of the Interior will convey the interest of the United States in expanded submerged land to a State if certain conditions are met. The terms \"interest owner\" and \"State\" are defined in relation to this conveyance. The United States will convey its interest in expanded submerged land to a State under certain conditions, with the State assuming the powers and duties of the Secretary for existing interests. The State must not impose stricter requirements on interest owners than Federal law for leases, easements, or rights-of-way on the outer Continental Shelf. No harsher penalties can be imposed by the State compared to Federal regulations for such interests. The State must enact laws or regulations within 5 years regarding environmental protection, safety, and operations of platform pipelines on expanded submerged lands, imposing the same requirements as Federal law. The State must enact laws or regulations for determining the value of oil, gas, or other mineral production from existing interests for royalty purposes, aligning with Federal requirements for the same minerals on the outer Continental Shelf seaward of the expanded submerged land. The State laws and regulations must align with Federal laws for leases, easements, and rights-of-way on the outer Continental Shelf. Existing interests will be modified to reflect changes in Federal laws. Exceptions apply if existing Federal mineral leases would be divided by a State's expanded seaward boundary. The expanded submerged boundary of a State does not convey leased minerals to the State until the lease or unit expires. The State's seaward boundary remains the same for all purposes, including revenue distribution. If necessary, laws and regulations may not be sufficient as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will not convey expanded submerged land to a State if any law or regulation enacted by the State does not meet requirements. The State is not covered by this section for any interest issued after the conveyance of the land. The State agrees to indemnify the United States for any liability related to the conveyance of the land. The Secretary may deduct from State's oil and gas leasing revenues for any final judgment related to a taking or breach of contract. Amendment made to the Submerged Lands Act."
