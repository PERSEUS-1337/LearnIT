    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Care Consolidation and Investment Act of 1995\". Congress acknowledges the fragmentation of major child care assistance programs, leading to gaps for parents transitioning from welfare to work. Child care issues hinder 34% of poor mothers aged 21-29 from working, and 2/3 of families on Aid to Families with Dependent Children need child care to work. There is an unmet need for child care assistance, with 37 states having waiting lists. Child care is crucial for workforce participation, especially with welfare reform emphasizing work. Child care is a significant financial burden for working poor families, consuming a large portion of their income. Quality child care is lacking, with only a small percentage of day care centers meeting basic standards. This highlights the need for a central focus on quality in the United States' child care policy. The purpose of this Act is to eliminate program fragmentation, provide parental choice in high-quality child care programs, and increase the availability of affordable child care to support working families. Amendments are made to the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to address these goals. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall allocate funds for child care services through grants to States, starting at $2.3 billion in 1996 and increasing annually. Additional funds will be provided if the initial amounts are insufficient to support children whose parents are required to participate in education or job-related activities. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to require states to allocate funds for child care services through grants, with specific set-asides for quality, working families, and child care guarantee. The amendments also include provisions for assistance to low-income working families. The State must reserve at least 50 percent of the funds for child care activities to support low-income working families. The State plan must ensure coordination of child care availability with the requirements of the Social Security Act to guarantee child care assistance for parents. The State plan must reserve funds for child care activities for low-income working families and coordinate child care availability with the Social Security Act. Additionally, a matching requirement is imposed on States to provide non-Federal contributions for child care services. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to require private entities to contribute non-Federal funds equal to $1 for every $4 of Federal funds provided. The Act also increases the required funding to 50% and establishes a Quality Improvement Incentive Initiative. The Secretary will establish a child care quality improvement incentive initiative to provide funds to States showing progress in implementing innovative teacher training programs and enhanced child care quality standards. Up to $50,000,000 will be reserved annually for this initiative. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to change the percentage of funding required. Additionally, amendments are made to payment and allotment sections of the Act. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to change funding percentages. Any remaining amounts after fiscal year 1995 will be allotted to States based on a formula starting in fiscal year 1996.
