    "content": "The Act titled \"Lance Corporal Josef Lopez Fairness for Servicemembers Harmed by Vaccines Act of 2009\" provides Traumatic Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance coverage for adverse reactions to vaccinations administered by the Department of Defense. The Traumatic Servicemember's Group Life Insurance program was established in 2005 to provide short-term monetary assistance to Armed Forces members who suffer traumatic injuries, helping to alleviate financial burdens on them and their families during treatment and rehabilitation periods. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs oversees the Traumatic Servicemember's Group Life Insurance benefit and has policies for its dispensing. The Department of Veterans Affairs Insurance Center does not extend the benefit to those with life-altering disabilities from adverse vaccine reactions. Multiple cases of severe adverse reactions to vaccinations in the Armed Forces are covered under Traumatic Servicemember's Group Life Insurance guidelines. Lance Corporal Josef Lopez suffered paralysis, coma, and loss of daily activities after a smallpox vaccination before deployment to Iraq. Lance Corporal Lopez experienced severe adverse reactions to the smallpox vaccine, leading to paralysis, wheelchair-bound for a year, permanent limp, bladder control issues, and the need for daily medication to control spasms. Lance Corporal Lopez was medically retired from the Marine Corps on June 30, 2009, after experiencing severe adverse reactions to the smallpox vaccine. His mother endured substantial hardship, providing care and assistance critical for his healing. She made expensive modifications to her home to accommodate his wheelchair. Lance Corporal Lopez applied for Traumatic Servicemember's Group Life Insurance benefits due to qualifying losses, including coma, paralysis, and loss of daily activities. His family would have received $75,000 in benefits under the program. Lance Corporal Lopez's claim for Traumatic Servicemember's Group Life Insurance benefits was denied due to adverse reactions to vaccinations. This caused financial hardship for his family during his recovery process, as they were unable to receive assistance from the program designed to help families facing traumatic events. The policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs denying Traumatic Servicemember's Group Life Insurance benefits to members of the Armed Forces who experience traumatic injuries from vaccines is inconsistent with the program's intent. Amendments are made to provide coverage for such cases. Amendments are made to ensure that the Secretary shall not exclude a qualifying loss due to adverse reaction to a vaccination administered by the Department of Defense for military purposes. The effective date of these changes is retroactive to a previous act."
