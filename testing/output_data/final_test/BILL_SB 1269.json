    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 667.1 of the Penal Code is amended to refer to existing statutes as they existed on November 7, 2012, and January 1, 2017. Section 667.5 is amended to impose a three-year term for each prior separate prison term served by the defendant if one of the new offenses is a violent felony specified in subdivision (c). The law imposes additional prison terms for certain offenses, with a one-year term for each prior separate prison term served. No additional term is imposed if the defendant remained free of prison custody and felony convictions for 10 years. The law imposes additional prison terms for certain offenses, with a one-year term for each prior separate prison term served. No additional term is imposed if the defendant remained free of prison custody and felony convictions for 10 years. For the purpose of this section, a \"violent felony\" includes murder, voluntary manslaughter, and mayhem. The list of violent felonies includes murder, voluntary manslaughter, mayhem, rape, sodomy, oral copulation, lewd acts, felonies punishable by death or life imprisonment, felonies inflicting great bodily injury, using a firearm in a felony, and robbery. The list of violent felonies includes robbery, arson, sexual penetration, attempted murder, kidnapping, assault with intent to commit a felony, continuous sexual abuse of a child, carjacking, rape, spousal rape, extortion, and threats to victims or witnesses. The specified crimes that merit special consideration for imposing a sentence include first-degree burglary with another person present, violation of Section 12022.53, violation of Section 11418, and human trafficking under Section 236.1. Human trafficking under Section 236.1 involves penalties for prior prison terms only if charged and admitted or found true in the new offense. Prior prison term penalties are not imposed if the defendant did not serve a prior separate term in state prison or county jail. A prior felony conviction in another jurisdiction will be considered if the defendant served one year or more in prison for an offense that is punishable by imprisonment in California. (g) A prior separate prison term is a continuous completed period of prison incarceration imposed for a specific offense, including any reimprisonment on parole revocation without a new commitment to prison or after an escape. (h) Serving a prison term includes confinement in any state or federal penal institution as punishment for an offense, even if in a hospital or other facility credited as prison time. (i) A commitment to the State Department of Mental Health or its successor as a mentally disordered sex offender following a felony conviction exceeding one year is considered a prior prison term. (j) When a person under the custody of the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is incarcerated at a facility operated by the Division of Juvenile Justice, it is deemed as serving time in state prison. Notwithstanding certain provisions, if a new offense is committed while the defendant is temporarily removed from prison or transferred to a community facility, full enhancements apply. This does not apply if a separate term is imposed under another law. Amendments to Penal Code Section 1170.125 clarify references to existing statutes for offenses committed after January 1, 2017. Section 600 of the Harbors and Navigation Code is amended to define \"watercraft\" as any vessel designed for navigation in water. This change does not require reimbursement by local agencies or school districts under the California Constitution. Nonresident is defined as a person who is not a resident of the state at the time of an accident or claim, or who was a resident but later becomes a nonresident."
