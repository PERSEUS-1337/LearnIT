    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Domestic Violence Victim Notification Act\" and includes the establishment of a Victim Notification System under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The Attorney General may grant a private non-profit entity to create a national victim notification system (VINE system) for domestic violence. It will provide information on individuals charged with domestic violence crimes and prison inmates, including prosecution status, correctional status, assistance availability, and nearest domestic violence center location. The national victim notification system (VINE system) for domestic violence will provide information on individuals charged with domestic violence crimes and prison inmates, including trial dates, release dates, parole eligibility, and relevant data. The Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 established a national victim notification system (VINE system) for domestic violence. This system includes referrals to law enforcement or victim service organizations, a 24/7 toll-free number for victims, registration for automatic notifications of inmate changes, and safeguards for victim confidentiality. The VINE system established under the Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 includes procedures for receiving information on individuals charged with domestic violence crimes and prison inmates. It collaborates with the National Domestic Violence Hotline to provide automatic referrals for shelter and services. The National Domestic Violence Hotline provides counseling, referral services, and shelter information for battered women on a 24-hour basis. Grants for the hotline require specific agreements and a detailed operational plan. The National Domestic Violence Hotline must demonstrate expertise in domestic violence, high-quality service to victims, and plans for training, hiring, resource database maintenance, publicizing the hotline, serving non-English speakers, and facilitating access for those with hearing impairments. The National Domestic Violence Hotline must show a commitment to serving minorities, older individuals, and individuals with disabilities. The term 'prison inmate' is defined as a person convicted of a crime involving domestic violence. The Attorney General will conduct a study on integrating a national victim notification system with the National Domestic Violence Hotline, state sexual offender registration programs, and the National Crime Information Center. Results and legislative recommendations will be reported to Congress."
