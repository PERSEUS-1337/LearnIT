    "content": "According to the CDC, 1.4% of US children aged 1-5 had high lead levels in their blood between 1999-2004, which can lead to learning disabilities. The National Toxicology Program is studying the effects of lower lead exposure. Poor children are at higher risk due to lower income and nutrition. The incidence of high lead levels has decreased since 1994. The drop in blood-lead levels since 1994 may be due to successful programs aimed at reducing childhood exposure to lead sources like lead-based paint in homes. Lead poisoning can occur from normal hand-to-mouth behavior in a lead-contaminated home, affecting children under seven years old. Many older homes still have lead-based paint hazards, with about 23 million U.S. homes affected. The cost of lead-based paint (LBP) risk management in housing is a significant concern. Complete removal of LBP from homes is the best protection for children, but it is costly. The Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated an average cost of $9,000 per dwelling for inspection, risk assessment, and full abatement. The total cost of inspecting and abating hazards in all pre-1960 homes was estimated to be about $16.6 billion per year for 10 years. Abating only 2.3 million low-income housing units would cost $2.1 billion per year. The estimated cost of managing lead-based paint hazards in homes constructed before 1960 through interim measures is approximately $1.84 billion per year. If only low-income housing units are targeted, the cost would be around $230 million per year. Abatement of hazards provides both qualitative and quantitative benefits according to HUD. The Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act directs HUD to eliminate LBP hazards in public and private housing built before 1978. Reduction of hazards leads to higher IQ levels and increased lifetime earnings for children, with blood-lead concentration affecting cognitive ability and earnings. The Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act mandates risk assessments and measures to reduce lead hazards in housing built before 1978 receiving federal assistance. Inspections are required before federally funded rehabilitation, with different requirements based on the amount of federal funds received. Public Housing Authorities oversee public housing programs locally. Authorities (PHAs) administer public housing programs locally, with some being units of general local government responsible for implementing HUD's LBP testing and abatement regulations. Federal mandates related to LBP only apply to publicly owned housing receiving federal financial assistance. EPA and HUD rules govern home renovations and inspections, requiring training and certification of contractors to prevent lead exposure. The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 authorizes federal grants for state and local governments to establish LBP poisoning prevention programs. Congress has appropriated funds for state and local grants to reduce lead-based paint hazards in private housing for low-income residents since FY1992, totaling over $1.5 billion. Additionally, roughly $400 million has been allocated for related lead-based paint abatement by nongovernmental organizations under Title X. In FY2003, Congress established a third parallel demonstration program for lead-based paint abatement in major urban areas with high lead paint abatement needs. Between $45 million and $50 million annually was appropriated for these urban areas through FY2012. President Clinton's Task Force released a strategy in 2000 aiming to eliminate lead-based paint hazards to children by 2010, recommending federal funding through grants for interim measures in privately owned units. The task force recommended a 50% increase in federal grant funding under the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act, from $60 million in FY2000 to $90 million for FY2001. Congress met that goal in FY2003, FY2004, and FY2005, but funding levels fluctuated in subsequent years. Over 20 years, Congress has appropriated roughly $2.0 billion to address lead-based paint hazards in target housing. In the 112th Congress, H.R. 3325 proposed a federal initiative led by HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control to address housing-related health hazards. Additionally, H.R. 5911 / S. 2148 aimed to provide financial incentives like tax credits to reduce lead-based paint hazards in housing for low and moderate-income families with young children. In the 111th and 110th Congresses, various proposals were introduced to address lead-based paint hazards in housing, including tax credits for LBP abatement costs and requirements for risk assessments and remediation. However, none of these proposals were enacted into legislation. S. 2244 aimed to address lead-based paint hazards in housing by requiring documentation of inspections and hazard control measures in purchase or lease contracts. It also proposed grant expenditures for lead hazard reduction in housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities and directed the Department of Energy to conduct lead hazard control measures during weatherization projects. None of these provisions were enacted."
