California is a major producer of over 350 agricultural commodities, including a significant portion of tomatoes, grapes, almonds, dates, figs, olives, peaches, prunes, raisins, and milk in the US. The state leads in agricultural exports, shipping over $7 billion annually. The investment by California's farms has a substantial economic impact, emphasizing the need to support farmers for a strong industry. Since 1945, agricultural land in California has been rapidly disappearing due to various factors like soil erosion, urbanization, desert growth, and salinization. If these trends continue, California may struggle to supply food for its population and the United States, as well as export food globally. As Americans become more detached from the country's agrarian history, there is a need to educate young Americans about the fundamental importance of agriculture. Educating young Americans about agriculture and its importance is crucial for the future benefits of American society. Greater public understanding and appreciation of agriculture is needed to secure a positive future with healthy domestically produced food. The proposed National Ag Science Center in Stanislaus County, California, aims to educate and involve citizens, especially youth, in shaping the future of California agriculture. The National Ag Science Center in Stanislaus County, California aims to educate future generations about the importance of preserving agricultural land and fostering an understanding of agriculture. It will provide learning opportunities for young people to prepare them for careers in the agriculture industry. According to the Center for Public Policy Studies at California State University, Stanislaus, the center will create or support up to 359 new opportunities. The National Ag Science Center in Stanislaus County, California will create up to 359 new local jobs, generate $57,500,000 in economic activity, and support $15,200,000 in labor income through construction. It was approved by the Yosemite Community College District Board and is seen as vital for the future of agriculture in California and the United States. Assistance is provided for the establishment of the National Ag Science Center in Stanislaus County, California. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture will provide grants to the Ag Science Center, Inc. in Stanislaus County, California for the establishment of the National Ag Science Center, covering costs for design, planning, construction, furnishing, equipping, and expansion. The Center must submit a detailed proposal for grant funds, including plans for the project. The National Ag Science Center will receive grants from the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, with a limit of 33% of total costs for establishment. An authorization of $10,000,000 is allocated for grants, which will remain available until expended."
