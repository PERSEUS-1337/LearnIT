    "content": "The \"San Francisco Bay Restoration Act\" establishes the San Francisco Bay Restoration Grant Program under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The \"San Francisco Bay Restoration Act\" defines key terms such as annual priority list, comprehensive plan, and Estuary Partnership. The annual priority list is compiled by the Administrator to prioritize activities and projects for the San Francisco Bay estuary. The annual priority list compiled under the \"San Francisco Bay Restoration Act\" includes activities, projects, and studies that advance the goals of the approved comprehensive plan. It also provides information on financial assistance recipients and communities to be served, along with established criteria and methods. The Administrator consults with relevant stakeholders to develop a priority list for activities in the San Francisco Bay estuary watershed. Funding may be provided through a grant program. The Administrator may provide funding through cooperative agreements, grants, or other means to State and local agencies, special districts, and public or nonprofit agencies for activities identified on the annual priority list. The maximum amount of grants provided shall not exceed 75% of the total cost of eligible activities, with a non-federal share required for the remaining cost. Funding for activities under this section must be at least 25% from non-Federal sources. $5,000,000 is authorized annually for fiscal years 2013-2017. Up to 5% can be used for administrative expenses. The Estuary Partnership remains eligible for additional funding. No funds from this section can be used for other purposes. No funds from subsection (c) can be used for management conference administration under section 320."
