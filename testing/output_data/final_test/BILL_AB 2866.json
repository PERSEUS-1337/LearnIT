    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 38750 of the Vehicle Code in California is amended to define \"autonomous technology\" as the capability to drive a vehicle without human control. An \"autonomous vehicle\" is a vehicle with integrated autonomous technology, excluding those with collision avoidance systems that still require human monitoring. An autonomous vehicle operator is defined as the person in the driver's seat or causing the autonomous technology to engage. A manufacturer of autonomous technology is the one who equips the technology on a vehicle. Autonomous vehicles can be tested on public roads by a driver with the appropriate license. The autonomous vehicle must be operated by designated individuals, with the driver monitoring its safe operation and ready to take manual control in emergencies. Prior to testing in the state, the manufacturer must obtain insurance of $5,000,000 and provide evidence to the department. An autonomous vehicle must have certain certifications before being operated on public roads, including mechanisms for engaging and disengaging autonomous technology, visual indicators for when the technology is engaged, and systems to alert the operator of any failures. The autonomous vehicle must allow the operator to take control in various ways, meet safety standards, and alert the operator if the autonomous technology is disengaged. The autonomous vehicle must meet safety standards and have a mechanism to capture and store sensor data before a collision. The data must be retained in a read-only format for three years after the collision. The manufacturer must certify testing of autonomous technology on public roads and maintain insurance or surety bond of $5,000,000. The department will adopt regulations for insurance requirements by January 1, 2015. The department must adopt regulations for testing and operating autonomous vehicles without a driver or traditional controls by July 1, 2018. These regulations will remain in effect for four years after their adoption, and a report on the testing results must be submitted to the Legislature within six months after the regulations expire. The regulations for autonomous vehicles must include testing, equipment, and performance standards to ensure safe operation on public roads, with or without a driver. The department may consult with relevant entities for expertise in automotive technology and safety. The department may establish additional regulations for autonomous vehicles in consultation with the California Highway Patrol, including rules for registration, operator licensing, and revocation/suspension of licenses. Public hearings must be held for regulations regarding driverless operation of autonomous vehicles. The department will approve a manufacturer's application for autonomous vehicles if all necessary information and testing have been completed to ensure safety on public roads and compliance with regulations. The department may impose additional requirements for autonomous vehicles capable of operating without a driver, including the presence of a driver in the driver's seat if deemed necessary for safe operation on public roads. Approval of such vehicles will be effective no sooner than 180 days after the application is submitted, with notification to the Legislature. The manufacturer of autonomous vehicles must provide a disclosure to purchasers about the data collected by the vehicle's technology. The department may charge a fee to manufacturers for operating autonomous vehicles on public roads to cover incurred costs. Federal regulations from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration take precedence over state laws if conflicts arise. An autonomous vehicle without a driver or traditional controls can be operated on public roads for testing and operation purposes, as long as the operator can take immediate control in case of emergencies. This falls under the Autonomous Vehicle Pilot Project outlined in the Vehicle Code. The Vehicle Code outlines an Autonomous Vehicle Pilot Project for testing autonomous vehicles on public roads. The project involves the Department of Motor Vehicles, the California Highway Patrol, and manufacturers of autonomous vehicles. Three counties will be selected for road tests, with local law enforcement agencies participating. The pilot project will run from January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2018. The Autonomous Vehicle Pilot Project allows testing of autonomous vehicles without traditional controls like steering wheels or pedals. The Department of Motor Vehicles will report results to the Legislature by July 1, 2018. The division will be in effect until January 1, 2019, unless extended or repealed by a later statute."
