    "title": "AB 2463",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2699 of the Labor Code is amended to allow civil penalties to be recovered through a civil action brought by an aggrieved employee on behalf of themselves and others. \"Person\" and \"aggrieved employee\" are defined within the code. For purposes of this part, \"cure\" means the employer abates each violation alleged by any aggrieved employee, complies with the underlying statutes, and makes the employee whole. A violation of certain sections requires the employer to provide compliant wage statements for the three-year period prior to the notice. Additionally, courts can assess civil penalties in line with the Labor and Workforce Development Agency's discretion. In actions seeking civil penalties, a court may award a lesser amount if necessary to avoid unjust penalties, with a maximum of $1,000 per employee. A $500 civil penalty is established for violations when no employees are employed. If a violation occurs while employing one or more employees, the civil penalty is $100 per employee for the initial violation and $200 per employee for subsequent violations. No civil penalty is imposed for failures to act by the Labor and Workplace Development Agency. An aggrieved employee can recover a civil penalty in a civil action filed on behalf of themselves and others for violations. Prevailing employees are entitled to attorney's fees and costs. No action can be brought for certain violations unless they involve mandatory reporting requirements. An aggrieved employee cannot bring an action if the agency has already cited a person for the same violation within the specified timeframes. Civil penalties recovered by employees are distributed with 75% going to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement and education, and 25% to the employees themselves. Civil penalties recovered under subdivision (f)(1) are distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement and education. The exclusive remedy for employer liability is through workers' compensation provisions. The superior court must approve any penalties in a settlement agreement. The agency can create regulations to implement the provisions of this part, excluding workers' compensation law penalties."
