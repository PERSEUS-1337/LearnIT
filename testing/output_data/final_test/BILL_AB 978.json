    "title": "AB 978",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The purpose of Section 12300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is to provide supportive services to aged, blind, or disabled persons who are unable to perform services themselves and cannot safely remain in their homes without these services. Supportive services include domestic services, personal care, accompaniment to health appointments, yard hazard abatement, protective supervision, teaching, and paramedical services. Personal care services include assistance with ambulation, bathing, grooming, dressing, care for prosthetic devices, bowel/bladder care, skin care, feeding, respiration, medication assistance, and more. These services can be provided in the beneficiary's home or other authorized locations, such as their place of employment under specific conditions. The recipient's place of employment can be a location for personal care services if authorized and necessary to support employment, without supplanting legal obligations or accommodations required by the ADA. Personal care services at the recipient's workplace can only be authorized within the total hours approved for home care. Remuneration for supportive services is provided if the provider is unable to work full-time due to caring for the recipient's child. Providers are paid for domestic and personal care services, accompaniment to health appointments, protective supervision, and paramedical services. Respite care is also offered to reduce costs. Eligibility for services under federal waivers or other sections may limit access to certain services. All services provided under this article must be equal in amount, scope, and duration to those provided under Section 14132.95, including any adjustments. If a waiver does not extend eligibility to all persons or cover certain services, those not eligible under the waiver shall still be eligible for services under this article. The rate of reimbursement for in-home supportive services shall not exceed the rate established under Section 14132.95, and the maximum number of hours available for services combined shall be 283 hours per month."
