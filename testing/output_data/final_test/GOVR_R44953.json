    "content": "Congress has played a leading role in combating human trafficking through the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. This act established U.S. antitrafficking policy focusing on prevention, protection of victims, and prosecution of traffickers. It also mandated the Secretary of State to produce annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) reports ranking foreign governments based on their antitrafficking efforts, with Tier 1 being the best and Tier 3 the worst performers. The Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report ranks countries based on their antitrafficking efforts, with Tier 1 being the best and Tier 3 the worst performers. Tier 3 countries could face restrictions on U.S. foreign aid to motivate them to improve. Congress has made adjustments to the TIP Report over the years, including creating a special watch list for countries deserving enhanced scrutiny. In 2003, a special watch list was created for countries deserving enhanced scrutiny under the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report. Congress has made various modifications to the TIP Report over the years, including limiting the number of years a country can remain on the watch list and requiring identification of countries using child soldiers. In 2015, Congress prohibited Tier 3 countries from participating in authorized trade negotiations to link U.S. trade policy to antitrafficking outcomes. Awareness of antitrafficking best practices has led to increased expectations for governments to address human trafficking. Ongoing congressional scrutiny has led to several bills addressing the State Department's TIP Report and country ranking process. Several bills in the 115th Congress aim to modify the State Department's TIP Report, potentially complicating its methodology. The impact of these changes on countries' antitrafficking efforts and the report's credibility is uncertain. This CRS report outlines legislative provisions governing the TIP Report, reviews country ranking trends, and discusses recent congressional oversight and legislative activity. Frequently asked questions are also addressed in the report. The annual TIP Report is governed by provisions in the TVPA and CSPA, with additional reporting requirements from other acts. The TVPA mandates the Secretary of State to submit an annual report on government efforts to combat trafficking in persons by June 1 each year. The TVPA requires an annual report on government efforts to combat trafficking in persons, including country lists based on compliance with minimum standards. Tier 1 countries fully comply, Tier 2 are making significant efforts, and Tier 3 do not fully comply. The 2004 TIP Report introduced a new category of country ranking called the Tier 2 Watch List, in addition to Tier 2 and Tier 3 lists. The TVPA also requires the State Department to include information on efforts by international organizations to prevent human trafficking. The 2017 TIP Report includes information on preventing human trafficking, global patterns, emerging issues, and promising practices. The Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008 requires listing countries recruiting child soldiers, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Nigeria, and Somalia. The TVPA requires a special watch list of countries needing scrutiny, including those upgraded in the TIP Report and countries with significant numbers of trafficking victims. This list includes countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The Tier 2 Watch List includes countries with a significant or increasing number of trafficking victims and a lack of evidence of efforts to combat trafficking. This list was introduced in the 2004 TIP Report as a subset of Tier 2 countries. The TVPA requires the Secretary of State to submit an interim assessment of progress made by special watch list countries. Countries on the Tier 2 Watch List for two consecutive years may be listed as Tier 3 non-compliant countries. In the 2017 TIP Report, five countries were downgraded to Tier 3 for not making significant efforts to become compliant: China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Guinea, and Mali. The President may waive downgrades for up to two years if credible evidence justifies a waiver. In the 2017 TIP Report, nine countries received waivers to stay on Tier 2 Watch List for more than two consecutive years if they have a written plan to make significant efforts to become compliant with minimum standards for trafficking in persons. The President must provide additional information on countries upgraded from Tier 3 in the prior year's report, as required by the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015. In the 2017 TIP Report, nine countries were upgraded from Tier 3 in the 2016 TIP Report: Algeria, Burma, Djibouti, The Gambia, Haiti, Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, Suriname, and Zimbabwe. Countries are assessed on four minimum standards and 12 criteria prescribed by the TVPA. The criteria for evaluating efforts to eliminate trafficking have been modified and expanded through multiple reauthorizations of the TVPA since 2000. The TVPA, enacted in 2000, sets standards for evaluating foreign governments' efforts to combat trafficking. It outlines four minimum standards, including prohibiting severe forms of trafficking and imposing appropriate punishments. Governments must make serious and sustained efforts to eliminate severe forms of trafficking in persons, as outlined in the TVPA. This includes criteria such as enforcement and prosecution of traffickers and protection of victims. The TVPA outlines criteria for governments to combat severe forms of trafficking in persons, including protecting victims, preventing trafficking, international cooperation, extradition, and human rights protections. The TVPA outlines criteria for governments to combat severe forms of trafficking in persons, including protecting victims, preventing trafficking, international cooperation, extradition, and human rights protections. Governments are evaluated on trafficking patterns, human rights protections, enforcement against public officials, treatment of foreign victims, and partnerships in combating trafficking. The TVPA established criteria for governments to combat trafficking, including partnerships with the United States and progress in eliminating trafficking. Foreign assistance may be withheld from Tier 3 countries not meeting these standards. The United States withholds nonhumanitarian, non-trade-related foreign assistance from Tier 3 countries that do not comply with minimum standards for eliminating trafficking and are not making significant efforts to do so. This restriction on aid began with the 2003 TIP Report and includes various forms of funding such as foreign assistance, arms sales, educational exchange programs, and funding from multilateral development banks. The International Monetary Fund defines nonhumanitarian, non-trade-related foreign assistance as assistance authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, excluding certain types of assistance such as disaster relief, antiterrorism assistance, refugee assistance, and humanitarian aid. The TVPA authorizes the President to withhold funding for participation by officials or employees of Tier 3 in educational and cultural exchange programs, as well as instructing on aid restrictions for nonhumanitarian, non-trade-related foreign assistance. The TVPA authorizes the President to withhold funding for participation in educational and cultural exchange programs by Tier 3 countries, as well as instructing on aid restrictions for nonhumanitarian, non-trade-related foreign assistance. The TVPA authorizes the President to withhold funding for education and cultural exchanges, loans, and other funds provided by multilateral development banks and the International Monetary Fund. Aid restrictions may be imposed in response to human rights violations, with considerations for compliance, national interest concerns, and selective waiver options. The TVPA allows the President to waive aid restrictions for national interest concerns, including specific programs. The President can also waive aid restrictions on Tier 3 countries, with a certification required to ensure no assistance goes to those involved in trafficking. Countries using child soldiers are barred from certain security assistance. Countries using child soldiers are prohibited from receiving certain types of security assistance, including excess defense articles, international military education and training, peacekeeping operations, foreign military financing, and direct commercial sales of military equipment. There are exceptions to these restrictions, such as for peacekeeping operations that support military professionalization and human rights. The Child Soldiers Prevention Act prohibits certain security assistance to countries using child soldiers, with exceptions for peacekeeping operations that support military professionalization and human rights. Assistance for international military education, training, and nonlethal supplies to child soldier countries may continue for up to five years with presidential certification. The President may waive security assistance restrictions if deemed in the national interest. The Child Soldiers Prevention Act allows for waivers of security assistance restrictions if in the national interest, with a notification to Congress. Reinstatement of assistance is possible if the country takes steps to stop using child soldiers. The 2017 Department of Defense Appropriations Act and Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act contain provisions prohibiting certain security assistance from supporting military training or operations involving child soldiers. Countries listed under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act may not receive funds for such activities unless the President issues a waiver. The Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 restricts trade authorities procedures for countries listed as Tier 3 in the TIP Report, unless concrete actions are taken to address human trafficking. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 allows negotiations with Tier 3 countries under certain conditions. The Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 restricts trade authorities procedures for Tier 3 countries in the TIP Report unless concrete actions are taken to address human trafficking. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 allows negotiations with Tier 3 countries under certain conditions. The TVPA created the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (J/TIP) within the State Department, responsible for overseeing the annual TIP Report publication and identifying countries recruiting child soldiers. The TIP Report covers country developments from April to March each year, based on various sources like U.S. embassies, NGOs, and news articles. Information is gathered through meetings with government officials, NGOs, journalists, and survivors. Congress added a new criterion for governments to achieve full compliance with minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking. The State Department collects data on trafficking investigations, prosecutions, convictions, and sentences to achieve compliance with minimum standards for eliminating human trafficking. This information is included in the annual TIP Report, which involves a global information gathering process and drafting led by relevant departments. The annual TIP Report involves a global information gathering process and drafting led by J/TIP, with input from U.S. diplomatic missions and bureaus. The rush to meet deadlines has caused tensions, leading to changes in the report draft cycle. The State Department requests information from NGOs to assess governments' compliance with trafficking standards. Internal process changes have been identified by the OIG. The J/TIP Office made internal process changes that reduced tier ranking disputes. Country rankings are not formula-based, giving State Department officials discretion. Disputes between regional bureaus and J/TIP decreased from 46% in 2006 to 22% in 2011. In 2015, 17 countries had tier-ranking disputes, with J/TIP winning only three. In 2015, the J/TIP Office had tier-ranking disputes with 17 countries, winning only three, the worst ratio in its 15-year history. Countries like China, Cuba, India, Malaysia, Mexico, and Uzbekistan received better rankings than recommended. J/TIP typically wins more than half of tier-ranking disputes, but the specific number of disputes preceding the 2016 TIP Report was not disclosed by J/TIP Director Susan Coppedge in her testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In 2017, Secretary of State Tillerson overruled his staff's assessments and removed Burma and Iraq from the child soldiers list. Advocacy groups have suggested including Afghanistan on the list, but Tillerson decided to leave it off due to pressure from the Pentagon. This decision was criticized by many observers. The TIP Report is seen as a credible reflection of global efforts to address human trafficking, but some criticize its methodology and tier rankings. The State Department's tier ranking designations are based on country-specific considerations, giving officials discretion. The 2016 GAO report assessed the TIP Report and country ranking procedures, noting both praise for its thoroughness and criticism for being subjective and influenced by political pressures. The 2016 GAO report criticized the State Department for lacking consistent explanations for upgrades and downgrades in the TIP Report, hindering stakeholders' understanding and use of the report as a diplomatic tool. Despite not being legally required, the State Department publicly releases the report annually, albeit missing the June 1 deadline. The TIP Report is annually released with provisions for translation and an award ceremony for combating trafficking in persons. The Secretary of State is required to translate applicable parts into multiple languages, focusing on nondemocratic countries. The report's release is connected to the Presidential Award for Extraordinary Efforts to Combat Trafficking in Persons. The TIP Report's release is tied to an annual award ceremony for combating trafficking in persons. The report serves as a foreign policy tool to encourage countries to address human trafficking through country rankings and monitoring progress. It can be used as a form of soft power to shame or blacklist countries. The TIP Report serves as a tool to pressure countries for policy change. In 2017, 36 countries were ranked Tier 1, but over 80% remained noncompliant with standards. Some countries, like Armenia, Guyana, Israel, and South Korea, improved their rankings over the years. South Korea improved from Tier 3 to Tier 1 in 2002. Other countries like Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus, Hong Kong, and Hungary have fluctuated between Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 2 Watch List over the years. In 2016, Hungary, Iceland, Mauritius, Morocco, Nepal, and Nigeria experienced changes in their human trafficking tier rankings. Several countries remained unchanged in their Tier 1 or Tier 2 status. The State Department's TIP Report is eagerly awaited in Congress each year, with oversight and evaluation through hearings, GAO reports, and legislation. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee holds closed briefings with officials before the report's release and public hearings afterward. The House Foreign Affairs Committee, especially its Subcommittee on Africa, also plays a role in the process. The House Foreign Affairs Committee, including its Subcommittee on Africa, has hearings on the TIP Report. The GAO has issued reports with recommendations, some of which are pending. Legislation in the 115th Congress, such as H.R. 2200, aims to modify requirements related to the TIP Report's country ranking process. Other bills introduced in the same Congress also seek to make changes to the TIP Report requirements. Legislative proposals aim to modify the TIP Report's methodology to reduce political interference, increase transparency, and enhance congressional oversight. Changes to the Tier 2 Watch List include reducing the maximum number of years a country can remain on the list from four to three. Legislative proposals aim to modify the TIP Report's methodology, including conditions for countries on the Tier 2 Watch List and justifying their listing. Some bills also seek to define key terms in the TVPA. Some legislative proposals aim to modify the TIP Report's methodology by redefining key terms and criteria used to evaluate countries' efforts to combat human trafficking. These changes could have a significant impact on the report's effectiveness as a tool. Some countries criticize the current ranking process of the TIP Report as opaque and may prefer more detailed instructions for assigning tier rankings. Additional transparency in the rankings and country narratives could clarify expectations for future upgrades. Countries with limited resources may struggle to prove progress in combating human trafficking. Changes to the ranking process could lead to more countries falling to Tier 3, raising questions about potential foreign aid restrictions or the use of waivers to mitigate poor rankings."
