Since the 2003 war in Iraq, millions of Iraqis have fled their homes due to violence, with over 2.7 million internally displaced. The influx of refugees has strained neighboring countries, leaving many vulnerable Iraqis without basic necessities. Poverty and despair are increasing among the displaced. The humanitarian crisis in Iraq and its neighbors is escalating, leading to increased poverty and despair among displaced populations. This situation may create opportunities for extremist groups to recruit. The United States has not yet revealed a long-term strategy to address the mass displacement of Iraqis, both within Iraq and as refugees in neighboring countries, which could further destabilize the region. The Sense of Congress is stated in Section 3. The Sense of Congress in Section 3 emphasizes the importance of addressing the needs of refugees from Iraq and vulnerable Iraqis, highlighting the role of US leadership in providing humanitarian assistance and funding requests from international organizations. The United States should develop a long-term humanitarian strategy in coordination with Iraq, host countries, and other organizations to assist vulnerable Iraqis, including refugees and internally displaced persons, ensuring their safe and voluntary return. The United States should rely on assessments of the UNHCR and develop a comprehensive humanitarian strategy to address the crisis facing refugees from Iraq and internally displaced persons. SEC. 4. DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL STRATEGY. The Secretary of State, in consultation with other federal agencies, will develop a regional strategy to address the mass displacement of Iraqis as refugees. The strategy will focus on challenges such as lack of legal status, limited UNHCR resources, and inadequate support for refugees in host countries. The curr_chunk highlights the urgent humanitarian needs of vulnerable Iraqis, including inadequate resources for NGOs, limited access to education and healthcare, food shortages, and shelter issues. It also emphasizes the responsibility of the Government of Iraq and the United States to provide support. The curr_chunk focuses on providing bilateral assistance and contributions to organizations aiding vulnerable populations in Iraq, including refugees. It also includes plans for admitting and resettling Iraqi refugees in the United States to maintain the traditional share of refugee admissions worldwide. The curr_chunk outlines the necessary conditions for the safe return of displaced Iraqis, steps taken to engage the international community, and plans to assess the impact of the strategy. The curr_chunk focuses on the requirement for reports. The Comptroller General of the United States will provide recommendations on addressing the humanitarian situation for vulnerable Iraqis by April 15, 2009. The Secretary of State will submit a comprehensive regional strategy by June 1, 2009, with proposed timelines and budgets.
