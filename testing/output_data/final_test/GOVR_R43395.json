    "content": "This report analyzes legislative efforts in Congress to delay the phase-out of subsidized flood insurance premiums mandated by the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2012. The law extended the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for five years and introduced reforms affecting flood insurance, mapping, and management. Concerns about affordability and balancing solvency with actuarial full-risk rates policies are discussed. The report examines changes in the NFIP's premium rate structure, focusing on key differences between Sections 100205 and 100207 of the Biggert-Waters Act. It also discusses the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 and legislative actions related to flood insurance. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was established in 1968 to provide flood insurance to property owners in communities that adopt flood mitigation measures. Currently, the NFIP has 5.6 million policies covering $1.2 trillion in almost 22,000 communities. The program collects $3.5 billion in annual premium revenue and saves the nation an estimated $1.6 billion annually in flood losses avoided. Flood insurance premium rates are based on risk and actuarial principles. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was established in 1968 to provide flood insurance based on risk and actuarial principles. Congress later amended the Act to allow FEMA to offer subsidized rates for pre-FIRM structures, with the intention of distributing the financial burden of flood recovery among floodplain residents. The NFIP's provision creates an inability to collect full risk-based premiums on 1.1 million policies, impacting the program's ability to pay future claims. Actuarial shortfall has drawn scrutiny due to catastrophic flood events, future flood risk uncertainty, and budgetary consequences of emergency appropriations. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, the NFIP could cover costs by borrowing from the Treasury and repaying with interest. In 2012, Congress passed legislation to address the National Flood Insurance Program's long-term solvency due to increased vulnerability to catastrophic flood events. The nation is facing more frequent and severe extreme weather events, leading to significant borrowing from the U.S. Treasury to pay claims. This follows a history of borrowing for events like Hurricanes Andrew, Katrina, and Sandy. In 2012, significant NFIP borrowing from the U.S. Treasury was needed to meet contractual obligations for flood damage losses. Pre-FIRM subsidized properties contributed to a disproportionate share of total flood losses. By the end of 2013, the NFIP had $24 billion in debt. Efforts in Congress to reform and modernize the NFIP were driven by concerns over the program's fiscal unsoundness and growing exposure to coastal flooding. Key issues included the gradual elimination of pre-FIRM premium subsidies and grandfather policies. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 addressed key issues such as flood risk exposure, cost of flooding, premium rate changes, and affordability of flood insurance. It aimed to make the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) financially sustainable by reauthorizing it for five years and implementing significant program changes. The NFIP's risk assessment and pricing model is based on a hydrologic model for estimating flood damage and insurance rates. FEMA classifies properties based on flood risks using specific risk zones, elevation relative to Base Flood Elevation, and occupancy type. The NFIP's risk assessment and pricing model is based on a hydrologic model for estimating flood damage and insurance rates. FEMA classifies properties based on flood risks using specific risk zones, elevation relative to Base Flood Elevation, occupancy type, and other determinants of risk. Flood risk zones are modeled using various data sources, and property owners in high-risk zones are required to purchase flood insurance. Residents in low-risk areas have the option to purchase insurance, typically a low-cost Preferred Risk Policy. \"FEMA conducts Flood Insurance Studies nationwide to identify flood hazards, assess risk, and designate insurance zones. BFEs are determined in consultation with local officials. Prior to the Biggert-Waters law, FEMA used subsidized rates and actuarial full-risk rates based on flooding probability and damage estimates.\" Subsidized rates are available for properties constructed or substantially damaged before December 31, 1974, or the effective date of the initial FIRM. Grandfathered rates are offered for properties in compliance with the flood map at the time of construction, keeping rates reflecting that compliance even if later maps increase premiums. Rates are also available for structures later remapped into high-risk zones based on average cross-subsidized rates. FEMA establishes cross subsidies within classes of structures to maintain actuarial integrity of rate structure. Actuarial rates estimate flood risk based on hydrologic method of ratemaking using data on floods, damage, and accepted actuarial principles. FEMA's rate-setting methodology is based on a hydrologic/financial model developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1966. The FEMA flood risk model combines estimated flood probabilities with expected damage to set property rates based on flood risk. Probabilities are based on flood elevation values relative to BFE, varying across risk zones. PELV tables provide detailed information on flood frequency by zone. FEMA also calculates structural damages. The FEMA flood risk model calculates structural damages based on flood probabilities and depth-damage relationships. DELV values represent the average percentage of property value damaged at each foot increment of flood level. Pricing for flood insurance is determined by converting expected damages to expected loss per $100 of property value covered. After the enactment of Biggert-Waters, FEMA implemented an \"elevation rating\" process that considers the elevation of all structures, including pre-FIRM properties. Owners of pre-FIRM properties must now provide elevation certificates to ensure accurate flood insurance rates. FEMA states that pre-FIRM subsidized properties paid less than actuarial rates and were not required to submit elevation certificates before. The key issue is the affordability of flood insurance for these properties. The reforms to the NFIP's premium rate structure have caused affordability issues for pre-FIRM properties due to the consideration of flood damage factors. The removal of subsidies and discounts has led to large and potentially unaffordable rate increases for these properties, making it challenging for some homeowners to sell their homes. Members of Congress have responded to the effects on policyholders. The removal of pre-FIRM premium subsidies and grandfathered policies has impacted policyholders' affordability of flood insurance. Legislative measures may be needed to roll back premiums or extend the transition to full-risk rates. FEMA is authorized to phase out subsidies by increasing rates 25% annually until reaching full-risk rates for certain properties. Structures affected include non-primary residential properties. The change affects various types of structures, including non-primary residential properties, business properties, severe repetitive loss properties, and properties with NFIP claim payments exceeding fair market value. FEMA no longer offers subsidized rates for certain pre-FIRM policies, requiring owners to submit an Elevation Certificate for full-risk rating. Subsidized policies on properties not insured by NFIP are impacted. FEMA phased out subsidized policies for various property types starting in 2013. This included non-primary residential properties, businesses, severe repetitive loss properties, and properties with NFIP claim payments exceeding fair market value. Subsidized policies on properties not insured by NFIP were also affected. Starting in 2013, FEMA phased out subsidized policies for various property types, including businesses, severe repetitive loss properties, and properties with NFIP claim payments exceeding fair market value. Pre-FIRM subsidized policies renewing after October 1, 2013, saw 25% annual premium rate increases until reaching average risk premium rates. The amendments made by the Biggert-Waters Act became effective 90 days after enactment, except for properties not covered by NFIP policies or purchased after the Act's enactment date. Primary residences with existing policies maintained subsidized premiums until property changes occurred. The Biggert-Waters Act, enacted in 2013, allows policyholders to keep subsidized premiums until property is sold or coverage lapses. FEMA charges full-risk rates for sold properties or new policies. Section 100207 phases in full-risk rates over five years for policyholders in areas with revised FIRMs. Pre-FIRM subsidized properties affected by map changes will see 20% annual premium increases until reaching full-risk rates. The elimination of subsidies for some pre-FIRM policies does not affect grandfathered procedures, except for changes in FEMA's eligibility rules and rates. New policies can still use grandfathered procedures, except for buildings constructed before December 31, 1974, or before the community's initial FIRM, previously rated with subsidized rates. The recent law prohibits FEMA from implementing changes until after FY2015. The recent law prohibits FEMA from implementing changes until after FY2015. There is no change to the NFIP grandfathered procedures for post-FIRM or non-subsidized pre-FIRM buildings rated using the \"continuous coverage\" procedure. The NFIP grandfathered procedure for \"continuous coverage\" cannot be used for policy assignments of pre-FIRM properties in certain flood zones. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 prohibits FEMA from implementing the \"grandfather\" provision of the Biggert-Waters Act. This law requires FEMA to cease any current planning and development related to Section 100207. The Omnibus does not roll back any flood insurance rate increases that have already occurred. FEMA will delay implementing Section 100207 until 12 to 18 months after the start of FY2015. Sections 100231 through 100237 of the Biggert-Waters Act authorized studies and reports on flood risk mapping and affordability frameworks for NFIP. FEMA is required to conduct an economic analysis of the costs and benefits of a flood. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is conducting an economic analysis of flood insurance programs with risk-based premiums and federal assistance. FEMA is required to submit a report on this study to Congress within 270 days of the Biggert-Waters Act. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is conducting an economic analysis of flood insurance programs with risk-based premiums and federal assistance. Phase 1 of the study will focus on designing alternative frameworks for conducting a benefit-cost analysis, including methods for establishing an affordability framework, data issues, assumptions and definitions, and analytical methods. In Phase 2 of the study, researchers will analyze the entire federal costs of flooding when comparing the NFIP affordability program to one with vouchers. The design alternatives will consider costs and benefits to the federal government, individuals, and communities. FEMA's rate-setting process has allowed rates below full cost for some structures built before the community's initial FIRM. Congress approved changes under Biggert-Waters to make flood rates more accurately reflect the true risk of flooding. Approximately 19% of the NFIP's policyholders receive subsidized premium rates, with immediate rate increases for non-primary residences, businesses, and severe repetitive loss properties under the law. Subsidized primary residences will remain subsidized unless sold or the policy lapses, while subsidized condominiums and non-condo multifamily structures will keep their subsidies. NFIP's debt to the U.S. Treasury stands at about $24 billion. The Biggert-Waters Act made changes to flood insurance rates to reflect true risk. Approximately 19% of NFIP policyholders receive subsidized rates, with immediate increases for certain properties. Subsidies for primary residences remain unless sold or policy lapses, while condominiums and multifamily structures keep subsidies. Owners of pre-FIRM properties may face unaffordable full-risk rates requiring Elevation Certificates. Tables compare premium rates before and after the Act's implementation. The Biggert-Waters Act changed flood insurance rates to reflect true risk, leading to immediate rate increases for some properties. Owners of pre-FIRM properties now face unaffordable full-risk rates based on flood risk zones, particularly affecting urbanized coastal communities. Critics argue that the law does not address affordability concerns for existing policyholders. The law authorized studies on the effects of charging premium rates reflecting full flood risk. Critics argue that using elevation rating on older homes in high-risk zones could harm policyholders. Supporters of delaying rate increases point out FEMA's lack of data on policyholders' ability to pay. Proponents of eliminating subsidized rates highlight the burden on taxpayers. The NFIP's burden on taxpayers is highlighted by proponents of eliminating subsidized rates. They argue that transitioning to actuarial rates would ensure property owners pay premiums reflecting their flood risk, reducing taxpayer costs and discouraging building in flood-prone areas. Some states are considering ways to incentivize private insurers to enter the flood insurance market, such as Florida publishing pure loss cost data for private firms to use in setting rates. Mississippi Insurance Department filed a lawsuit against FEMA over Biggert-Waters law changes. The plaintiff in a lawsuit against FEMA argues that affordability studies required by the Biggert-Waters law should be completed before new flood insurance rates are established. Several states, including Alabama, Louisiana, Florida, and Massachusetts, have supported the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, claiming that FEMA failed to consider affordability and actuarial principles when setting new premium rates. FEMA's new premium rates were criticized for not considering actual risk and actuarial principles. FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate denied a connection between the affordability study timing and rate implementation. In a lawsuit, FEMA argued that Congress mandated transitioning subsidized rates to actual risk-based rates. Long-term NFIP goals include increasing private-sector involvement in flood insurance sales and promoting technological innovations in risk assessment. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a study on NFIP-privatization, with experts suggesting strategies to promote private flood insurance sales. These strategies include eliminating subsidized rates, funding means-based subsidies, and federal reinsurance. The Wharton School proposed long-term insurance as an alternative to annual catastrophe risk financing. Members of Congress are exploring alternative insurance policies to reduce costs for policyholders agreeing to scheduled payouts linked to flood risk. The Biggert-Waters Act led to increased debate about affordability and the feasibility of balancing program solvency concerns against marketability of actuarial full-risk rates policies that now consider the elevation or height of the structure. H.R. 3370 and S. 1846 were introduced to delay the phase-out of subsidized flood insurance premiums and grandfathered policies. The House may vote on passing H.R. 3370 with an amendment to delay certain provisions of the Biggert-Waters Act. The substitute bill would remove coverage lapses, home sales triggers, and new policy rate increases for primary residences. It would also restore NFIP grandfather procedures and impose annual premium increases and surcharges on policies. H.R. 3370 proposes annual premium surcharges on NFIP policies, transfer of flood risk to private markets, reimbursement for successful map appeals, and establishment of a Flood Insurance Advocate within FEMA. The Senate passed S. 1926 to delay rate increases under the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014. The Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 aims to delay rate increases for six months after FEMA proposes an affordability framework or certifies a flood mapping approach. The bill also includes a report to Congress on methods for establishing an affordability framework for NFIP. The Congressional Budget Office has not released a score on the bill yet. The CBO has provided scores for two bills, S. 1846 and S. 534, which make up the two titles of S. 1926. S. 1846 would result in the NFIP borrowing and spending an additional $900 million over the 2012-2018 period, with no net effect through 2024. S. 534 would increase revenues by $490 million and direct spending by $483 million, reducing the deficit by $7 million over the 2014-2023 period. S. 1926, consisting of S. 1846 and S. 534, would delay flood insurance rate increases for certain properties, including grandfathered properties and pre-FIRM properties not insured or with lapsed policies. This would result in a reduction of the deficit by $7 million over the 2014-2023 period. FEMA prohibited from removing premium subsidies on lapsed policies. S. 1926 delays flood insurance rate increases until FEMA proposes affordability framework and implements credible flood mapping. Section 103(c) requires rate structure reform for pre-FIRM properties. FEMA proposes draft affordability framework and Congress implements flood mapping approach. H.R. 3370 and S. 1926 address flood insurance affordability concerns for various types of properties. Uncertainty remains regarding affordability and actuarial adequacy of full-risk premium. Flood risk is highly uncertain and potentially catastrophic. The draft affordability framework authorized by H.R. 3370 and S. 1926 aims to address the affordability of flood insurance sold under the NFIP. It considers federal costs of flooding and the need for a public decision-making framework to tackle uncertainty in flood risk exposure. Future legislation may be required to implement recommendations from the affordability study. The phase out of pre-FIRM subsidies for flood insurance will impact about 438,000 policies covering businesses, second homes, and severe repetitive loss properties. Another 715,000 policies for primary residence homes were expected to be affected in 2014 before Congress intervened. The availability of flood insurance helps communities enforce NFIP flood mitigation requirements, but this leverage could be reduced by implementing actuarial ratings for certain properties. The potential impact of eliminating pre-FIRM subsidies for flood insurance will affect a significant number of properties, including businesses, second homes, and severe repetitive loss properties. Property owners are concerned about changes in property values and tax revenues, as well as the adverse effects of elevation rating. The transition to actuarial risk-based rates for certain properties is a key issue addressed in H.R. 3370 and S. 1926. H.R. 3370 and S. 1926 address the transition to actuarial risk-based rates for certain properties, including second properties, SRL properties, properties with claim payments exceeding fair market value, and commercial properties. Key differences include H.R. 3370 allowing premium subsidies for new policies and grandfathered policies, and permitting assumption of existing policies at subsidized rates for property purchasers. H.R. 3370 and S. 1926 propose changes to flood insurance policies, including offering high loss-deductible options and delaying rate increases. H.R. 3370 also refunds premiums for policyholders affected by new rates. H.R. 3370 and S. 1926 propose changes to flood insurance policies, including new premium rates effective from January 1, 2012, and October 1, 2013. It imposes a new premium surcharge for residential and non-residential properties, implements a flood mapping approach for NFIP, allows FEMA to transfer flood risk to private reinsurers, and permits states to regulate private flood insurance. H.R. 3370 does not create the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers. The delay proposed in S. 1926 would postpone premium adjustments in flood insurance until FEMA meets specific requirements, addressing concerns about affordability in high-risk flood zones. Congressional debate focuses on balancing affordability with the NFIP's fiscal solvency and exploring innovative approaches to minimize future flood damages. Innovative approaches to minimize future flood damages include strengthening FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Assistance programs. Congress debates balancing affordability with the NFIP's fiscal solvency and the use of elevation rating for flood insurance coverage. Resolving affordability tensions may require a three-pronged policy analysis approach. The first policy analysis approach is to determine the scope of the affordability problem associated with the transition toward full-risk rates for flood insurance. Policy makers need to consider best practices in quantifying and mapping flood risks to address these policy questions. The second policy analysis approach could be to find ways to reconcile the NFIP's long-standing ratemaking procedures to address the affordability issue. The third policy analysis approach involves exploring alternative risk-financing options and ratemaking approaches to spread risk without borrowing from the U.S. Treasury, aiming to make insurance policies more marketable to policyholders. The third policy analysis approach aims to spread risk without borrowing from the U.S. Treasury, making insurance policies more marketable to policyholders. It includes exploring alternative risk-financing options and ratemaking approaches."
