    "content": "The President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 into law, which includes the FY2008 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, along with emergency military funding for Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress appropriated $54.637 billion for various federal departments and agencies under this act. In January 2008, the House Appropriations Committee issued a committee print on the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, with detailed funding tables and additional information for various federal departments and agencies. Representative David Obey inserted an explanatory statement on the FY2008 omnibus spending measure into the Congressional Record. Table 2 shows funding levels for departments and related agencies under the House and Senate CJS Appropriations Subcommittees for FY2007 enacted, FY2008 requested, FY2008 House-reported and -passed, FY2008 Senate-reported and -passed, and FY2008 enacted. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-161), Congress provided $54.637 billion in CJS appropriations, with increases for the Department of Commerce and Department of Justice compared to FY2007 levels and the President's FY2008 request. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-161) provided $54.637 billion in CJS appropriations, with increases for the Department of Commerce and Department of Justice compared to FY2007 levels and the President's FY2008 request. The act includes $23.380 billion for science agencies, $1.173 billion more than FY2007 (an increase of 5.3%) but $364.3 million less than the President's FY2008 request (a decrease of 1.5%). For related agencies, the act includes $808.8 million, $8 million more than FY2007 (an increase of 1.0%) and $46.2 million more than the President's FY2008 request (an increase of 6.1%). The House Appropriations Committee reported an FY2008 CJS appropriations bill (H.R. 3093) with $55.975 billion for FY2008, $3.132 billion more than FY2007, and $2.621 billion more than the FY2007 request. The House passed H.R. 3093 on July 26, 2007, with $10 million less than the reported bill but included a provision to increase funding for the Crime Victims Fund. The House-passed bill for FY2008 CJS appropriations would provide $55.965 billion, a 5.9% increase over FY2007, and a 4.7% increase over the Administration's request. It includes $7.018 billion for the Department of Commerce, $23.974 billion for the Department of Justice, and $24.127 billion for science agencies. The House-passed bill for FY2008 CJS appropriations included $24.127 billion for science agencies, $845.7 million for related agencies, and $56.58 billion for CJS departments and agencies as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate-passed bill for FY2008 CJS appropriations, H.R. 3093, provided $57.7 billion, including $1 billion for NASA's return to flight initiative and a provision exempting certain H-2B workers from the visa cap. The House-passed bill did not include a similar provision. The Senate-passed bill for FY2008 CJS appropriations, H.R. 3093, included $56.7 billion, with $1 billion for NASA's return to flight initiative. It provided increases for the Department of Commerce, Department of Justice, and science agencies compared to FY2007 levels and the President's FY2008 request. The Senate-passed bill for FY2008 CJS appropriations, H.R. 3093, included $56.7 billion, with increases for related agencies compared to FY2007 levels and the President's FY2008 request. A conference meeting on H.R. 3093 was cancelled due to objections to language prohibiting the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from using funding to initiate civil actions against employers requiring employees to speak English at work. The H-2B visa cap exemption was not included in the conference version of H.R. 3093, leading to no further action on the bill. Congressional leaders used H.R. 2764 for the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 instead. In the 110th Congress, parallel jurisdictions were created for the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittees. The jurisdiction for the Judiciary was transferred to the Transportation and HUD Appropriations Subcommittees, while certain science agency appropriations were moved to the former CJS subcommittees. This included agencies like NASA and NSF. In the Senate, the Department of State jurisdiction was transferred to the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee. In the House, it remained under the renamed SSJC Appropriations Subcommittee. Congress passed the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007 for FY2007 funding. In FY2007, funding for CJS agencies was provided through the Appropriations Resolution, 2007 and the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007. Congress allocated $52.843 billion in CJS appropriations, a 4.8% increase from the previous year. Funding trends for major agencies in CJS appropriations from FY2002 to FY2008 are shown in Table 3. Department of Commerce funding increased by 14.1% from FY2002 to FY2005, decreased by 1.9% in FY2006, then increased in FY2007 and FY2008. Department of Justice funding decreased by 17.1% from FY2002 to FY2003 due to a transfer to Department of Homeland Security, but increased by 20.1% from FY2003 to FY2008. Science agencies funding increased by 15.8% from FY2002 to FY2006, decreased in FY2007, and increased in FY2008. Key issues in Department of Commerce may be considered in FY2008 budget deliberations. Key issues affecting funding priorities in the FY2008 budget deliberations include proposed increases for the Census Bureau in preparation for the 2010 Census, efforts to combat intellectual property infringement abroad, and enforcement of trade remedy laws against unfair foreign competition by U.S. trade agencies and the PTO. The anniversary of hurricanes Katrina and Rita may also highlight the Department's weather and ocean-stewardship programs. The Administration's budget request includes proposals to revamp programs under the Department of Commerce, consolidate activities under a Regional Development Administration, limit access to fees collected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, fund the Advanced Technology Program, and consolidate NOAA programs under a single authorizing law. Funding levels for NOAA satellite programs, ocean research, and Tsunami projects are also being considered. The FY2008 DOJ appropriations included issues such as ATF sharing gun-trace data, declining federal funding for law enforcement assistance, and the American Competitiveness Initiative aiming to boost research and education funding. Declining federal funding for state, local, and tribal law enforcement assistance remained a concern for Congress due to recent increases in violent crime rates. The Administration proposed reducing funding for these programs and consolidating grants, but Congress rejected these proposals. Additionally, the DEA faced hiring freezes and proposed agent reductions, which Congress opposed by providing additional funding to lift the freeze. The proposal aimed to reduce \"hollow\" DEA positions and increase funding to lift the hiring freeze, restoring DEA's ability to support state and local law enforcement in combating drugs. Key issues included President Bush's \"Vision for Space Exploration,\" potential personnel cuts in NASA programs, servicing the Hubble Space Telescope with the space shuttle, and funding for research on global warming. The Department of Commerce's origins date back to 1903, with its establishment in 1913. The Department of Commerce, established in 1913, has various responsibilities focused on promoting U.S. business, improving technological competitiveness, encouraging economic development, fostering environmental stewardship, and providing statistical information on the economy and population. Agencies within the department, such as the International Trade Administration and the Economic Development Administration, carry out these missions. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides grants for economic development projects in distressed communities; Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) promotes investment in minority businesses; Economic and Statistical Analysis Programs offer timely economic data and analytical support; Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) conducts analysis; Bureau of the Census collects economic, demographic, and social data; National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) advises on communications policy and manages radio frequency spectrum. The Technology Administration advocates integrated policies to maximize technology's impact on economic growth, develops technology, and disseminates technological information. The National Institute of Standards and Technology assists industry in improving product quality and modernizing manufacturing processes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides expertise to promote safe marine and air navigation and assess coastal and marine resource health. The FY2008 enacted appropriation for the Department of Commerce was $6.856 billion, a 3.5% increase from FY2007. The Senate passed a total of $7.289 billion for FY2008, while the House passed $7.018 billion. The President's request for FY2008 was $6.596 billion, representing a decrease from the FY2007 appropriation. The House passed $7.018 billion for FY2008 for the Department of Commerce, $393.7 million more than FY2007. The International Trade Administration (ITA) aims to improve U.S. prosperity by strengthening industry competitiveness, promoting trade, and ensuring fair trade practices. ITA consists of four policy units: Manufacturing and Services, Market Access and Compliance, and Import Administration. The International Trade Administration (ITA) is responsible for administering trade remedy laws and promoting trade opportunities. The FY2008 enacted appropriation for ITA is $413.2 million, including $405.2 million in direct appropriation and $8 million in anticipated fee receipts. This is $9.6 million more than FY2007 and $6.8 million less than the Administration's request. The FY2008 budget for the International Trade Administration (ITA) was $413.2 million, with $8 million in anticipated fee collections. The President's request was $412.4 million, $16.8 million higher than FY2007. The Senate approved $417.4 million, $21.8 million more than FY2007, while the House approved $422.4 million, $26.8 million more than FY2007. Both chambers anticipated $8 million in fee collections. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) collects $8 million in fees, the same as the Senate amount and $5 million less than the budget request. BIS administers export controls on dual-use goods and technology, cooperates with other nations on export control policy, and assists the U.S. business community to comply with export controls. It also administers U.S. anti-boycott statutes and monitors the U.S. defense industrial base. Authorization for BIS activities expired in August 2001, but President Bush invoked authorities to continue controls. The FY2008 enacted appropriation for the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is $72.9 million, $2.5 million less than FY2007. The President's FY2008 request was $78.8 million, with funding divided between licensing, enforcement, and management. $14.8 million was requested for Chemical Weapons Convention enforcement. BIS also proposed consolidating contract management functions with the Department of State. The BIS aimed to reduce its management and policy coordination budget by $955 thousand. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $78.8 million for FY2008, which was approved. The EDA's mission is to assist economically distressed areas in generating new jobs and retaining existing ones. Congress rejected Administration proposals to consolidate EDA assistance programs and reduce funding for them. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Congress allocated $279.9 million for the Economic Development Administration (EDA), with $30.8 million for salaries and expenses and $249.1 million for assistance programs. This includes funding for public works grants, economic adjustment assistance, planning assistance, trade adjustment assistance, technical assistance, research, and the Global Climate Change Mitigation Incentive Fund. The amount for EDA assistance programs is $79.1 million more than the Administration's FY2008 request but $1.6 million less than the FY2007 appropriation. The FY2008 appropriation for the Economic Development Administration (EDA) is $279.9 million, with $30.8 million for salaries and expenses. The Consolidated Appropriations Act directs EDA to distribute all economic development assistance program funds to the six regional offices within 30 days. Concerns were raised about the potential consolidation or elimination of regional offices, leading to a directive to maintain all six offices. The Senate-approved bill directed the Economic Development Administration (EDA) to prioritize projects that diversify local economies, support new industry clusters, promote innovation and technology transfer, and commercialize university-led research. The FY2008 budget requested $202.8 million for EDA, with $32.8 million for salaries and expenses and $170 million for a Regional Development Account. The bill did not include a study on the impact of the 2005 hurricanes on industry clusters in the Gulf Coast region. The Administration's proposed consolidation of economic adjustment and defense economic adjustment assistance programs aimed to streamline application processes for EDA grantees in distressed rural communities. The $170 million request for EDA assistance programs was $80.7 million less than the FY2007 appropriation. The proposal also included the creation of an Office of Regional Affairs (ORA) to administer the new program, potentially leading to the consolidation of EDA's six regional offices. The Senate-approved bill for FY2008 would have provided $282.8 million for EDA, including $32.8 million for salaries and expenses and $250 million for assistance programs. This amount would have allocated funds for various grants and assistance programs, with the Senate rejecting the Administration's RDA proposal and expressing concerns about the distribution of funds among EDA's regional offices. The Senate report for FY2008 expressed concern about the distribution of EDA funds among the six regional offices. It directed the Administration to disperse funding in accordance with account levels and required EDA to notify the Senate Appropriations Committee when all grant funds had been distributed. The House-passed bill for FY2008 allocated $302.8 million for EDA, with $32.8 million for salaries and expenses and $270 million for assistance programs, including various grants and initiatives. The House-approved funding level for EDA assistance programs in FY2008 was $270 million, $20 million more than the Senate recommendation, $100 million more than the Administration's request, and $19.3 million more than the previous year. The bill included $32.8 million for salaries and expenses and a new initiative called GCCMIF, aimed at funding projects promoting sustainable resource conservation and reducing energy consumption and harmful gas emissions. The House also directed EDA to develop criteria for evaluating GCCMIF applications within 90 days of the act's enactment. The MBDA, established in 1971, aims to provide technical assistance to minority business owners to become suppliers to private corporations and the government. The FY2008 appropriation is $28.6 million, slightly less than the previous year. Progress will be measured in terms of entrepreneurial parity and growth in gross receipts, employees, and firm size. The FY2008 budget for the MBDA is $28.6 million, slightly less than the previous year. The Senate recommended $30.2 million, the House passed $31.2 million. Both chambers emphasized funding for Native American Business Development Centers. The Economic and Statistical Analysis division provides economic data and forecasts to government agencies and the public. The Economic and Statistical Analysis division, part of the ESA, has a FY2008 enacted appropriation of $81.1 million, with a requested increase to $85.0 million. The Senate and House recommended funding amounts close to the President's request, with additional funds allocated for a study by the National Academy of Sciences. The House committee recommended $86.5 million, including $1.5 million for regional datasets. The Bureau of Economic Analysis accounted for $81 million of the FY2008 administration request. The BEA has four core programs supporting agencies and policymakers with economic data. The National Economic Accounts aid in federal budget projections, balance-of-payments data are needed for exchange rates, regional data allocate federal funds, and industry accounts compile datasets for various uses. The Bureau of the Census was established in 1902. The Bureau of the Census, established in 1902, conducts a census every 10 years and collects various demographic, economic, housing, and governmental data. In FY2008, the Census Bureau received $1.230 billion, with $202.8 million for salaries and expenses and $1.027 billion for programs, reflecting preparations for the 2010 census. In FY2008, the Census Bureau received $1.230 billion, with $797 million allocated for preparations for the 2010 census. This includes conducting a dress rehearsal, improving the geographic database, and implementing the American Community Survey to replace the long form in 2010. In FY2008, the House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.232 billion for the Census Bureau, with $196.8 million for salaries and expenses. The committee instructed the Bureau to discontinue the Dynamics of Economic Well-being Survey and focus on restoring the Survey of Income and Program Participation. Additionally, the committee recommended $1.035 billion for periodic programs, with a requirement to include \"some other race\" as a category in census data collection. Representative Shelley Moore Capito offered an amendment to reduce funding. Shelley Moore Capito's amendment reduced funding for the Census Bureau's FY2008 periodic programs account by $10 million and increased funding for the Justice Department's Southwest Border Prosecutor Initiative by the same amount. This resulted in the House approving $1.222 billion for the Bureau instead of the committee-recommended $1.232 billion. The reduction would eliminate the Industrial Reports Program, quarterly financial reports, and the Survey of Business Owners and Self-Employed Persons. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.246 billion for the Bureau in FY2008, with $226.2 million allocated for salaries and expenses. The Senate approved additional funding for the Census Bureau's salaries and expenses account in FY2008, with a recommendation to fund a SIPP sample size of 45,000 in 25 states. The full Senate also approved amounts for periodic programs, which were $29.4 million more and $5 million less than those passed by the House. Senator Richard Shelby's amendment was also approved to prevent $10 million of the Commerce Department's FY2008 appropriations. The Senate approved additional funding for the Census Bureau in FY2008, including a SIPP sample size increase. Senator Richard Shelby's amendment blocked $10 million of the Commerce Department's appropriations until the Bureau provides a report on internet access for census completion. The NTIA advises on telecommunications issues and funds research grants for new technologies. The NTIA manages federal use of radio frequency spectrum domestically and internationally. The FY2008 enacted appropriation is $36.3 million, with two major components: Salaries and Expenses and the Public Telecommunications and Facilities Program (PTFPC). The Bush Administration recommended $18.6 million for Salaries and Expenses, while Congress approved $17.5 million. The Bush Administration requested the elimination of funding for the Public Telecommunications and Facilities Program (PTFPC), arguing that most construction and refurbishing of public telecommunications facilities has been completed. Congress disagreed for FY2008, citing the need for upgrading public broadcasting facilities as the deadline for converting analog broadcasts to digital approaches. Congress funded the program at $18.8 million for FY2008. Additionally, the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act created a Digital Transition and Safety Public Fund to offset receipts from auctioning licenses for the electromagnetic spectrum recovered from discontinued analog signals. The 2005 Deficit Reduction Act created a Digital Transition and Safety Public Fund to offset receipts from auctioning licenses for the electromagnetic spectrum recovered from discontinued analog signals. The initial auction was held on January 24, 2008, with proceeds funding various programmatic functions at NTIA, including a digital-analog converter box program, public safety interoperable communications grants, New York's 9/11 digital transition funding, assistance to low-power television stations for converting to digital transmission, a national alert and tsunami warning program, and funding to enhance a national alert system as stated in the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004. The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is responsible for examining and approving patent applications and administering trademarks. It is funded by user fees and has a budget authority of $1.916 billion for FY2008, with existing fee increases mandated to continue. The FY2008 appropriations bill provided the USPTO with a budget authority of $1.916 billion and mandated that fee increases from 2005 and 2006 remain in effect. There is controversy over limiting the USPTO's use of fee collections, with opponents arguing for immediate financing of agency operations and proponents advocating for budget balancing. The Technology Administration and the Office of the Under Secretary for Technology in the Department of Commerce advocated national policies to foster technology development and stimulate economic growth. The Office managed the activities of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Technical Information Service. Funding for the Office decreased by 66% in FY2007 and was not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. The President's FY2008 budget proposed a 20% decrease in funding for the Technology Administration. The FY2008 appropriations bill, H.R. 3093, initially included $1 million for the Technology Administration to eliminate the Under Secretary for Technology position. The Senate version of H.R. 3093 did not provide funding for the Technology Administration, which is part of the Department of Commerce's NIST laboratory. NIST's role is to enhance U.S. companies' competitiveness by supporting industrial development and disseminating government-developed technological advances. The FY2007 appropriation for NIST was $676.9 million, with funding for internal research and development increasing to $434.4 million. The Advanced Technology Program received $79.1 million, while $104.7 million was allocated for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 provided NIST with $755.8 million, an 11.7% increase from FY2007. The Technology Innovation Program (formerly the Advanced Technology Program) received $65.2 million in appropriations, 17.6% less than the previous fiscal year. Funding for MEP totals $89.6 million, 14.4% less than FY2007 but 93.5% more than the budget request. Support for construction almost triples to $160.5 million, more than 1\u00bd times the original budget proposal. The Administration's FY2008 budget request for NIST was $640.7 million, 5.3% less than FY2007, primarily due to the absence of support for ATP and reduced funding for MEP. The STRS account would have increased 15.2% to $500.5 million. The FY2008 budget request included no funding for ATP and MEP would have been reduced 55.8% to $46.3 million. Construction expenses would have increased 60.0% to $93.9 million. The House-passed FY2008 appropriations bill, H.R. 3093, would have provided NIST with $831.2 million, including $500.5 million for the STRS account. Funding for ATP would have increased to $93.1 million, MEP to $108.8 million, and construction budget to $128.9 million. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3093 would have appropriated $863.0 million for NIST. The House-passed FY2008 appropriations bill would have provided NIST with $832.2 million, including funding for the STRS account, ATP, MEP, and construction budget. The bill included stipulations for ATP awards and increased support for various programs. The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) provides seed financing for businesses and consortia to develop generic technologies with broad applications. Critics view ATP as corporate welfare, while supporters argue it helps businesses, especially small manufacturers, develop crucial technologies. Despite ongoing funding challenges, ATP has assisted in industrial competitiveness. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not fund ATP in their version of the measure. Funding for the program in FY2006 was 41% less than in FY2005, and remained the same in FY2007. The Technology Innovation Program replaced ATP with reduced support, focusing on small and medium-sized firms. The budget for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, another NIST-administered program, has been debated since FY2004. Congressional support for MEP has been consistent, but federal funding decreased in FY2004. Funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) has fluctuated over the years, with a significant reduction in FY2004. However, funding was restored in FY2005 and remained stable in FY2006 and FY2007. In FY2008, funding was reduced by 14.4% to $89.6 million. The American Competitiveness Initiative aims to double funding for innovation-enabling research at NIST over 10 years. In FY2008, Congress addressed concerns about funding for NIST's internal research programs, providing a 1.4% increase to $440.5 million in the STRS account. This was lower than the Administration's proposed 15.2% increase. NOAA's mission is to understand and predict environmental changes and manage coastal resources. In FY2008, Congress addressed concerns about NOAA funding by restoring key programs such as meteorological satellites and ocean research. Funding levels for NOAA are shown in Table 5, including enacted amounts for FY2007 and FY2008. In FY2008, Congress approved $3.897 billion for NOAA, with funding levels slightly below FY2007 enacted levels. The appropriations included $2.86 billion for the ORF account, $979 million for the PAC account, and $64 million for NOAA's Other Accounts. This funding represented a middle ground between the FY2008 request and House-approved levels. Congress appropriated larger increases for the NOAA satellites program, except for the GOES-R funding which was reduced due to the cancellation of a planned suite of instruments. Funding was provided for the National Weather Service to expand the Urbanet III network, with a slight overall decrease compared to the President's request. Additionally, $20.1 million was allocated for the NOAA Marine Fisheries Service to support fishermen in marine conservation areas. In FY2008, Congress allocated $5.9 million for a National Academy of Sciences study on climate change, $34.1 million for NOAA education programs, and $500 thousand for Western Pacific Fishery Demonstration Projects. The House-passed bill would have provided $3.95 billion for NOAA, a 3.7% increase from the FY2008 request. In FY2008, Congress allocated $127.8 million, which was 1.0% less than the FY2007 funding level. This amount was $230 million less than the Senate-approved $4.18 billion. The House approved $2.851 billion for ORF, $1.039 billion for PAC, and $60.8 million for NOAA's Other Accounts. Additionally, $6 million was allocated for a Climate Change Study Committee, $23 million for NOAA Satellite Services, and $31.2 million for coastal and outer continental shelf hydrographic surveys. The House-passed bill for FY2008 included $37.7 million for NOAA education and outreach programs, $140 million for climate change research grants, $64.8 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund, and $15 million for the Coastal Estuarine Land Conservation Program. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3093 would have provided $4.185 billion for NOAA. The Senate report criticized NOAA's ocean policy reform efforts and allocated $795 million for the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative (JOCI), but Congress approved around $511 million for JOCI. Funding was mainly for existing programs and a few new starts, with a focus on NOAA satellite program deficiencies and climate change research. The Senate report supported increased funding for NOAA satellite system acquisitions and climate data preservation. They approved $425 million for open competitive grants, with $140 million allocated for climate change programs. Both the Senate and the House approved $20.3 million for the Pacific Region Center in Hawaii. Additionally, the Senate called for a Disaster Response Center in the Gulf of Mexico with $11.3 million in funding. The Senate report language supported increased funding for NOAA satellite system acquisitions and climate data preservation. They approved $425 million for open competitive grants, with $140 million allocated for climate change programs. The Senate also called for a Disaster Response Center in the Gulf of Mexico with $11.3 million in funding. Additionally, budget baselines for Marine Sanctuaries and the NOAA Coastal Service Center were increased by conferees on H.R. 2764 in the explanatory statement tables for NOAA's FY2008 appropriation. The Senate approved various amendments to H.R. 3093, including funding for NOAA satellite program, safety requirements for divers, relief for fisheries in Marine National Monument, and bycatch reduction devices for shrimpers. The NOAA request for FY2008 was the largest in the Department of Commerce, accounting for 58% of the budget. The President's FY2008 budget request for NOAA was $3.809 billion, a 6% decrease from FY2007 appropriations. The budget proposed savings of $30.2 million from underperforming programs. NOAA's Administrator stated that the request was a consensus to fund ongoing activities. Funding priorities included enhancing personnel and core mission areas. Enhance personnel and core mission areas to improve safety of NOAA Corps officers. Reprogram funds within NOAA Satellite Service to prioritize launch of polar orbiting Prime (N') in 2009 for continuity of meteorological observations. Fund President Bush's Ocean Action Plan for ocean-related activities and research. Request new funds for operation and maintenance. In FY2008, Congress considered legislation to establish NOAA in the Department of Commerce, define its mission, and emphasize marine ecosystem-based management. They provided additional resources for key programs and activities beyond the President's requests. In FY2008, Congress provided additional funding for key programs and activities of importance in their home districts, including regional economic issues, disaster recovery, and environmental concerns such as atmospheric pollution and climate change. The enacted FY2008 amount for Departmental Management is $70.0 million, which is less than the FY2007 enacted amount and the President's request. In FY2008, Congress provided additional funding for key programs and activities, including $23.4 million for the Office of Inspector General and $4.3 million for renovation of the department's headquarters. The President's FY2008 budget included $1 million for the Coordination Council and no funding for United States Travel and Tourism Promotion. The Senate passed $82.7 million for Departmental Management, $4.7 million less than the President's request. The House bill included $46.5 million for Departmental Management, $40.9 million less than the Administration's request. It also allocated $3.4 million for renovations to the Herbert C. Hoover Building. P.L. 110-69 (H.R. 2272) America COMPETES Act authorized funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through 2010 and created new manufacturing R&D programs. The America COMPETES Act authorized funding for NIST through 2010 and established new manufacturing R&D programs. It included the Technology Innovation Program and was signed into law on August 9, 2007. H.R. 21, the Oceans Conservation, Education, and National Strategy for the 21st Century Act, was introduced on January 4, 2007. Title II of the Oceans Conservation, Education, and National Strategy for the 21st Century Act proposes to establish the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) within the Department of Commerce, authorizing its programs and activities under a single law. It outlines NOAA's mission, including research and development, education, and services, and mandates the creation of a NOAA Science Advisory Board. Additionally, the act requires National Academy of Sciences reviews of NOAA activities and a reorganization plan. The Oceans Conservation, Education, and National Strategy for the 21st Century Act proposes establishing NOAA within the Department of Commerce, outlining its mission, requiring a reorganization plan, and emphasizing ecosystem-based management. The act also mandates an annual assessment of NOAA's effectiveness, notification to Congress before making any facility changes, and setting conditions for developing major programs. A hearing on H.R. 21 was held by the House Resources Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Oceans on April 26, 2007. The Stimulation Act of 2007 authorizes funding for NIST through 2010 and creates new manufacturing R&D programs. The America Creating Opportunities to Promote Excellence in Technology Act authorizes appropriations for NIST through FY2011 and establishes a new manufacturing R&D program. Several CRS reports provide overviews of NIST, the Advanced Technology Program, the Export Administration Act, and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program. The Department of Justice, established in 1870, provides legal counsel and law enforcement for citizens, representing the federal government in legal proceedings. It offers legal advice to the President and executive branch department heads. The Department of Justice provides legal counsel and law enforcement, offering advice to the President and executive branch department heads. DOJ agencies like United States Attorneys prosecute criminal offenses, United States Marshals Service provides security for the federal judiciary, and the FBI investigates federal criminal law violations.
