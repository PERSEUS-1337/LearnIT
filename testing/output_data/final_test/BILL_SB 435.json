    "title": "SB 435",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Department of Food and Agriculture will establish a Medical Cannabis Cultivation Program for the cultivation of medical marijuana. A person must obtain a license from the city or county and a state license to cultivate medical marijuana. To apply for a state license for medical marijuana cultivation, one must first obtain a permit from the local city or county allowing cultivation. The proposed cultivation must comply with local ordinances and regulations, and not be prohibited by the local jurisdiction. A city, county, or city and county can issue or deny a permit for medical marijuana cultivation, subject to local regulations. The intended cultivation site may be inspected before permit issuance. A state medical marijuana cultivation license must be obtained after local permit approval. Cultivation is not allowed without both a local permit and a state license. A city, county, or city and county issuing conditional licenses for medical marijuana cultivation must notify the department. Local permit requirements must meet or exceed state licensing standards. If a city or county lacks regulations for marijuana cultivation, the division becomes the sole licensing authority starting March 1, 2016. The secretary has the authority to create and enforce regulations for implementing this part, including applicant requirements, collections, reporting, refunds, and appeals. Emergency regulations can also be enacted if necessary, following specific procedures for immediate public safety and welfare. The secretary can collaborate with a county agricultural commissioner to implement regulations for medical marijuana cultivation, with compensation from collected fees. The department will establish a unique identification program for medical marijuana, considering water use and environmental impacts, in consultation with relevant agencies. The department will establish a program for unique identification of permitted medical marijuana plants at cultivation sites. Unique identifiers, such as zip ties, will be attached to each plant and issued only to appropriately licensed individuals. Information related to the identifier and licensee will be included in a trace and track program. The department may charge a fee for issuing unique identifiers for medical marijuana plants and enforcing regulations. Protections against fraud and illegal diversion of identifiers must be established. Cities and counties issuing cultivation licenses must notify the department and adhere to department requirements for unique identifiers. The section exempts qualified patients and primary caregivers cultivating marijuana for personal medical use from certain restrictions based on the cultivation area and purpose. The area used for cultivating marijuana is measured by the aggregate area of live marijuana plants. Exemption from these requirements does not restrict local jurisdictions from imposing their own regulations. The Legislature aims to collaborate with various stakeholders to establish consistent payment methods for chronic care management and support patient-centered medical homes. The Legislature aims to exempt activities from antitrust laws for this act, but not authorize violations of such laws. They also intend to displace competition and actively supervise anticompetitive conduct.

Chapter 3.5 is added to Division 20 of the Health and Safety Code to establish a Patient Centered Medical Home Health Care Delivery Model. The Secretary of California Health and Human Services will convene a working group to align incentives in support of patient centered medical homes. The working group will consult with the Legislature and state agencies on implementing the model. The working group has the authority to develop strategies for implementing the patient-centered medical home care model, create alignment on payment and infrastructure, utilize purchasing power, and propose participation in federally funded projects. The secretary will convene the group once sufficient nonstate funds are secured."
