    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Global Poverty Act of 2005\". Congress finds that over one billion people worldwide live on less than $1 per day, with another 1.6 billion struggling on less than $2 per day. The United States, along with 180 other countries, committed to improving the lives of the world's poorest by 2015 at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000. Goals include reducing poverty, hunger, child mortality, ensuring education for all, and combating HIV/AIDS and malaria. President George W. Bush emphasized the fight against poverty as a means to combat terror and uphold human dignity. The 2002 National Security Strategy of the United States highlighted the moral imperative of including all of the world's poor in development and opportunity. The bipartisan Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks recommends a comprehensive U.S. strategy to counter terrorism, including economic policies that encourage development and opportunities for people to improve their lives. The G-8 nations committed to increasing aid to Africa and canceling debt obligations for the world's poorest nations. The United States has acknowledged the need for increased financial and technical assistance to help the world's poorest nations burdened by extreme poverty. This includes initiatives like the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003, the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, and trade preference programs for developing countries such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The United States prioritizes reducing global poverty and eliminating extreme poverty in developing countries. A comprehensive strategy must be developed to achieve this goal. The President, with input from various entities, will develop a strategy to reduce global poverty. This strategy will include specific goals and timelines. The strategy to reduce global poverty includes goals, benchmarks, and timetables to fulfill the commitment of reducing poverty by half. It should adhere to guidelines such as continued investment in existing initiatives related to international poverty reduction. The African Growth and Opportunity Act aims to increase US development assistance, improve its effectiveness, enhance debt relief, leverage trade policy for economic development, coordinate efforts with various stakeholders, mobilize businesses and NGOs, and align poverty reduction with other development goals. The African Growth and Opportunity Act focuses on achieving development goals like combating diseases, improving access to water and sanitation, reducing hunger, and integrating sustainable development principles into policies and programs. The President is required to submit reports to congressional committees describing the strategy outlined in the Act. The President must report to congressional committees on the progress of implementing the strategy for global poverty reduction objectives until 2015. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. \"Extreme global poverty\" is defined as living on less than $1 per day, while \"global poverty\" is living on less than $2 per day, both adjusted for purchasing power parity in 1993 USD according to World Bank statistics."
