It requires federal employees to determine if information created qualifies as a federal record and outlines how records are collected, retained, and eventually archived by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). This report answers common questions about recordkeeping laws, regulations, and policies in the federal government, excluding requirements for Congress, the Supreme Court, the President, or the Architect of the Capitol. The Federal Records Act of 1950 empowers the Archivist of the United States to manage federal agency records efficiently. It requires federal employees to determine if information created qualifies as a federal record and outlines how records are collected, retained, and eventually archived by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The report does not cover laws and regulations governing access to and protection of federal records, nor federal record classification and declassification policies. P.L. 113-187, the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014, amended the definition of federal records to include all recorded information made or received by a Federal agency under Federal law or in connection with public business. The amended definition of federal records under P.L. 113-187 shifts the focus from physical storage media to the actual information stored, regardless of format. The Code of Federal Regulations further clarifies that the format used to create the information does not impact its classification as a federal record. The Archivist of the United States also emphasizes that the system used to create the record is not a determining factor. The Archivist of the United States has the authority to determine whether recorded information, regardless of format, constitutes a federal record. The Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 amended the definition of what does not constitute a federal record. The definition of what does not constitute a federal record includes library and museum material for reference or exhibition purposes, duplicate copies kept for convenience, and non-record materials like copies kept for reference or museum materials for exhibit. If an agency is unsure if an item is a record, NARA's regulations require treating it as a record. The final determination by the Archivist on recorded material being a record is binding on the agency. Items not considered records are to be managed accordingly. The Presidential Records Act (PRA) governs the collection, preservation, and access to records of a former President. These records are not subject to the Federal Records Act (FRA) requirements. Presidential records are defined as documentary materials created or received by the President, his immediate staff, or the Executive Office of the President. The Presidential Records Act (PRA) governs records created or received by the President, his staff, or the Executive Office of the President. Some components of the Executive Office are governed by the PRA, while others are governed by the Federal Records Act (FRA). For example, the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of the Vice President fall under the PRA, while the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy are generally governed by the FRA. The Presidential Records Act (PRA) governs records created or received by the President, his staff, or the Executive Office of the President. The central differences between the PRA and the Federal Records Act (FRA) are the permanence presumption of presidential records and the PRA governing access to presidential records. All presidential records are provided to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) when the President leaves office for public access at a presidential library. Only 2%-3% of federal records are transferred to NARA for permanent retention under the FRA, which focuses on records management. The Federal Records Act (FRA) focuses on records management, archival preservation, collection, and retention. It mandates federal agencies to maintain records documenting their organization, functions, policies, decisions, and transactions. The Freedom of Information Act governs access to federal records, while the FRA defines a federal agency as any executive agency or establishment in the legislative or judicial branch. The Federal Records Act (FRA) applies to various government entities, including Cabinet departments, independent agencies like the EPA and the Federal Reserve, and some legislative branch entities. It does not cover the records of Congress, but information sent from Congress to the executive branch may be considered federal records under the FRA. The Code of Federal Regulations outlines the specific records required to adequately document agency business, including documenting persons, places, things, or matters dealt with by the agency, facilitating action by agency officials, enabling scrutiny by Congress, protecting government and individual rights, documenting policies and decisions, and recording important meetings. The Federal Records Act mandates federal agencies to create and preserve records that document their organization, functions, policies, decisions, and transactions to protect legal and financial rights. Agency heads must maintain an efficient records management program with controls over record creation, maintenance, and use, cooperating with the Archivist to improve record management standards. Federal agencies are required to establish standards, procedures, and techniques for managing records to ensure their authenticity, reliability, and usability throughout their retention period. This includes assigning records management responsibility, issuing directives for recordkeeping programs, integrating records management into electronic information systems, providing guidance and training to personnel, and developing records schedules for all records. The agency must develop records schedules for all records and obtain NARA approval before implementation. They must also conduct formal evaluations of their records management program, identify specific categories of records, specify materials for preservation, and distinguish records from nonrecord materials. The agency must develop records schedules for all records and obtain NARA approval before implementation. They must also comply with laws and requirements for records scheduling and disposition, ensure departing officials do not remove federal records, and define recordkeeping responsibilities for various staff. NARA's regulations emphasize the importance of accurate and complete recordkeeping by all employees, including the authenticity, protection, and retrieval of electronic records. The Presidential and Federal Records Act of 2014 adds additional responsibilities for federal employees using certain e-mail accounts for official business. The Federal Records Act places restrictions on federal employees using non-official electronic messaging accounts for official business, requiring emails to be forwarded to an official account within 20 days. Definitions for \"non-official electronic messaging account\" and \"official electronic messaging account\" are not provided, but the content of the information, not the platform, determines if it qualifies as a federal record. The Federal Records Act restricts federal employees from using non-official electronic messaging accounts for official business. The terms \"official electronic messaging account\" and \"non-official electronic messaging account\" do not determine if a record qualifies as a federal record. Congress could consider amending the law to ensure all qualifying federal records are captured, or agencies could require records from accounts without automated archiving to be forwarded to those with such technology. An agency can transfer inactive records to an archival center after approval from the Archivist. After 30 years, most agency records are disposed of or transferred to NARA. Agencies can destroy temporary records without permanent value in compliance with regulations. NARA must report to Congress on record disposal. Paper records cleared for destruction must be sold or destroyed by authorized means. Agencies must work with NARA to determine federal record status. When information is deemed a federal record, agencies collaborate with NARA to decide if it holds permanent value. The FRA does not mention \"temporary records\" but allows NARA to authorize the destruction of records lacking sufficient value. NARA defines temporary records as those with insufficient value for preservation. Permanent records are those designated as such on NARA's records management form. Records scheduled by agencies in consultation with NARA determine the disposition of federal records, whether temporary or permanent. This can be done through a standardized form approved by NARA, a General Records Schedule (GRS) issued by the Archivist, or a published agency manual with NARA-approved records descriptions and disposition instructions. The disposition of federal records is determined by NARA-approved descriptions and instructions on standardized forms or in the GRS. All federal records must have a NARA-approved disposition authority to be considered of permanent utility. Agencies create records schedules by analyzing recordkeeping requirements, preparing inventories, and evaluating the period of time each record series is needed based on various factors. The process for determining the disposition of federal records involves specifying retention periods, identifying if records are temporary or permanent, compiling a schedule with descriptions and disposition instructions, and submitting the standard form to NARA for approval. The record schedule includes details on each type of record and whether they are to be discarded or permanently retained by NARA. The Federal Records Act requires agency heads to establish safeguards against the removal or loss of records and inform employees of penalties for unlawful removal or destruction. If unlawful removal is suspected, the agency head must notify the Attorney General for investigation and recovery efforts. Failure to report such incidents may result in the Archivist initiating action with the Attorney General for record recovery. The Archivist is also required to notify Congress of any necessary actions taken. The Federal Records Act mandates penalties for unlawfully concealing or destroying federal records, with fines and imprisonment up to three years. Those convicted can also lose their federal office and be disqualified from holding it in the future. The Act governs the collection, retention, preservation, and disposal of federal records, while the Freedom of Information Act provides public access to executive branch records, with exemptions for certain categories. The Federal Records Act mandates penalties for concealing or destroying federal records. It governs the collection, retention, preservation, and disposal of records, while the Freedom of Information Act provides public access to executive branch records with exemptions for certain categories. The FRA ensures proper collection and retention of materials for administering FOIA and other records access laws."
