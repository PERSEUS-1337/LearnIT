    "content": "SECTION 1. APPEALS PROCESS. Section 1 outlines the appeals process. An amendment to Section 8118 establishes a 90-day time period for the Secretary of Labor to make an initial decision on a claim filed by an employee. Failure to meet this deadline results in the claimant receiving further payment until a decision is reached. Employers and agencies are prohibited from delaying or obstructing the filing of claims. The amendment to Section 8123 requires employees to undergo physical examinations by a designated physician when ordered by the administrative law judge. A second opinion is necessary before surgery, except in urgent situations. Legal and medical examinations are only required if there are questions regarding the injury's nature or work-related cause. The amendment to Section 8123 allows employees to have their own physician present during physical examinations ordered by the administrative law judge. In case of disagreement between the Secretary's physician and the claimant's physician, a list of 3 physicians will be provided for the claimant to choose from for a final examination. The claimant's physician will have access to the same information as the Secretary's physician. The Secretary will set physician fees to match those allowed for claimants' physicians. Medical bills must be paid within 60 days, except during initial claims processing. Appeals for an oral hearing must be made within 180 days of an initial decision, with the hearing to be held within 90 days of the request. Compensation will be reinstated if the hearing is not held within the specified timeframe. The claimant's authority during a hearing includes the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses and present evidence. The employer is not allowed at the hearing but can comment on the transcript. The claimant's attorney is entitled to a fee of 15 percent of benefits awarded, except in cases where the claimant prevails in a Federal court decision under chapter 7. In such cases, the attorney's fees are paid by the Secretary if the Secretary's position was found to be unjustified. Section 8128 is amended to allow the Secretary to only end, decrease, or increase compensation by meeting a burden of proof standard, with the claimant having the right to petition for review of adverse decisions. The claimant has the right to petition for review of adverse decisions with new legal arguments or evidence. Decisions on petitions for review must be made within 90 days. The Secretary of Labor provides vocational rehabilitation services to permanently disabled claimants upon request. Federal employers must prioritize placing injured workers in suitable positions based on their pay at the time of injury. Retaliation or discrimination against claimants for filing compensation claims is prohibited. The Secretary of Labor offers vocational rehabilitation services to permanently disabled claimants upon request. Reemployment and vocational rehabilitation services are provided to permanently disabled claimants upon request."
