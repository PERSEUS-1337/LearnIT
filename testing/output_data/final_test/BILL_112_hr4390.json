Revenues at large for-profit education companies mainly come from Federal Government student aid programs. In 2009, students at for-profit institutions received billions in Federal Pell Grants and loans. For-profit colleges were major recipients of Post-9/11 Educational Assistance funds. During the 2-year period from August 1, 2009, to July 30, 2011, for-profit colleges received $280 million out of $563 million in military tuition assistance. Additionally, in fiscal year 2009, 15 companies that heavily relied on Federal student aid programs spent $3.7 billion on advertising, marketing, and recruitment, while 30 companies operating for-profit institutions spent $4.1 billion on the same activities. In fiscal year 2009, for-profit institutions of higher education spent $4.1 billion on advertising, marketing, and recruitment. An analysis of 8 publicly traded companies in the same sector showed they allocate 31 percent of expenditures to these activities. These institutions have sophisticated marketing plans and employ large sales forces to enroll as many students as possible, including veterans and servicemembers. An undercover investigation in 2010 found misleading recruitment practices at 15 for-profit higher education campuses. Documents provided to the HELP Committee reveal that for-profit higher education institutions use Federal funds to pay recruiters who exploit emotional vulnerabilities of prospective students to meet enrollment targets. These institutions also employ a large sales staff, including thousands of enrollment advisors, to maximize student enrollment. The HELP Committee found that for-profit higher education institutions have a disproportionate number of enrollment advisors compared to staff providing student support services like job placement. SEC. 2. RESTRICTIONS ON FUNDS FOR RECRUITING AND MARKETING. Section 119 of the Higher Education Opportunity Act is amended to include restrictions on sources of funds for recruiting and marketing activities. An institution of higher education cannot use Federal educational assistance funds for such activities. The Higher Education Opportunity Act prohibits the use of Federal educational assistance funds for recruiting and marketing activities at institutions of higher education. Covered activities include advertising, promotion, efforts to attract prospective students, and contact regarding enrollment or financial assistance. The curr_chunk discusses activities related to applying for grants, loans, or work assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965, including overseeing enrollment, contacting potential students, and soliciting contact information. These activities are outlined as permissible under the Act. The curr_chunk outlines additional activities authorized by the Secretary of Education, such as promoting education or military-related associations. Exceptions are specified for activities required by the Higher Education Act of 1965 or authorized by the Secretary. Federal educational assistance funds refer to funds provided to institutions or students under specific laws. The curr_chunk specifies provisions of law under which institutions can receive federal educational assistance funds, including Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and various chapters of title 38 and title 10 of the United States Code. It also clarifies that the section does not limit institutions from using revenues from non-Federal sources. Each institution receiving Federal educational assistance funds must report annually to the Secretary and Congress their expenditures on advertising, marketing, and recruiting."
