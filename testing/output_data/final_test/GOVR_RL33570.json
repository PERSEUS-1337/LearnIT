This deficit has grown to 6.2% of GDP in 2005, leading to the U.S. becoming a large net debtor. Despite the increase in external debt, there is a paradox in U.S. international transactions. The U.S. current account has shifted from a surplus to a deficit, reaching nearly $900 billion in 2006, representing 6.2% of GDP. Despite the increase in external debt, the investment income component of the current account has remained in surplus, fluctuating between $4 billion and $37 billion over the past 25 years. This enduring surplus means the U.S. has been borrowing without significant debt service costs. The United States has a surplus in investment income balance despite being a large net debtor. This suggests that the US is an economic net creditor to the rest of the world and is bearing no debt service cost on its large external debt. This paradox raises questions about concerns regarding US international imbalances. A 2005 study by economist William Cline explains the external debt paradox and the limited impact of large current account deficits on the US economic debt service payments. It highlights valuation changes and asymmetrical capital returns as factors that have helped mitigate the effects of the deficits. The US earns a higher rate of return on its foreign investments than foreigners earn on their US investments, leading to an increase in the price of US assets relative to liabilities over time. The valuation effect on the U.S. net asset position is significant due to the higher incidence of equities in U.S. foreign assets compared to liabilities, and the differential currency denominations. This results in the appreciation of U.S. foreign assets relative to liabilities when the dollar depreciates against major currencies. Based on BEA data, Cline reports that from 1991-2004, U.S. cumulative current deficits were $3.6 trillion, but the net asset position only increased by $2.4 trillion. Valuation effects erased $1.2 trillion or 53% of deficits, particularly strong in 2002-2004 with a depreciating dollar. The U.S. consistently earns higher returns on foreign investments than vice versa, with a 1-2 percentage point advantage. This advantage is likely due to a structural bias in world capital markets. Prudent investment portfolio management involves holding a diversified collection of assets to balance risk and reward. The U.S. asset market offers a variety of low-yield, low-risk assets, such as U.S. Treasury securities, attracting foreign investors who hold over $2 trillion in these securities. This contributes to a structural bias in world capital markets. The United States has a rate of return advantage on its foreign assets, particularly in foreign direct investment (FDI). The rate of return on U.S. FDI averages 7.1%, while the rate of return on FDI in the United States averages only 2.5%. Rates of return on other types of foreign investments have been similar for both assets and liabilities. Portfolio equities have favored U.S. equities in the past but have shifted to favor foreign equities in recent years. The rate of return advantage of U.S. FDI is significant, adding $20 billion to U.S. investment income in 2004. Cline estimates that if rates of return were equal, the U.S. investment income balance would have been a deficit of $102 billion. The burden of massive external borrowing by the U.S. has been relatively painless so far, but future prospects are concerning as current account deficits grow. The high fixed income obligations in U.S. foreign liabilities contribute to the real debt burden. The high incidence of fixed income obligations in U.S. foreign liabilities could greatly accelerate the growth of the debt burden as global interest rates rise. An increase in interest rates of 1 or 2 percentage points could lead to a $30 billion to $70 billion increase in U.S. net interest payments to foreigners, potentially causing a shift from surplus to deficit in the investment income balance. The potential increase in interest rates could shift the U.S. investment income balance from surplus to deficit, leading to higher debt service costs. Economists suggest that the U.S. may actually be a net external creditor due to unrecorded service exports. The United States is considered a large net external creditor due to unrecorded service exports, known as \"dark matter.\" These hidden services generate foreign investment income, transforming a deficit of $2.5 trillion into a surplus of $600 billion. The economic value of accumulated dark matter is estimated at $3.1 trillion, consisting of global liquidity services, insurance services, and knowledge services. The U.S. dollar holds a special global status as a widely held asset for liquidity needs. Estimates of foreign holdings of dollars range from 30% to 70%, with $333 billion held abroad in 2004. Much of this demand comes from foreign governments with unstable currencies or inflation issues, and some may be tied to black market activities. These holdings effectively act as interest-free loans to the U.S. The U.S. dollar is widely held for liquidity needs, with foreign holdings acting as interest-free loans to the U.S. An interest-free and irredeemable loan to the United States, recorded as a liability but not performing as one. If invested in assets, there is potential dark matter income ranging from $10 billion to $25 billion annually. The world economy has a strong demand for low-risk assets like U.S. Treasury bonds, which allows the U.S. to invest in higher yielding bonds from emerging economies. This yield difference acts as an insurance premium paid to the U.S. for lowering risk. Current accounting practices underestimate U.S. FDI assets due to unmeasured embodied knowledge services, which generate revenue inflow. The United States' FDI assets include valuable unmeasured assets like know-how, brand recognition, and research and development, leading to a higher apparent rate of return. Dark matter, such as knowledge services, is crucial in balancing global imbalances, making the U.S. a net creditor. Japan is a large creditor, while the euro area and the rest of the world are net debtors. Dark matter also suggests that the U.S. is a bigger saver than official data indicates. Dark matter, such as knowledge services, plays a crucial role in balancing global imbalances and making the United States a net creditor. However, the dark matter hypothesis has faced criticism, particularly regarding liquidity and insurance services. Default risks on sovereign debt of emerging economies make the argument for insurance services highly improbable. Additionally, recent debt defaults by various countries raise concerns about the stability of the international economy. The yields on U.S. Treasury bonds are often higher than sovereign debt of other advanced economies, suggesting no preferred market status. The spread in interest rates between U.S. Treasury bonds and emerging market debt is minimal, covering default risk with little left for insurance services premium. Dark matter in knowledge services may be undervalued in U.S. net international investment position calculations. The value of FDI in the United States compared to U.S. FDI shows no significant difference in expected profitability. There are valuation problems on both the asset and liability side of FDI, leading to uncertainty about systematic overstatement or understatement. The high yield on U.S. FDI raises questions about investing in the U.S. with lower yields compared to risk-free U.S. Treasury bonds, suggesting potential better investment opportunities elsewhere. This behavior challenges rational economic decision-making. The apparent violation of rational economic behavior in FDI earnings data from foreign firms operating in the United States suggests potential problems. The lack of a yield gap between U.S. portfolio assets and liabilities also indicates issues with FDI data. The hypothesis is that foreign multinational companies in the U.S. may be shifting profits to lower tax jurisdictions due to higher U.S. corporate taxes. Foreign multinational companies operating in the United States may be shifting profits to lower tax jurisdictions to reduce their U.S. tax liabilities. This is done through certain business practices or accounting devices, which distort investment income data by undervaluing foreign income in the U.S. The retained earnings component of investment income balance shows a stark asymmetry, with U.S. firms reporting substantial retained earnings in their foreign affiliates while foreign affiliates in the U.S. report virtually none. From 1999 to 2004, cumulative profits reported on U.S. FDI totaled $984 billion, with 65% reported as retained earnings, compared to only 18% of cumulative profits reported on FDI in the U.S. The disparity in reported Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) earnings in the United States is evident, with only $41 billion out of $233 billion reported as retained earnings. Tax incentives play a significant role in where profits are reported by multinational corporations, as seen in Ireland where foreign firms report profit rates 10 times higher than in the U.S. The response of U.S. multinational companies to tax incentives further highlights the shifting of retained earnings from abroad to U.S. parents. The cloaking of U.S. earnings of foreign multinational companies through transfer pricing manipulates prices to decrease tax liability. This practice can be hard to detect as transactions often lack market-determined prices for reference. By paying higher prices for goods or services from affiliates, U.S. affiliates can decrease recorded profits and tax liability. The transfer pricing transactions of multinational corporations can manipulate profits to reduce U.S. tax liability. Detecting profit shifting through transfer pricing is challenging, and measurement errors in valuing external assets and liabilities may not significantly impact the U.S.'s current account deficits and external net asset position. The U.S. is likely to become a net external debtor due to large prospective current account deficits. The United States is facing a potential shift from an investment income surplus to a deficit due to debt accumulation and higher world interest rates. This could lead to economic debt service costs on borrowings from abroad, with the trade deficit remaining a concern for policymakers."
