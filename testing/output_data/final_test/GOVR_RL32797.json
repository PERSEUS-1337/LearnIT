    "content": "The Senate Finance Committee convened to address concerns over the withdrawal of the popular anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx by Merck due to increased risks of heart attacks. This was part of a larger trend of Congress reacting to drug safety issues, including controversies over antidepressants for children. Members sought to understand what went wrong and prevent similar incidents in the future. Members of the Senate Finance Committee expressed concerns about the lack of transparency from drug manufacturers and the FDA regarding the risks of drugs like Vioxx. FDA's Associate Director for Science and Medicine, David Graham, criticized the FDA's ability to protect against another Vioxx incident. The FDA advisory committees meeting in February 2005 also received significant public attention following the withdrawal of Vioxx from the market. The FDA advisory committees unanimously concluded that Vioxx and similar drugs increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Despite some members believing the benefits outweigh the risks for certain groups, they recommended limited sales with strong warnings about cardiovascular risks. Dr. Graham's testimony reignited interest in regulatory issues surrounding drug safety. The FDA was created during Theodore Roosevelt's presidency due to concerns over unsafe food and medicines. There have been several incidents since then, such as the deaths caused by an untested antibiotic in 1937, the polio vaccine mistakes in 1954, and the thalidomide tragedy in 1962. These events have led to legislation strengthening the FDA's authority to protect the public from unsafe drugs. The FDA, with a budget of $1.88 billion in FY2006, oversees about $1 trillion of goods, accounting for one-quarter of U.S. consumer spending. Congressional funding for FDA has not kept pace with industry user fees, which make up 59% of FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). The FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) budget in FY2006 was mainly funded by industry user fees, accounting for 59% of the total budget. The report discusses drug safety within the regulatory process, including premarket approval, postmarket regulatory procedures, and FDA's role in drug approval and postmarket surveillance. The report discusses the challenges in identifying and resolving postmarketing safety and effectiveness issues, along with suggested actions to improve the situation. The term \"quack\" originated from Dutch and was used to describe charlatans in medicine who sold adulterated medicines until the Food and Drugs Act of 1906 outlawed the practice. This was the first of many laws aimed at ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medicines. The FDA's authority was expanded through legislation like the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938 and the Orphan Drug Act in 1983 to ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs. Additional laws have been passed to boost pharmaceutical research and development. The FDA's authority was expanded through legislation like the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938 and the Orphan Drug Act in 1983 to ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs. Other laws, such as the Hatch-Waxman Act, PDUFA, and FDAMA, have also influenced the U.S. drug approval process. These laws have balanced patent protection with public access to generic drugs, introduced user fees for faster approvals, and relaxed clinical testing requirements. The FDA regulates drug approval in the United States according to laws from 1938 and 1962. To market a drug, the manufacturer must demonstrate its safety and effectiveness to the FDA, pass an inspection of its manufacturing plant, and obtain approval for the drug's labeling. There are four steps to FDA approval: filing an IND application, conducting clinical testing, submitting a NDA, and undergoing FDA review. The FDA requires manufacturers to obtain approval for drug testing through an IND application, which includes demonstrating safety and effectiveness, meeting with the FDA to discuss study design, and describing the drug's indication for use. If there is no objection within 30 days, clinical testing can begin with IND status. Phase I clinical trials aim to determine dosing, metabolism, and side effects in a small number of human volunteers. If successful, Phase II and III trials follow to assess efficacy in larger groups. The sponsor then submits an NDA to the FDA for review, including clinical trial results and manufacturing information. CDER evaluates safety, effectiveness, and inspects facilities before approval. The FDA requires substantial evidence of drug safety and effectiveness, typically through two Phase 3 clinical studies. The agency can assess this in various ways, including reviewing manufacturer studies and medical literature. FDA has 180 days to review a New Drug Application (NDA), pausing if there are deficiencies until additional information is provided. The FDA reviews New Drug Applications (NDAs) for drug safety and effectiveness. If a required study is missing, the manufacturer may withdraw the application. FDA convenes advisory panels to review clinical data, but the final decision is made by the FDA, which can approve, make changes, or reject the NDA based on inadequate testing or insufficient data. Manufacturers can appeal FDA's decision. The FDA funds new drug approval reviews through appropriations from Congress and industry fees. Pressure for quicker approvals came from manufacturers due to the 20-year patent protection starting at NDA submission. The 20-year patent protection begins with NDA submission, leading to manufacturers losing income during the approval process. The average effective patent life for prescription medicines is 11-12 years, compared to 18.5 years for other products. Congress passed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) in 1992 and the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) in 1997 to speed up drug reviews without compromising safety. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was created in 1992 to speed up drug reviews by supplementing congressional appropriations with user fees paid by pharmaceutical companies. FDA reduced approval times for priority new drugs significantly after the introduction of user fees. FDA includes Biologics License Application (BLA) approvals along with New Drug Applications (NDAs) in its records tracking PDUFA fees. The FDA maintains detailed records of PDUFA fees and oversees drug safety post-market. Various offices within the FDA address drug supply safety, adverse drug experiences, and regulatory affairs. The FDA's Office of Drug Safety (ODS) has three divisions: Marketing, Advertising and Communications; Drug Information; and Compliance Risk Management and Surveillance. ODS uses reports of adverse events to identify drug safety concerns and recommend actions to protect public health. The Division of Drug Risk Evaluation evaluates safety data and literature, while the Division of Medication Errors and Technical Support addresses drug labeling questions. The Division of Surveillance, Research, and Communication Support manages risk communication activities related to drug safety, including research, patient materials, and data resources. Other drug safety functions, such as risk management plans and product recalls, are handled outside the Office of Drug Safety. In response to criticism, FDA announced actions to strengthen the safety program for marketed drugs in 2004, including sponsoring an Institute of Medicine study. In response to criticism, FDA announced actions in 2004 to strengthen the drug safety program, including sponsoring an Institute of Medicine study. This led to the implementation of new drug safety initiatives in May 2005, such as providing more drug-specific information and establishing a Drug Safety Oversight Board for independent oversight and advice on important drug safety issues. The FDA established a Drug Safety Oversight Board (DSB) to increase safety decision oversight, but critics raised concerns about excluding the public from board proceedings. Some members of the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee criticized the DSB's approach, stating that it could lead to failure in the age of transparency. Manufacturers and the FDA negotiate postmarket study requirements for certain new drug approvals, but it is not required for all applications. Once FDA approves a drug, it monitors safety by requiring manufacturers to report serious adverse reactions within 15 days. Postmarket studies may be required for drugs with lingering safety questions, especially to identify rare adverse events. Adverse reactions can be reported by health professionals and patients to FDA's MedWatch system. Regulatory actions like labeling changes may be taken based on postmarket study findings. Regulatory actions, such as labeling changes or drug withdrawals, are prompted by events indicating serious hazards. Decisions can vary among reviewers, as seen in the case of Adderall where Canadian authorities halted sales while U.S. authorities issued a public alert. A year later, concerns about stimulants increasing stroke and arrhythmia risks led to recommendations for stricter regulations by the FDA Drug Safety Committee. The FDA recommends manufacturers to provide written guides and warnings on drug labels about serious arrhythmias in children and adults. Physician compliance with black-box warnings is debated, with a study showing 7% violation. FDA can make label changes based on industry reports and adverse event reports. Manufacturers can also initiate label changes for new drug uses by submitting data to FDA. The FDA utilizes an iterative risk management process that includes risk assessment and minimization strategies. This involves actions such as education and outreach, prescribing guidelines, restricted access, and potential suspension of product marketing. The goal is to minimize a drug's risks while maintaining its benefits, as seen in the case of Accutane. The FDA has a risk minimization plan for Accutane, a drug for severe acne with birth defect and suicide risks. Some clinicians object to strict prescribing requirements, leading to limited FDA enforcement authority. FDA can withdraw drug approval but must request label changes from manufacturers. FDA's enforcement activities are detailed in The Enforcement Story: Fiscal Year 2003 webpage. The FDA's enforcement activities in Fiscal Year 2003 focused on regulating off-label use of drugs, which is considered accepted medical practice. While the FDA cannot regulate the practice of medicine, it can enforce restrictions on drug promotion and advertising. Examples of off-label use include prescribing drugs for longer durations or at different doses than tested. Off-label use of drugs presents safety and effectiveness challenges as researchers have not yet demonstrated their use in new ways. Manufacturers rarely conduct studies to establish safety and effectiveness for off-label uses, leading to difficulties in funding for such studies. The budget for drug safety in FY2006 was $32.5 million, increasing from $15.4 million in FY2002 primarily due to PDUFA user fees. The FY2007 request is $39.2 million. The FY2007 budget request for drug safety is $39.2 million, with staff levels increasing from 77 in FY2002 to 109 in FY2005. Authors like Marcia Angell, Jerry Avorn, and Philip J. Hilts have criticized government and industry handling of drug safety. FDA task force proposed changes in 1999 report. The FDA task force proposed changes in its 1999 report on risk management, with analysts in agreement that FDA's approach should be changed. The report focuses on six areas where problems in postmarketing surveillance, study, and regulatory action are identified, with options listed in different sections. The influence of industry is a challenging aspect to categorize, with options aimed at diminishing inappropriate industry behavior. Increasing postmarket information involves expanding the industry's role. The FDA task force proposed changes in its 1999 report on risk management, focusing on six key areas for improvement in postmarket activities. Recommendations include FDA organization, budget, industry role, and access to postmarket data. Some changes can be implemented by the FDA, while others would require congressional action. Critics argue that the Office of Drug Safety lacks influence compared to the Office of New Drugs within CDER. Dr. Graham highlighted the organizational structure geared towards new drug approval. The FDA's organizational structure within CDER is focused on new drug approval, creating a conflict of interest when it comes to postmarketing regulatory actions. The Office of Drug Safety lacks regulatory power and must convince the new drug reviewing division of issues before taking action. Dr. Graham and others have criticized the hierarchy that prioritizes pleasing the Office of New Drugs over drug safety concerns. Critics have raised concerns about the FDA's organizational structure within CDER, highlighting a conflict of interest between new drug approval and postmarketing regulatory actions. Dr. Graham and others have criticized the hierarchy that prioritizes pleasing the Office of New Drugs over drug safety concerns. Recommendations have been made to address political pressure on ODS scientists and bureaucratic reluctance to restrict drugs approved by OND. Suggestions include organizational changes and increasing ODS power relative to OND. Some believe FDA should maintain the current organizational structure within CDER, while others argue for changes to address potential conflicts of interest between new drug approval and postmarketing regulatory actions. The reorganization of drug safety activities within CDER over the past two years has led to the creation of new positions directly reporting to the CDER Director. The debate revolves around whether having these offices together may create pressure to keep CDER-approved drugs on the market. The FDA faced pressure to maintain CDER-approved drugs on the market. In 2004, the Institute of Medicine was asked to review the post-approval safety program. The committee's report in 2006 recommended organizational and cultural changes at the FDA. A pilot program for resolving disagreements between scientists and supervisors was announced in 2004. The FDA is considering using ad hoc panels to resolve scientific disagreements among agency reviewers, aiming to formalize standard practices. Critics argue that keeping disputes within the FDA compromises scientific objectivity. Supporters compare this approach to the National Transportation Safety Board's independence. Harvard Medical School professor Jerry Avorn suggests assigning drug safety tasks to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA is considering assigning drug safety tasks to other agencies for independence. Dr. Graham's testimony highlighted the need for protection for government whistleblowers. Criticism of FDA's budget for post-approval safety activities and industry user fees influencing safety judgments. Critics are concerned about the increasing industry influence on FDA due to higher user fee contributions compared to congressional appropriations. Various solutions have been proposed, including legislative changes to reduce industry influence, using more user fees for post-marketing safety, and maintaining reviewers' independence. Some, like Marcia Angell, advocate for repealing PDUFA and increasing FDA appropriations for better public service. Some analysts suggest increasing congressional budget authority for FDA, particularly the Office of Drug Safety, independent of repealing PDUFA. Dr. Avorn highlights alternative ways to conduct postmarket reviews that would require legislative action. Dr. Avorn suggests alternative ways to fund postmarket reviews, such as a 10-cent fee per prescription or user fees by payers. Critics argue that FDA's reliance on industry user fees has eroded its ability to regulate drug makers. The FDA is criticized for accommodating the pharmaceutical industry instead of prioritizing public safety. The corporate culture within CDER values clinical trials over postmarketing safety and views the industry as its client, leading to a disregard for drug safety. The pharmaceutical industry's focus on marketing drugs can lead to overlooking potential dangers, as seen in cases like thalidomide and Vioxx. Industry influence is evident in various aspects, such as data and funding sources for FDA approval. Critics question industry's social responsibility and transparency, citing examples like Vioxx where risks were known years before the drug was withdrawn. The pharmaceutical industry's influence on FDA approval includes user fees supporting new drug reviews, with industry paying over $269 million in PDUFA fees in 2005. There are concerns about compromised objectivity in independent research due to funding sources not always being clearly identified. The pharmaceutical industry's influence on FDA approval includes user fees supporting new drug reviews, with concerns about compromised objectivity in independent research due to pervasive industry funding. Former Harvard University president Derek Bok warns of the difficulty for medical schools to free themselves from industry influence, as industry-funded clinical trials are perceived to be more favorable to sponsors. Direct-to-consumer advertising in the United States is seen as a powerful tool for informing consumers. The pharmaceutical industry's influence on FDA approval is a topic of debate, with concerns about compromised objectivity due to industry funding. There is a need for the FDA to be objective in regulating the industry, with suggestions for revamping the industry role lying within the legislative arena. The FDA's industry role in reducing postmarketing problems is primarily in the legislative arena. In 2004 and 2005, there were acting officials in key positions due to various reasons. Dr. Angell believes that marketing considerations unduly influence premarket studies. Dr. Angell argues that government agencies like the FDA or NIH should control clinical trials to test safety and effectiveness, as marketing influences premarket studies. However, the cost of this proposal, as shown by PhRMA's $38.8 billion R&D spending in 2005, may be a challenge for Congress to fund. Some suggest industry should be assessed for these costs but with legislation to eliminate their influence on how funds are used. The Vioxx case highlights the conflict of interest in pharmaceutical marketing, with marketers pushing for more evidence of safety and effectiveness despite millions of prescriptions and billions in sales. More funding for independent research could alleviate marketing pressure on research decisions. Congress could mandate full disclosure of industry contributions to research. Industry marketing efforts include sales representatives, conferences, and direct advertising. Suggestions to limit direct-to-consumer advertising vary from minor restrictions to an outright ban. Critics question the health benefits of industry promotion to physicians. Some suggest banning industry-sponsored practices like conferences and gifts to maintain objectivity in Phase IV clinical trials. Recommendations include disclosing support publicly and prohibiting advisory committee members from receiving benefits from pharmaceutical companies. FDA advisory committees discussed DTC advertising restrictions but lacked authority for a complete ban. The committees suggested ways to restrict DTC ads, including government-produced alternative ads focusing on drug risks. Former Secretary of Labor Reich acknowledges the importance of both regulation and torts in holding corporations accountable for negligence. Congress is exploring tort reform to influence industry behavior in drug safety. Specific changes in FDA's drug approval process could enhance its ability to anticipate and address problems. The FDA may need to implement changes to improve drug safety and effectiveness. Critics point out problems in the current approval process, such as the inability to attach conditions to new drug approvals. Identifying all potential issues during Phase III trials before a drug is released to the market is challenging without slowing down the process. Only when a large number of people use a drug can certain side effects become apparent. Critics argue that FDA's approval process lacks the ability to enforce postmarket research deadlines and stimulate comparative effectiveness analysis. This hinders the agency's ability to address safety issues once a drug is on the market and ensure manufacturers complete required studies. The FDA approval process lacks the ability to enforce postmarket research deadlines and stimulate comparative effectiveness analysis, hindering the agency's ability to address safety issues once a drug is on the market and ensure manufacturers complete required studies. Comparing new drugs to existing treatments is crucial for consumers and physicians to determine if the new drug is better than others on the market. The Vioxx controversy highlighted the importance of comparing drugs used to treat the same illness for safety and effectiveness. The FDA approval process lacks enforcement of postmarket research deadlines and comparative effectiveness analysis, hindering safety monitoring of drugs once on the market. Clinical trials often exclude certain patient groups, leading to concerns about drug safety for those not represented in trials. Off-label use of approved drugs is controversial, especially with antidepressants and children. FDA Task Force emphasizes healthcare providers and patients are responsible for safety decisions. Monitoring mechanisms for off-label use are suggested, but changing drug approval requirements would need legislation. FDA could re-evaluate safety using postmarket data. The FDA could re-evaluate drug safety using postmarket data, set license-renewal dates, and enforce penalties for noncompliance. They could also require postmarket continuation of clinical trials and rigorous trials for off-label uses. Increased resources would strengthen enforcement and data gathering efforts. The FDA could require rigorous postmarket trials for off-label uses to assess safety and effectiveness relative to other treatments. Critics argue for banning off-label prescribing, while others recommend limiting and monitoring it. Postmarket data collection and analysis shift focus with changed incentives and statutory requirements. Data collection and analysis in the FDA system have shifted with changed incentives and regulatory requirements. Critics and supporters alike find postmarket information on drug safety and effectiveness to be insufficient for making important decisions. The system relies on passive surveillance, waiting for reports from consumers and physicians, which are then passed on to the FDA. The Adverse Events Reporting System received 464,068 reports in 2005. The Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS) received 464,068 reports in 2005, with about 25,000 as MedWatch reports from individuals and the rest from manufacturers. A 2000 study by the General Accounting Office estimated that FDA receives reports on no more than 10% of all adverse drug events, leading to a \"fragmentary and inconsistent\" picture. The passive approach relies on anecdotal evidence, resulting in an incomplete and distorted view of actual problems. Physicians are more likely to report rare conditions following drug use than common conditions, leading to underreporting of certain adverse events. The Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS) received 464,068 reports in 2005, with about 25,000 as MedWatch reports from individuals and the rest from manufacturers. However, voluntary reports do not present a balanced picture due to various reasons such as underreporting of adverse events, lack of information about patients, and the incomplete data provided by MedWatch. The Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS) received 464,068 reports in 2005, with about 25,000 as MedWatch reports from individuals and the rest from manufacturers. Without the denominator, a cluster of events reported to a system such as MedWatch serves only as a red flag to prompt further investigation. Researchers can design studies to address suspected drug associations and test hypotheses based on a drug's mechanism of action or findings concerning other drugs in its class. Postmarket efforts to identify safety and effectiveness problems require a two-pronged approach. The FDA needs to accurately assess patient warning signs for safety issues and conduct impartial research to identify problems. They should reassess criteria for detecting signals of issues and clarify steps to address them. Postmarket activities include actively collecting data on prescribing patterns and designing studies for off-label use. Developing valid data collection and analysis procedures is crucial for capturing relevant information. The FDA is looking to enhance data collection procedures for off-label drug use, including establishing privacy measures for patient data linkage. Planned projects involve integrating data with CMS for drug safety information access and collaborating with other federal agencies, insurers, and healthcare systems for linked analyses. Critics suggest a drug surveillance system similar to FoodNet for monitoring drug safety. Critics recommend a drug surveillance system similar to FoodNet for monitoring drug safety, funded by increased federal appropriations and industry-generated funds with restrictions on industry influence. Congress could authorize FDA to require studies to avoid current gamesmanship and assert FDA's role in taking specific enforcement steps other than revoking approval. The FDA's current approach to clinical trials lacks comparative effectiveness studies, which are important for clinicians to determine if a new drug is better than existing treatments. Manufacturers and researchers rarely conduct these studies due to cost, but Congress has started including provisions for them in recent laws. The 2003 Medicare Modernization Act directed the HHS Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to conduct research on the outcomes and effectiveness of healthcare services, including prescription drugs. Other bills in the 109th Congress also addressed comparative effectiveness in healthcare. The Prescription Drug Comparative Effectiveness Act of 2006 (H.R. 5975) aimed to improve research on safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs. Congress could increase funding for intramural scientists to analyze data and conduct follow-up studies. They could also consider funding extramural researchers and training programs. Looking at systems used in other countries, like France's \"pharmaco-vigilance centers\" and Great Britain's \"green card\" requests for more information, could provide insights for the US. Lack of research on safety and effectiveness questions for treatment decisions is a significant issue. The lack of research on safety and effectiveness for treatment decisions is a significant issue. Publication bias and insufficient FDA resources contribute to the problem of unavailable research information for clinicians, patients, and insurers. The FDA faces challenges in analyzing adverse drug event data due to budget constraints and lack of trained researchers. Drug manufacturers may not disclose all findings, leading to potential biases in marketing information. In DTC advertisements and marketing materials, drug manufacturers may provide incomplete and distorted information about a drug's safety and effectiveness, leading physicians to make decisions without full information. Industry suppression of negative findings can complicate matters of policy and scientific procedure, raising questions about FDA's duty to disclose industry data and how to handle risks uncovered by researchers. The problem lies in the potential for chance, poor study design, or unrelated events to misrepresent a drug's safety profile. Labeling requirements for prescription drugs are important as they provide detailed prescribing information to clinicians and patients. Once a drug is approved by the FDA, physicians have the freedom to prescribe it as they see fit, even for off-label uses such as prescribing to children or for preventive measures. Limiting or withdrawing a drug based on erroneous conclusions can harm those who would benefit from it. The FDA's passive system for monitoring off-label drug use limits its effectiveness, as potential side effects may not be known. Industry may not investigate issues that could harm a drug's financial success, leading to unchanged labeling even when off-label uses are considered unsafe. Opportunities for sharing research beyond traditional journals exist, such as the Public Library of Science's online forum for published results. Since May 2005, the National Library of Medicine has encouraged NIH-funded researchers to submit their reports to PubMed Central for public access. Concerns exist about websites posting unpublished reports, bypassing peer review. FDA may consider an education outreach program for physicians using computer software, round-the-clock consultations, and office visits. Comparative effectiveness studies and safety monitoring can be conducted through initiatives like the Cochrane Collaboration and the Oregon Drug Effectiveness Review Project. Funding from various sources could make this information public and free. Current drug labeling may not cover all off-label uses by clinicians. FDA could require that drug labels include information and assessment of hypothesized safety and effectiveness for off-label uses. Postmarket studies could be conducted by various private groups to evaluate safety and effectiveness for common off-label uses. Contract research organizations and private groups could conduct postmarket studies funded by government or industry contracts. Funding mechanisms such as a fee for filled prescriptions or user fees could ensure independence in managing the studies. Congress mandated public listing of clinical trials in 1997 to promote transparency and allow individuals to participate. Registration of trials is being considered as a way to enforce openness, with incentives proposed to increase compliance. Incentives suggested to increase compliance with registration of clinical trials include linking it to permission to begin human studies or publication of results to avoid data withholding. Making data public allows validation of findings but could lead to premature, ill-informed treatment decisions due to the complexity and volume of data. The pharmaceutical industry provides information about drugs to physicians and the public, but there are concerns about the balance of information in direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertisements. Some suggest a total ban on DTC advertising or stronger controls, such as FDA reviewing and approving advertising copy before publication. Other proposals include prohibiting DTC advertising for a few years after a new drug's approval. Coordination with Federal Trade Commission regulations may be necessary. No drug is completely safe, as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act acknowledges. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines prescription drugs as having potential harmful effects and requiring supervision by licensed practitioners. Physicians must balance benefits and risks when prescribing drugs, relying on available information. Ethicists argue that the public should also have access to risk information. The FDA analyzes drugs to assess their effects and make decisions on benefits versus risks. For example, codeine provides pain relief but is addictive, while Tamoxifen has benefits but also risks. The FDA's advisory committees face challenges in assessing the safety, benefit, and risk of prescription drugs. Patients and researchers may have differing perspectives on the risks and benefits of certain medications. Manufacturers and researchers are encouraged to find ways to reduce or manage risks associated with drugs. Trained researchers analyze drug risks and reach different conclusions after three days of discussions surrounded by various stakeholders. There is criticism of FDA's postmarket enforcement activities, with calls for more legal authority to regulate drug safety and effectiveness. Congress is considering giving FDA more authority to gather and disseminate information and take action. Congress is considering giving FDA more authority to gather, analyze, and disseminate information, as well as enforce penalties to encourage industry cooperation in addressing postmarket activity issues. Observers have suggested possible solutions, and now Congress faces the challenge of selecting the most effective approaches."
