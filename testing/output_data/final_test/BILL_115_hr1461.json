    "content": "The \"Veterans, Employees, and Taxpayers Protection Act of 2017\" or the \"VET Protection Act of 2017\" amends Chapter 7 of title 38, United States Code, by adding a new subchapter on labor management in the Department of Veterans Affairs. The \"VET Protection Act of 2017\" requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to accurately track and report on the use of official time by employees annually. The report must include the total official time granted and expended during the fiscal year. The \"VET Protection Act of 2017\" mandates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to report on official time usage by employees annually, including total time expended, activities granted official time for, impact on department operations, number of employees granted official time, and details of official time usage for each employee. The report required by the \"VET Protection Act of 2017\" includes details such as the square footage of designated official time spaces, a list of employees granted waivers, and the definition of official time as outlined in chapter 71 of title 5. The Department employees are restricted from using official time for political activities or lobbying. Certain employees, including those appointed under section 7401(1), those with an annual pay of $100,000 or more, and those on probation, cannot use official time. Other employees can only use up to 25% of their time on official duties. The Secretary has the authority to waive these requirements. The Secretary may waive official time requirements for Department employees if deemed necessary and in veterans' best interests. The waiver authority is not subject to bargaining and does not constitute an unfair labor practice. Any exclusive bargaining agreement must include provisions for termination of dues collection by the Department. The Department allows employees to terminate voluntary dues allotments at any time, with deductions ceasing in the next pay period. Sections 742 and 743 of title 38 apply to collective bargaining agreements, and a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. SEC. 3. REQUIRED PROBATIONARY PERIOD FOR NEW EMPLOYEES OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. The new section inserted after section 717 of title 38, United States Code, establishes a 2-year probationary period for covered employees appointed to permanent positions within the competitive service or as career appointees in the Senior Executive Service at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The new section establishes a 2-year probationary period for covered employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The supervisor must determine if the appointment becomes final before the probationary period expires. Amendments are made to related sections for application.

The new section establishes a 2-year probationary period for covered employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs, amending various sections in Title 5, United States Code to include individuals covered by section 719 of title 38.
