    "content": "The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) mandates that private-sector firms provide workers' compensation coverage for employees in maritime occupations. Administered by the Department of Labor, benefits are paid through private insurers or self-insured firms. The LHWCA ensures medical and disability benefits for injured workers and survivors of deceased workers. In 2016, $1.41 billion was paid in benefits. Workers' compensation in the United States is primarily mandated by state laws and administered by state agencies. The federal government only administers workers' compensation programs for federal employees and certain private-sector workers. All states and the District of Columbia have their own workers' compensation systems, providing wage replacement, medical benefits, and survivors benefits for injured or ill workers and families of deceased workers. Federal standards for state workers' compensation systems do not exist. Workers' compensation in the United States is a no-fault system that provides benefits to workers for employment-related injuries or illnesses. It is mandatory in all states except Texas, where employers can opt out but may face civil actions from injured employees. The system guarantees benefits in exchange for workers giving up their rights to sue employers in civil court for damages. The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) was enacted in 1927 to provide federal workers' compensation coverage for longshore and harbor workers who were previously not covered by state systems. The LHWCA extended coverage in 1972 to include areas adjacent to navigable waters used for vessel-related activities. This federal program applies to private firms with covered employees working on or near navigable waters. The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) applies to private firms with covered employees working on or near navigable waters, including piers, wharves, terminals, and marine railways. It covers maritime employees, excluding certain workers like those covered by state workers' compensation laws or engaged in clerical or retail work. The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) applies to private firms with covered employees working on or near navigable waters, including piers, wharves, terminals, and marine railways. It covers maritime employees, excluding certain workers like those covered by state workers' compensation laws or engaged in clerical or retail work. The Act also excludes workers such as marina employees not involved in construction, aquaculture workers, and employees working on recreational vessels under 65 feet in length. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 added exclusions for persons working on recreational vessels over 65 feet in length. The LHWCA was amended to exclude individuals employed to repair any recreational vessel, regardless of its size, limiting the scope of the Act and increasing the types of workers excluded from coverage. The DOL implemented regulations in 2011 for the new recreational vessel provision under the LHWCA. These regulations define a recreational vessel based on USCG classifications, stating that it is used mainly for pleasure or leased for recreational purposes. Manufacturers or builders bear the burden to prove a vessel's recreational use during warranty repairs. The manufacturer or builder must prove that a vessel is recreational for warranty repairs. A vessel is not recreational if it falls under specific categories in the U.S. Code. The DOL's 2011 rules defined recreational vessels for the LHWCA, leading to proposed legislation to expand the types of recreational vessels covered. This would allow employers to provide workers' compensation under state laws instead of the LHWCA for workers on recreational vessels. In the 115th Congress, Section 3509 of H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for 2018, contained a legislative provision to extend coverage under the LHWCA to occupations outside the original scope of the law. This provision was not included in the final NDAA enacted into law. The LHWCA has been amended four times to extend coverage, including to employees of the District of Columbia in 1928. Coverage under the LHWCA has been extended over the years to include military and public works contractors, civilian employees of armed forces' nonappropriated fund instrumentalities, workers on the Outer Continental Shelf, and employers can choose to provide workers' compensation through private insurance or self-insurance authorized by the DOL. Insurance premiums are not regulated by the DOL. The Department of Labor (DOL) does not regulate insurance premiums for Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) benefits. The Special Fund, financed through employer and insurance carrier assessments, provides benefits when the responsible party cannot pay. General revenue covers administrative costs for the LHWCA oversight functions. In 2016, total administrative costs for the LHWCA were $15.8 million, with $13.6 million (86%) covered by general revenue and $2.2 million (14%) by the Special Fund. The LHWCA provides medical, disability, and survivors benefits for covered injuries and illnesses. LHWCA provides full medical benefits for covered injuries without any out-of-pocket costs for the injured worker. This includes coverage for prescription drugs, medical procedures, and transportation to medical appointments. Workers can choose their own physician for treatment. Vocational rehabilitation services are also available at no cost to help workers return to employment, with an additional $25 per week benefit for active participants. The LHWCA provides disability benefits to covered workers based on pre-disability wages, with minimum and maximum benefits determined by the NAWW. Disability benefits are not subject to taxes and are paid out of the Special Fund. Disability benefits under the LHWCA are not taxed and are adjusted annually based on wage inflation. Total disability benefits are provided if a worker is unable to earn their pre-injury wage or experiences specific severe injuries. These benefits amount to two-thirds of the worker's wage at the time of the injury and continue until the worker's condition improves. Total disability benefits under the LHWCA continue until the worker is no longer totally disabled or dies. Partial disability benefits are provided if the worker can partially return to work at a lower wage. Section 8(c) of the LHWCA outlines benefits for permanent partial disability, such as loss of limb, with compensation based on a schedule. Benefits for permanent partial disability (PPD) under the LHWCA are paid at two-thirds of the difference between pre-injury wage and current earning capacity. PPD benefits are paid regardless of work status, allowing the employee to return to work and earn wages along with compensation. Disability benefits for illnesses caused by covered employment post-retirement are calculated based on impairment percentage and NAWW. The LHWCA provides cash benefits to surviving spouses and minor children of workers killed on the job. Benefits for a surviving spouse end when the spouse remarries or dies, while benefits for surviving children continue until they reach a certain age or for the life of a child with a disability. The amount of benefits for a surviving spouse is based on the deceased worker's wage at the time of death. The LHWCA provides cash benefits to surviving spouses and minor children of workers killed on the job. If the eligible spouse becomes ineligible due to death or remarriage, benefits are still paid to any surviving children. A single eligible child is entitled to half of the deceased worker's wage, while two or more children can receive two-thirds of the wage. Survivors are also entitled to a burial and funeral allowance capped at $3,000. If a covered worker receiving PPD benefits dies unrelated to their illness, the remaining benefits are paid to their survivors. If a covered worker dies on the job with no survivors, the employer or the... The LHWCA requires employers or insurance carriers to pay $5,000 into the Special Fund if a covered worker dies on the job with no survivors. The DOL makes decisions on benefit eligibility and amount, and the claims process begins upon injury, illness, or death report. If the employer disputes the claim, an informal conference is held, followed by a formal hearing before a DOL administrative law judge if disputes remain. If disputes remain after an informal conference, a formal hearing before a DOL administrative law judge is scheduled. The decision of the ALJ can be appealed to the Benefits Review Board (BRB), and further to the U.S. Court of Appeals if dissatisfied. Failure to pay compensation may result in a request to the U.S. District Court for payment enforcement."
