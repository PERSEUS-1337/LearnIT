    "content": "The Constitution grants Congress broad powers over the Armed Forces, including raising armies, maintaining a navy, and making rules for military governance. Congress also has authority to advise and consent on presidential nominations of military officers. Laws passed by Congress govern aspects of military officer personnel management. General officers are the most senior in the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps, while flag officers are the most senior in the Navy. \"General and flag officers\" refer to officers in paygrades O-7 through O-10. General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in paygrades O-7 through O-10 hold key military positions in the Department of Defense. This report covers their roles, compensation, historical trends, criticisms, and statutory controls. National Guard and Reserve GFOs are not included unless serving on active duty. Congress has developed a statutory framework for general and flag officers (GFOs) and periodically reviews their number, duties, and compensation. There is often tension between DOD requests for more GFOs and congressional concerns about having too many. Congress has historically believed fewer GFOs are needed, while the military has argued for more. The debates between Congress and the military over the number of general and flag officers have intensified during periods of downsizing and restructuring after major wars. As of November 1, 2018, there were 920 active duty GFOs, with 891 subject to statutory caps. This number is lower than the maximum authorized by statute, a decision made by DOD in 2011 for efficiency. The policy of keeping General and Flag Officer (GFO) numbers below the maximum authorized was implemented as an efficiency initiative by then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. This allows the Department of Defense (DOD) flexibility to respond to new requirements for GFOs without delays. While some key GFO positions are specified by Congress, the majority are not defined in statute. DOD uses specific criteria to determine whether a position should be filled by a general or flag officer based on the nature of the position, grade of superiors, and degree of independence of operation.

DOD uses specific criteria to determine whether a position should be filled by a general or flag officer based on the nature of the position, grade of superiors, and degree of independence of operation. The summary of GFO levels shows an increase in the number of four-star and three-star officers over the past five decades. The number of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) has increased over the past five decades, with a 46% rise in their proportion to the total force from 1965 to 2018. This trend reflects a 24% increase in three-star officers and a decrease in one-star and two-star officers by about 35%. The total force size was halved during this period, but the GFO corps has grown as a percentage of the total force. The proportion of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in the total force increased by 46% from 1965 to 2018. This increase was more significant for four-star officers (114% increase) and three-star officers (149% increase) compared to one- and two-star officers (31% increase). The officer corps also grew from 12.76% to 17.51% of the total force during this period. The increasing proportion of GFOs in the total force has raised concerns about the higher cost of employing them compared to lower-ranking officers. Additionally, there are worries that having too many GFOs can slow down decision-making processes. The average GFO in paygrade O-7 receives $204,405 in regular military compensation in 2019, while the average officer in paygrade O-6 receives $180,709. Other costs associated with GFOs include larger staffs, official travel, security details, and aides. The increasing proportion of GFOs in the total force raises concerns about higher costs and slower decision-making processes. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates criticized the impact of an increase in GFOs and senior civilians, making the Department of Defense top-heavy and bureaucratic. The Defense Business Board estimated a significant gap between senior executives and action officers, with requests needing to go through multiple layers of hierarchy. This has raised concerns about the increasing proportion of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in the total force, leading to higher costs and slower decision-making processes. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates criticized the top-heavy and bureaucratic nature of the Department of Defense due to the rise in GFOs and senior civilians. The growth of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in the Department of Defense is attributed to the increase in joint requirements following the Goldwater-Nichols Act in 1986. This led to the creation of more joint GFO positions and career incentives to serve in those positions, affecting the proportion of GFOs to the total force. The growth of joint organizations has led to an increased proportion of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in the Department of Defense. This growth includes the establishment of various joint headquarters such as U.S. Northern Command, Joint Task Force Guantanamo, and U.S. Africa Command. Additionally, the emphasis on coalition operations has also contributed to the rise in GFO numbers. The rise in General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in the Department of Defense is attributed to the growth of joint organizations and emphasis on coalition operations. These GFOs lead contingency operations involving forces from multiple countries, with their experience and authority playing crucial roles in the success of complex operations. Political and diplomatic considerations also come into play as they interact with senior military and civilian leadership. The increase in General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in the Department of Defense is not due to a rise in their numbers, but rather a decrease in the overall size of the Armed Forces. This trend is influenced by the organizational structure of the Armed Forces, where certain GFO positions are maintained regardless of the force's size. For example, the presence of a Chief of Staff of the Air Force has remained constant despite fluctuations in the number of airmen. This pattern is also observed in GFOs serving in various military branches and defense agencies. The increase in General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in the Department of Defense is not due to a rise in their numbers, but rather a decrease in the overall size of the Armed Forces. The amount of management \"overhead\" does not necessarily change in direct proportion to the size of the force. Technological advances have led to more powerful and accurate weapons systems, requiring fewer personnel to deliver greater firepower. This results in increased lethality of the forces commanded by GFOs. The increase in lethality of military forces is due to advancements in weapons systems, leading to a decrease in the overall size of the Armed Forces. This has resulted in the need for senior military officers to lead organizations. Additionally, new domains of warfare like space and cyber have led to the creation of new organizations. Military personnel are compensated through cash, non-cash, and deferred compensation, with Regular Military Compensation (RMC) being a key measure of military cash. Regular Military Compensation (RMC) is a key measure of military cash compensation levels for servicemembers, including basic pay, housing and subsistence allowances, and tax advantages. General and flag officers also receive a personal money allowance. Recent legislation has frozen basic pay increases for certain officers. Table 4 shows the average RMC for general and flag officers in 2019. The statutory framework for general and flag officers (GFOs) limits their numbers by grade, requires presidential determination of three-star and four-star positions, and specifies key positions. Sections 525 and 526 of Title 10 establish caps for general and flag officers in each service and the joint community, with exceptions. The President has authority under Title 10. The President has authority to suspend caps on general and flag officers during war or national emergency. Currently, there are 891 active duty GFOs subject to caps, with a total of 963 authorized positions. An additional 29 GFOs are not subject to caps. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act aims to reduce the number of GFOs on active duty. Starting in 2023, the number of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) authorized to be on active duty will be reduced to a maximum of 620 for Service positions and 232 for Joint positions. This is a reduction of 111 positions from the current number authorized by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7526. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act aims to address concerns about GFO reductions not being implemented and significant personnel strength reductions from 2011-2016. The President, with Senate approval, designates three-star and four-star positions, except those specified in statute. Congress can review and confirm these appointments, with limits set by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7525 and 526. Congress has designated grades for key positions like the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In 2008, Congress increased the grade of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau from Lieutenant General to General. Section 502 of the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act eliminated the statutory grade for 54 positions to manage the reduction in the number of general and flag officers. The Secretary of Defense must have flexibility in assigning officer grades to positions, allowing for officers of the same, higher, or lower grade than currently required by law. Statutorily required duties for positions are outlined in Table 7, with Congress occasionally changing these responsibilities. For example, in 2011, Congress specified the Chief of the National Guard Bureau as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with specific duties related to non-Federalized National Guard forces. Congress has a longstanding interest in the military officer corps. Congress has a long-standing interest in the military officer corps, especially senior officers. If Congress decides to address GFO authorizations, it should consider factors like determining the appropriate number of GFOs, the impact of technology on GFO needs, and potential modifications to statutory frameworks governing GFOs. The current chunk discusses various questions related to the need for General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in the military, including potential revisions to statutory requirements, organizational restructuring, rank equivalence, utilization of National Guard and Reserve GFOs, elimination of certain GFO positions, and cost-benefit analysis. These questions aim to explore ways to potentially reduce the reliance on GFOs and optimize military effectiveness. The curr_chunk discusses the potential reduction of costs associated with General and Flag Officers (GFOs) in the military, specifically focusing on the elements of Regular Military Compensation (RMC) and how basic pay is a significant part of servicemembers' compensation. Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is a key component of servicemembers' compensation, accounting for about two-thirds of an individual's Regular Military Compensation (RMC). GFOs in the United States receive either government-provided housing or a housing allowance based on paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status. There is no increase in BAH after paygrade O-7, so the amount does not vary by rank but only by locality and dependency status. The Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is determined by paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status to provide appropriate housing profiles for servicemembers. BAH rates vary by location but ensure comparable housing for servicemembers of similar paygrade and dependent status. Additionally, servicemembers receive a Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) to cover personal food costs at a flat rate. In 2019, officers, including GFOs, received $254.39 a month as part of Federal Tax Advantage Military allowances, which are not subject to federal income tax. The value of this tax advantage varies based on individual tax situations."
