    "content": "Senate Rule XXIII outlines the individuals who are granted floor privileges in the Senate chamber during sessions. This includes the Vice President, former Senators, high-level officials, and certain staff members conducting Senate business. However, lobbyists and agents of foreign principals are excluded from these privileges. The Senate has amended this rule over time and has also passed resolutions and agreements to clarify procedures and allow additional individuals onto the floor. The report discusses the current positional categories listed in Rule XXIII for Senate floor privileges, starting from the first resolution in 1798. It also covers relevant standing orders and biennial UC agreements. Guidance on obtaining temporary staff access is provided. The list of individuals granted floor privileges includes officials like the Mayor of Washington, DC, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and members of the European Parliament. The Senate floor privileges, as outlined in Rule XXIII, allow access to various officials including the President, Vice President, ex-Presidents, Judges of the Supreme Court, Senators, House Members, and certain Senate officers. The Senate floor privileges include access for officials such as the President, Vice President, ex-Presidents, Supreme Court Judges, Senators, House Members, and certain Senate officers, as well as other dignitaries like Ambassadors, Governors, military leaders, foreign legislators, and various officials from different branches of government and institutions. The Senate floor privileges do not apply to individuals who are registered lobbyists, agents of foreign principals, or those employed to influence federal legislative proposals. The Committee on Rules and Administration may allow exceptions for ceremonial functions and designated events.

The Committee on Rules and Administration can make exceptions for ceremonial functions and designated events. The Senate Rule XXIII excludes lobbyists, foreign agents, and those influencing legislation from the chamber during sessions. The Committee issues rules for the Senate Wing. The Committee on Rules and Administration issues regulations for Senate floor access, specifying the duties of the Senate Sergeant at Arms in enforcing chamber rules. The Sergeant at Arms ensures the clearance of unauthorized individuals from the floor, cloakrooms, and lobby before daily sessions. The Committee may allow exceptions for ceremonial functions and events designated by the Majority Leader and the Minority. Access to the Senate chamber is restricted, but exceptions can be made for ceremonial events and designated functions by the Majority Leader and Minority Leader. Temporary access can also be granted by unanimous consent for specific individuals, such as Senators-elect or House officials. In the early years of Congress, the Senate was closed to the public and press, but a public gallery was eventually installed in 1795 without official rules for non-Senator floor access. The Senate had no official rules for non-Senator floor access until 1798 when a policy was established. This policy continued after the Senate moved to the Capitol Building in 1800 and was codified in the rules in 1806. Additional rules were added in the 1820 revision, including clearing the Senate chamber for confidential or executive business. On the opening day of the 24th Congress (1835-1837), the Senate agreed to a resolution that designated the circular gallery for ladies and their companions. Reporters were to be moved to the Senate floor under the Secretary's direction, with specific categories of individuals allowed access to the floor. The Senate amended its floor privilege rule in 1854, expanding the list of categories admitted to the floor. This included government officials, state judges and legislators, and individuals who had previously served in positions. The Senate resolution in 1854 expanded floor privileges to include government officials, state judges, legislators, and former position holders. Regulations were set for chamber access, restricting entry to side doors for non-members and requiring individuals to sign in before accessing the Senate floor. This policy, still in place today, allows Senators to grant temporary access to others. In 1855, the Senate allowed officers and soldiers of the war of eighteen hundred and twelve to sit on the Senate floor during a convention. Access to the Senate floor was restricted to senators, Senate officers, and House of Representatives members in 1858 until a new chamber was established in 1859. In January 1859, the Senate amended Rule 48 to restrict access to the Senate floor to specific individuals, including officers, members of the House of Representatives, the President, foreign ministers, and judges of the Supreme Court. Temporary access could be granted for specific reasons through motions and resolutions. In 1862, governors were added to the list of individuals allowed on the Senate floor. In 1868, the Senate revised Rule 47 to include \"ministers of the United States and foreign ministers.\" During the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, access to the Senate floor was restricted to specific individuals and gallery spectators with tickets. During the impeachment trial, the Senate rejected a resolution to allow the Associated Press agent on the floor. Senate amended Rule 47 to include General of the Army, Admiral of the Navy, foreign legislators, private secretaries, and the Librarian of Congress. The inclusion of \"duly appointed in writing\" limited employee admission. In 1877, the Senate codified the floor privileges rule, granting access to specific individuals including private secretaries, foreign ministers, and ex-Presidents. In 1879, George Bancroft was granted permanent floor privileges, a unique occurrence in Senate history. In 1884, the Senate re-codified the rules to grant permanent floor privileges to George Bancroft, a renowned historian and author. This privilege was extended to honor him as a distinguished man of letters. The revised Rule XXXIII specified individuals allowed admittance and added new categories such as the House Sergeant at Arms and judges of the Court of Claims. In 1884, the Senate revised Rule XXXIII to grant permanent floor privileges to George Bancroft and added new categories for admittance. The rule was further amended in 1888 and 1889 to include ex-Speakers of the House, President-elect, and Vice President-elect. In 1891, after the deaths of Bancroft, the general of the Army, and the admiral of the Navy, the Senate amended the rules to broaden the categories for floor privileges. The amendment clarified who was entitled to admission, including Senate employees and ex-Secretaries of the Senate. The 1891 amendment to Senate rules expanded floor privileges to include ex-Secretaries of the Senate and Senate staff, replacing the term secretary with clerk and removing gender restrictions. This allowed female staff members to enter the Senate chamber during sessions. In 1946, informal tradition allowed only male secretaries on the Senate floor, despite the presence of women clerks. The first female staff member granted floor privileges was Frances Dustin, after a failed Equal Rights Amendment vote. Senator Brewster considered a resolution for women's floor access but found it unnecessary as rules already allowed female clerks on the floor. The ruling allowed female clerks the same floor privileges as male clerks in the Senate, marking a historic moment as Frances Dustin entered the chamber for the first time in 160 years. She discussed the privilege with Senator Brewster before leaving, promising that women would not abuse it. The first time in 160 years a woman had floor privilege in the Senate as clerk to a Senator. Senators used to request access via unanimous consent until 1978. Majority Leader Byrd supported a new procedure proposed by Senator Magnuson to streamline staff admissions. On September 30, Byrd requested unanimous consent for Senators to pre-notify the Journal clerk for staff admissions. Senator Ted Stevens supported a new procedure for staff admissions on the Senate floor, with the condition that Senators specify the bill, date, and limit staff members to two at a time. Majority Leader Byrd accepted the modification and received unanimous consent to implement the procedure. Senator Ted Stevens supported a new procedure for staff admissions on the Senate floor, with Senators allowed to leave a list of two staff members for floor privileges during specific matters. Majority Leader Byrd established this policy for the 96th Congress through unanimous consent, and subsequent Congresses have seen similar requests without formal codification in Senate rules. Floyd Riddick noted this practice in Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices. In 1979, the Senate revised the Standing Rules to include new position categories for floor privileges, such as the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the mayor of the District of Columbia. The Privilege of the Floor rule was recodified in 1980 as Rule XXIII, adding members of the European Parliament. No new position categories have been added since 1980. In 1997, the Senate added a new position category to the Privilege of the Floor rule, allowing individuals with disabilities to access the Senate floor with guide dogs, wheelchairs, or other accommodations. Senator Ron Wyden requested permission for a legislative fellow with a service dog, which was initially objected to. Majority Leader Trent Lott then proposed a policy allowing individuals with disabilities to bring necessary support services onto the Senate floor until further review by the Rules and Administration Committee. Senator Wyden sponsored S.Res. 110 (105th Congress) to allow individuals with disabilities access to the Senate floor with necessary support services, such as service dogs and interpreters, unless deemed a significant difficulty or expense by the Senate Sergeant at Arms. Senator Wyden sponsored S.Res. 110 (105th Congress) to allow individuals with disabilities access to the Senate floor with necessary support services, such as service dogs and interpreters, unless deemed a significant difficulty or expense by the Senate Sergeant at Arms. The resolution's \"undue burden language is intended for very unusual circumstances, like significant architectural modifications. The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, including John Warner, supported the resolution to set an example for disability accommodation. The staff disability accommodation policy remains a non-statutory standing order of the Senate. Another resolution in 1997 applied only to that Congress and concerned a wounded Senator. Resolution S.Res. 8 in the 105th Congress allowed a Senator, a wounded veteran, to have an employee assist him in traveling to and from his seat in the Senate chamber. Majority Leader Lott implemented policies for Senate access during the impeachment trial of President Clinton, limiting access to the Senate floor based on protocol considerations. Access to the Senate floor during impeachment proceedings is limited to specific individuals based on guidelines set by the Secretaries for the Majority and Minority and the Sergeant at Arms. This includes designated staff members and officials such as assistants to leaders, legal counsel, cloakroom staff, legislative staff, and doorkeepers. The Senate floor access during impeachment proceedings is restricted to specific individuals as per guidelines set by the Secretaries for the Majority and Minority and the Sergeant at Arms. This includes designated staff members and officials such as assistants to leaders, legal counsel, cloakroom staff, legislative staff, and doorkeepers. The UC agreement also specifies who can be admitted to the Senate floor during impeachment proceedings, including assistants to the Chief Justice, assistants to the House managers, and counsel for the President of the United States. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 eliminated Senate floor privileges for former Members, officers, and Speakers of the House who are registered lobbyists or seek financial gain. Rule XXIII now excludes lobbyists from the chamber during Senate sessions, with exceptions outlined for certain events. Lobbyists or agents of foreign principals are not granted floor privileges, as stated in Clause 2(a) of the amended rule. The Senate's Rule XXIII prohibits lobbyists from having floor privileges during Senate sessions, with exceptions for certain events. In 2018, a resolution allowed Senators to bring their young children onto the Senate floor during votes. The Senate passed a resolution in 2018 allowing Senators to bring their young children onto the Senate floor during votes. This policy change was prompted by a concern raised by a Senator expecting a baby daughter. Senator Tammy Duckworth voted with her newborn daughter on the Senate floor in 2018. In 2020, the Senate agreed to a unanimous consent request regarding access to the Senate wing and floor during the President Trump impeachment trial. The UC agreement's section on Senate floor access outlined policies for entrance and seating, with specific regulations for trial assistants. Limited staff access was specified, with the Majority Leader and Minority Leader allowed up to 4 assistants each. The UC agreement limits staff access on the Senate floor, with specific regulations for trial assistants. Various Senate officials and their staff are granted access as needed under supervision.

The Sergeant at Arms enforces Senate chamber rules, including restricting staff access to the floor based on specific regulations and UC agreements. Only authorized staff members are allowed on the floor during a Senate session, with a limit of two staff members from the same Senator's office at a time. The regulations aim to supervise employees on the floor while ensuring their privilege is not deprived. The Senate Doorkeepers provide instructions for Senate staff members to access the Senate floor, ensuring they are eligible under Rule XXIII.

The Senate Doorkeepers provide instructions for Senate staff members to access the Senate floor, ensuring eligibility under Rule XXIII. Staff members must be committee staff or work in a Senator's office and be on the Senate payroll. Changes in personnel should be updated through the SAA TranSAAct web portal. Credentialed staff members submit changes to the SAA via TranSAAct. Senate offices may pre-submit names of multiple staff members, but the number of staff members from the same office allowed on the floor at one time is limited. Access is restricted to individuals with floor passes from the Credentials Desk. Committees are allotted six cards for pending legislation, with four having no time limit and two with a 15-minute limit for official duties. Each Senator and the Vice President receive two cards for regular full-time Senate staff members in their office. Staff members working in a Senator's office can obtain time-limited cards to speak briefly to a Senator or transport materials to the floor. They can sign in and get a pass at the Credentials Desk before a Senate session. The desk attendant checks their Senate ID badge and verifies their information in the TranSAAct system. Unlisted staff members should request to be added to the database. The desk attendant notes the staff member's name, office, official business, and card number in the daily roster. Staff members granted floor access must display their Senate ID badges and floor passes to the Doorkeeper at the chamber entrance. After completing their duties, they should return the floor passes to the Credentials Desk attendant. If a Senator's office has reached its allotment, additional employees must wait in the Senate lobby. The Sergeant at Arms may rotate staff on and off the floor to reduce congestion and restrict access based on UC agreements or Senate resolutions. Staff members with floor access must display their Senate ID badges and floor passes to the Doorkeeper.

The Sergeant at Arms closes the floor for entry during roll-call votes, except for staff members granted access via unanimous consent or committee staff associated with the issue. Senators may use UC requests to provide access to staff members on the floor, including those not in the TranSAAct database or Senate payroll. UC requests can also allow access for more than two staff members at a time or for temporary floor privileges for individuals not on the Senate payroll. Requests for additional staff members must include a reason for the increase. Examples of UC request language that may be used to grant floor privileges include requesting access for defense fellows or additional staff members during debate and votes on a specific bill in the Senate."
