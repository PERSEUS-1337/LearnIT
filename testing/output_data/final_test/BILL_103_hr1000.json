    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Asbestos Management Incentive Act.\" Key findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that although asbestos is hazardous, the risk of asbestos-related disease depends on exposure to airborne asbestos fibers. Data from the Environmental Protection Agency indicates that average airborne asbestos levels in buildings are low, resulting in a low health risk for most building occupants. The EPA estimates that only 20% of buildings contain friable asbestos-containing material and removal of asbestos may not always be the best solution to reduce exposure. Improper asbestos removal can increase exposure and risks. EPA requires removal to prevent public exposure during demolition or renovation. Lending institutions may demand removal for health and liability reasons. EPA recommends a proactive approach. The EPA recommends proactive management of intact asbestos-containing material. The American Medical Association suggests focusing on safe coexistence with asbestos rather than complete removal. The Health Effects Institute's report in September 1991 indicates that the health risks of intact asbestos in well-maintained buildings are minimal. Maintenance workers exposed to higher levels of asbestos may have a significantly increased risk of cancer. The text chunk discusses the impact of asbestos inspection on lending institutions. Liability immunity for lending institutions making loans secured by a commercial building with asbestos-containing material. Liability immunity for lending institutions making loans secured by a commercial building with asbestos-containing material is granted if the building meets certain criteria, such as having no asbestos-containing material certified by the construction manager or having undergone an asbestos inspection within the last 5 years with recommended removal of asbestos-containing material. Liability immunity for lending institutions making loans secured by a commercial building with asbestos-containing material is granted if the building meets specific criteria outlined in the Occupational Safety and Health Act and related regulations. However, this immunity does not apply if the lending institution mandates the removal of asbestos-containing material recommended for in-place handling by the management planner, or requires an asbestos inspection despite evidence provided by the loan applicant. The loan applicant can qualify for liability immunity if they provide documentation showing asbestos removal from the building. The immunity does not apply to a lending institution's subsidiary if they secure a loan on a commercial building. The section will take effect immediately. The section will take effect upon the promulgation of regulations by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to section 7(a). In the event of foreclosure, a lending institution that is immune from liability for a commercial building will maintain that immunity as long as they follow regulations for operations and maintenance, EPA asbestos guidance, and this Act. The Act states that a lending institution requiring an asbestos inspection for a building securing a loan is not considered participation in building management, but rather a measure to protect the institution's security interest. Additionally, after foreclosure, the institution must conduct an operations and maintenance program to maintain immunity from liability. For the purpose of this Act, an asbestos inspection of a commercial building must be conducted by a qualified management planner to determine the presence of asbestos-containing material. The management planner will recommend specific response actions for each area with such material, following regulations and EPA guidance. A qualified management planner must be accredited as an inspector under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits individuals from owning or controlling entities involved in response actions for asbestos-containing material in buildings they inspect. Accreditation of management planners for public and commercial buildings is amended under the Act. The Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to include provisions for public or commercial buildings in response actions for asbestos-containing material. Accreditation of management planners for such buildings is also updated under the Act. The Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to include provisions for public or commercial buildings in response actions for asbestos-containing material. Accreditation of management planners for such buildings is also updated under the Act. Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency requirements are addressed in Section 7. The Environmental Protection Agency will establish regulations for asbestos inspection and management in public and commercial buildings within a year of the Act's enactment. The regulations will include guidelines for determining whether asbestos should be removed or managed in place, practices for maintenance programs, and standards for surveillance of asbestos-containing material. The Environmental Protection Agency will establish regulations for asbestos inspection and management in public and commercial buildings, including standards for training maintenance and custodial staff. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will periodically update, revise, and republish asbestos guidance documents. SEC. 8. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS. After an asbestos inspection, the owner must visually inspect remaining asbestos-containing material every 6 months. Accessible asbestos in public areas must be labeled, excluding intact vinyl floor tile and ceiling tile. After an asbestos inspection, the owner must ensure access to any remaining asbestos-containing material is restricted to authorized personnel. A report on the inspection must be kept on file in the building, detailing the remaining asbestos, removal recommendations, and any past removals. The report should be available for inspection by tenants, employees, maintenance workers, and contractors. After each asbestos inspection, the building owner must inform maintenance workers of the inspection and make the inspection report available for their review. Maintenance workers and contractors should be notified of any changes in the condition of asbestos-containing material in the building. SEC. 9. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAW.\n\n(a) Clean Air Act - This Act does not affect the requirement to remove asbestos from a building under the Clean Air Act.\n(b) Limited Requirements - This Act does not impose general inspection or maintenance programs in buildings, but rather enables lending institutions to meet conditions for liability immunity.\n\nSEC. 10.
