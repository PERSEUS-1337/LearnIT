    "content": "We propose a technique for training generative RNNs to plan ahead by using a backward recurrent network to generate sequences in reverse order. This approach improves performance on speech recognition and COCO caption generation tasks. RNNs excel at tasks by predicting one output at a time based on past information. They are usually trained using teacher forcing to optimize one-step-ahead prediction. However, they may focus more on recent tokens than capturing long-term dependencies, leading to local coherence but lacking global coherence in generated samples. Recent efforts to address the difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies in RNNs include augmenting them with external memory, unitary or hierarchical architectures, and explicit planning mechanisms. Additionally, parallel efforts aim to prevent overfitting on strong local correlations by regularizing the network states and applying dropout or penalizing various statistics. TwinNet is a method for regularizing a recurrent neural network by running a backward RNN in parallel to the forward RNN. This encourages the model to focus on past information predictive of the long-term future. The backward network is trained to maximize data log-likelihood and the cost function can be a Euclidean distance or a learned metric. Our model introduces a regularization term to the training loss by formulating explicit auxiliary targets for the forward hidden states, namely the backward hidden states. This approach is distinct from other regularization methods and is driven by the intuition that the backward hidden states contain a summary of the future of the sequence. The TwinNet approach introduces a regularization term to the training loss by utilizing backward hidden states as auxiliary targets. This method improves prediction accuracy by forming a better representation of the past. Experimental results show its effectiveness in various generation tasks such as speech recognition, image captioning, and language modeling. The model's contributions include training generative recurrent networks, extensive evaluation on multiple tasks, and visualization of the introduced cost. The introduced cost negatively correlates with word frequency in the analysis. A dataset of sequences is used to estimate density by maximizing log-likelihood. Recurrent neural networks are powerful for approximating conditional probability by updating hidden states iteratively. The network uses a non-linear function to summarize past information and predict the next symbol. A twin recurrent network predicts the sequence in reverse to ensure compatibility with future inputs. Hidden states of the forward and backward networks are required to be close, containing useful information for prediction. Our idea is to penalize the distance between forward and backward hidden states to improve prediction accuracy. This is achieved by using the Euclidean distance and a parameterized affine transformation function. The model's objective is a weighted sum for a sequence, aiming for predictive forward and backward hidden states. The model's objective is to maximize a weighted sum of forward and backward log-likelihoods while penalizing the distance between hidden states. The penalty term is controlled by an alpha hyper-parameter to provide a stable learning signal to the forward network. The method avoids co-adaptation of backward and forward networks and can be extended to conditional generation cases. Bidirectional neural networks are used as powerful feature extractors for sequence tasks. Bidirectional neural networks are effective feature extractors for sequence tasks, incorporating information from both past and future time steps. However, applying these models to sequence generation is challenging due to limitations in ancestral sampling. To address this, a backward model is used to regularize the hidden states of the forward model during training. Gated architectures like LSTMs and GRUs help in modeling long-term dependencies by controlling the flow of information through gates. Recent efforts in improving neural networks include methods such as equipping architectures with hierarchical structures, making recurrent dynamics unitary, and augmenting RNNs with explicit planning mechanisms. Regularization techniques like noise injection are also utilized to shape learning dynamics and overcome local correlations. Dropout, Zoneout, norm stabilization, and other regularization methods are used in neural networks to improve learning dynamics and overcome local correlations. Experimental results on sequence generation are presented to analyze the performance gains of TwinNet. In an effort to understand the performance gains of TwinNet, the results of conditional generation tasks like speech recognition and image captioning show clear improvements over baseline and other regularization methods. However, in unconditional language generation, the model does not significantly improve on the baseline. Additionally, the model's suitability for tasks is further analyzed through a sequential imputation task, varying from unconditional to strongly conditional. The approach is evaluated on character-level speech recognition, where the model is trained to convert speech audio signals to character sequences using forward and backward RNNs as conditional generative models with soft attention. The model is evaluated on the Wall Street Journal dataset using 40 mel-filter bank features for speech recognition. Various regularization methods are compared, including TwinNet, with different configurations showing improvements in character error rate. The features are generated following the Kaldi s5 recipe. The model is trained using features generated from the Kaldi s5 recipe BID46, with an input feature dimension of 123. Character Error Rate (CER) is monitored for validation and test sets, with early stopping based on the best CER. Training includes pretraining for 1 epoch with a forward-moving context window, followed by 10 epochs with a freely moving context window and annealing with 2 different learning rates. AdaDelta optimizer is used, and a hyper-parameter search is conducted on the weight \u03b1 of the twin loss. Results are summarized in TAB0. The best performing model in the study showed a 12% improvement compared to the baseline. The TwinNet with a learned metric was found to be more effective than strictly matching forward and hidden states. Two ablation tests were conducted to investigate the usefulness of using a backward recurrent network. Results indicated that information included in the backward states is indeed useful for obtaining significant improvements. The TwinNet model converges faster than the baseline, generalizes better, and utilizes information from backward states for significant improvements. The L2 cost initially rises as networks learn independently but later align hidden representations. High entropy words like \"uzi\" cause spikes in loss, especially for rare words. Average L2 distance decreases with word frequency, as shown in histograms comparing rare and frequent words. The study compares the cost of rare and frequent words, showing that average cost is lower for frequent words with higher variance for rare words. The L2 cost cross-entropy of the forward network demonstrates the role of conditioning in output entropy. Evaluation is done on image captioning using the MS COCO dataset with early stopping based on validation scores. TwinNet is tested on encoder-decoder for consistency. The study evaluates TwinNet on image captioning models using Resnet for feature extraction and LSTM for both 'Show & Tell' and soft attention. Results on the MS COCO dataset show improvements in metrics like BLEU and METEOR. Twin cost is added to both models for comparison. The text chunk discusses various models and their performance on different tasks such as binarized sequential MNIST and WikiText-2. It also includes results for models like MNIST DBN, NADE, EoNADE-5, DLGM, DARN, DRAW, P-Forcing, PixelRNN, PixelVAE, MatNets, and LSTM with different configurations. The results show varying levels of performance for each model. The text chunk discusses the performance of various models on tasks like binarized sequential MNIST. TwinNet showed improvements over \"Show & Tell\" and small improvements were observed for the soft attention model. The baseline LSTM implementation achieved 79.87 nats on the test set. The TwinNet regularization cost improves LSTM performance by 0.52 nats. Adding dropout further enhances results, with the final model achieving 79.12 nats on the test set. Results are competitive with deeper models like PixelRNN and PixelVAE BID24. Additionally, the TwinNet regularization cost is applied to the AWD-LSTM model for language modeling tasks on PennTree Bank and WikiText-2 datasets, showing promising results in Table 3. The proposed model is a simple recurrent neural network with two separate networks running in opposite directions during training. The forward model's states are predictive of the entire future sequence, making the sampling process efficient. Empirical results show good performance on conditional generation tasks, with an interpretable behavior of the proposed loss. One drawback is that training requires double the computation of the baseline due to the backward network, but the sampling process has the same computation steps as the baseline. One future direction is to test if the approach can improve conditional speech synthesis using WaveNet. Minor improvements were seen when applied to language modeling with PennTree bank, possibly due to high entropy in the target distribution. To address this, replacing the L2 loss with a more expressive loss obtained through inference networks or distribution matching techniques could be explored in future research."
