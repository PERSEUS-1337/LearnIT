    "content": "Article V of the U.S. Constitution outlines two methods for amending the Constitution: through Congress with a two-thirds vote in both houses, or through an Article V Convention initiated by two-thirds of state legislatures. The approval of three-fourths of states is required for any proposed amendments to be added to the Constitution. Interest in the Article V Convention option has seen a resurgence in the past decade after being dormant for some time. Advocacy groups from various political spectrums are supporting the Article V Convention as a solution to federal legislative and policy deadlock. The advancement in communication technology has accelerated the emergence of new convention advocacy organizations, streamlining the process that was once time-consuming and requiring significant infrastructure. The curr_chunk discusses the provisions of Article V of the U.S. Constitution regarding the procedures for proposing amendments. It covers the role of Congress in calling a convention, the form and function of Article V conventions, proposed amendments, ratification process, and ancillary issues. Another report tracks current developments in Congress, states, and the Article V Convention advocacy community. Amendments: Historical Perspectives for Congress delves into the convention mechanism for amending the U.S. Constitution, detailing the procedures for proposing amendments by Congress and the role of states in the ratification process. Article V provides two methods for amending the Constitution, with Congress proposing amendments that must be ratified by three-fourths of the states. The Article V Convention alternative allows for amendments to be proposed by Congress or a convention called by two-thirds of the states. Both methods require ratification by three-fourths of the states, with Congress choosing the method of ratification. Amendments ratified by either method have equal force as part of the Constitution. The ratification process for proposed amendments includes a three-fourths requirement, with additional elements such as amendments being included as supplementary articles and Congress setting a time limit for ratification. These elements are not necessarily required for amendments proposed by an Article V Convention. The Constitution does not require the President's approval for proposed amendments. Thirty-three amendments have been proposed by Congress, with 27 approved by the states. The 18th Amendment was repealed by the 21st Amendment. The Article V Convention option has not been successfully invoked yet. In the 20th century, various campaigns made efforts to secure enough applications for an Article V Convention. The most successful campaign was for the popular election of U.S. Senators, leading to the 17th Amendment in 1912. Other campaigns in the 1960s-1980s and later in the century came close to the required number of state applications but ultimately fell short. Various campaigns in the 1960s-1980s aimed to change the Constitution, including one for apportioning districts and another for a balanced federal budget amendment. Both efforts ultimately failed due to various reasons such as changing public attitudes and legislative actions addressing budget deficits. Advocates argue that convention applications remain valid indefinitely, even if submitted in the past. In the past, campaigns for an Article V Convention faced obstacles due to the requirement of a two-thirds majority of state legislatures. However, new technology and advocacy methods may be changing the landscape for convention proponents. The process of securing convention applications from a large number of states has historically been challenging, even with advancements in mass electronic communications. Grass-roots movements have taken time to develop, communicate, and establish national structures to promote causes, with state legislatures serving as a check to the convention process. Securing convention applications from states has historically been challenging, with time constraints on state legislative sessions. It took seven years to gain applications from 32 state legislatures for the balanced budget amendment campaign. Previous efforts to consider diverse issues through an Article V Convention did not reach the required 34 state applications. In the 21st century, the convention alternative has seen a revival among various advocacy groups, such as the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street. Progress in communications technology, like the Internet and social media, has facilitated the rise of issue-driven mass policy advocacy campaigns. Groups like MoveOn.org, the Tea Party movement, and Occupy Wall Street have quickly gained prominence through contemporary communication strategies. The resurgence of interest in the Article V Convention has been fueled by public dissatisfaction with national policy deadlock and the direction of the country. Political analysts highlight a period of heightened political volatility, with prolonged pessimism in national polling. A Pew Research Center study in late 2014 revealed widespread expectations of deepening political divisions and ongoing partisan gridlock. The Article V Convention movement has not gained widespread public support or influenced state legislatures. Congress holds important responsibilities for the amendment process, including proposing amendments with a two-thirds vote and summoning a convention with support from two-thirds of state legislatures. Despite public dissatisfaction with political deadlock, only 20% believe progress will be made on national issues. Advances in communications technology and public concern over policy deadlock have led to advocacy for an Article V Convention on various issues. While some groups have tried to persuade state legislatures, widespread support remains uncertain. There is potential for a rapid increase in interest, presenting Congress with urgent policy decisions. The Article V Convention process is moving quickly, requiring Congress to address urgent policy considerations. State legislatures play a crucial role in the process, but Congress is equally important in summoning and defining the convention. Key policy questions for Congress include its overall role in the process and the decision to call a convention. The overall role of Congress in the convention process under Article V is unclear. Supporters of a minimalist interpretation suggest Congress should have a purely ministerial role in calling the convention and referring proposed amendments to the states. The Article V Convention process requires Congress to call a convention and refer proposed amendments to the states. This role is seen as ministerial, with Congress having a duty to act upon the request of two-thirds of the states. Alexander Hamilton emphasized the mandatory nature of this process, stating that Congress \"shall call a convention\" without discretion. This check was intentionally included in the Constitution to address an unresponsive Congress. The duties of Congress in calling a convention at the request of two-thirds of state legislatures suggest that Congress acts as the legislatures' agent. Congress cannot impose its own rules on the states or the convention. Some scholars argue that Congress should have broad authority over an Article V Convention, while others view Congress as a mere \"guardian.\" The House Judiciary Committee explored these perspectives in its 1993 report. The 1993 report on the Constitutional Convention in America suggested that Congress has a role in calling the convention and choosing a method of ratification. There is debate on the extent of Congress's function, with some advocating for a limited role while others argue for broader authority. The House Judiciary Committee's report explored these differing perspectives. Congress has the primary power of administering Article V and must call a Convention for proposing Amendments once two-thirds of the states have submitted applications. Legal scholars agree that Congress is obligated to call a convention as per the founders' intentions, as stated by Alexander Hamilton. The article emphasizes that Congress is obligated to call a convention for proposing amendments once two-thirds of the states have submitted applications, as per the founders' intentions. Constitutional scholar Russell Caplan confirmed the unanimity of the founders on this issue, citing various historical figures. Some factors may be used to argue against the validity of state applications for a convention. Applications proposing a specifically-worded amendment are invalid as they seek to make the 'Convention' part of the ratifying process rather than the deliberative process for 'proposing' constitutional amendments. Hesitation in calling an Article V Convention also arises from the issue of its scope and the question of whether state applications expire over time. Convention proponents argue that state applications never expire, while a 2010 study by the Goldwater Institute stated that Congress cannot impose rules on the states or the convention. In a 1957 report to the House Judiciary Committee, committee counsel Cyril Brickfield suggested that Congress may not be compelled to summon an Article V Convention even if enough state applications were submitted. Congress has the mandate to act, but its failure to do so may not lead to any enforceable cause of action. Another option could be preemption of the convention call, where Congress legally responds to state applications. During the 1980s campaign for a convention to consider a balanced budget amendment, the National Taxpayers' Union asserted that the convention movement was designed to force Congress to propose an amendment. The House Judiciary Committee supported this argument in its 1993 print, noting that states had forwarded conditional applications that would be canceled if Congress proposed a balanced budget amendment. In the final analysis, Congress may need to heed the call of the nation's citizens through state legislatures and Article V requirements. Public opinion and the ballot box are key in persuading Congress to act. The House Judiciary Committee speculated that a failure to call a convention could lead to court challenges, but doubts exist about court intervention. The status of an Article V Convention is debated, with some viewing it as a near-sovereign body, others as an instrument of state constitutional authority, and some suggesting it fits within the constitutional framework. Law professor Michael Stokes Paulsen argues for a unique status based on original intent. Michael Stokes Paulsen argues for a unique status for the Article V Convention, comparing it to the Constitutional Convention and emphasizing its role as a deliberative political body representing the people. He aligns with Cyril Brickfield's concept of \"conventional sovereignty,\" viewing the convention as a premier assembly charged with framing the basic law of the land. The convention tasked with amending the Constitution is considered to have sovereign powers, superior to other government branches. However, some argue that a convention is not truly sovereign but rather an agency of the people for revising fundamental law. The Article V Convention, tasked with amending the Constitution, should not have primacy over other government branches. Some argue that the convention should be firmly in the hands of the states with minimal role for Congress. Former Solicitor General Walter Dellinger expressed concern about the role of state legislatures in the convention process. The framers sought to create a Constitution amendment process insulated from excessive influence, including from Congress and state legislatures. Dellinger argued that a convention should have the authority to make its own decisions and draft amendments, rather than being dominated by Congress or state legislatures. The nature of the convention envisioned by the founders has been a controversial issue. The founders envisioned three models for the Article V Convention: general convention, limited convention, and \"runaway\" convention. Each variant has gained both supporters and critics over the years. The founders envisioned three models for the Article V Convention: general convention, limited convention, and \"runaway\" convention. The general convention option has arguably generated less opposition than the other models. Advocates note that Article V is broadly inclusive and permits a general convention for proposing amendments. The American Bar Association's 1974 accepted the validity of a general convention as essential, stating that implementing legislation should not preclude states from applying for one. However, not all observers support the idea of a general convention, with concerns raised about unlimited conventions transcending their mandates. The trend towards aggrandizement of power at conventions is supported by modern experience in the states. Delegates often choose to frame a new constitution rather than submit amendments to the existing document, leading to concerns about unlimited conventions transcending their mandates. Some scholars argue that Article V places no limitations on the number or scope of amendments within a convention's purview. Constitutional scholar Charles Black supported this viewpoint in the 1970s. Defenders of the general convention could counter opponents by asserting that the founders included ample checks on the work of a general or unlimited convention. They might also note that Congress retains the authority to choose whether proposed amendments will be considered by state legislatures or ad-hoc conventions for ratification. In the final analysis, a convention can only propose amendments, not ratify them. The concept of a limited convention has considerable support in the debate over the Article V alternative. Some scholars argue that a convention under Article V can be limited to specific issues in state applications, contrary to Charles Black's view. They believe the framers intended for specific amendments rather than a general revision of the Constitution. Senator Sam Ervin supported this idea, emphasizing the need for specific amendments over a general overhaul. Some commentators argue that a convention under Article V can be limited to specific issues in state applications, emphasizing the need for specific amendments rather than a general revision of the Constitution. They believe that the founders intended to check Congress's ability to impede popular amendments. The Convention Clause allows states, not Congress, to limit a convention to achieve this purpose. This viewpoint suggests that a convention could be open or limited based on state applications. Congress historically embraced the limited convention, claiming authority to call it while respecting state application process and limiting subject of amendments to areas cited in state petitions. In 1984, Senate Judiciary Committee asserted Congress's power to set and enforce limits on subject considered by Article V Convention based on state petitions. States, through Congress, responsible for imposing subject-matter limitations on the convention. The Article V Convention allows states to apply for a convention to propose specific amendments. The founders intended for the convention to be controlled by the states, with Congress facilitating the will of the people through their state legislatures. The convention would be bound by the agenda set by the states, respecting the limits of the mandate. The Article V Convention allows states to call for a convention to propose specific amendments. Congress is obligated to call for a limited convention if states request one for specific policy proposals. Bills introduced between 1968 and 1992 included language supporting the limited convention model. For example, S. 119, the Constitutional Convention Implementation Act of 1984, outlined the process for summoning an Article V Convention with specific amendments for consideration. The limited convention model allows states to propose specific amendments for consideration, with Congress having the authority to decide related questions. Critics like Yale Professor Charles Black argue that state applications for single-issue conventions should be considered null and void, as they were rare in the 19th century. Professor Black argues that single-issue conventions were rare in the 19th century and were not contemplated by the founders. He believes that limited conventions would be constitutionally impermissible as Article V does not authorize them to address topics beyond their original purpose. Congress cannot be obligated to summon a convention for the limited purpose of dealing with electoral apportionment alone, as argued by Walter Dellinger. He believes that any new constitutional convention should have the authority to study, debate, and submit amendments for ratification, regardless of limitations in state applications or congressional summons. During the 1980s campaign for a balanced budget amendment convention, state legislatures proposed specific amendment language, some advocating for specifically-worded amendments. The limited convention variant, where a convention considers only a particular subject, continues to draw support despite concerns about its constitutionality. The House Judiciary Committee's study suggested that using similar language could meet constitutional requirements for a balanced budget amendment convention, but proposing specifically-worded amendments could not be considered valid. This approach was argued to undermine the Convention's deliberative function and bypass the checks and balances built into Article V by the framers. Walter Dellinger further contended that specific language proposals would deprive the Convention of its purpose to \"propose amendments\" and turn it into part of the ratification process. The House Judiciary Committee's study suggested that proposing specifically-worded amendments for a balanced budget amendment convention could undermine the Convention's deliberative function. H.J.Res. 34, introduced in the 114th Congress, aims to expand the Constitution's Article V Convention language to allow states to apply for a specifically-worded amendment, addressing concerns about the validity of such amendments and preventing a \"runaway convention.\" Concerns about a potential \"runaway convention\" have been a recurring theme in discussions about an Article V Convention. Some suggest that Congress should limit the agenda of the convention to the exact wording of the amendment proposed by the states to prevent any deviation from the intended purpose. One scholar noted that a \"runaway convention\" is an age-old fear, defined as an Article V Convention that strays beyond its original mandate to consider policy questions and amendments not initially proposed. Concerns have been raised about delegates potentially wanting to make broader changes once convened, as seen in past proposals for amendments on apportionment. Virginia state legislator James LeMunyon expressed concerns about the possibility of a \"rogue\" constitutional convention targeting the Bill of Rights. Critics fear that such a convention could propose drastic changes to the Constitution, including revising or deleting parts of the Bill of Rights. However, some commentators believe that worries about a runaway convention are exaggerated, arguing that the diversity of opinions in the United States would prevent a monolithic agenda from dominating. The diversity of opinions in the United States would act as a deterrent against a \"rogue\" constitutional convention. Delegates would represent the political mainstream, with checks and balances from State Legislatures and the Supreme Court. Time for deliberation in proposing and ratifying amendments would prevent surprises or drastic changes to the Constitution. The Senate Judiciary Committee's 1984 report on S.119 in the 98th Congress argued that an Article V Convention would be broad, inclusive, and moderate, similar to Congress. Delegates representing the political mainstream, with checks and balances from State Legislatures and the Supreme Court, would prevent a \"rogue\" constitutional convention. The notion of a 'runaway' convention amending the Constitution against the will of the American people is deemed impossible. The Constitution is silent on the next steps after an Article V Convention drafts and approves amendments. Scholars believe Congress must refer amendments to the states, as the convention was meant to be an alternative to Congress's amendatory power. The Constitution is silent on the next steps after an Article V Convention drafts and approves amendments. Scholars believe Congress must refer amendments to the states, as the convention was meant to be an alternative to Congress's amendatory power. However, there is disagreement on whether a blanket requirement to refer all amendments to the states would frustrate the intent of the convention. Congress historically claimed the right to determine the conditions under which a convention-proposed amendment might be referred to the states, asserting authority based on the assumption of a limited convention. Congress reserved the right to decide whether an amendment would be submitted to the states for approval and ratification. The Article V Convention is limited by the subject matter set forth in the concurrent resolutions by Congress. Proposed legislation allowed Congress to withhold amendments if they did not align with the convention's purpose. Senator Sam Ervin argued for Congress's right to reject amendments due to procedural irregularities or subject matter limitations imposed by Congress. The Congress must adhere to subject matter limitations set by the concurrent resolution for the Article V Convention. Senator Sam Ervin emphasized that Congress cannot unconditionally refuse to submit proposed amendments for ratification, as it would undermine the independence of the amending process. The Goldwater Institute's 2010 study also highlighted that Congress is obligated to refer convention-approved amendments to the states, but they must align with the convention's mandate. The Article V Convention must adhere to subject matter limitations set by the concurrent resolution. If the convention proposes amendments, Congress must send those within the convention's call to the states. The Goldwater Institute study suggested that the convention could offer policy recommendations outside its mandate, sparking national debate on the issues. Congress may be obligated to propose all amendments approved by an Article V Convention to the states, even if they are not within the convention's call. This could potentially undermine the independence of the convention and give Congress supreme power, contrary to the intentions of the framers. The text, history, and structure of Article V suggest that Congress should have a limited role in setting the agenda of a convention. Congress's responsibilities are to call the convention and choose a ratification method for proposed amendments. Any attempt by Congress to veto an amendment from an Article V Convention may not be sustainable. The Article V Convention delegates may argue that congressional refusal to propose amendments would hinder the people's voice in the ratification process. Congress might face a political dilemma if they refuse to submit the convention's proposals for ratification, potentially leading them to ultimately submit all proposals for the people to have a say. In the final analysis, Congress's ability to refuse to refer an amendment may depend on the type of convention authorized in Article V and its mandate. If a limited convention is allowed, Congress could potentially decline to propose amendments beyond its authorization. However, if a general convention is requested or if a limited convention can propose amendments beyond its mandate, Congress may have less justification to refuse. Congress historically has considerable discretion in setting standards and procedures for an Article V assembly. During the late 1960s to early 1990s, Congress considered numerous bills to establish procedures for an Article V Convention. A total of 50 convention planning bills were introduced in the House of Representatives and Senate during this period. The proposed legislation aimed to create a procedural framework for a potential convention, providing a \"stand-by\" tool for contingency planning. The Senate passed two constitutional convention procedures bills during this time. During the late 1960s to early 1990s, Congress considered numerous bills to establish procedures for an Article V Convention. The Senate passed two constitutional convention procedures bills, but the House did not take action. No relevant legislation has been introduced since the 103rd Congress in 1993-1994. Legislative proposals evolved over the years with specific requirements for state applications and convention standards. The House Judiciary Committee's 1993 study highlighted the need for specific requirements for an Article V Convention, including standards for state applications, delegate apportionment, procedures, funding, ratification procedures, and judicial review. Most proposed bills during that period included guidelines for state applications, submission schedules, and a contemporaneity provision. The proposed bills included a contemporaneity provision, setting a time limit of usually seven years for state convention applications to expire. The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives were authorized to receive and retain applications, declare when received, and report to their respective chambers. Congress needed to declare through a concurrent resolution that valid applications from two-thirds of states had been submitted, meeting the constitutional requirement for an Article V Convention. Convention procedures bills set a time limit for Congress to call a convention once the requirement was met, usually ranging from 45 days to two years. The bills proposed calling for a convention to consider amendments, with varying methods for apportioning delegates among states. Some proposals assigned delegates based on the number of Representatives and Senators, totaling 535 delegates. This allocation aimed to give smaller states a weighted influence in proposing amendments. Some bills proposed a three-member delegation for the District of Columbia in a convention, with voting on a per capita basis. Delegates were to be popularly elected, with some advocating for states to have discretion in choosing the selection process. Advocates assert states have discretion in choosing delegates. Convention procedures bills cover compensation, expenses, and immunity for delegates. Federal agencies can provide support as requested. Vice President presides over inaugural session for election of officers. Permanent officers oversee adoption of rules and subsequent sessions. The convention rules and procedures are overseen by permanent officers who preside over subsequent sessions. Proposed amendments require a two-thirds majority of delegates for approval and must address the issue for which the convention was summoned. Congress can reject amendments that do not meet this standard, and approved amendments are sent to the states for ratification unless Congress passes a concurrent resolution of disapproval. The proposed amendment in the Article V Convention must align with the issue for which the convention was called and follow prescribed procedures. Amendments would need ratification by state legislatures or ad hoc conventions as determined by Congress. State legislatures could rescind ratification at any time before reaching the three-fourths threshold. Challenges to congressional rejection of convention-approved amendments would be subject to judicial review. The convention process raises various ancillary issues. The Article V Convention process raises ancillary issues for Congress, including the role of the President. While the Constitution designates Congress as the exclusive agent in the process, the President, executive branch, and federal judiciary are not mentioned in Article V. Precedents like Hollingsworth v. Virginia suggest that the President's signature is not required for proposed amendments. Some argue that the President has no constitutional role in the amendment process. Some argue that the Constitution's presentment clause may require all constitutional amendments to be presented to the President, but the President's role in an Article V Convention remains unclear. Advocates have debated the importance of involving the President in the convention process, with constitutional scholar Charles Black emphasizing the significance of a convention call having the force of law. Supporters of a presidential role in the Article V Convention process argue that a mere call for a convention would be meaningless without specific terms outlined by Congress for its constitution, organization, and conduct. This includes prescribed forms, procedures, and funding, emphasizing the importance of the convention call having the force of law. Supporters argue that Congress should outline specific terms for an Article V Convention, including constitution, organization, and conduct, to give the convention call legal weight. The President's involvement is seen as crucial for the national interest, but opponents cite Article V as excluding the chief executive's role. The committee asserted that there is no proper place for a Presidential role in an Article V Convention. A concurrent resolution was deemed the appropriate device for proposing an amendment, excluding the need for presidential approval. The American Bar Association's 1974 study also questioned the President's involvement, stating that it would alter the intended purpose of the convention process. The purpose of the Convention process is to initiate amendments equally. The Senate Judiciary Committee's 1984 report emphasized congressional primacy in the proposal process, excluding a role for the President. The goal is to free states from federal government control in amending the Constitution. The Congress has the authority to issue legislation on the subject matter of the \"Constitutional Convention Implementation Act\" as stated in Article V. This authority is derived from the provision that allows Congress to \"call\" a convention for proposing amendments. The powers of Congress in this regard are authorized under the \"necessary and proper\" clause of Article I. The convention planning bills of the 1960s through 1990s were considered regular legislation that would require approval from the President if passed by Congress. The House Judiciary Committee's 1993 report argued that bills related to a constitutional convention are constitutionally distinct from the convention call, as they would appropriate federal funds and allocate resources. These bills would require submission to the President for approval. This implies a two-step process where Congress could pass a resolution summoning a convention without presidential approval, while additional arrangements would need presidential approval. Presidential involvement also extends to the ratification process. The framers incorporated checks and balances in the amendment process, allowing Congress to choose ratification by legislatures or conventions. James Madison introduced the language authorizing this choice at the Philadelphia Convention. At the Philadelphia Convention, James Madison introduced the option for Congress to choose ratification of amendments by state legislatures or conventions. The delegates favored ratification by ad hoc state conventions as more democratic. Observers have debated the merits of both methods over the years. The Philadelphia Convention introduced the option for Congress to choose ratification of amendments by state legislatures or conventions. Observers have debated the merits of both methods over the years, with one commentator highlighting the importance of the convention mode for expressing the people's will. Another scholar suggested that Congress should choose ratification by state legislatures to provide a check on the work of an Article V Convention. The framers intended that successful amendments to the Constitution, whether proposed by Congress or an Article V Convention, would reflect measured and deliberate changes. Amendments proposed by a convention must be ratified by a supermajority of three-fourths of the states, as set by the framers to prevent extreme ease or difficulty in altering the Constitution. The framers intended that successful amendments to the Constitution, whether proposed by Congress or an Article V Convention, would reflect the measured and deliberate opinion of the nation. Congress has set a deadline of seven years for ratification of proposed amendments since the 18th Amendment, but this standard is not found in the Constitution. The question arises whether Congress would have the authority to attach a ratification deadline to amendments proposed by a convention. Proponents argue that Congress has the power to set a deadline for ratification of amendments, citing historic precedent and Supreme Court sanction. They believe that Article V does not prohibit attaching a deadline, as it applies to both Congress and a convention. Critics point to the founders' intent of keeping the convention process separate from Congress, arguing that a deadline would hinder ratification. The proposed amendments to the Article V Convention could make the ratification process more stringent, which goes against the founders' original intent. There is debate over where to place a ratification deadline in the resolution proposing an amendment, with two alternatives being considered. Placing the deadline within the body of the amendment could be subject to criticism. The Article V Convention debate includes policy-related issues and potential conflicts of interest for Members of Congress serving as committee delegates. The Constitution may bar Members from serving in this capacity due to a presumed constitutional prohibition. Some commentators believe there may be a conflict of interest for Members of Congress serving as delegates in an Article V Convention, as they would be seen as both regulators and regulated. However, the American Bar Association's 1974 study found no constitutional prohibition for Senators and Representatives to serve in such a convention. One scholar suggests that congressional participation could be beneficial, as historical precedent shows that many delegates to the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of 1787 had also served in Congress. During the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of 1787, 41 out of 55 delegates had prior congressional experience, with 10 serving as incumbent Members of Congress. Proposed bills in Congress suggested apportioning delegates based on state population, with figures ranging from 435 to 538 delegates. Some argue that Congress lacks authority to determine delegate numbers, leaving it to the states' discretion. During an Article V Convention, the debate centers on how states would vote, with advocates claiming voting should be on a one-state, one-vote basis. This approach follows the precedent set in 1787, where each state sent delegates but only had one vote. During an Article V Convention, the debate revolves around how states would vote, with some arguing for a one-state, one-vote system based on the precedent set in 1787. Questions arise about voting within delegations and the need to reflect population differences in voting power. The American Bar Association criticized the idea of voting by states at a convention as unconstitutional and undemocratic. It is unclear if the District of Columbia or U.S. territories would be included in an Article V Convention. Some legislation has proposed including D.C. delegates but not U.S. territories. The ratification process is limited to states according to the Constitution. The Constitution limits the ratification process to states, but there is debate over whether the District of Columbia should participate in an Article V Convention. Advocates argue for D.C.'s inclusion based on its history and citizenship status, while others point out that Article V gives authority exclusively to Congress. The inclusion of the District of Columbia in an Article V Convention is debated, with some arguing for its participation based on history and citizenship status, while others point out that Article V gives authority exclusively to Congress and the states. The question of territorial representation at the convention is also raised, with arguments for U.S. territories to have a place at the table as observers or delegates. The Constitution is silent on the vote required in an Article V Convention to propose amendments. Convention planning legislation of the 1960s-1990s set varying standards for the vote, with some bills requiring a simple majority vote of convention delegates and others setting a two-thirds vote requirement. Supporters of a simple majority argue that the framers would have established a higher threshold if they wanted one. Some argue for a two-thirds convention vote to propose amendments, ensuring widespread support. This would mirror the requirement for amendments proposed by Congress. The question of congressional authority in this matter is also debated. The Article V Convention allows for proposing constitutional amendments with a simple majority vote, rejecting Congress's authority to set standards for the process. The convention can decide its own approving vote, potentially requiring a supermajority, but this decision must come from within the convention itself, not from Congress. This alternative was included by the framers as a balance to Congress proposing amendments, providing the people with a means to initiate amendments through their state legislatures. The Article V Convention was included to allow the people to call a convention to propose changes to the Constitution if Congress couldn't or wouldn't initiate amendments. This provision has never been implemented and would raise policy and procedural questions if Congress were to convene it. The report identifies key issues for Congress to consider, drawing on the founders' original intent and historical examples. Congress could consider historical examples, scholarly writings, and previous debates on the Article V Convention alternative when evaluating the possibility of convening it."
