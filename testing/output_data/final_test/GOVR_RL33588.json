    "content": "The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported the Energy and Water Appropriations bill for FY2007, including funding for the DOE Renewable Energy Program. The Senate recommends an increase in funding for R&D and deployment programs, with notable increases for Hydrogen, Biomass/Biorefineries, and Solar. Cuts are proposed for the Weatherization program and Facilities. Renewable energy programs in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill for FY2007 saw funding cuts in various areas such as the Weatherization program, Facilities, and Industrial programs. Renewable energy sources like sun, wind, and water can be converted into different forms of energy through various technologies. Renewable energy sources, including hydropower, biomass, waste combustion, wind turbines, and photovoltaics, are being developed for increased efficiency and market penetration. Geothermal energy, although sourced differently, is also considered a renewable resource. Commercial nuclear power is not classified as renewable. In 2004, renewable energy (excluding wood for heating) supplied 6.0% of national energy demand, with over half in the form of electricity, mainly from large hydropower. Renewable energy sources, including hydropower and biofuels, contribute to the national energy supply. Despite federal support for over 25 years, renewable energy has not achieved significant market penetration or growth in market share. Declining fossil fuel and electricity prices have hindered its progress, although the costs of renewable energy technologies have decreased. The costs of renewable energy technologies are still higher than conventional energy, but federal support has helped wind energy succeed. EIA projects a 1.8% annual increase in renewable energy production, reaching 6.7% of total demand by 2030. The UN report emphasizes the importance of developing low-energy paths based on renewable sources. Renewable energy systems are in early development stages but offer a potentially huge primary energy source available to every nation. A research program is needed to reach the energy levels currently obtained from fossil fuels. The UN emphasizes the importance of clean and renewable energy sources to mitigate pollution and climate change impacts. The Johannesburg Earth Summit in 2002 adopted a Political Declaration and Plan of Implementation, highlighting \"Clean Energy\" as a key policy action. The U.S. Department of State and the European Union subsequently implemented significant financial commitments towards clean energy initiatives. Despite these efforts, renewable energy is projected to account for less than 9% of global energy consumption by 2030. The oil embargo in 1973 led to a surge in energy prices, prompting the establishment of a federal energy program to address immediate and long-term energy needs, including research and collaboration with the private sector on renewable energy projects. The federal government implemented market incentives and created a utility market for nonutility-produced electric power through the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act. Despite Congress's support for renewable energy programs, federal spending fell steadily through 1990. Congress led policy development and funding until 1994, when a shift occurred with less funding approved than requested by the Administration. The 104th Congress approved significantly less funding than requested for FY1996 and FY1997. From FY1978 through FY2005, the DOE spent about $13.4 billion for renewable energy R&D, with funding growing from less than $1 million per year in the early 1970s to $380 million in 2005 constant dollars by FY2005. This spending history can be viewed within the context of DOE spending for nuclear, fossil, and energy efficiency R&D programs. In FY1978 through FY2005, the federal government allocated $140.0 billion for energy R&D, with $76.5 billion for nuclear, $35.2 billion for fossil, $13.4 billion for renewables, and $12.4 billion for energy efficiency. In FY2006, Congress merged appropriations accounts for DOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Programs. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill merged appropriations for subprograms of the Renewable Energy Program, including Hydrogen and Program Management, with the Energy Efficiency Program. The total for renewable energy subprograms was $242.5 million for FY2005 and $236.2 million for FY2006. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 created solar and wind energy credits, which expired in 1985. Business investment credits were extended for solar, geothermal, and ocean thermal energy technologies in the 1980s. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 extended business tax credits for solar and geothermal equipment indefinitely. It also introduced a production tax credit for wind, biomass, and poultry waste. Subsequent acts expanded the tax credits to include various renewable energy sources and extended them through 2007. Additionally, income tax credits were created for alcohol fuels, with extensions granted until 2007. The Energy Tax Act extended the credit for gasohol and created a federal excise tax exemption. The JOBS Act reformed the subsidy into a tax credit for ethanol blends. PURPA required electric utilities to purchase power from renewable facilities. Section 1253 of P.L. 109-58 terminated mandatory purchase requirements for new renewable power facilities. State and local governments have been instrumental in the development of renewable energy, with examples such as California's investment tax credit for wind energy in the 1980s. Various states, including Texas, have implemented renewable energy portfolio standards to promote renewable energy. Cities like San Francisco and Honolulu have also issued bonds to support solar and wind energy projects. The city of Honolulu approved a $7.85 million solar and energy efficiency bond. President Bush issued the Administration's budget request for FY2007, seeking $359.2 million for renewables, including funding for the Solar America and Biorefinery initiatives. The House Appropriations Committee report includes policy directives to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The report directs the Energy Laboratory to improve management of uncosted balances and report on steps taken to identify prior year balances. It also instructs EERE to report on implementing Inspector General's recommendations, fully fund a biomass R&D grant, strengthen recruiting from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and prepare a report on solar water heaters. Additionally, there is a directive for DOE to submit a reprogramming for funding the Asia Pacific Partnership. The Senate Appropriations Committee report for FY2007 includes policy directives for the Renewable Energy Program, such as completing biorefinery awards before funding new ones, focusing on cellulosic ethanol, and recommending ways to implement the cellulosic biomass production incentive. Additionally, there are directives for a report on solar water heaters and a focus on non-silicon materials. The Senate Appropriations Committee report for FY2007 includes directives for DOE to focus on non-silicon materials in the Renewable Energy Program. It also recommends funding increases for a solar-hydrogen pilot plant, a 1 MW solar thermal facility in New Mexico, and reports on wind resource locations and integration into the electric grid. Additionally, it urges DOE to form an interagency group to promote renewable energy use in federal agency operations. The Senate Appropriations Committee report for FY2007 includes directives for DOE to focus on non-silicon materials in the Renewable Energy Program. It recommends funding for a 2 MW permanent magnet motor wind turbine, advanced ocean energy techniques study, impacts of plug-in hybrids on electricity networks, and strategy for zero energy buildings development acceleration. The Senate Appropriations Committee report for FY2007 directs DOE to focus on non-silicon materials in the Renewable Energy Program, recommending funding for various renewable energy projects. This includes accelerating the development of zero energy buildings by five to seven years and supporting renewable energy programs in developing countries. The Bush Administration also sought funding for the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development. The Defense Appropriations Bill would fund a wind turbine demonstration project at a military base. Offshore wind farms have grown rapidly in Europe, especially in coastal areas of Germany, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. In the United States, proposals have been made for offshore areas near Texas and the mid-Atlantic and northeast states. A major issue erupted over the Cape Wind Associates proposal for a $1 billion offshore development that would install 450 megawatts of wind turbine capacity in federal waters near Cape Cod in Massachusetts. The Cape Wind project application was initially submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in November 2001 for a development with 130 wind turbines rated at 3.6 megawatts each. The project would be located six miles offshore, covering a 24 square-mile area. The regulatory responsibility was later shifted to the Minerals Management Service in August 2005. Supporters of the project claim it is a safe and clean way to generate renewable energy and create jobs, with backing from various groups including local towns, renewable energy organizations, labor unions, and environmental groups. The Cape Wind project has support from national environmental groups like NRDC and Union of Concerned Scientists. They believe the project will reduce air pollutants and create construction jobs. They also argue that the wind farm will have minimal impact on the environment and create new tourism opportunities. Opponents of the Cape Wind project, including the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, argue that the proposed development poses dangers to the area's ecosystem, maritime navigation, and the Cape Cod tourism-based economy. They highlight concerns about the impact on the viewshed, bird migration patterns, and fishing grounds in the region. The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound opposes the Cape Wind project due to concerns about its impact on the ecosystem, maritime navigation, and the local economy. They argue that fishing grounds, tourist spending, ferry lines, and radar systems could be negatively affected. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is leading the federal regulation of the project and is considering alternative proposals as part of the environmental impact statement. Section 414 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 directs the Commandant of the Coast Guard to specify terms for navigational safety for the Cape Wind energy facility in Nantucket Sound. Concerns exist about wind turbines creating false signals for military and civilian radar. Section 358 of the Defense Authorization Act for FY2006 requires the Department of Defense to report on the effects of wind farms on military readiness and technologies to mitigate adverse effects on radar installations. The Defense Authorization Act for FY2006 requires the Department of Defense to report on the effects of wind farms on military radar installations and technologies to mitigate adverse effects. An Interim Policy on Proposed Windmill Farm Locations was issued by the DOD and DHS, contesting windmill farms within radar line of sight until completion of the study and Congressional Report. The American Wind Energy Association notes many wind farm projects have received a Notice of Presumed Hazard from the FAA. The wind industry has received a Notice of Presumed Hazard from the FAA, leading to a halt in development in several states. Defense and FAA officials state that the letters do not ban wind farms but delay them for assessment. Concerns have been raised about delays impacting the renewable energy production tax credit. Senators and the Sierra Club have expressed worries over the interim policy of halting wind farms within radar line of sight. The British DTI has supported studies on wind farm impact on radar. The British Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has conducted studies on the impact of wind turbines on air traffic control radar. Studies found that wind turbines can affect radar performance by producing false targets and reducing aircraft detection. Recommendations include modifying turbine and radar design, using radar absorbent materials in turbine blades, and developing an advanced digital tracker in partnership with the British Wind Energy Association (BWEA). The British Department of Trade and Industry conducted studies on wind turbines affecting radar performance. Recommendations include modifying turbine and radar design, using radar absorbent materials, and developing an advanced digital tracker with BWEA funding. Flight trials were planned by the Ministry of Defence and National Air Traffic Services in 2005, with tests conducted in Wales near wind farms in 2006. 19 states and the District of Columbia have enacted Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) for renewable energy production. The discussion in the United States regarding Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce resulted in the rejection of an amendment to add an RPS to H.R. 6. Proponents argued for the benefits of an RPS, while opponents raised concerns about exclusion of existing hydropower facilities and resource limits. The House version of H.R. 6 did not include an RPS provision, while the Senate version had a 10% RPS provision. Ultimately, the RPS was dropped during the conference, and the enacted law extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for two years until the end of 2007. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended for two years until the end of 2007, providing a credit for electricity produced by various renewable energy facilities. Additionally, a renewable energy production \"incentive\" (REPI) was created for state and local governments and nonprofit electrical cooperatives, funded by appropriations to the Department of Energy. Eligible facilities include solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal energy. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expands REPI to include ocean and wave energy, defines \"renewable fuel\" to include ethanol, biodiesel, and natural gas from certain sources. Ethanol is the most produced renewable motor fuel. Production targets for renewable fuels were set to increase over the years. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded renewable energy production incentives, including ethanol and biodiesel. The Act set production targets for renewable fuels to increase annually, with a focus on cellulosic and waste-derived ethanol. Additionally, the Act introduced a program to produce hydrogen from various sources for developing hydrogen fuels and infrastructure. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded renewable energy production incentives, including ethanol and biodiesel, setting production targets for renewable fuels. The Act also introduced a program for hydrogen production for developing hydrogen fuels and infrastructure. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) played a key role in promoting electric power production from renewable energy facilities, with the renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) becoming a major incentive for wind energy development. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded incentives for renewable energy production, including ethanol and biodiesel, and introduced a program for hydrogen production. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) promoted electric power production from renewable energy facilities, with the renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) incentivizing wind energy development. In the 109th Congress, P.L. 109-58 included a conditional repeal of the mandatory renewables purchase requirement in PURPA Section 210. States and utilities have implemented measures like renewable energy portfolio standards (RPS) and green power marketing to support renewable energy. Several bills with RPS provisions have been introduced since the enactment of P.L. 109-58. Green power refers to electricity sourced from renewable energy. Green power marketing is available in several states including California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Green pricing allows customers to purchase renewable energy instead of conventional power. Distributed energy involves small electricity generators near customers to reduce transmission costs and provide reliable energy from sources like wind, solar, and bioenergy. Adding distributed electricity generation using various sources like wind, solar, bioenergy, fuel cells, and gas microturbines can help reduce grid vulnerability, according to DOE studies. Net metering allows customers to receive retail prices for excess electricity they generate, encouraging investment in renewable energy equipment. About 40 states have some form of net metering in place, supported by P.L. 109-58 (\u00a71251). The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a natural gas conference in January 2005, discussing the potential for renewable energy to reduce gas demand and prices. A 2005 DOE study suggested using renewables like biomass to produce methane as a substitute for natural gas. By 2020, biomass and energy crops could fulfill 15% of natural gas needs according to DOE projections. A Princeton University study suggests that biomass-generated \"black liquor\" and wood waste could support 25 billion watts of natural gas-fired power plant capacity by 2020. Renewables like solar and wind energy can displace natural gas use for power generation during peak demand periods. Wind farms were saving over 0.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2005. Federal policy changes could accelerate biomass-based power production through 2010. In the United States, ethanol is mainly produced from corn and used as a 10% blend with gasoline. High cost has been a barrier, but a tax credit has helped. There is a debate over the net energy benefit of using corn ethanol due to fertilizer use. Ethanol has lower emissions of some air pollutants than gasoline, but higher emissions of VOCs per mile. National ethanol production was 4.0 billion gallons in 2005. In 2005, national ethanol production was estimated at 4.0 billion gallons, equivalent to about 2.7 billion gallons of gasoline. Ethanol accounted for about 1.2% of transportation fuel use and 0.8% of total oil use. A renewable fuel standard aims to increase renewable fuel production to 7.5 billion gallons per year by 2012, primarily with ethanol. By 2030, ethanol production may reach 700,000 b/d, equivalent to about 470,000 b/d of oil use. Advanced bioethanol technology allows for the production of ethanol from various biomass sources, including cellulosic biomass like agricultural and forestry wastes, trees, and grasses. Cellulosic ethanol can be produced through different processes such as gassification, thermochemical, and microbial processes. Ethanol can also be made from dedicated fuel crops like fast-growing trees and switchgrass. The Farm Security Act of 2002 encourages the use of Conservation Reserve Program lands for developing biomass resources like switchgrass. Switchgrass, a native grass, grows well on marginal lands without needing fertilizer, making its net energy production higher than corn ethanol. However, cellulosic feedstocks, while cheaper and more plentiful than corn, require more processing, increasing ethanol conversion costs. Research by DOE and USDA aims to improve technology and reduce costs, including using enzymes and heat as catalysts. The United States and Canada have facilities for producing cellulosic ethanol, with Canada having the only commercial-scale plant. The Biorefinery Initiative aims to increase funding for cellulosic ethanol development to accelerate commercial use. DOE set a goal to displace 30% of national transportation fuel with biofuels by 2030. A partnership between EERE and the Office of Science is pursuing biotechnology for cellulosic ethanol production, with a research plan aiming to produce up to 60 billion gallons of biofuels per year. The plan focuses on breakthroughs in biotechnology to increase biomass production per acre and improve plant breeding. It aims to streamline biorefinery processes, shifting from chemical to biological steps to reduce waste and costs. Biodiesel, a renewable fuel made from vegetable oils, is noted for its safety, biodegradability, and reduced air pollutants. Biodiesel production has increased significantly in the U.S. from 1999 to 2005, reaching 75 million gallons in 2005. Blends of 20% biodiesel (B20) with 80% petroleum diesel can be used in unmodified diesel engines, but pure biodiesel (B100) may require engine modifications. Challenges include resource availability, retail distribution network establishment, and increased emissions of nitrous oxides. Biodiesel has a higher net energy production than corn ethanol and slightly higher than petroleum diesel. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created an excise tax credit for biodiesel fuel blending, set at $1.00 per gallon of biodiesel used. EPACT extended this credit through 2008 and created a renewable fuel standard allowing biodiesel production to contribute to the standard. Renewables are seen as a key long-term resource to substitute for fossil energy sources in vehicle fuels and electricity production. Renewable energy sources can substitute for fossil fuels in vehicle fuels and electricity production. The percentage of substitution depends on technology cost, market penetration, and energy efficiency measures. Various federal reports outline technologies and initiatives to advance renewable energy development and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The role of renewables in curbing global CO2 emissions is also highlighted. The federal government has accelerated programs since 1988 to study global climate change and mitigate CO2 emissions through renewable energy. Funding for renewable energy programs is provided by various agencies, focusing on reducing CO2 emissions through renewable energy technologies. Renewable energy equipment displaces fossil fuels, reducing CO2 emissions and pollutants. Biomass combustion releases CO2, but growth of biomass material offsets this. In a \"closed loop\" system, biomass combustion with rotating energy crops reduces CO2 emissions. Over 260 bills for renewable energy or energy efficiency were introduced in the 109th Congress. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL32860, Energy Efficiency and Renewable. The CRS Report RL32860 provides information on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Legislation in the 109th Congress. H.R. 5384 and H.R. 5427 are bills related to funding for renewable energy programs. The House and Senate have differing recommendations for funding amounts. The House and Senate have differing recommendations for funding amounts for renewable energy programs in the 109th Congress. H.R. 5427 (Hobson) Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2007, provides funding for DOE Renewable Energy Program. The Senate version of H.R. 5522 (McConnell) Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, 2007, includes support for renewable energy in developing countries. In developing countries, funding would be provided for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and cleaner energy technologies. $3 million would go towards the USAID partnership with DOE for the hydropower Clean Energy Technology Exports Initiative. Additionally, $160 million would be allocated for Energy, Biodiversity, and Other Environment programs in various regions. $26 million would be provided for the Asia Pacific Partnership to promote clean energy export and market development initiatives.

P.L. 109-148 includes funding for a wind power demonstration project on an Air Force base. P.L. 109-171 limits funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency programs. The USDA Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to carry out renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Section 1402 terminates funding for the USDA Value-Added Producer Program for grants to such projects. Several other public laws also provide appropriations for renewable energy programs. The DOE renewable energy programs are funded by P.L. 109-103 (H.R. 2419) and the Transportation Equity Act (P.L. 109-59, H.R. 3). Various sections within these laws provide support for alternative fuels, high-occupancy vehicle lanes, clean fuels, and fuel cells. The Clean Fuels Formula Grant Program includes provisions for biodiesel, alcohol fuels, and fuel cells. Additionally, there is support for clean fuel school buses. The United States-India Energy Cooperation was discussed in a hearing held by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on July 18, 2006. The conference report (H.Rept. 109-203) was issued on July 28 and the laws were signed on August 10.
