    "content": "The legal implications of whether an ICO involves securities are significant. Issuers must register with the SEC or qualify for an exemption. Compliance with detailed disclosures and high fees is seen as burdensome. Federal law also holds issuers liable for false statements and omissions in prospectuses. The Exchange Act imposes continuous disclosure obligations and anti-fraud liability on securities issuers and sellers. The SEC imposes disclosure and anti-fraud requirements on securities issuers and sellers, with the authority to investigate violations and impose penalties. These requirements aim to protect investors, ensure accurate pricing of securities, and facilitate capital allocation. Transactions involving securities must adhere to the Securities Act and Exchange Act regulations, with a broad definition of \"security\" covering various financial products. The Securities Act and Exchange Act regulations impose disclosure and anti-fraud requirements on securities issuers and sellers to protect investors. The term \"investment contract\" is not defined in the Act, but the Supreme Court outlined a four-part test in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. to determine if a transaction qualifies as an \"investment contract.\" This test includes an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profit derived solely from the efforts of others. The Supreme Court agreed with the SEC that the land sale and service contracts qualified as \"securities\" under the Securities Act based on the Howey test. The contracts involved investors putting money into citrus groves for profit based on the efforts of others, meeting the criteria of an \"investment contract.\" The Court emphasized the flexible nature of the Howey test to adapt to various investment schemes. The Howey test emphasizes the economic realities underlying a transaction, leading to complex judicial inquiries into various financial arrangements that may qualify as \"investment contracts.\" Courts have found a wide range of schemes, from pyramid schemes to interests in earthworm farms, to fall under this classification. The determination of whether an ICO involves securities hinges on its economic realities rather than its formal characteristics or the name given to the coins or tokens. The Howey test focuses on the economic realities of a transaction, not its formal characteristics or the name of coins or tokens. It is difficult to draw broad conclusions about its application to all ICOs due to their diversity. The first part of the test requires an \"investment of money,\" which is rarely litigated, and the Supreme Court's guidance on this is limited. The Howey test focuses on the economic realities of a transaction, not the name of coins or tokens. Investments of cash or virtual currency qualify as investments of \"money\" under Howey. In SEC v. Shavers, the court held that transferring Bitcoin for \"investment opportunities\" involved an investment of \"money.\" The primary consideration is whether something of value was given up in exchange for the promised consideration. The Howey test focuses on the economic realities of a transaction, not the name of coins or tokens. Investments of cash or virtual currency qualify as investments of \"money\" under Howey. In SEC v. Shavers, the court held that transferring Bitcoin for \"investment opportunities\" involved an investment of \"money.\" The Court addressed whether an individual's provision of labor or services can involve an investment of \"money,\" which is relevant to some ICOs. The Supreme Court has not squarely answered this question, but in a related case, it held that an employee's interest in a compulsory, noncontributory pension did not involve an \"investment of money\" under the Howey test. The Court concluded that the employee in Daniel exchanged his labor primarily to obtain a livelihood rather than to make an investment, therefore his interest in the pension plan was not considered a \"security\" as it did not involve an investment of money. The Court noted that a person's 'investment' could take the form of goods and services, not just cash, as long as the primary motivation behind the provision of labor was to obtain a salary and other benefits. The provision of labor in exchange for salary and benefits was not considered an \"investment of money\" under the Howey test. Lower courts have differed in their interpretations, with some ruling that labor does not qualify as an investment, while others have endorsed the idea that it does. The Tenth Circuit ruled that transactions where employees gave up legal rights to wages for profit-sharing plans can be considered \"investment contracts\" under Howey. ICOs involving token sales for cash or digital currencies likely qualify as \"investments of money\" under the Howey test. The district court in Shavers agreed that exchanging valuable virtual currency in ICOs qualifies as an \"investment of money.\" ICOs typically involve selling tokens for cash or digital currencies, but tokens can also be distributed as rewards for mining or other valuable services. For example, Filecoin sold tokens in an ICO but also offers them as rewards for storage services. In 2017, Filecoin distributed tokens as rewards for storage services, raising questions about whether this constitutes an \"investment of money\" under Howey. The answer is unclear, with courts suggesting that the provision of goods and services may satisfy this element of the Howey test. The Tenth Circuit held that the forfeiture of legal rights to wages could qualify as an \"investment of money\" based on an exchange of value standard. The Howey test is satisfied when a purchaser exchanges something of value for promised consideration. Providing services can fulfill this requirement, but the Ninth Circuit ruled that services do not count as an \"investment of money.\" Token distributions for services like mining or data storage may not meet the Howey test if services are not considered investments. Miners and service providers for token issuers typically do not receive cash in exchange for their services. Miners and service providers for token issuers do not receive cash salaries, which could be seen as similar to the SEC v. Addison case where non-salaried workers exchanged services for profits. If courts adopt a broad rule like Uselton's, where any \"exchange of value\" involves an \"investment of money,\" then token distributions for services like mining could satisfy the Howey test. However, Uselton involved a different scenario where employees gave up salary rights for profit-sharing, making it distinguishable from service offerings. The value of mining and services provided to a token issuer may be challenging to establish compared to salary rights. Difficulty in valuing services does not necessarily exclude them from being considered an \"investment of money\" under Howey. The Howey test is meant to be flexible and adaptable to various schemes, and the courts have not supported the idea that valuation challenges remove transactions from federal securities law. The securities laws should be interpreted flexibly to achieve their remedial purposes. Exchanging difficult-to-value assets for tokens may still qualify as an \"investment of money\" under the Howey test, despite valuation challenges. The \"investment of money\" requirement under the Howey test may still apply even with challenges in valuing contributions to a token issuer's enterprise. Quantifiable expenditures on mining or other services could help courts calculate the value of these contributions within reasonable boundaries. Based on the Howey test, the provision of services by a miner could be considered an \"investment of money\" in a common enterprise, as investors may have difficulty assessing the enterprise and lack control over its management, necessitating special protection. The \"buyer beware\" regime is inadequate for sales of fractional participation in collective projects where buyers cannot inspect or control the enterprise. Lower courts have different approaches to assessing the \"common enterprise\" element of the Howey test, including horizontal and vertical commonality. The relationship between an investor and the promoter of an enterprise is defined by the common enterprise concept. This concept can be viewed through broad or narrow vertical commonality approaches, where investor fortunes are tied to the promoter's efforts and profits. An example is given to illustrate the differences in commonality approaches. The investment funds are not pooled, and there is no sharing of profits as each purchaser owns a separate asset. Investors purchasing individual condominium units and sharing in the manager's profits lack horizontal commonality but involve vertical commonality. This vertical commonality includes both broad and narrow approaches, where investors' fortunes depend on the manager's efforts in renting and managing the units. Investors are entitled to a percentage of the rental proceeds generated by the manager's activities. The federal circuit courts have different positions on the \"common enterprise\" requirement in Howey's case. Some require horizontal commonality, while others find vertical commonality sufficient. The investors' fortunes depend on the manager's profits and activities, leading to varying interpretations among different circuits. The Second Circuit has ruled that horizontal commonality is sufficient for a \"common enterprise\" in ICOs, while broad vertical commonality is deemed insufficient. Token sales with fungible tokens, pooled funds for network development, and issuer-dependent fortunes demonstrate horizontal commonality. Broad vertical commonality occurs when token purchasers rely on issuer expertise or efforts. In ICOs, token purchasers' fortunes depend on the issuer's expertise or efforts, indicating broad vertical commonality. For example, ChronoBank issued tokens in exchange for Bitcoin to develop a platform, making tokenholders reliant on the issuer's development efforts. Narrow vertical commonality also exists when tokenholders receive dividends based on the issuer's profits. Most ICOs do not involve narrow vertical commonality, which is a requirement for tokens to be considered \"securities\" under the Howey test. The test focuses on whether a transaction offers a \"reasonable expectation of profit\" to investors, distinguishing between financial returns and the desire to use a product or service. This distinction was crucial in a court case where shares of stock for leasing apartments were not classified as securities. Shares for leasing apartments in a housing cooperative were not considered \"securities\" as purchasers did not expect profit. The shares allowed occupancy but could not be transferred, pledged, or sold above initial purchase price. The cooperative leased commercial spaces to reduce rental costs for tenants. Purchasers later brought federal securities law claims against the cooperative. The Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision in the Forman litigation regarding federal securities law claims brought by purchasers of shares in a housing cooperative. The Court ruled that income derived from the cooperative's leasing activities was too speculative and insubstantial to fall under securities laws, despite being a profit traditionally associated with security investments. The Court in Forman case concluded that purchasers of shares in a housing cooperative were attracted solely by the prospect of acquiring a place to live, not by an expectation of profit. The Court distinguished between transactions motivated by financial returns and those motivated by a desire to use or consume a product or service. In Rice v. Branigar Organization, the Eleventh Circuit held that the sale of lots in a housing development and equity memberships in a nearby country club did not involve an \"expectation of profit\" for the Howey test. The case involved a residential planned-unit development on a barrier island off the coast of Georgia, where purchasers sued the developer for unregistered sales of securities and failure to disclose information about club memberships. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed a lower court order granting summary judgment for the developer in Rice v. Branigar Organization. They concluded that the sale of lots and equity club memberships did not meet the Howey test's definition of \"securities\" due to the lack of an \"expectation of profit.\" Buyers were primarily motivated by the desire to use the lots, not for profit from the developers' efforts. Promotional materials focused on the island's beauty and club amenities, not investment value. Equity memberships in the country club were also deemed not to be \"securities\" by the court. The court concluded that equity memberships in the country club were not considered \"securities\" as purchasers bought them for club facilities access, not financial returns. The court rejected the argument that buyers were primarily motivated by profit, citing promotional materials aimed at providing club access. In contrast, the Fourth Circuit in Teague v. Bakker held that transactions involving consumptive and profit-related motivations could be seen as having an \"expectation of profit\" under the Howey test. Teague involved a non-profit organization selling \"lifetime partnerships\" for short annual stays at a hotel and vacation retreat. The Fourth Circuit in Teague v. Bakker reversed a district court's decision that \"lifetime partnerships\" sold by a non-profit organization did not qualify as \"securities\" under the Howey test. The court disagreed with the district court's reasoning that the purchasers did not have an \"expectation of profit\" because they primarily bought the partnerships for annual stays at a hotel and vacation retreat. The court emphasized that the \"expectation of profit\" element of the Howey test requires proof of financial returns, as per Forman. The Fourth Circuit in Teague v. Bakker reversed a district court's decision that \"lifetime partnerships\" sold by a non-profit organization qualified as \"securities\" under the Howey test. The court found that the promotional materials emphasized the possibility of profits through capital appreciation or participation in earnings, satisfying the \"expectation of profit\" element. The materials touted the partnerships as an investment opportunity that could increase in value, supporting the conclusion that the sale of the partnerships met the Howey test requirements. The Fourth Circuit in Teague v. Bakker reversed a district court's decision regarding \"lifetime partnerships\" sold by a non-profit organization, emphasizing the partnerships' investment value and the potential for economic benefits. The court found that the representations created an \"expectation of profit,\" leading to the reversal of the directed verdict for the defendants. The court highlighted that an ICO's \"expectation of profit\" depends on specific features, and if purchasers are primarily motivated by using the product or service, the ICO may not satisfy this element of the Howey test. In assessing whether tokens qualify as \"securities\" under the Howey test, promotional materials play a crucial role. Emphasizing the possibility of profits in promotional materials indicates an expectation of profit, while focusing on goods and services for token exchange supports the opposite conclusion. Commentators distinguish between \"investment\" or \"securities\" tokens and \"utility\" tokens in the context of ICOs. Tokens can be categorized as either investment/security tokens or utility tokens. Investment tokens are meant to serve as substitutes for traditional securities like corporate stock, offering capital appreciation or income. Utility tokens, on the other hand, provide intrinsic utility by allowing access to goods or services. Examples include Filecoin, Storj, and Siacoin for cloud storage, and Basic Attention Tokens for purchasing goods and services. Utility tokens, like Basic Attention Tokens, can be used to access goods or services such as cloud storage platforms and Internet advertising within the Brave web browser. The question of whether utility tokens involve the \"expectation of profit\" under the Howey test is complex, as they can appreciate in value and be subject to speculation. Some argue that utility tokens do not meet the \"expectation of profit\" requirement unless the desire for financial returns outweighs the desire to use the product or service. This interpretation has some support in case law. In recent case law, the interpretation of the \"expectation of profit\" element for tokens remains somewhat unclear. Simply labeling a token as a \"utility token\" does not prevent it from being classified as a \"security.\" The SEC determined that tokens labeled as \"utility tokens\" in an ICO's promotional materials still qualified as \"securities.\" This decision aligns with the Supreme Court's stance on the matter. The Supreme Court's case law emphasizes that the \"economic realities\" of a transaction determine if it involves \"securities.\" Profits must be derived from the efforts of others for a transaction to qualify as a sale of \"securities.\" While the term \"solely\" has been debated in court rulings, it is not always interpreted literally. Buyers need legal protection when they lack control over how their money is used. Courts have interpreted the \"efforts of others\" element of the Howey test with varying degrees of strictness. The D.C. Circuit and Ninth Circuit have used formulations like \"predominantly\" and \"undeniably significant\" to determine if profits depend on the efforts of others. The extent of investor participation and control in an enterprise is crucial in evaluating this element. For example, in Albanese v. Florida National Bank of Orlando, investors lacked control over ice machines they purchased, satisfying the \"efforts of others\" requirement. Albanese involved a scheme where investors bought ice machines and contracts for placement in hotels. Investors had some control over machine locations but discovered many machines didn't exist. They sued a bank for aiding fraud, but the court ruled contracts were not \"securities.\" The Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court's decision in Albanese, ruling that the contracts for ice machines were considered \"securities\" because investors were largely dependent on the seller's efforts for profits. Investors had some control over machine locations but ultimately relied on the seller's expertise for success. The Ninth Circuit ruled that a multi-level marketing scheme involving investor participation satisfied the \"efforts of others\" element of the Howey test. In SEC v. Glenn W. Turner Enterprises, Inc., the court considered whether a network where investors purchased \"Adventures\" or \"Plans\" constituted the sale of \"securities\" as investors received profits from bringing in new investors. The SEC obtained a preliminary injunction against the sale of these products for being unregistered securities. The Ninth Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction against the sale of \"Adventures\" and \"Plans\" in a multi-level marketing scheme, deeming them unregistered securities. The court determined that investors primarily relied on the efforts of the promoters for success, satisfying the \"efforts of others\" requirement under Howey's test. The D.C. Circuit also adopted a similar test. The D.C. Circuit adopted a similar test for applying the \"efforts of others\" requirement in SEC v. Life Partners, Inc. The SEC brought an enforcement action against a company that sold fractional interests in life insurance policies, claiming they were unregistered \"securities.\" The company performed pre-sale tasks such as evaluating medical conditions, reviewing insurance policies, negotiating purchase prices, and preparing legal documents for viatical settlements. The D.C. Circuit vacated injunctions against a company that sold viatical settlements, ruling that they did not qualify as \"securities\" because investors did not expect profits based on the \"efforts of others.\" The court applied a test similar to the one used in SEC v. Life Partners, Inc., where the \"efforts of others\" requirement is satisfied only if expected profits are derived predominantly from the efforts of others. The court distinguished between \"purely ministerial\" and \"entrepreneurial\" activities in the sale of viatical settlements. Post-sale functions were deemed \"ministerial\" and did not establish investor profit expectations from the \"efforts of others.\" Pre-sale activities were considered \"entrepreneurial\" but had limited relevance to the Howey test. The court distinguished between pre-sale and post-sale activities in the sale of viatical settlements, noting that pre-sale efforts may not significantly contribute to the \"efforts of others\" element of the Howey test. The Eleventh Circuit reached a different conclusion in SEC v. Mutual Benefits Corp, emphasizing the importance of this distinction. The Eleventh Circuit ruled that investors in viatical settlements depended on the \"efforts of others,\" qualifying the contracts as \"securities.\" They rejected the distinction between pre-sale and post-sale efforts, stating that both are relevant in the analysis. The Eleventh Circuit ruled that both pre- and post-purchase managerial activities should be considered in determining if Howey's test is satisfied for viatical settlements contracts. The level of control given to purchasers over the enterprise funded by tokens issued in ICOs determines if the tokens qualify as securities. Examining the rights and powers associated with the tokens is crucial in applying the Howey test to individual ICOs. In ICOs, the level of control given to tokenholders over the funded enterprise determines if tokens qualify as securities. Courts focus on investors' expectations of control at the time of investment, primarily looking at formal powers granted to tokenholders in white papers. Evidence of how businesses operate in practice is also considered. Courts consider evidence of how businesses operate in practice as relevant to determining control allocation at the outset of an investment. The timing of an issuer's efforts to support token value is also important in the \"efforts of others\" analysis. Performing entrepreneurial tasks before token sale may make tokens less likely to be classified as securities. The D.C. Circuit's distinction between pre-sale and post-sale efforts in determining the \"efforts of others\" requirement has been challenged by other federal circuit courts. The application of the Howey test to ICOs has led to the development of the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) framework, aimed at providing advantages related to securities, money services, and tax laws for ICOs involving \"pre-functional utility tokens.\" Utility tokens are purchased primarily for using or consuming goods or services. A \"pre-functional utility token\" lacks utility when sold but becomes useful later, potentially qualifying as a security under the Howey test. In contrast, a \"functional utility token\" is useful upon delivery to purchasers. The SAFT framework aims to provide advantages for ICOs involving pre-functional utility tokens. The SAFT framework allows companies to raise funds for developing a platform without offering pre-functional utility tokens, which may be considered securities. Investors exchange money for the right to receive functional utility tokens in the future, which is likely a security under the Howey test. Promoters are advised to enter into SAFTs with investors under SEC Regulation D. The SAFT framework proposes that promoters enter into agreements with investors under SEC Regulation D to raise capital for platform development. The developers argue that tokens issued through SAFTs may not be classified as securities due to the nature of token purchasers' motivations and the efforts made before token delivery. This approach aims to allow token trading in secondary markets while avoiding securities classification. The SAFT framework aims to avoid securities classification for tokens by allowing trading in secondary markets. Developers caution that utility tokens may still be considered securities if purchased for financial returns rather than for use. Additionally, promises of post-delivery activities enhancing token value may satisfy securities requirements despite the SAFT structure. The SAFT framework is a popular method for structuring ICOs, with over 60 companies raising $564 million in the first four months of 2018. However, it is cautioned that if a token issuer maintains control over the token's monetary policy or promises to support secondary trading, the ICO may be considered an offering of securities. The SEC has issued subpoenas to token issuers using the SAFT framework, but it is unclear if it effectively avoids securities regulation. The SAFT framework is commonly used for ICOs, but critics have raised concerns about its legal analysis. The Cardozo Blockchain Project highlighted issues with the framework, suggesting that it may not provide sufficient protection under federal securities laws. The SAFT framework used for ICOs may not offer adequate protection under federal securities laws. Critics argue that emphasizing profit potential in SAFT contracts could inadvertently turn tokens into investment contracts, potentially failing the Howey test. The premise that timing of a token creator's efforts affects the assessment of the \"efforts of others\" element lacks strong legal support. The report questions whether pre-purchase entrepreneurial activities are relevant to the \"efforts of others\" analysis in SAFT contracts. It argues that post-purchase activities by developers using SAFTs may not qualify as insignificant efforts, as developers regularly update their platforms after token sales. Additionally, it suggests that the concern about \"pre-functional utility tokens\" being securities due to dependence on others' efforts is misplaced, as purchasers are primarily motivated by using the platform, not financial returns. The report questions the classification of tokens as securities under Howey if they are not driven by financial gain and do not rely on the efforts of others for their value. It also raises concerns about the potential harm to consumers from using SAFTs, highlighting the ability for quick profit-taking and market manipulation by large token holders. The ongoing debate over the SAFT framework lacks regulatory guidance. The ongoing debate over the SAFT framework and lack of regulatory guidance make it unclear if tokens issued through SAFTs will be considered securities under federal law. The SEC has taken enforcement actions against token issuers and discussed their approach towards ICOs. Two notable SEC enforcement actions and a recent speech by the Director of the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance have sparked discussions on the agency's views on ICOs. In July 2017, the SEC investigated an unregistered sale of digital tokens by The DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization. The DAO was a decentralized autonomous organization that used smart contracts to allow collaboration outside traditional corporate structures. It issued DAO Tokens in exchange for Ether to fund projects and grant voting and ownership rights to token holders. The DAO issued DAO Tokens for projects and profits, with Curators overseeing project proposals and voting. Curators had significant control over project submissions and voting processes, including the ability to reduce quorum requirements. DAO Tokens were promoted for trading on various platforms. The DAO Tokens were traded on secondary markets via various platforms, with over 500,000 transactions executed by more than 15,000 customers. A hacker exploited a flaw in The DAO's code, stealing one-third of its assets. The SEC concluded that DAO Tokens were securities under the Howey test, as the exchange of Ether for DAO Tokens constituted an investment of money. The SEC determined that DAO Tokens were securities under the Howey test due to investors' expectation of profit from The DAO's for-profit projects. Investors purchased tokens with the expectation of earning profits from the efforts of others, meeting the \"investment of money\" and \"common enterprise\" criteria. The SEC concluded that investors expected profits from The DAO's projects primarily through the efforts of promoters and Curators, who were essential to the enterprise. Investors had limited voting rights and relied on the expertise of promoters and Curators to manage and propose profitable projects. Curators had authority to vet projects, determine voting procedures, and adjust quorum requirements. The SEC found that investors in The DAO had limited voting rights and lacked meaningful control over the enterprise due to the Curators' authority and lack of communication among tokenholders. The SEC determined that DAO Tokens met the Howey test and were considered securities that The DAO was required to register. In a separate case, the SEC took action against Munchee, Inc. for an iPhone app related to restaurant reviews. Munchee planned an ICO to raise $15 million for its restaurant review app. The funds would be used for hiring, marketing, legal expenses, and maintaining the MUN token ecosystem. Users could earn MUN tokens for writing reviews, restaurants could buy ads, and in-app goods/services could be purchased with MUN tokens. Munchee aimed to allow users to buy food with MUN tokens and for restaurants to reward customers with them. Munchee's white paper outlined plans to reward customers with MUN tokens and increase their value through ecosystem participation. It also detailed strategies to reduce token supply, ensure liquidity in secondary markets, and promote profit potential. Additionally, Munchee made investment claims in various media before the ICO. The SEC imposed a cease-and-desist order against Munchee in December 2017 after concluding that MUN tokens were considered securities under the Howey test. Munchee had to stop the token sale and refund purchasers' money after SEC staff contacted them. The SEC determined that purchases of MUN tokens for Bitcoin or Ether qualified as investments of money under Howey. The SEC imposed a cease-and-desist order against Munchee in December 2017 for selling MUN tokens without filing a registration statement, violating the Securities Act. Munchee represented that MUN token purchasers would profit from the efforts of others through the creation of an ecosystem that would increase token value. Despite not evaluating the \"common enterprise\" element of the Howey test, the SEC concluded that purchasers had an expectation of profit due to Munchee's representations. Munchee consented to the order and stopped selling tokens promptly, avoiding a civil penalty. In June 2018, the SEC's Director of Corporation Finance gave a speech on applying the Howey test to virtual currencies, providing interpretive assistance to companies. The speech, not a definitive statement, addressed whether a digital asset offered as a security can evolve into something else. Based on a speech by the SEC's Director of Corporation Finance in June 2018, a digital asset may not be considered a security if the centralized enterprise no longer supports its value and purchasers are primarily motivated to buy goods or services. In such cases, essential managerial efforts are no longer expected from a third party, leading to the conclusion that Bitcoin and Ether are not securities. Bitcoin and Ether were not considered securities as they did not rely on a central third party for their value. However, Hinman warned that digital assets could still be classified as securities based on various factors such as investors' governance rights and marketing strategies. The SEC's views on ICOs were influenced by The DAO report, the Munchee enforcement action, and Hinman's speech in June 2018. The SEC's views on ICOs were influenced by The DAO report, the Munchee enforcement action, and Hinman's speech in June 2018. The SEC believes that the exchange of virtual currency for newly issued tokens qualifies as an \"investment of money\" under the Howey test. The agency also emphasizes the importance of assessing the \"expectation of profit\" requirement and will not simply accept a promoter's characterization of a token as a \"utility token.\" The SEC's Munchee order raised questions about the \"expectation of profit\" requirement for tokens to be considered securities. Factors included lack of utility, potential for appreciation, promise to maintain token value, and establish secondary markets. Unclear which factors were necessary for the SEC's conclusion. Some argue the order focused on Munchee's emphasis on potential profits and inability to use tokens for a period. The SEC's Munchee order highlighted the importance of avoiding promoting the investment value of utility tokens and the ability to derive profits from them. Issuers should refrain from issuing tokens without meaningful functionality to comply with securities laws. The SEC also clarified that giving token buyers a rudimentary role in an enterprise is not enough to avoid being classified as a security. The SEC's Munchee order emphasized the need to avoid promoting utility tokens for investment value and profit. Issuers must ensure tokens have meaningful functionality to comply with securities laws. The SEC also stated that simply giving token buyers a basic role in an enterprise does not exempt an ICO from securities regulations. The SEC found that purchasers of DAO Tokens relied on the \"efforts of others\" due to factors like curators' authority, limited project information, and tokenholder dispersion. However, the weight given to each factor in the SEC's analysis is unclear. Hinman's June 2018 speech further discussed the dependence on the \"efforts of others\" in token offerings. Hinman's June 2018 speech sparked commentary by suggesting tokens like Bitcoin and Ether may not be securities. Ether was created in 2014 through a token pre-sale by the Ethereum Foundation. Some, like Gary Gensler, argue Ether is not a security. Gary Gensler and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission suggest that Ether may be considered a security due to its centralized issuance. However, the Ethereum Foundation and other commentators argue against this, stating that Ether's value now relies on independent developers and users, not just the Foundation. Hinman's speech seemed to support this view, indicating that Ether may no longer be classified as a security. In his speech, Hinman suggested that Ether is not a \"security\" because its network is \"decentralized,\" meaning purchasers do not rely on the efforts of others for profits. This view was well-received by investors and virtual currency advocates concerned about applying securities laws to virtual currencies. Hinman's stance may impact the viability of the SAFT framework. After Hinman's speech, developers argued that his emphasis on a network's \"decentralization\" aligns with the concept of \"functional\" utility tokens in the SAFT white paper. Hinman's endorsement that a product initially classified as a \"security\" may evolve into a non-security is seen as positive for the SAFT. However, Hinman clarified that his speech did not opine on the legality of a SAFT, as the Howey test depends on individual offerings. Hinman's views are relevant for assessing the SAFT's viability, but legal implications remain uncertain. While Hinman's views are relevant in assessing the SAFT's viability, firm legal conclusions about the framework remain premature. Uncertainties with applying the Howey test to ICOs and limited SEC guidance have led to discussions on potential exemptions from registration requirements for token issuers. Issuers relying on exemptions must prove eligibility, but anti-fraud provisions still apply. Registration exemptions may provide valuable benefits to token issuers. Registration exemptions offer valuable benefits to token issuers by allowing them to avoid detailed disclosures required in registration statements. Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act provides an exemption for transactions \"not involving any public offering,\" with the term \"public offering\" not clearly defined. The Supreme Court has interpreted this exemption for sales to specific individuals. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Section 4(a)(2) exemption for sales of securities to individuals who can \"fend for themselves\" in evaluating an offering. In SEC v. Ralston Purina, the Court ruled that offering stock to \"key employees\" did not qualify for the exemption because not all employees had access to the necessary information. Lower courts have used various factors to apply the \"fend for themselves\" standard. Securities sold under Section 4(a)(2) exemption are restricted and cannot be resold without meeting certain conditions. This exemption may not be suitable for most token issuers due to limitations on the number of offerees and resale restrictions. ICOs typically involve offering tokens to a large number of investors with varying levels of sophistication. Regulation D offers more specific exemptions from SEC registration requirements, including Rule 504 for offerings up to $5 million. Unlike Section 4(a)(2), Rule 504 is not limited to sophisticated investors but still results in restricted securities. Rule 504 offerings result in restricted securities with resale restrictions, while Rule 506 offerings exempt from registration have conditions such as no general solicitation, limited to accredited investors, and no limit on fundraising amount. Token issuers have relied on Regulation D for offerings, including using the SAFT framework to offer SAFT contracts to accredited investors. Several SAFT issuers, such as Telegram and Filecoin, have raised significant funds through Regulation D offerings. However, concerns have been raised about limitations on participation by non-accredited investors in Rule 506 offerings. Regulation D's limitations on non-accredited investor participation restrict the pool of ICO investors. Resale restrictions under Regulation D may hinder token purchasers seeking immediate liquidity. Concerns also arise about the SAFT framework's effectiveness in avoiding token classification as securities. If SAFTs fail to prevent token classification as securities, tokens issued under Regulation D could be considered restricted securities, contrary to issuer and purchaser intentions. Regulation A offers exemptions from Securities Act registration requirements for token issuers, with Tier 1 allowing up to $20 million raised from accredited and non-accredited investors, and Tier 2 allowing up to $50 million with limitations on non-accredited investor contributions. Issuers under Regulation A must file an offering statement and disclose necessary information, differing from Regulation D exemptions. Regulation A offers exemptions from Securities Act registration requirements for token issuers, with Tier 1 allowing up to $20 million raised from accredited and non-accredited investors, and Tier 2 allowing up to $50 million with limitations on non-accredited investor contributions. Securities offered under Regulation A are not subject to resale restrictions, making it potentially more attractive for ICOs than Regulation D. Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) provides an exemption for offerings up to $1.07 million, with limits on individual investor amounts and requirements for offerings through a registered funding portal. Reg CF allows offerings up to $1.07 million through a registered funding portal, with disclosure obligations and resale restrictions similar to Regulation D. Some suggest using Reg CF for ICOs, but limitations and resale restrictions make it less favorable. Commentators propose various improvements to ICO regulation, criticizing the SEC's \"regulation through enforcement\" approach. Some commentators criticize the SEC's approach of \"regulation through enforcement\" regarding ICOs, suggesting it lacks general guidance and legal certainty. They argue that this may drive token sales overseas, harming innovation in the U.S. Suggestions include issuing interpretive guidance or providing clear guideposts to token sale participants in administrative orders. Congress could also mandate the SEC to issue guidance if necessary. Some commentators suggest that Congress could require the SEC to issue guidance on token issuers, similar to Regulation A exemptions. This token-specific exemption would involve disclosing relevant computer code and evaluations by technical experts to ensure network viability. Some observers propose Congress or the SEC create a \"safe harbor\" for token exchanges, granting immunity under certain conditions like performing cybersecurity due diligence, obtaining legal opinions, and de-listing tokens if they are deemed securities. This could prevent utility tokens from moving to overseas exchanges due to U.S. exchange refusals. Several commentators have urged Congress to consider changes to the regulatory structure surrounding ICOs. Currently, various federal agencies are responsible for regulating virtual currencies, with the SEC overseeing virtual currencies classified as \"securities\" and the CFTC having jurisdiction over virtual currencies like Bitcoin classified as \"commodities.\" However, there is no federal agency with general jurisdiction over virtual currency \"spot\" markets. FinCEN, a bureau within the Treasury Department, also plays a role in regulating virtual currencies under the Bank Secrecy Act. Some commentators suggest creating a new federal agency or designating an existing regulator with primary jurisdiction over virtual currencies, as opposed to the current multi-agency approach led by FinCEN. No legislation has been introduced in the 115th Congress regarding this proposal."
