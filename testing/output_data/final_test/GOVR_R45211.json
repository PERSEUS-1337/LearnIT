    "content": "Congress is deciding on prioritizing lock construction projects on the inland waterway system. There are 20 authorized projects and one preconstruction study. The decision on which projects to undertake first is a controversial issue as funding has been focused on the Olmsted Lock and Dam project, causing delays in other projects. With the completion of the Olmsted project expected in FY2019, funds may become available for other lock projects. The federal advisory board is considering which of the 21 lock projects on the inland waterway system should move forward. The system consists of 11,000 miles of navigation channels with 186 lock sites and 225 lock chambers designed for barge transportation of heavy raw materials. Barge operators pay a $0.29/gallon federal fuel tax to fund new construction and major rehabilitation projects. The federal advisory board is considering 21 lock projects on the inland waterway system, funded partly by the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers oversees lock construction and requires periodic reevaluation of costs and benefits. The Office of Management and Budget will only request funding if the economic benefit is at least 2.5 times the cost. The projects are clustered in three regions facing different economic conditions affecting barge traffic. In three regions, economic conditions are impacting barge traffic: record corn and soybean harvests are increasing cargo volumes on the Upper Mississippi River, coal plant closures are reducing coal transportation demand in the Ohio and Tennessee River Valleys, and the petrochemical industry's investments are affecting tank barge traffic in Texas and Louisiana. Preliminary work has been completed on some projects, including building a cofferdam for a new lock construction site. Construction of new locks on dry ground is facilitated by preparatory work, with investments ranging from $200 million to $400 million. The physical condition of locks and the potential for major failures impacting river commerce are key considerations. Congressional authorization and funding play a crucial role in initiating lock projects, with additional capacity being a common motivation. After Congressional authorization and funding, construction of lock projects can begin. Standard size barges are 195 feet long, 35 feet wide, and can hold up to 1,570 tons of cargo. On busy rivers, 15 barges are tied together in a tow pushed by a towboat. The largest locks can accommodate these 15-barge tows, but smaller locks require the tow to be split into two sections. A 15-barge tow is split into two sections to pass through a lock, taking about two hours. On less busy tributaries, smaller locks only allow one barge at a time. Tows carrying grain or coal are typically 15 barges, while those carrying other dry goods are smaller. Tank barge tows carrying liquid cargo consist of one to three barges. Liquid cargo tows on the Mississippi River can consist of up to 50 barges, with \"Jumbo\" barges measuring 290 feet x 50 feet. These tows travel at 3 to 5 mph, with two crews rotating six-hour shifts for multiday voyages. Delays can occur due to droughts, floods, or winter closures for ice around locks. A voyage between Pittsburgh and St. Louis takes about 18 days, while Peoria, IL, to New Orleans takes about 16 days. The Army Corps of Engineers performs major lock repairs on inland waterways without disrupting traffic, despite challenging weather conditions. Barge shippers primarily transport low-value commodities in large quantities, facing competition from railroads and pipelines for certain routes. Most shippers are committed to river transport due to facility locations and the difficulty of switching to other modes of transportation. The Corps maintains a minimum depth of 9 feet throughout the waterway system using dams to create pools. The Army Corps of Engineers operates locks on inland waterways 24/7, with reliability being a persistent issue due to scheduled and unscheduled repair work. Age is often cited as a reason for constructing new locks, but many have undergone major rehabilitation. Barge operators and agricultural shippers are affected by lock closures and may need to use smaller auxiliary locks. Barge operators and agricultural shippers in the upper Midwest are pushing for the expansion of locks on the Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway to accommodate larger vessels. This project, known as the Navigation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program (NESP), is crucial for shipping corn, soybeans, wheat, and fertilizer to the New Orleans region for export. Currently, the locks are too small for 15-barge tows, leading to the need for splitting them into two sections. The locks on the Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway need to be expanded to accommodate 15-barge tows for shipping grain. Congress authorized expansions in 2007, but funding for construction is still needed. Tonnage passing through the locks has declined, with a significant drop in 2012 due to a drought. The expansion of corn-based ethanol production slowed after 2010, limiting further growth in demand for barge transport. However, there has been a recent increase in barge transport of corn and soybeans since 2013, coinciding with exceptionally large harvests. The slight increase in chemical tonnage, including fertilizer, also aligns with the record harvest years. Lock and Mississippi Lock 25 saw record harvests in 2017, resulting in strong volumes of agricultural products passing through these locks. The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects a slight increase in U.S. corn and soybean exports through 2027, potentially impacting traffic volumes on the Mississippi River. However, possible tariffs on U.S. soybeans by China could adversely affect future traffic volumes. The opening of new locks in the Panama Canal in 2016 allows larger ships to carry grain and soybeans between New Orleans and Asia, potentially reducing transport costs. Freight rates for dry bulk ships are volatile, which could make the rail option to the West Coast more attractive. Agricultural products account for the bulk of tonnage passing through locks on the Illinois Waterway, with a diverse commodity mix. LaGrange lock sees about a third more tonnage than Peoria, mainly in corn and soybeans. The Army Corps developed an appointment system to manage barge traffic at locks on the Illinois Waterway, but barge operators argue against its practicality. Locks handle an average of 10 tows per day, with Lock 27 on the Mississippi River handling about 23 tows per day. Debate continues on the necessity of a scheduling system for locks with lower traffic volumes. Debate continues over the necessity of lock extensions for more efficient barge traffic on the Ohio River System, dominated by coal shipments. Unlike the Mississippi/Illinois Waterway, coal on the Ohio River is moved short distances through locks with two parallel chambers. The Ohio River has lock sites with varying chamber sizes, with some smaller locks used for repairs. Congress authorized replacement of three locks in 2016 to improve efficiency. The availability of natural gas has reduced demand for barge movement of coal through the Emsworth, Dashields, and Montgomery locks. Half of the riverfront coal-fired electric plants that used these locks have closed since 2012, with more closures expected. Limestone, the second largest commodity carried through the locks, is also dependent on the electric plants. Other commodities like frac sand, pipes, and wastewater have not significantly increased in volume. The decline in coal traffic could lead to more empty backhaul movements of barges on the waterway. The ratio of empty barges to loaded barges on the Ohio River has increased, reducing efficiency. Despite a decline in traffic levels, a study projected tonnage to more than double by 2020 and increase further by 2040. This implies less time is needed for tows to pass through locks, impacting the time savings from lock enlargement. The projected increase in tonnage through the locks on the Ohio River is expected to more than double by 2040, with a peak year forecasted to be one-fifth higher than in 1996. This projection is based on a 2013 U.S. Energy Information Administration forecast of increased coal production in the Northern Appalachia region, although only a small percentage of coal from this region actually moves by river. Recent revisions to the forecast now predict a decline in coal production over the coming decades. The Army Corps is planning to release an economic update for this project in May 2020. The decline of coal shipping on the Ohio River system is evident through recent transactions, such as American Electric Power selling its barge line in 2015 and Jeffboat Inc. shutting down in 2018. The US Army Corps of Engineers is rebuilding structures at Lock and Dam 2, 3, and 4 on the Monongahela River, with $1 billion in funding allocated. Lock 3 will be eliminated by raising the pool depth, and new wider lock chambers will be built at Lock 4 to accommodate two barges wide tows. Completion of the projects at Locks 3 and 4 on the Monongahela River will depend on further funding. Coal shipping on the river has declined, with the volume passing through the locks decreasing by half since the late 1990s. Three out of four coal-fired power plants along the river have closed between 2013 and 2017. The remaining power plant at Lock 4 uses about 2.8 million tons of coal per year. Preliminary data for 2017 shows a slight decrease in tonnage passing through Lock 4 compared to 2016, with 7.9 million tons transported. The Tennessee River has two new locks at Lock 4, with dimensions of 720 feet in length and 84 feet in width, allowing for more capacity than needed based on current cargo volume. The Kentucky Lock and Chickamauga Lock are slated for improvements, with no funding requested by the Trump or Obama administrations. The last lock on the Tennessee River is the Kentucky Lock, where a new parallel lock 1,200 feet in length is planned. The Kentucky Lock is a busy lock attracting barge tows from the Cumberland River. It handles a diversified traffic of coal and crude materials, with coal-fired electric plants nearby. Despite some closures, the lock has maintained steady tonnage, partly due to sand and gravel shipments. The Chickamauga Lock, located 450 miles upriver from the Kentucky Lock at Chattanooga, is small in size at 360 feet in length and 60 feet in width. It has a long-standing issue with its concrete, prompting plans to build a parallel 600-foot lock. Despite being suitable for recreational boats, the lock's tonnage has decreased over the years, with only about 900,000 tons passing through in 2016. The drop in cargo volume is mainly attributed to the loss of food and farm product shipments. The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) is the third-busiest inland waterway in terms of tonnage after the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. It allows flatwater barges to engage in coastal transport from Brownsville, TX, to the panhandle of Florida. The traffic is dominated by tows of tank barges carrying liquid petroleum or chemical products. The GIWW requires about 15 locks or gates to control river and tide currents. The Inner Harbor Navigation Canal (IHNC) Lock on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) connects the Mississippi River, Lake Pontchartrain, and the Industrial Canal. It was previously linked to the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO) which was closed in 2007 due to controversy over flooding during Hurricane Katrina. Plans are in place to build a larger replacement lock in a densely populated area. The Army Corps plans to build a larger replacement lock on the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal to widen it for two barges to pass through, costing $1.4 billion. Congress authorized the lock expansion in 1956 and reauthorized it in WRDA 1986 and 1996. The Corps held public meetings in 2017 for the project, which is opposed by the surrounding residential community. The current lock causes significant delays and downtime for repairs, with tows waiting 12 to 24 hours on average to pass through. The Calcasieu Lock in southwestern Louisiana on the GIWW experiences significant closures for repairs, with an average of 12 to 24 hours for tows to pass through. In 2016, the lock was closed for 185 days for repairs, affecting tonnage passing through. Shippers of petroleum and chemical products are the largest users of the lock, which serves to prevent saltwater intrusion and for flood control. The Army Corps plans to build a bypass canal with a gate at the Calcasieu Lock on the GIWW to separate water control from barge navigation. The project, authorized in WRDA 2016, aims to improve the lock's efficiency in handling around 40 million tons per year. Additionally, six lock or gate structures on the Texas portion of the GIWW are set for improvement to prevent sediment deposits and swift currents, enhancing navigation safety. The Corps plans to widen three structures on the GIWW to allow two barges to pass through, eliminating three gates. Barge operators highlighted navigation issues at the Brazos River Floodgates. Congress authorized studies for the project, but construction has not been approved. Tonnage through the structures has fluctuated, possibly due to the oil boom and a shift to pipeline transport. The demand for domestic barge transport of oil along the waterway has decreased since 2015, possibly due to the lifting of the crude oil export ban. Despite an increase in chemical production in the Gulf Coast region, there has not been a corresponding rise in barge movement of chemicals through the locks. Preliminary 2017 tonnage data show a continued decline in volumes. S. 2800 (\u00a73101) calls for a report on the progress and obstacles to implementing lock expansions on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway. The bill calls for expedited review of deepening Baptiste Collette Bayou and GAO study on benefit-cost analysis procedures. Recent funding includes projects like Kentucky Lock and Dam and Lower Mon locks. FY2018 bill allocations are anticipated. The FY2019 appropriations bills for the Army Corps Civil Works program include funding for waterways projects such as the NESP project and the Brazos and Colorado River Floodgates/Locks project. The bills aim to utilize barge fuel taxes for inland waterway construction projects."
