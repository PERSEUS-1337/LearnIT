    "content": "On February 2, 2019, the United States and Russia both suspended their participation in the INF Treaty. Despite meeting in Geneva on January 15, 2019, to try to reach an agreement, the two countries failed to find a resolution. Russia proposed displaying the 9M729 missile to prove it couldn't reach INF range, while the US wanted Russia to destroy the missile, launchers, and infrastructure. Russia displayed the canister for the 9M729 cruise missile on January 23, 2019, stating that the added length was necessary for a larger warhead and guidance system. US and NATO officials did not attend, questioning the display's effectiveness in addressing concerns about the missile's range. NATO has shared US concerns about the missile, with some members now less doubtful about its violation of the INF Treaty. The allies have offered strong support for the U.S. decision to withdraw from the INF Treaty, stating that Russia is in material breach of its obligations. NATO is committed to arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation. In July 2014, the State Department released a report stating that the Russian Federation violated the INF Treaty by possessing a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km. The United States raised concerns with Russia multiple times in 2013 and continues to seek resolution on the issue. The 2015-2018 State Department reports reiterated that Russia violated the INF Treaty by developing a prohibited ground-launched cruise missile. The Obama Administration raised concerns with Russia to resolve the issue. The 2016-2018 State Department reports confirmed Russia's violation of the INF Treaty by developing a prohibited ground-launched cruise missile. The reports detailed the information shared with Russia to support the claim of noncompliance, with the 2018 report specifically stating Russia's continued violation of the treaty. The report indicated that the United States provided Russia with information on the missile and launcher, including the system's designator, test history, and range capability. U.S. officials have offered details on Russian noncompliance with the INF Treaty, stating that Russia has deployed several battalions of the 9M729 missile. In late November 2018, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats detailed Russia's noncompliance with the INF Treaty, revealing that Russia covertly developed the 9M729 missile in the mid-2000s and completed a comprehensive flight test program by 2015. Russia conducted the tests in a way to disguise the true nature of the missile's capabilities. Russia developed an INF-range missile that could be launched from a ground-mobile platform. The United States identified Russian activities raising INF compliance concerns as early as 2008. In October 2016, the Administration concluded that Russia might be preparing to deploy the missile. Deployment occurred in December 2016, with one brigade remaining at the test site and another moving to a different base within Russia. Russia denied developing a cruise missile violating the INF Treaty, but acknowledged the 9M729 missile's existence. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov called U.S. claims \"fabrications\" and stated Russia had detailed discussions with the U.S. about the missile's capabilities. Russia denied developing a cruise missile violating the INF Treaty but acknowledged the existence of the 9M729 missile. The missile, described as an upgraded version of the Iskander-M system, was launched within the permitted range at the Kapustin Yar testing ground. Russian President Putin expressed disagreement with the treaty's destruction and warned of a corresponding reaction if the US developed INF-range missiles. General Gerasimov stated that Russia would respond if the treaty was destroyed, potentially targeting US missile sites on allied territory. The Obama Administration expressed concern over Russia's violation of the INF Treaty, stating the need to bring Russia back into compliance. Secretary of Defense Mattis highlighted the increased risk to allies and U.S. interests due to Russia's actions. The U.S. reviewed economic and military options to incentivize Russia's compliance and counter any threats. Secretary Mattis emphasized the threat posed by Russia's violation of the INF Treaty to U.S. forces and interests, stating that it could erode arms control agreements. He warned that if Russia continues to act as an adversary, the U.S. will respond with allies. Mattis stressed the importance of Russia returning to compliance with the treaty for its own benefit. The Trump Administration announced plans to develop a new U.S. ground-launched cruise missile of INF range if Russia does not return to compliance with the INF Treaty. The Administration conducted a review of the treaty and outlined an \"integrated strategy\" to address Russia's non-compliance and prepare for potential treaty collapse. The United States will seek a diplomatic resolution while also preparing to defend itself and its allies. The Trump Administration announced plans to develop a new U.S. ground-launched cruise missile of INF range if Russia does not return to compliance with the INF Treaty. The Administration outlined an \"integrated strategy\" to address Russia's non-compliance, including diplomatic efforts and military preparations. Economic measures will also be taken against entities involved in Russia's prohibited cruise missile system. These actions will cease if Russia returns to compliance with the treaty. The Trump Administration is urging Russia to return to compliance with the INF Treaty, emphasizing the importance of arms control agreements for transparency and predictability in the relationship. Thomas Shannon stated that the U.S. is making efforts to preserve the treaty but finds it unacceptable for Russia to violate while the U.S. complies. Russia is urged to eliminate the prohibited missile system to ensure compliance. The United States called for a meeting of the Special Verification Commission in Geneva to discuss the INF Treaty. Russia denied testing the 9M729 missile to INF range, but the U.S. noted Russia's attempts to obfuscate the program. In October 2018, the Trump Administration announced the United States would withdraw from the INF Treaty due to Russia's violation and China's nonparticipation. The decision was conveyed to Moscow by John Bolton, and Secretary of State Pompeo declared Russia in breach of the treaty on December 4, 2018. The United States announced its intent to withdraw from the INF Treaty due to Russia's violation, with a 60-day period for Russia to return to compliance before the official withdrawal process begins. Talks between U.S. and Russian officials in Geneva failed to reach an agreement, with the U.S. rejecting Russia's proposal to display the 9M729 missile and insisting on its destruction as the only acceptable solution. The United States demanded Russia to destroy the missile, launchers, and supporting infrastructure to comply with the INF Treaty. If Russia does not agree, the U.S. will suspend participation and withdraw on February 2, 2019. Thompson stated that verifying the missile's range was not possible through inspection. Congress sought additional information on the violation of the INF Treaty and called on the Obama Administration to address U.S. compliance concerns with Russia. Representatives urged for economic sanctions and military responses to hold Russia accountable for its actions. Members also expressed concerns about Russia's compliance with the INF Treaty in legislation. The FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act expressed concerns about Russia's violations of the INF Treaty, stating it poses a threat to the United States and its allies. The final legislation recognized the seriousness of Russian violations and emphasized the importance of the INF Treaty for national security interests. The FY2016 NDAA addressed concerns about Russia's noncompliance with the INF Treaty, requiring the President to report to Congress on the impact of Russian violations on national security. It also mandated briefings on efforts to address compliance issues and called for a plan to counter Russia's cruise missile program. In response to Russia's cruise missile program, the United States proposed legislation to develop defenses and counterforce capabilities. This included allocating $500 million for active defenses and the development of a new U.S. land-based cruise missile system. The House bill mandates the development of a new U.S. land-based cruise missile system with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. It also requires a report on modifying existing missile systems for ground launch within this range. If Russia is found to possess a ground-launched cruise missile of INF range, the INF Treaty's ban on intermediate-range missiles will no longer be binding on the United States. The Senate bill does not mention \"program of record\" in response to Russia's INF violation but calls for a research program for a dual-capable road-mobile ground-launched missile system with a range of 5,500 kilometers. The House language in the 2018 NDAA requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a program to develop a conventional road-mobile ground-launched cruise missile system with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers and allocates $58 million for active defenses against INF-range ground-launched missiles. The Senate bill focuses on countering INF-range ground-launched missile systems and enhancing US capabilities, without requiring a report to Congress. It directs the Director of National Intelligence to notify Congress of any Russian developments inconsistent with the INF Treaty and outlines possible sanctions for non-compliance. This differs from the House version, which includes a requirement for the President to submit a report to Congress and states that non-compliance would make the treaty no longer binding on the US. Congress addressed the INF Treaty in the National Defense Authorization act for FY2019, requiring the President to determine if Russia is in breach of the treaty. It stated that Russia's testing of an INF-range cruise missile constituted a material breach, allowing the US to suspend the treaty. The FY2019 NDAA included language allowing the President to determine if Russia breached the INF Treaty. Congress also proposed legislation to encourage Russia to comply and to counter their noncompliant missile systems. Some Senators introduced a bill to constrain or delay U.S. withdrawal from the treaty. Senators introduced a bill to prohibit funding for new INF-range missiles until the Trump Administration submits a report on various aspects, including finding a U.S. ally to host such a system. The report also discusses the current status of the INF Treaty and issues Congress may address in dealing with Russia's compliance concerns. The report discusses the provisions of the INF Treaty, Russia's potential violation, and concerns with U.S. compliance. It also explores options for addressing Russia's activities and potential deployment of new INF-range missiles. During the Cold War, nuclear weapons played a key role in deterring Soviet aggression. During the Cold War, the United States deployed a variety of weapons including mines, artillery, missiles, and bombs with troops and on various platforms. The U.S. developed detailed plans for using these weapons in a conflict with the Soviet Union and its allies. Strategic weapons were kept in the U.S., while shorter-range nuclear weapons were deployed overseas to deter aggression and defend allies in Europe and Asia. During the Cold War, the United States deployed various weapons to deter aggression and defend allies in Europe and Asia. These weapons, including mines, artillery, missiles, and bombs, were part of NATO's strategy of \"flexible response\" to counter the Soviet Union's numerical superiority in conventional forces. The presence of U.S. forces and these weapons served as a reminder of the U.S. commitment to defend its allies and control escalation in case of a conflict. During the Cold War, the United States and NATO deployed various weapons to deter aggression and defend allies in Europe and Asia. This included the use of nuclear weapons to control escalation and prevent Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces from overrunning NATO's defenses. The nuclear posture aimed to complicate Soviet efforts and had three main objectives. During the Cold War, the United States and NATO pursued a divide and conquer strategy towards NATO with three main objectives: providing military capabilities to disrupt Soviet attacks, deterring Soviet aggression through nuclear escalation, and assuring U.S. allies in Europe of defense under Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty. During the Cold War, the United States focused on bolstering the credibility of its extended deterrent by adjusting the numbers and types of nuclear weapons deployed in Europe. This was done to assure allies of its commitment to their defense and deter adversaries from attacking. During the Cold War, the United States adjusted the deployment of nuclear weapons in Europe to bolster the credibility of its extended deterrent and assure allies of its commitment to their defense. This included deploying intermediate-range missiles in Europe between 1983 and 1991, designed to disrupt a conventional attack by Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces. The placement of these weapons near potential conflict zones in West Germany aimed to convince the Soviet Union of their potential use. During the Cold War, the deployment of intermediate-range missiles in Europe aimed to convince the Soviet Union of their potential use in deterring a conventional attack by Warsaw Pact forces. Concerns arose over whether NATO would actually employ these weapons early in conflict, leading to questions about the alliance's credibility and the vulnerability of some NATO allies to Soviet coercion. Analysts debated the potential for the Soviet Union to exploit divisions within NATO by threatening select members. During the Cold War, concerns arose over NATO's credibility and the vulnerability of some allies to Soviet coercion. Analysts debated the need for longer-range missile systems to provide a more credible deterrent. Some allies questioned whether the US would defend them against Soviet attacks, fearing potential consequences for the US. During the Cold War, concerns arose over NATO's credibility and the vulnerability of some allies to Soviet coercion. Analysts debated the need for longer-range missile systems to provide a more credible deterrent. The question of whether the United States would actually \"trade New York for Bonn\" grew as the Soviet Union deployed SS-20 intermediate-range ballistic missiles. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union deployed SS-20 intermediate-range ballistic missiles with a range of 4,000 kilometers, posing a threat to NATO nations. In response, NATO adopted a \"dual-track\" decision in December 1979 to modernize U.S. nuclear forces. The United States and NATO partners adopted a \"dual-track\" decision to modernize U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe and spur the Soviets to negotiate reductions in INF systems. They agreed to deploy 108 Pershing II ballistic missiles and 464 ground-launched cruise missiles with single nuclear warheads between 1983 and 1986 on the territories of five European allies. The deployment decision of cruise missiles was linked to NATO's agreement for the United States to negotiate limits with the Soviet Union on intermediate-range nuclear systems. Allies recognized the need to eliminate the Soviet Union's ability to target Europe with SS-20 missiles, but also understood the importance of negotiating to appeal to public opinion in Europe. NATO adopted the dual-track decision unanimously. The NATO dual-track decision was unanimously adopted, with all alliance members supporting both deployment and negotiation plans. However, the five host nations had to approve the deployments, with West Germany requiring unanimous NATO decision and another European nation accepting new nuclear systems. The planned deployments led to massive public protests in Europe and the United States starting in 1980, escalating through the early 1980s with protests in various countries and a large march in Central Park, New York. In June 1982, nearly 1 million people marched in Central Park in New York City. In October 1983, protests took place across the United States and Europe, with nearly 3 million people protesting. A Welsh group called \"Women for Life on Earth\" established a peace camp at Greenham Common in the UK to protest the deployment of 96 cruise missiles. The governments in some nations faced political opposition to the missile deployments. The government sought to link the deployment of cruise missiles to progress in U.S.-Soviet negotiations on nuclear weapons. In 1984, a compromise was approved by Dutch parliament to delay deployment until 1988, contingent on an increase in Soviet SS-20 missiles. Belgium also faced opposition but supported the deployments. Despite debates and opposition, all five nations agreed to deploy the new missiles. In late 1983, the five nations agreed to deploy new missiles, leading to the Soviet Union suspending arms control negotiations until March 1995. The United States and Soviet Union began negotiations in 1980 without presenting specific proposals for limits on intermediate-range missiles. The United States sought equal limits on both sides' missiles, while the Soviet Union proposed freezing the numbers of medium-range systems in Europe. In November 1981, President Reagan announced the \"zero-option\" plan, seeking the total elimination of Soviet SS-20, SS-4, and SS-5 missiles in exchange for canceling NATO's deployment plans. The Soviet Union proposed a phased reduction of all medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe. In March 1982, the Soviet Union offered to freeze its deployments of SS-20 missiles unilaterally, maintaining the moratorium until an agreement was reached or the US deployed Pershing IIs and GLCMs. Negotiations stalled in 1982 and 1983, but gained traction in 1986 after the Reykjavik summit where Gorbachev proposed eliminating all missiles. At the Reykjavik summit in October 1986, Soviet President Gorbachev proposed removing all intermediate-range missiles from Europe within five years of signing a treaty. He also suggested reducing Soviet SS-20s in Asia to 33 missiles with 99 warheads. In April 1987, Gorbachev indicated readiness to eliminate shorter-range missiles in Europe and Asia as part of an INF agreement. In June, he proposed a global ban on shorter and longer-range INF systems, leading to the signing of the Treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) on December 8, 1987. The treaty entered into force on June 1, 1988, requiring both nations to eliminate their INF systems within three years. The treaty banned the deployment of intermediate-range land-based ballistic missiles and cruise missiles indefinitely, marking a new approach to arms control. The INF Treaty, signed in 1987, required the Soviet Union to destroy more missiles than the United States, with asymmetrical reductions. It was the first U.S.-Soviet treaty to include intrusive monitoring mechanisms, allowing on-site inspections of missile facilities and storage centers. The INF Treaty allowed for inspections at designated sites, data exchange, and continuous monitoring to verify compliance with missile production limits. Inspections continued for 10 years after eliminations were complete, ending in May 2001. The treaty also established the Special Verification Commission (SVC) to promote treaty objectives. The United States and Soviet Union agreed to meet in the SVC to resolve compliance issues and improve the INF Treaty. They agreed to destroy intermediate-range and shorter-range ground-launched missiles and associated launchers. The treaty prohibited the production or flight-testing of new ground-launched intermediate-range missiles. The INF Treaty banned the production of intermediate-range missiles and launchers for the US and Soviet Union. It listed specific missiles like the SS-20 for the Soviet Union and Pershing II for the US. The treaty counted all types of missiles and launchers as INF, even if modified for different ranges or missions. The INF Treaty classified all missiles and launchers as intermediate-range, even if modified for different purposes or missions. It specified that any missile or launcher tested or deployed for weapon delivery would be considered treaty-limited, regardless of its intended use. The INF Treaty classified all missiles and launchers as intermediate-range, even if modified for different purposes. It banned land-based intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles but allowed testing of sea-based or air-delivered weapons at land-based test ranges. Testing from operational ground-based launchers would violate the treaty. The INF Treaty prohibited ground-based launchers from launching intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles, but allowed testing of sea-based or air-delivered weapons at land-based test ranges. Rockets not designed as weapons-delivery vehicles were not banned by the treaty, even if they could fly within the restricted range. Missile defense interceptors were also not prohibited by the treaty if developed solely for intercepting objects not on the earth's surface. Article VII of the INF Treaty outlines how the range of ground-launched cruise missiles is measured to determine compliance with treaty limits. The range is defined as the maximum distance the missile can cover in its standard design mode until fuel exhaustion, taking into account factors like altitude and flight path. Flight tests are crucial to determine the actual range of these missiles. The range of a missile can vary based on altitude and flight path, making it necessary to conduct flight tests to determine its actual range. Article VII of the INF Treaty defines the range as the maximum distance a missile can cover until fuel exhaustion. If a new missile's maximum range falls between 1,000 and 5,500 kilometers, it is considered intermediate-range; if it exceeds 5,500 kilometers, it is classified differently. The INF Treaty does not address ballistic missile flight tests within the 1,000 to 5,500 kilometer range if the missile has demonstrated a maximum range exceeding 5,500 kilometers in another test. Members of the Senate debated this issue during the ratification of the treaty in 1988. Members of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees raised concerns about potential Soviet circumvention of the INF Treaty by testing missiles with ranges exceeding 5,500 kilometers. The Reagan Administration acknowledged these possibilities, stating that such missiles would not be covered by the treaty. Ambassador Maynard Glitman clarified that a missile tested to a range greater than 5,500 kilometers would be considered a strategic ground-launched ballistic missile, regardless of subsequent tests within INF ranges. The State Department clarified that a missile tested at strategic range with a different configuration could be considered a new type covered by the INF Treaty. It was suggested that if the Soviet Union tested a missile with a single warhead for longer range, then tested it with multiple warheads at a reduced range, it could be classified as an intermediate-range missile. The letter did not confirm Soviet agreement with this interpretation. The INF Treaty was questioned regarding the possibility of the Soviet Union using longer-range strategic missiles to target Europe after eliminating their INF systems. Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci acknowledged this concern, stating that both the Soviets and the United States could retarget their strategic systems on Europe without violating the treaty. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger also highlighted that Soviet ICBMs, SLBMs, and airplanes could still carry out missions in Europe. The United States accused Russia of violating the INF Treaty in 2014, prompting President Obama to suggest a meeting with President Putin to discuss compliance. The issue was first raised in May 2013, with subsequent meetings leading to a meeting in September 2014 after the release of the Compliance Report. The State Department reported a \"useful exchange of views\" with Russia after the release of the Compliance Report, but Russia failed to address U.S. concerns. The Obama Administration accused Russia of noncompliance in the 2015 report, citing a prohibited cruise missile developed by Russia. The Administration accuses Russia of violating the INF Treaty by testing a ground-launched cruise missile. Details about the missile are withheld, but the US claims to have provided enough information for Russia to identify it. The United States has provided Russia with information on a violating GLCM with a range capability between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. Russia is accused of moving towards deployment of the new missile, as it has begun producing it in numbers greater than needed for a test program. In February 2017, reports revealed Russia's deployment of a new ground-launched cruise missile, violating the 1987 INF Treaty. General Paul Selva confirmed this during testimony, stating Russia posed a threat to NATO facilities and showed no intention to comply with the treaty. The 2014, 2015, and 2016 Compliance Reports reiterated Russia's violation of possessing such missiles. The State Department repeated findings of Russia's violation of the INF Treaty in the 2015 and 2016 Compliance Reports. The missile tests at the Kapustin Yar test site in western Russia began in 2008, with the Obama Administration concluding it as a violation in late 2011. The Administration briefed U.S. allies in NATO about its concerns in January 2014. The Obama Administration delayed informing Congress and U.S. allies about Russia's potential violation of the INF Treaty until 2014. Some speculate it was to avoid undermining arms control agenda with Russia, while others suggest it was to gather more information before raising concerns. The United States took years to gather information on Russia's new missile system, leading to a delay in making a determination with high confidence. Under Secretary of State Rose Goetemoeller highlighted the gradual accumulation of information on Russia's ground-launched cruise missile, emphasizing the need for thorough analysis before assuming a treaty violation. The United States took years to gather information on Russia's new missile system, leading to a delay in making a determination with high confidence. Under Secretary of State Rose Goetemoeller highlighted the gradual accumulation of information on Russia's ground-launched cruise missile. Director of National Intelligence, Daniel Coats, confirmed Russia conducted tests with a missile to a range of greater than 500 kilometers from a static launcher and a shorter range from a mobile launcher. Experts outside government focused on the Iskander system as a potential INF violation. The R-500 cruise missile, launched from an Iskander launcher, has been tested to a range of 360 kilometers but could potentially reach a longer range. The Obama Administration clarified that the R-500 missile was not the one in question, as the State Department Compliance Report showed that the noncompliant missile is different. Speculation suggests Russia may have violated the INF Treaty by testing an intermediate-range sea-launched cruise missile from a land-based launcher. The INF Treaty allows land-based tests of SLCMs from specific launchers. Concerns were raised about Russia possibly violating the treaty by testing a cruise missile with a range over 500 kilometers from a ground-based launcher. Reports from Russia also mentioned a 2,600-kilometer test of a cruise missile in 2013. Russia tested a naval cruise missile from a ground-based platform in 2013 to save money and simplify data collection. In 2015, they used sea-launched cruise missiles in Syria, exceeding INF Treaty range limits. Analysts suggest a potential treaty violation if the missile is launched from a mobile land-based launcher. The United States collected data across several tests, with no evidence of Russian officials offering explanations in meetings. U.S. officials referred to a ground-launched cruise missile test as a violation, casting doubt on misidentification of sea-launched missile tests. Rose Goetmeoller stated in 2015 that the missile test was not a technical violation. Press reports in 2015 identified another possible suspect missile tested by Russia. Russia conducted a test of its new GLCM on September 2, identified as the SSC-X-8 cruise missile. The missile had an assessed range of 300 to 3,400 miles, exceeding INF Treaty limits. The SSC-X-8, now designated SSC-8, was deployed by Russia in December 2016. The Trump Administration identified it as a breach of the treaty in late November 2017. The Trump Administration identified the Russian missile as the 9M729, suspected to violate the INF Treaty. Some believe it could be a ground-based version of the Kalibr sea-launched cruise missile. There are debates on whether Russia's RS-26 missile also breaches the treaty due to its tested ranges. The Obama Administration did not mention this missile in the 2014 Compliance Report. The Obama Administration did not mention the RS-26 missile in the 2014 Compliance Report, indicating a lack of conclusion on its INF violation status. Russia conducted four flight tests of the RS-26 missile, with varying success, raising concerns about its compliance with the INF Treaty. The RS-26 missile was tested four times, with varying success, using solid-propellant missiles launched from a mobile launcher. The first three tests carried a single warhead, while the last test had a new combat payload, possibly with multiple warheads. Russian officials claimed the RS-26 is an ICBM, part of a new fifth-generation ICBM development program. General-Colonel Zarudnitskiy stated that the tests were for a new intercontinental-range ballistic missile with improved accuracy. The RS-26 missile, tested with solid-propellant missiles from a mobile launcher, has raised concerns about potential treaty violations. Russian officials claim it is an ICBM with improved accuracy, but its intermediate-range tests suggest a possible circumvention of INF Treaty limits. The missile's payload and rationale for shorter-range tests may determine if it violates the treaty. The RS-26 missile, tested with solid-propellant missiles from a mobile launcher, has raised concerns about potential treaty violations. Analysts speculate that Russia tested the missile to evade ballistic missile defenses, with Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin calling it a \"killer of air defense.\" The missile uses new fuel to reduce engine operation time, making it more capable of overpowering defense systems. Sary-Shagan, Russia's test site for ballistic missile defense radars, was used to determine if the new missile could evade detection. The RS-26 missile, tested with solid-propellant missiles from a mobile launcher, has raised concerns about potential treaty violations. Analysts speculate that Russia tested the missile to evade ballistic missile defenses. Sary-Shagan, Russia's test site for ballistic missile defense radars, was used to determine if the new missile could evade detection. The missile could fly to a shorter range by using different warhead configurations or trajectories. The RS-26 missile may have flown with different warhead configurations in tests. Russian press reports suggested it could carry multiple warheads. The missile's range of 5,800 kilometers is shorter than other Russian missiles like the Topol-M and Yars. This suggests the RS-26 may have had a different payload during shorter-range tests. The data from flight tests shows a potential change in the missile's payload, which could lead to a violation of the INF Treaty. Despite this, the United States has not officially declared the missile as violating the treaty. Analysts believe Russia has been seeking to replace lost capabilities to maintain a full range of missile capabilities. Russia has been pursuing long-range cruise missiles that ignore treaty limits, citing threats from neighboring countries with intermediate-range missiles. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates mentioned Russia's desire to withdraw from the treaty to counter Iran, Pakistan, and China. Deputy Minister of Defense Anatoly Antonov expressed similar concerns in 2014. Anatoly Antonov, Russia's Deputy Minister of Defense, highlighted the presence of intermediate-range missiles in around 30 countries, many of which are near Russia. In 2007, Russia proposed a multilateral treaty to address this issue, supported by the US, but it did not gain traction. Recent reports suggest Russia may deploy the RS-26 missile in Irkutsk, potentially out of range of Europe. Russia plans to deploy the RS-26 missile at Irkutsk, potentially targeting China and other nations to the south and east. This move is seen as a response to threats outside of Europe, with Russian officials citing NATO as a source of concern. President Putin previously threatened to withdraw from the INF Treaty due to U.S. and NATO plans for missile defense assets in Europe. The United States plans to deploy missile defense interceptors in Poland and Romania as part of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). Russia views these interceptors as a threat and has threatened to deploy intermediate-range missiles to target the sites. The Aegis Ashore site in Romania is operational, but Russia argues it could threaten their strategic forces and violate the INF Treaty. Russia may have used the Aegis Ashore site as an excuse to deploy treaty-noncompliant cruise missiles in response to NATO's advanced capabilities and enlargement towards its western border. Russian defense documents highlight the need to deter NATO's precision weapons, including the U.S. Navy's Tomahawk missiles. Russia's existing conventional and nuclear capabilities, like the Iskander missiles, pose a threat to U.S. allies in NATO. Russia may believe that land-based intermediate-range cruise missiles could fill a gap in its conventional capabilities. These missiles could reach eastern NATO allies, including Germany and most other NATO states. This would allow Russia to target cities in Poland, Romania, and other NATO countries for national security assurance. Russia may use intermediate-range ballistic missiles to threaten NATO capitals at a greater distance, potentially undermining the alliance's cohesion. The elimination of Soviet SS-20 missiles reduced the nuclear threat to these cities, but a new threat to more distant allies could raise questions about NATO's commitment. This could lead allies closer to Russia to be more susceptible to coercion or intimidation. Russia's new intermediate-range missiles could create a dynamic similar to the Cold War, potentially leading NATO allies closer to Russia to be more susceptible to coercion or intimidation. Russian officials claim that U.S. military programs violate the INF Treaty, including the use of intermediate-range missiles as targets during missile defense tests and drones. They have become more insistent on addressing these issues following the State Department's 2014 Compliance Report. The United States uses missiles as targets in missile defense tests, drones as weapons delivery vehicles, and plans to deploy missile defense interceptors on land. DOD reviews U.S. weapons programs to ensure compliance with arms control agreements. Despite providing explanations to Russia, they continue to claim U.S. violations of the INF Treaty. The United States produced target missiles using modified engines from retired Minuteman II missiles for missile defense tests. Russia claims these missiles violate the INF Treaty as they have similar characteristics to intermediate-range missiles. The U.S. disputed this claim, stating the Hera missile was for research, not weapons delivery. Brian McKeon testified before House subcommittees, stating that the INF Treaty allows the use of older booster stages for research and development, including as targets for missile defense tests. The treaty prohibits land-based intermediate-range missiles flight-tested or deployed for weapons delivery. Target missiles used for defense tests have never been equipped with warheads or used for weapons delivery. The treaty also permits the reuse of guidance systems from eliminated missiles in non-restricted systems. The United States uses drones for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. The United States uses drones for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, with some equipped to carry precision-guided weapons for ground attacks. Russia claims that U.S. armed drones violate the INF Treaty as they are similar to ground-launched cruise missiles, but drones may not fully meet the treaty's definition of unmanned and self-propelled vehicles. The INF Treaty does not restrict two-way, reusable armed UAVs, as they are different from ground-launched cruise missiles. Drones are piloted remotely and carry weapons, but are self-contained and return to base after releasing their payload. Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Brian McKeon clarified that drones are not missiles but reusable systems. The United States plans to deploy ballistic missile interceptors on land in Romania and Poland as part of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) for missile defense. The site in Romania became operational in May 2016, while the site in Poland is scheduled for 2018. The deployment will include SM-3 interceptor missiles in the MK-41 vertical launch system, which Russia claims will violate the INF Treaty. The deployment of ballistic missile interceptors in Romania and Poland as part of the EPAA for missile defense includes SM-3 interceptor missiles in the MK-41 vertical launch system, which Russia claims will violate the INF Treaty due to the potential to launch intermediate-range cruise missiles. The INF Treaty specifies that a launcher must launch an intermediate-range GLCM, not any intermediate-range cruise missile, to be banned by the treaty. U.S. officials claim the MK-41 system in Romania and Poland will not be the same as the shipboard version used for Tomahawk missiles. Russia's complaint stems from the possibility of launching intermediate-range cruise missiles from the MK-41 system. The Aegis Ashore system in Romania and Poland will not be the same as the shipboard version used for Tomahawk missiles. It is only capable of launching defensive interceptor missiles and lacks the necessary components to launch offensive ballistic or cruise missiles. This distinction undermines Russia's concerns about the system being able to launch intermediate-range cruise missiles. The Aegis Ashore system in Romania and Poland differs from the shipboard version used for Tomahawk missiles. It can only launch defensive interceptor missiles, not offensive ballistic or cruise missiles. This distinction undermines Russia's concerns about the system launching intermediate-range cruise missiles. The INF Treaty does not require systems with different purposes to possess observable differences, but the United States may need to address Russia's concerns to avoid treaty violations. Russia has the right to withdraw from the INF Treaty if it believes its supreme interests are jeopardized by emerging threats from intermediate-range missiles. Despite US allegations of Russia developing new capabilities, it has remained in the treaty, possibly to delay a US response before withdrawing later. The US is considering options to address compliance concerns and security issues. The United States has decided to withdraw from the INF Treaty due to Russia's violation and to pursue the development of new intermediate-range missiles. Russia dismissed U.S. concerns about INF compliance, stating the case was closed. The United States raised concerns about Russia's violation of the INF Treaty, but Russia dismissed them, considering the case closed. U.S. officials found Russia's response unsatisfactory and plan to continue pressing the issue in future meetings. President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized the importance of dialogue with Moscow to preserve the treaty and address compliance issues. The United States raised concerns about Russia's violation of the INF Treaty during a meeting on September 11, 2014. Despite Russia denying the allegations and accusing the U.S. of violating the treaty, the State Department continued to address the issue in subsequent meetings. Russia refused to acknowledge any violations, leading to ongoing tensions between the two nations. Under Secretary of State Rose Gotemoeller acknowledged the difficulty in addressing Russia's violation of the INF Treaty, stating that diplomatic engagement had some value. Russia has not deployed the new missile due to the exposure of its program, but the Trump Administration continued to pursue a diplomatic solution. The Trump Administration initially pursued a diplomatic solution to the INF problem, highlighting the importance of discussions with Russia. Despite Russia's denial of violating the INF Treaty, ongoing diplomatic exchanges aimed to address U.S. concerns and facilitate future discussions focused on compliance. Public discussions on compliance concerns could strengthen the U.S. position and complicate Russia's dismissal of the issue. Russia's discussions on its missile programs did not acknowledge violating the INF Treaty but disputed U.S. claims. Despite this, there is potential for further dialogue before the U.S. formally withdraws. The United States aims to involve its allies in discussions with Russia to address violations of the INF Treaty. NATO allies have been briefed and encouraged to raise concerns directly with Russia. The State Department's 2018 Compliance Report highlights these efforts. The State Department's 2018 Compliance Report notes NATO's public statement affirming U.S. compliance with the INF Treaty and urging Russia to address concerns. NATO allies, including Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, remain concerned about Russia's lack of respect for international commitments, highlighting the importance of the INF Treaty for NATO security. Russia has acknowledged the existence of a new missile system, 9M729, but has not provided credible answers. Allies agree that Russia is likely violating the INF Treaty. NATO Foreign Ministers accepted the U.S. claim of Russian noncompliance, stating that Russia has developed and fielded the 9M729 missile system in violation of the treaty. Allies support US finding of Russian breach of INF Treaty, call for Russia to return to compliance. German Foreign Minister reaffirms treaty's importance for security. Germany supports the US finding of a Russian breach of the INF Treaty and calls for the missile violating the treaty to be destroyed in a verifiable manner. NATO allies' united response signals concerns about Russia's activities, but this could backfire if Russia claims it as evidence of NATO's threat. The Special Verification Commission (SVC) established by Article XIII of the INF Treaty has not met since 2000. The Special Verification Commission (SVC) established by Article XIII of the INF Treaty had not met since 2000. In October 2016, the United States summoned Moscow to a mandatory meeting to address accusations of treaty violations. The meeting took place in Geneva, Switzerland on November 15-16, 2016, with delegations from the United States, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine discussing compliance with treaty obligations. No details about the discussions or future meetings were provided in the State Department's statement. The United States called a second meeting of the SVC in late 2017 in Geneva to address compliance concerns, specifically regarding the noncompliant GLCM identified as the 9M729 by the United States. Russia denied testing the missile to INF range, despite evidence suggesting otherwise. The United States disputed Russia's claim of not testing the missile to INF range and noted Russia's attempt to obscure the program's nature. Analysts suggested that meeting in the SVC could facilitate a return to the compliance process established by the treaty, easing political posturing and clearing unrelated issues from the agenda. Russia was obligated to attend the meetings once the United States called for them. The United States called for meetings with Russia to discuss missile testing under the INF Treaty. The meetings were an opportunity to share data and potentially resolve violations. If successful, they could have discussed steps to address concerns and reach agreements on past tests. The United States and Russia could negotiate new definitions or procedures to reduce future ambiguities regarding past INF Treaty violations. Resolving violations may take years, as seen in the 1983 ABM Treaty radar dispute with the Soviet Union. The United States identified a radar in the Soviet Union as a violation of the ABM Treaty in 1984. Despite Soviet denials, the radar was acknowledged as a violation in 1989, and dismantled in 1990. Analysts suggest studying the deployment of new missiles in response. The United States is considering deploying new intermediate-range ballistic or cruise missiles to address emerging military needs. This approach would strengthen negotiations with Russia and provide military options if negotiations fail. The Pentagon has already conducted military assessments on the threat posed by new Russian missiles and is reviewing various response options, including new defenses against cruise missiles and the development of new U.S. intermediate-range missiles. The Pentagon conducted assessments on the threat posed by new Russian missiles and is considering deploying new U.S. intermediate-range missiles to counter them. The Administration has not released the classified report on this matter to Congress or the public. Under Secretary McKeon updated Congress on the Pentagon's pursuit of options to respond to Russia's INF violation, emphasizing the need to prevent Russia from gaining a military advantage. The Pentagon is developing a comprehensive response to Russia's aggressive behavior, including investing in new military capabilities to counter Russian cruise missile advancements. Congress has shown support for developing ground-launched cruise missiles in response to Russia's violation of the INF Treaty. The Pentagon is developing a response to Russia's aggressive behavior by investing in new military capabilities, including ground-launched cruise missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. Congress supports this initiative and has called for potential deployment sites on US overseas military bases or sites offered by allies. The FY2015 and FY2016 National Defense Authorization Acts also require reports on steps to address Russia's INF Treaty violation. The FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act expanded on the provision for developing counterforce capabilities against Russian INF systems, including ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles. The FY2018 NDAA further funded research and mandated the development of a new U.S. ground-launched cruise missile. The Pentagon has already begun research on this new missile. The Pentagon has started researching a new ground-launched cruise missile, informing Russia about the program and stating they would abandon it if Russia complies with the INF Treaty. Studies may suggest using sea-based or air-delivered weapons for security challenges, but if needed, the US could develop land-based INF-range systems without violating the treaty. This would allow a quicker response to Russia's deployment of INF-range missiles. New U.S. research into INF systems could prompt Russia to address U.S. concerns and preserve the INF Treaty. Soviet Union's willingness to reduce INF-range systems only came after the U.S. deployed missiles in Europe, as they posed a threat to Moscow. This led to a ban on INF missiles to mitigate the threat. New U.S. research into INF systems may lead to Russian concerns about vulnerability to missile strikes from Europe, sparking interest in limiting or banning intermediate-range missiles. Reports on potential U.S. deployment of new land-based missiles to Europe caught the attention of Russian officials, with warnings of retaliation if such actions were pursued. Russia's response to this potential deployment remains uncertain. Russia may conclude that its security is better served by either deploying its own systems or returning to compliance with the INF Treaty to avoid a new U.S. cruise missile threat. The U.S. response to Russia's INF violation may not encourage compliance, as it is part of a broader challenge of Russian activities in Europe. The U.S. could refrain from deploying new capabilities in Europe if Russia complies, but investments will be made regardless of Russia's decisions. Some analysts suggest the US suspend participation in arms control agreements with Russia to show concerns about Russia's missile developments and preserve response options to military threats. This could incentivize Russia to acknowledge and suspend noncompliant missile tests. President Trump announced the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty due to Russia's noncompliance. This move allows the US to develop its own land-based INF-range missiles and respond to challenges from Russia and China. The decision provides added flexibility in countering Chinese missile capabilities in Asia. The United States could deploy air-delivered and sea-based missiles in the region to counter Chinese efforts. Deploying missiles on the territory of allies like Japan, the Philippines, and possibly northern Australia would expand US reach without further stretching naval forces. However, some argue that US withdrawal from the INF Treaty could harm US and allied security interests as Russia would be the only party able to benefit from the treaty limits being eliminated. The termination of the INF Treaty could leave Russia as the sole beneficiary, allowing them to quickly move from testing to deployment. Some argue that the U.S. should ensure Russia pays the political price for ending the treaty, while others fear it could damage NATO cohesion as many member nations still support the treaty. Some suggest the U.S. should remain in the INF Treaty, seek resolution with Russia, and deploy air or sea-based systems around Russia. Questions arise on the need for a land-based missile to counter China, as sea and air-delivered missiles can cover targets in Asia without violating INF. Some analysts question the willingness of U.S. allies in Asia to host new U.S. missiles, citing concerns about civilian populations and potential conflict escalation. The deployment of land-based missiles in Asia could upset U.S. allies and destabilize the current security structure in Europe, potentially leading to Cold War instabilities. It is suggested that the U.S. should consider the risks of increasing anxiety among allies in Europe to reduce risks in Asia. The United States is urged to suspend participation in the New START treaty, which limits nuclear warheads. Analysts suggest the U.S. could resume reductions if Russia complies with the INF Treaty, but others warn this could undermine national security. The United States and Russia have completed their New START reductions, but the linkage between New START and INF compliance remains an issue. The Trump Administration is reviewing whether to support the extension of New START for five years when it expires in 2021. Administration officials discussed this review during testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 18, 2018. During testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 18, 2018, Under Secretary of State Andrea Thompson and Deputy Under Secretary of Defense David Trachtenberg highlighted how Russia's violation of the INF Treaty undermined U.S. confidence in arms control. They emphasized Russia's noncompliance has created a trust deficit, leading the U.S. to question Russia's commitment to arms control. Deputy Under Secretary Trachtenberg also noted that Russia's selective adherence to agreements puts the credibility of all international agreements at risk. The Administration is considering whether to extend New START. The Administration is considering whether to extend New START, weighing concerns about Russia's compliance with INF against U.S. national security interests. Under Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller noted a debate in Moscow about the INF Treaty's importance for Russia's security. Recent Russian comments provide room for negotiation. The debate in Russia is about moving beyond the INF Treaty. Russia may be unwilling to withdraw now, hoping for a joint withdrawal with the US or US withdrawal freeing Russia. The US is considering options to address security concerns with Russia deploying new INF-range cruise missiles. The debate in Russia is about moving beyond the INF Treaty, with considerations for military responses and diplomatic steps with U.S. allies. Former Under Secretary of State John Bolton supports new U.S. INF-range systems, arguing that the treaty limits the U.S.'s ability to preserve global security and that withdrawing from the treaty would provide access to a full spectrum of options. Congress has mandated a study on the need for new missiles and potential deployment locations overseas. The Pentagon is conducting research on a new ground-launched intermediate-range cruise missile, mandated by Congress. Supporters argue for new U.S. INF-range missiles, without specifying nuclear warheads or European deployment. Critics believe deploying new nuclear weapons is unnecessary, as U.S. conventional weapons are sufficient for security. Russia sees U.S. conventional capabilities as a threat to its security. The Pentagon is researching a new ground-launched intermediate-range cruise missile, supported by Congress. Critics argue against deploying new nuclear weapons, citing the adequacy of U.S. conventional weapons for security. Russia views U.S. advanced conventional weapons as a threat to its security and is reluctant to reduce its nuclear forces further without limitations on U.S. capabilities in an arms control treaty. Finding allied countries willing to host nuclear-armed missiles could be challenging, as historical opposition and public protests against such deployments exist. Several U.S. allies in Europe are calling for the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe, which could worsen political divisions and weaken NATO unity. There is little support for new U.S. land-based nuclear weapons in Asia, as the U.S. removed these weapons in the 1990s. If Russia deploys new intermediate-range missiles to coerce the U.S. or its allies, the U.S. may respond with new military capabilities, such as air-delivered or sea-based cruise missiles. The United States may consider developing new air-delivered or sea-based cruise missiles that comply with the INF Treaty without needing bases on allied territories. They could also expand the range of existing shorter-range systems, like extending the Army's tactical missile system range or developing a land-based variant of the Navy's vertical launch system for offensive missile launches from land. The United States could expand its missile defense capabilities in Europe and Asia to counter new Russian missiles, including air-delivered and sea-based military capabilities. This includes the European Phased Adaptive Approach with interceptors deployed at sea and eventually on land in Poland and Romania. The system is designed to defend against shorter- and intermediate-range missiles from Iran. The United States is considering expanding its missile defense capabilities in Europe and Asia to counter new Russian missiles. Analysts suggest NATO may reorient its system to defend against Russian intermediate-range missiles. New intermediate-range missiles from Russia could threaten U.S. allies in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The United States may engage with allies to respond to potential Russian deployment of new INF-range missiles. Allies' views on the threat could influence the U.S. approach, with some favoring diplomatic efforts and others preferring new defense capabilities. The U.S. decision to delay withdrawal from the treaty was influenced by European leaders. The United States may delay the move to consult with allies on reassurance measures in response to potential Russian missile threats. NATO could develop new plans for engaging with Russia, expand joint training missions, and discuss responses with allies in Asia and the Middle East. The United States may need to respond to Russia's noncompliance with the INF Treaty by focusing on military measures and developing new missile capabilities. However, some argue for a more nuanced approach, emphasizing the importance of reassuring allies and addressing political concerns to effectively counter Russian aggression. Confidence in U.S. defense commitments is crucial for allies feeling vulnerable to Russian coercion. The United States may need to respond to Russia's noncompliance with the INF Treaty by focusing on military measures and developing new missile capabilities. Some European allies have expressed concerns about the US military presence in Europe and have asked for a more robust response. NATO addressed these concerns during the September 2014 summit in Wales and announced collective defense measures to deter further Russian aggression. These measures may also help alleviate security concerns arising from Russia's actions. The Obama Administration faced pressure from Congress to address Russia's noncompliance with arms control agreements. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015 mandated a report on the impact of Russian noncompliance on national security and a plan to resolve the issues. Congressional committees held hearings on the matter, highlighting concerns about Russia's development of new missiles. The FY2016 NDAA addressed Russia's compliance with the INF Treaty, stating that Russia's development of a nuclear ground-launched cruise missile violates the treaty. The legislation requires periodic briefings to Congress on efforts to resolve U.S. compliance concerns and potential U.S. military responses. The United States provides information to NATO and East Asia allies about Russia's testing, operating capability, and deployment of INF-range ground-launched ballistic missiles or cruise missiles. Legislation mandates the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan to Congress for developing counterforce capabilities, countervailing strike capabilities, and active defenses against missile attacks. The FY2017 NDAA also addressed concerns with Russia's compliance with the INF Treaty by withholding funding until meaningful military capabilities are developed. The Secretary of Defense completed \"meaningful development\" of military capabilities in response to Russia's deployment of a new ground-based cruise missile. Legislation mandates the development of a conventional road-mobile ground-launched cruise missile system with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. The legislation authorizes funding for active defenses, counterforce capabilities, and countervailing strike capabilities to counter INF-range ground-launched missile systems. It also mandates additional sanctions on Russia if it remains in noncompliance with the INF Treaty. Congress also addressed the INF Treaty in the National Defense Authorization act for FY2019. The President must submit a determination to Congress on Russia's compliance with the treaty. The legislation prohibits testing and deploying land-based ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of 500-5,500 kilometers. It calls for actions to encourage Russia to comply with the INF Treaty, including funding for military capabilities and missile defense assets. The FY2015 NDAA emphasized the importance of the INF Treaty for national security. However, with Russia deploying new noncompliant missiles, Congress and the Trump Administration may reassess their stance. The United States may need to address security concerns beyond diplomatic efforts regarding the INF Treaty. Congress can express its views on a potential withdrawal from the treaty but cannot mandate the outcome."
