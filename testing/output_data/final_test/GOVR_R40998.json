    "content": "Federal agencies rely on general contracting authorities like the Armed Services Procurement Act (ASPA) and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (FPASA) to contract with small businesses. However, only the Small Business Act allows agencies to set aside contracts for small businesses, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs), and small businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones). Federal agencies can \"favor\" small businesses in certain procurements under the ASPA and FPASA authorities. These include HUBZone small businesses and 8(a) firms. Negotiated procurements consider various factors for the \"best value\" contract award. Federal agencies can \"favor\" small businesses in certain procurements under the ASPA and FPASA authorities. Factors for contract award may include contractors' past performance, compliance with solicitation requirements, technical excellence, management capability, personnel qualifications, prior experience, and small-business status. Contracts awarded to small businesses may not always be preference contracts, as some are based solely on price or other evaluation factors without considering the firms' size. The Business Opportunity Development Reform Act (BODRA) of 1988 requires government-wide and agency-specific goals for contracting with small businesses, set by the President and agency heads in consultation with the SBA. These goals must exceed certain percentages specified in statute and reflect the potential of small businesses to perform federal contracts. The government sets goals for contracting with small businesses, but there are concerns about meeting these goals. Limitations on subcontracting for small business contracts have been in place since 1986. The percentage of work that small businesses must perform themselves varies depending on the contract. It is unclear if these limitations apply to preference contracts as well as set-asides. Certain contracts set-aside for \"local firms\" in disaster or emergency areas under the authority of the Stafford Act are subject to limitations on subcontracting. These limitations require a certain percentage of work to be performed by the \"local firm\" rather than subcontracted. GAO denied a protest alleging improper award of a contract for case management and administrative services to Skyline Ultd Inc by the Army National Guard Bureau. The procurement was not set aside for SDVOSBs, but the solicitation included an evaluation factor for firms' SDVOSB status. The solicitation included an evaluation factor for firms' SDVOSB status, with firms' SDVOSB status and understanding of the requirements carrying equal weight. Price was the least important factor, and offers were considered to come from SDVOSBs if the prime contractor was an SDVOSB or if the offeror was a joint venture involving an SDVOSB firm performing more than 50% of the work. Washington-Harris Group argued that SDVOSB contractors must perform at least 50% of the contract requirements to be evaluated favorably. The GAO rejected Washington-Harris Group's arguments regarding the solicitation, stating that the FAR clause on limitations of subcontracting did not apply to this procurement as it only applies when offers are solicited exclusively from service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The solicitation differentiated between SDVOSB prime contractors and joint venturers, requiring only the latter to perform over 50% of the work. GAO concluded that Clause 52.219-27 did not apply to the procurement, so the agency did not improperly evaluate Skyline as an SDVOSB. The decision did not directly address differences between general contracting authorities and the Small Business Act, but it highlighted that contracts under general authorities cannot be set aside for SDVOSBs. The GAO's decision suggests that limitations on subcontracting may not apply to preference contracts awarded to small businesses. This could lead to more preference contracts and fewer set-asides, potentially without increasing government costs due to recent legislation addressing subcontractor tiering. The FAR was amended to minimize excessive subcontractor tiering by non-defense agencies, requiring contractors to provide information on indirect costs and value added for subcontract work when over 70% of the total cost will be subcontracted. Contractors are barred from receiving indirect costs or profits on work with no value added. Defense agencies already had similar requirements. The Department of Defense will comply with government-wide regulations, potentially benefiting small businesses through increased contracting opportunities. However, this shift could also limit small businesses' development by reducing the need for in-house resources. The limitations on subcontracting may require small businesses to develop in-house resources to perform set-aside contracts, particularly concerning 8(a) firms aimed at helping disadvantaged individuals. Preference contracts could also be used by agencies to direct work to preferred subcontractors."
