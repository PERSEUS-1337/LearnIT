    "title": "SB 1154",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Patricia Siegel Child Care Resource and Referral Memorial Act of 2016 amends the Education Code to allocate funds for child care resource and referral programs operated by public or private nonprofit entities. The Legislature intends to provide funding each fiscal year for these programs, which offer services to all parents and child care providers regardless of income. The Act requires the identification and maintenance of a resource file of all child care services, including family day care homes, public and private programs, and infant, preschool, and extended care programs. The resource file must include details such as type of program, hours of service, ages of children served, fees, and eligibility. Additionally, a referral process must be established for parents, providers, and potential users. Child care resource and referral programs provide referrals to licensed child day care facilities and may also refer to programs exempt from licensing. Referrals are available to all regardless of income level, with full respect for parental confidentiality rights. Maximum access to referral information is ensured, including through telephone assistance. Access to child care referrals is provided through telephone assistance for at least 30 hours per week. Efforts are made to ensure accessibility to all parents in the defined geographic area. Child care resource and referral programs offer services through toll-free telephone lines, email, and office space. They provide referrals in community languages and publicize their services widely. Information on licensed child care facilities is available upon request. State law requires licensed child day care facilities to make licensing reports accessible to the public, documenting facility visits or complaint investigations. Additional information on child care licensees may be available at the State Department of Social Services Community Care Licensing Division office. Public access to these files is allowed. Maintenance of ongoing documentation of requests for service through the internal referral process is required for child care resource and referral programs. This includes tracking the number of calls, ages of children served, time categories for child care requests, reasons for needing child care, and other relevant information. The data should be easily accessible for dissemination purposes. Provision of technical assistance to child care providers in California includes information on starting new services, resources for existing providers, training on various topics, and dissemination of information on public issues affecting child care delivery. The services provided include facilitating communication between child care providers, offering information on community resources and child care statistics, collaborating with partners to raise awareness of child care issues, assisting in planning and improving child care, partnering with welfare agencies to meet child care needs, and expanding child care services based on demand to maximize parental choice. A program under this article must promptly remove a licensed child day care facility with a revocation, suspension, or on probation from its referral list. It must also notify other entities in the jurisdiction. Section 8212.3 of the Education Code is repealed, and a new section 8212.5 is added, requiring child care resource and referral programs to establish complaint procedures. Procedures for documenting and resolving complaints, referring licensing violations, and removing/reinstating child care providers are outlined in Section 8214 of the Education Code. Basic child care referrals are provided at no cost to all individuals, regardless of income. Referrals include names and contact information of child care providers meeting the parent's needs. Enhanced referrals may incur a fee. Child care resource programs offer various support services to improve child care quality. The Education Code is amended to establish two projects, the California Child Care Initiative Project - State Program and the California Child Care Initiative Project - Quality Plan Program, to increase quality child care availability in cooperation with private corporations and local governments. The California Child Care Initiative Project aims to clarify the role of resource and referral programs in increasing child care spaces and improving services. The Legislature intends to promote this project in cooperation with private corporations and local governments. State funds allocated for the project must be matched by two dollars from other sources. Child care resource and referral programs in California are required to offer professional development services to all types of child care providers to enhance new services and improve quality. They must also support parental choice by providing information on selecting child care services and offering a range of alternatives for parents to choose from. Child care resource and referral programs in California offer a range of child care alternatives, provide licensing information, subsidies, and referrals. They also implement the trustline registry program for license-exempt child care providers. Child care resource and referral programs in California implement the trustline registry program for license-exempt child care providers, reviewing applications for completeness and cooperating with the California Child Care Resource and Referral Network."
