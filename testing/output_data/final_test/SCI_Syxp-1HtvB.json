    "content": "Despite the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in image synthesis, there is a lack of understanding on how photo-realistic images are composed from random noises. This work reveals a highly-structured semantic hierarchy in generative representations, showing that GANs learn variation factors for synthesizing scenes. By probing layer-wise representations with visual concepts, the causality between activations and semantics in the output image is quantified. The results suggest that GANs specialize in synthesizing hierarchical semantics, with early layers determining spatial layout and configuration. The early layers in deep neural networks determine spatial layout and configuration, middle layers control categorical objects, and later layers render scene attributes and color scheme. Representation learning in deep networks identifies explanatory factors in data. Prior research shows concept detectors emerge in deep representations trained for classification tasks, detecting semantic object parts and categorical concepts at different layers. Analyzing deep representations provides insight into emergent structures. The current focus on interpreting deep representations is mainly on discriminative models, while the nature of generative representations in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) remains less explored. GANs can transform random noises into high-quality images, but how photo-realistic images are composed over different layers of the generator is not well understood. Internal units of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) act as object detectors when trained for scene categorization. Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective object detectors for scene categorization, but synthesizing scenes requires a deeper understanding. Recent research on GANs shows that internal filters specialize in generating specific objects, but studying scene synthesis solely from an object perspective is limited in understanding GAN capabilities. This work delves deeper into the hierarchical generative representations of StyleGAN models, matching layer-wise variation factors with human-understandable scene variations at multiple abstraction levels. It reveals a highly-structured semantic hierarchy emerging from the deep generative process. In this example, a structured semantic hierarchy emerges from deep generative representations in a GAN model. Layer-wise activations correspond to spatial layout, category-guided objects, and scene attributes. Identifying these latent variation factors allows for diverse semantic image manipulation. The proposed manipulation technique in GAN models is generalized to other GANs like BigGAN and ProgressiveGAN. Various studies have analyzed hidden units in CNNs for image classification tasks, including simplifying input images, computing class saliency maps, interpreting hidden representations with segmentation masks, and training linear probes to analyze information separability among different layers. Some studies have also focused on transferring CNN features to different datasets or tasks. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have significantly advanced image synthesis, with recent models able to generate photo-realistic faces, objects, and scenes. This makes GANs applicable to real-world image editing tasks such as image manipulation and painting. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized image synthesis, producing diverse and realistic images through techniques like image painting and style transfer. Despite their success, it is unclear what GANs have truly learned. Recent studies have delved into the latent space of GANs, revealing the emergence of informative visual contents like objects and textures. This work aims to quantitatively explore the multi-level semantics within the early latent space of GANs. The text discusses the emergence of multi-level semantics in the early latent space of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It uses image classifiers to assign semantic scores to variation factors and explores how adding objects like sofas and TVs affects the synthesis process. The artist adds living room objects like sofas and TVs, refines details with specific decoration styles, and compares human interpretation with GANs' end-to-end training for scene synthesis. The study aims to understand how GANs learn to create photo-realistic scenes and align them with human perception using off-the-shelf classifiers. The study uses off-the-shelf classifiers to extract semantics from scene images, identifying variation factors encoded in generative representations by GAN. GAN synthesizes scenes hierarchically, starting with spatial layout, then category-specific objects, and finally scene attributes. The method to quantify emergent variation factors will be described. The study employs off-the-shelf image classifiers to extract semantic information from scene images and identify variation factors within generative representations by GAN. The method involves probing and verification steps to analyze latent space and synthesized images to assign semantic scores. The study uses off-the-shelf image classifiers to assign semantic scores to latent codes, creating a hierarchical semantic space. Decision boundaries are established for concepts like \"indoor lighting\" by treating them as bi-classification problems. Manipulatable variation factors are verified in the latent space. The study verifies manipulatable variation factors in the latent space by defining relevance and using GAN models to capture these factors during training. Separation boundaries are established for candidate concepts, and moving latent codes along these boundaries affects semantic scores. The study proposes a re-scoring technique to quantify the relevance of variation factors in the latent space for GAN models. By moving latent codes along normal vectors, semantic scores can be increased, allowing for ranking of the most relevant latent variation factors. The latent code is considered a \"generative representation\" in the generation process. The study analyzes variation factors in the latent space of GANs, showing a hierarchy of factors in deep generative representations. It includes a layer-wise analysis of the StyleGAN model and explores how GANs represent categorical information. By controlling activations, GANs can easily change the category of output images while preserving layout and attributes. The study explores how GANs represent categorical information by analyzing variation factors in the latent space. It includes a layer-wise analysis of the StyleGAN model and shows how GANs can change the category of output images while preserving layout and attributes. The main experiment is conducted on StyleGAN, with extensions to PGGAN and BigGAN, using off-the-shelf image classifiers to assign synthesized scenes with semantic scores. The GAN models analyze variation factors in the latent space to represent categorical information. They manipulate scene attributes and color schemes, showing the ability to change image categories while preserving layout and details. The study includes a layer-wise analysis of StyleGAN, with extensions to PGGAN and BigGAN, using image classifiers to assign semantic scores to synthesized scenes. The study focuses on analyzing variation factors in the latent space of GAN models to represent categorical information. It includes a layer-wise analysis of StyleGAN, PGGAN, and BigGAN, using image classifiers to assign semantic scores to synthesized scenes. The StyleGAN model trained on indoor scenes is used as the target model, which learns a disentangled latent space W and feeds the latent code w to each convolutional layer with different transformations. The importance of each layer with respect to variation factors is quantified using the re-scoring technique. The layer-wise analysis of GAN models like StyleGAN, PGGAN, and BigGAN reveals that the generator's layers are specialized in composing semantics hierarchically. Different layers control layout, category-level, attribute-level variations, and color schemes. Moving latent vectors along boundaries at different layers shows how synthesis varies. Objects are transformed by GAN to represent various scene categories, with object segmentation masks varying accordingly. The object segmentation mask varies when transitioning between different scene categories in GAN models. The generator's layers control layout, category-level, attribute-level variations, and color schemes. Varying latent code at different layers can lead to inconsistent changes in image content. The user study results show that bottom layers align with layout, lower layers control scene category, and hierarchical variation factors emerge in generative representation for scene synthesis. The re-scoring method helps identify variation factors across layers, facilitating semantic scene manipulation. The generative representation in GAN models allows for semantic scene manipulation by changing attributes like decoration style, furniture material, and cleanliness at different layers. Hierarchical variation factors can be jointly manipulated to alter room layout, scene category, and scene attributes simultaneously. GAN models encode hierarchical semantics from layout to scene attribute and color scheme, with middle layers synthesizing different objects for different scenes. The middle layers of GAN synthesize different objects for various scene categories, prompting an exploration of how scenes are categorized. Using the StyleGAN model trained on different room types, objects are extracted using a semantic segmentation model. By manipulating latent codes towards category boundaries, the scene category interpretation and transformation are analyzed. By manipulating latent codes towards category boundaries, the GAN model tracks label mapping for each pixel during the manipulation process to analyze how objects are transformed across different scene categories. Objects like sofa and bed are mapped to different classes when moving between living room, bedroom, and dining room categories. The GAN model can identify objects that are shareable between different scene categories. The GAN model can identify objects that are shareable between different scene categories and learn to generate these shared objects across different classes. It can control category without the need for class labels, offering an alternative approach to traditional methods like BigGAN. The method is applied to a collection of StyleGAN models to capture a wide range of manipulatable attributes for scene synthesis. The StyleGAN models in the collection are trained to synthesize scene images from various categories, both outdoor and indoor. Key semantics like \"sunny\" and \"lighting\" are identified for different categories, showing consistency with human perception. Manipulation results based on scene attributes are realistically shown in Fig.7. The method effectively disentangles semantics for scene synthesis. The generative representation in the Appendix disentangles semantics by moving latent codes along semantic directions to analyze how other factors change accordingly. Scene attributes are separated at the layout-level but entangle at the same abstraction level. For example, modifying \"indoor lighting\" also affects \"natural lighting\", aligning with human perception. The proposed quantification metric demonstrates the effectiveness of analyzing GAN structures like PGGAN and BigGAN. PGGAN does not support layer-wise analysis but the re-scoring method can still help identify manipulatable semantics. BigGAN, on the other hand, allows layer-wise analysis and analysis results show that scene attributes can be manipulated effectively. The analysis results on BigGAN show that scene attributes can be best modified at upper layers compared to lower layers. The results demonstrate the generalization ability of the approach and the emergence of manipulatable factors in other GANs. The GAN model learns to set up layout, generate categorical objects, and render scene attributes and color schemes at different layers when trained to synthesize scenes. A re-scoring method is proposed to identify manipulatable semantic concepts within a well-trained model for photo-realistic scene manipulation. The implementation details include the GAN models used, off-the-shelf classifiers for semantic score prediction, and the process of semantic identification. An ablation study in Sec. B shows the importance of the re-scoring technique in identifying variation factors in GAN. Limitations and future directions are discussed in Sec. C, while Sec. D presents more scene manipulation results. Sec. E details the model structures of StyleGAN and BigGAN, employing layer-wise latent codes, and Sec. F provides an ablation study on layer-wise manipulation. The LSUN dataset includes indoor and outdoor scene categories, while the Places dataset contains millions of images across various categories. PGGAN and StyleGAN are trained on LSUN, while BigGAN is trained on Places. Officially released models are used for PGGAN, with each trained to synthesize scenes from specific LSUN categories. StyleGAN has a model for bedroom scene synthesis, and additional models are trained for other indoor and outdoor scene categories.

StyleGAN has a model for bedroom scene synthesis, and additional models are trained for other indoor and outdoor scene categories. The models are used for categorical analysis, with semantic scores extracted from synthesized images using off-the-shelf image classifiers. In addition, a layout estimator detects the outline structure of indoor places, and a color scheme is extracted through hue histograms in HSV space. A GAN model is used to generate synthesized scene images by sampling latent codes, with N set to 500,000 to capture potential variation factors. The category classifier and attribute predictor output probabilities for image categories and attributes. After training image classifiers on the LSUN and Places datasets, semantic scores are assigned to visual concepts based on the relative position within the image. Positive and negative samples are selected for each candidate, and a linear SVM is trained for bi-classification. Samples are then re-generated for semantic verification before applying the re-scoring technique. After training image classifiers on LSUN and Places datasets, semantic scores are assigned to visual concepts. The proposed re-scoring technique involves assigning semantic scores for synthesized samples and training SVM classifiers to search semantic boundaries. An ablation study on a StyleGAN model for synthesizing bedrooms shows the effectiveness of the re-scoring technique in identifying manipulatable semantics. The study filters out default attributes of bedrooms, proving the essentiality of the technique in verification. Our method successfully filters out invariable candidates and reveals more meaningful semantics like \"wood\" and \"indoor lighting\". It also identifies less frequent but manipulatable scene attributes such as \"cluttered space\". Even the worst SVM classifier achieves 72.3% accuracy due to some variation factors not being encoded in the latent representation. Relying solely on the SVM classifier is not enough to detect relevant variation factors. Our method pays more attention to this aspect. Our method focuses on score modulation to detect variation factors in the latent space, avoiding bias from initial responses or SVM performance. It successfully identifies hierarchical manipulatable factors in deep generative representations but has limitations in analyzing outdoor scenes due to a lack of unified spatial layout definition. Future work will leverage computational photography tools for 3D recovery. In future work, the method will utilize computational photography tools for 3D camera pose recovery to enhance viewpoint representation. The re-scoring technique relies on off-the-shelf classifiers, which may need more accurate models for better manipulation boundaries. The current use of linear SVM for semantic boundary search limits the framework from interpreting complex and nonlinear structures in the latent semantic subspace. The proposed method can identify hierarchical variation factors and enable semantic scene manipulation at layout, category, and attribute levels. The experiments conducted on StyleGAN, BigGAN, and PGGAN for high-resolution scene synthesis involve manipulating latent codes at different levels and categories. The models introduce layer-wise stochasticity and utilize state-of-the-art deep generative architectures. In high-resolution scene synthesis, GAN models like StyleGAN and BigGAN use layer-wise latent codes for better generation quality. StyleGAN has 14 convolutional layers, with each layer corresponding to layout, category, attribute, and color scheme. BigGAN has 12 convolutional layers for 256x256 resolution images. The BigGAN model with 256x256 resolution has 12 convolutional layers. The layers are separated into lower and upper groups for analysis. Attribute-level semantics are better controlled by the upper layers of BigGAN, as shown in visualization results and quantitative curves. Manipulating attributes like \"vegetation\" at upper layers gives desired output, while lower layers result in unexpected variations. Ablation study on layer-wise manipulation with StyleGAN model further validates the emergence of semantic hierarchy. A study on layer-wise manipulation with StyleGAN model reveals that manipulating latent codes at attribute-relevant layers can increase indoor lighting without affecting other factors. Similarly, modifying latent codes at bottom layers only affects layout instead of all other semantics, confirming the emergence of semantic hierarchy."
