It incorporates a graph attention mechanism to predict conversation evolution and decodes responses using utterance texts and concept flows. Experiments show ConceptFlow outperforms previous dialog models and fine-tuned GPT-2 models on Reddit conversations with fewer parameters. The advancements in language modeling have led to data-driven conversation models that generate natural language responses. However, current models can produce dull and repetitive content, resulting in irrelevant responses that harm user experiences. To combat this, incorporating knowledge such as open-domain knowledge graphs or commonsense knowledge bases can help improve conversation quality. Recent research has shown that integrating external knowledge into conversation models can improve the quality of generated responses. This includes grounding conversation utterances to external knowledge and using it as additional semantic representations. Human dialogues are dynamic and flow in the semantic space, shifting between concepts and topics. ConceptFlow leverages commonsense knowledge graph to model conversation flow in latent concept space. It starts from grounded knowledge, extends to multi-hop concepts, and models conversation flow using fine-grained graph attention mechanism. Mimicking development of conversation topics, graph attentions guide concept flow by attending on different directions in the concept. The encoded latent concept flow is integrated into response generation using ConceptFlow, which models conversation structure by sampling tokens from a context vector combining utterance texts and latent concept flow. Experiments on Reddit and ConceptNet show ConceptFlow outperforms other generation models leveraging commonsense knowledge graph. ConceptFlow outperforms fine-tuned GPT-2 systems by effectively modeling conversation structure with a latent concept graph. Reddit discussions align naturally with paths in the knowledge graph, improving response coverage. Graph attention mechanism selects useful latent concepts, generating relevant and informative responses. The Conversation generation model ConceptFlow uses a latent concept graph to generate meaningful responses by modeling conversation flow along commonsense relations between concepts. The encoder-decoder architecture represents user utterances and generates responses using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and context embeddings. ConceptFlow uses a latent concept graph to generate responses by modeling conversation flow. The graph includes grounded concepts and grows with one-hop and two-hop concepts to form central and outer concept graphs. This latent concept flow consists of related concepts for conversation generation. The central flow concept in ConceptFlow models the conversation flow from zero-hop to one-hop concepts using a Graph Neural Network. The encoding involves interactions between zero-hop and one-hop concepts, with user utterance representations calculated at each layer. The user utterance representation in the l-th layer is updated with grounded concepts. The attention weight controls concept flow from neighbor concepts based on relation and Page Rank scores. Initial concept and user utterance representations are based on pre-trained embeddings and hidden states. The outer flow encoding in the GNN model establishes concept flow from one-hop to two-hop concepts using attention weights. It calculates attention scores to aggregate concept triples and guides conversation developments in diverse directions. The text discusses generating responses using latent concept flow in context representation with ConceptFlow. It involves updating output representations with context representations and attention scores over user utterance representations. The concept-based representation combines central concept flow encodings and outer flow encodings with attention weights. The conversation generator utilizes output representations to decode words and concepts from vocabularies. Generation probabilities are calculated for words and concepts separately, with a gate controlling token generation. Cross entropy loss is minimized to optimize parameters end-to-end. The conversation generator uses output representations to decode words and concepts. Evaluation metrics include PPL, Bleu, Nist, ROUGE, and Meteor for relevance and repetitiveness. Diversity is measured using Dist-1, Dist-2, and Ent-4. Baselines compared in experiments include Seq2Seq, MemNet, and CopyNet. The MemNet and CopyNet models utilize extra knowledge to store and read concepts for conversation generation. The Commonsense Knowledge Aware Conversation Generation Model (CCM) leverages a graph attention mechanism to improve conversation flow. GPT-2, a pre-trained model, is also compared in experiments for language generation tasks. The GPT-2 model is extended with an encode-decoder architecture and trained with response data. Zero-hop concepts are initialized by matching keywords in posts to concepts in ConceptNet. The central concept graph is formed by extending zero-hop concepts to their neighbors. ConceptFlow selects related concepts for conversation generation by training an initial version on 10% of the data and using graph attention to select the top-100 two-hop concepts for further training and testing. The ConceptFlow model uses TransE and Glove embeddings to represent concepts and words, respectively. It employs an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 for training. The quality of generated responses, ablation study, and case studies are presented. Automatic evaluation metrics show that the model outperforms previous ones in terms of relevance, diversity, and novelty of responses. The study evaluates the word diversity and repetitiveness of generated responses using various metrics. GPT-2 (lang) is diverse, while ConceptFlow is more novel and on-topic. Human evaluation focuses on appropriateness and informativeness. Responses from CCM, GPT-2 (conv), ConceptFlow, and Golden Response are scored for appropriateness and informativeness. ConceptFlow outperforms baseline models in human evaluation, scoring higher in Average Score and Best@1 ratio. It demonstrates the advantage of explicitly modeling conversation flow with semantics and outperforms GPT-2 with fewer parameters. The effectiveness of ConceptFlow is studied through golden concept coverage, selection, and response generation strategies. ConceptFlow, a method that selects concepts by learned graph attentions, outperforms baseline models in human evaluation. It effectively selects more meaningful outer concepts for conversation generation and demonstrates advanced performances in precision, recall, and F1 metrics. ConceptFlow filters unrelated concepts and chooses underlying concepts to enhance central graph understanding, leading to superior performance even compared to Gold in perplexity. ConceptFlow outperforms Gold in Perplexity by selecting more meaningful concepts for conversation generation. Pre-trained language models like ELMO, BERT, and GPT-2 have improved NLG performance, but irrelevant responses remain a challenge in conversational generation. Challenges in conversational generation include utilizing unstructured texts, knowledge extraction with CNN, and memory networks for better response generation. Previous studies focus on domain-specific dialog systems, while ConceptFlow improves response quality by selecting meaningful concepts. ConceptFlow models conversation flow explicitly with a commonsense graph and uses a novel attention mechanism with Graph Neural Network to guide the conversation flow in latent concept spaces. It generates more meaningful responses compared to previous conversational systems and fine-tuned GPT-2 models. The advantage of ConceptFlow lies in its high-quality and high-coverage latent concept flow captured by graph attentions, leading to more appropriate and informative responses according to human evaluation. ConceptFlow generates more appropriate and informative responses by explicitly modeling the latent conversation structure. The system uses a novel attention mechanism with Graph Neural Network to guide the conversation flow in latent concept spaces, resulting in high-quality responses according to human evaluation. The curr_chunk discusses targeting young animals as they are perceived as the weakest, with a mention of a player's performance and potential in sports. It also touches on the idea of tricking the body into thinking it is still in the season for better performance. The curr_chunk discusses a player's performance and potential in sports, mentioning tricking the body into thinking it is still in the season for better performance. The conversation also touches on the feeling of not having friends and changing music. The curr_chunk discusses the financial struggles of Milan and Inter, questioning if they are still top clubs. GPT-2 believes Milan is a top club due to their consistent performance. The concept graph is expanding, requiring a concept selector to filter related concepts based on attention scores. The curr_chunk discusses the construction of a two-hop concept graph G2 with central concepts reserved based on high correlation to the conversation topic. Human judges evaluate responses from CCM, GPT-2 (conv), ConceptFlow, and Golden Response for appropriateness and informativeness. Agreement among judges is shown in Table 9, comparing scores from baseline models with ConceptFlow. The construction of a two-hop concept graph G2 is discussed, with human evaluation confirming the quality of responses. The graph covers over 61% of golden concepts with acceptable efficiency, increasing dramatically with three hops but ending at two hops due to computational complexity."
