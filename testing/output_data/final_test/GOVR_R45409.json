    "content": "Quantum information science (QIS) combines mathematics, computer science, engineering, and physical sciences to achieve capabilities beyond current technologies. It builds on quantum science principles to process information in ways not possible with classical physics. Quantum computing, a key application of QIS, excels in tasks like code breaking due to its unmatched power derived from quantum effects in physics. Quantum computing's power comes from the use of qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. This allows a quantum computer to be exponentially more powerful than a classical computer, with the ability to represent multiple states at the same time. Adding a bit to a classical computer increases its power linearly, while adding a qubit to a quantum computer increases its power exponentially. Quantum computing's power comes from qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. Adding a qubit to a quantum computer increases its power exponentially. Assembling a working quantum computer is much more difficult than a classical computer due to the narrow set of conditions required for it to work. Many quantum systems remain theoretical until ideal conditions can be maintained for qubits. Quantum sensing and metrology technologies include navigation, atomic clocks, gravimeters, inertial motion units, and electron microscopes. These technologies offer improved accuracy compared to classical physics products. The Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA) found that quantum metrology and sensing have the largest range of commercial products with established categories. New QIS technologies are being used for position, navigation, and timing, medical imaging, and research. Some experts believe that potential markets for these technologies are small due to higher costs and technical complexity. However, continued investment and effective coordination could bring QIS-enhanced sensors to the U.S. marketplace by 2021. Quantum key distribution (QKD) uses quantum physics to secure communications over unprotected networks. Quantum repeaters can extend signal distances over fiber-optic cables. Quantum key distribution (QKD) uses quantum physics to secure communications over unprotected networks. Quantum repeaters can extend signal distances over fiber-optic cables, but increase complexity. Chinese government invests heavily in QKD, but analysts in North America and Europe question cost-benefit ratio. Quantum computing offers exponential scale advantages over classical computing. Quantum simulation uses quantum hardware to study properties of materials and nuclear physics. The current capabilities of quantum computers limit the size of the problems they can solve. Significant research has been conducted by various entities, but widespread commercial quantum computing is not expected before 2025. Government interest in Quantum Information Science (QIS) dates back to the mid-1990s, with investments made in research projects by organizations like the Department of Energy (DOE). In September 2018, the National Science Foundation (NSF) committed $218 million to 85 research projects, including $31 million in grants for 33 projects. $6 million was allocated to engineering projects for quantum information systems, with the remaining $25 million going to basic research projects. Various government agencies, including NIST, DOD, DARPA, and IARPA, are involved in QIS research. QIS is part of the National Strategic Computing Initiative, established in 2015, with reports issued by the White House under both President Obama and President Trump. The National Science and Technology Council issued a report in July 2016 outlining the QIS strategy under President Obama and President Trump. The report highlighted the importance of maintaining stable and sustained core programs for QIS R&D. The report emphasized the need for sustained core programs in Quantum Information Science (QIS) to support researchers, instill confidence in students, and facilitate the transition of lab demonstrations into marketable technology. It recommended strategic investments in targeted, time-limited programs to achieve measurable objectives and adapt quickly to technological advancements. Continuous monitoring of federal QIS investments was advised to capitalize on breakthroughs and ensure the effectiveness of future investment strategies. The National Strategic Overview for Quantum Information Science highlights the need for federal coordination and investment in Quantum Information Science (QIS) to keep the United States at the forefront of developments. The Department of Commerce released an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to review controls for emerging technologies. The Department of Commerce released an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking public comment on criteria to identify emerging technologies essential to U.S. national security, including Quantum Information Science applications. Comments are due on December 19, 2018, with major research centers worldwide, including China and the EU, leading in QIS R&D. China is a leading country in Quantum Information Science (QIS) research, designating it as a \"megaproject\" in its science and technology development plan. China invests an estimated $244 million annually in QIS R&D and has begun constructing a national QIS science center. Additionally, China actively recruits QIS experts. China actively seeks out QIS experts and entrepreneurs, offering incentives to attract Chinese experts back to China. Between 2016 and 2018, China achieved significant QIS milestones, including the launch of the world's first quantum satellite, Micius, and long-distance quantum communication achievements. The EU's Quantum Technologies Flagship program, outlined in the Quantum Manifesto, is a $1.1 billion initiative to commercialize QIS R&D and foster competitiveness in European quantum technologies. The EU aims to foster a competitive quantum industry, expand scientific leadership, attract investment, and address grand challenges. The UK and Canada have invested in quantum technology development, focusing on areas like internet security and life-saving equipment. Canada's Quantum Information Science (QIS) program began in 1999 with private investments, leading to the establishment of the Perimeter Institute and University of Waterloo as QIS R&D leaders. In 2018, Canada allocated $11.5 million over three years to the Institute of Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo. The US Congress has introduced several bills and held hearings on QIS, including the National Quantum Initiative Act (S. 3143, H.R. 6227) to accelerate US QIS R&D by establishing a federal program. The Quantum Coordination Office within OSTP oversees interagency coordination, strategic planning, outreach, and promotes commercialization of federal research. The bills aim to support basic QIS research, standards development, establish national research centers, encourage U.S. technology companies to contribute, address research gaps, strengthen workforce pipeline, and lead in developing quantum standards globally. H.R. 6227 was reported by the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and passed in the House on September 13, 2018. The Quantum Computing Research Act (S. 2998) was introduced by Senator Kamala Harris on June 5, 2018. The bill aims to establish the Defense Quantum Information Consortium, including members selected by the Chief of Naval Research from institutions of higher learning and industry partners in the eastern United States. The bill aims to establish the Defense Quantum Information Consortium, with members selected from institutions and industry partners in the eastern and western United States recognized for achievements in quantum information science. A board would be formed to award grants, assist with research, and facilitate partnerships among consortium members. The Department of Energy Quantum Information Science Research Act (S. 3673) introduced by Senator Lisa Murkowski aims to conduct basic quantum information science research, set goals, provide research experiences for students, coordinate research efforts, and collaborate with other federal agencies and research communities. Three House committees have also held hearings on various aspects of Quantum Information Science. House committees have held hearings on different aspects of Quantum Information Science (QIS), including American leadership in QIS technology, China's investment in QIS, and concerns about China closing the gap with the U.S. in advanced technology research and development. The House committees held a hearing on quantum computing as part of its \"Disrupter Series.\" Topics discussed included the uses and advantages of quantum computers, potential dangers, barriers to development in the U.S., and the country's standing in relation to others. Reports emphasized the need for a collaborative effort in creating an effective U.S. QIS R&D policy, addressing key areas like institutional boundaries, education, technology transfer, materials, and funding stability. The DOE report and congressional hearings highlighted the need for coordination and collaboration in Quantum Information Science (QIS) research. Current academic programs are deemed insufficient for progress in QIS R&D, emphasizing the importance of partnerships and cross-cutting teams with diverse expertise. Education and workforce training programs are inadequate for advancing Quantum Information Science (QIS) research and development, which requires a diverse range of skills. While a deep understanding of quantum mechanics is essential, expertise in disciplines like computer science, applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and systems engineering is also needed. Multidisciplinary QIS centers at universities and federal labs are seen as a potential solution. Impediments to successful commercial QIS products include challenges with licensing intellectual property, lack of venture capital, and difficulty in connecting qualified graduates and experienced scientists. Advancement of Quantum Information Science (QIS) applications relies on novel quantum materials and improving fabrication tools. Challenges include federal funding fluctuations affecting progress and workforce development. Insufficient coordination among agencies leads to uncertainty in university research programs. Uncertainty in university research programs due to insufficient coordination among agencies may lead promising researchers to seek opportunities abroad or be recruited by foreign entities."
