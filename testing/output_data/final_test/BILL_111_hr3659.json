    "content": "The \"Building Energy Tax Credit Act of 2009\" may be cited as the short title. It introduces the Commercial Building Energy Project Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Commercial Building Energy Project Credit allows a 35% credit for energy conservation commercial building property costs. The maximum credit for a building in a taxable year is $4.00 multiplied by the square footage, minus any prior year credits. Energy conservation commercial building property includes depreciable property. The Commercial Building Energy Project Credit allows a 35% credit for energy conservation commercial building property costs. The credit is applicable to energy efficient commercial building property installed in the United States as part of a commercial building energy project. This project aims to achieve energy consumption rates below 60% of the ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007 for commercial buildings, with credit amounts allocated by an energy credit agency. The credit limitation for a project under the State energy credit dollar amount allocated shall not exceed the amount determined for any taxable year. Energy credit agencies have an aggregate credit dollar amount allocated for each calendar year, determined by the Secretary among the States. The energy credit limitation is allocated among States based on population, with a national limit of $100,000,000 per year. Special rules apply for building location jurisdiction. The energy credit agency can only allocate its funds to projects within its jurisdiction. If the agency exceeds its allocated limit, the excess funds will be reduced in reverse order of allocation. The energy credit agency must allocate funds according to an approved plan by the governmental unit. The qualified allocation plan must meet specific requirements. The qualified allocation plan must meet specific requirements, including selection criteria and project preference for energy savings. The plan should prioritize projects based on local conditions and allocate funds accordingly. The qualified allocation plan must prioritize projects based on energy savings, with higher amounts allocated to projects achieving greater savings. Compliance monitoring is required to ensure adherence to the plan's provisions. The plan must prioritize projects based on energy savings, with compliance monitoring required to ensure adherence. The plan should have a certification procedure for inspection and testing by qualified individuals to certify projects complying with energy-savings plans and targets. Qualified individuals for determining compliance are those recognized by the energy credit agency. The plan must prioritize energy-saving projects and include a pre-certification procedure for commercial building energy projects. A person can transfer the allowable credit for energy conservation building property once. The credit for energy conservation building property can be transferred once to another person not described in the paragraph. The transferee is treated as the taxpayer eligible for the credit, while the transferor's proceeds are considered to arise from an essential government function. The transfer of a credit under this subsection does not count as income. The credit is available to tax-exempt organizations or government entities. No double benefit is allowed if a deduction is already claimed. Basis reduction applies if a credit is claimed for energy conservation. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for energy conservation building property credits. State guidance will be provided for measuring energy savings in commercial building projects. The credit is treated as part of the general business credit. The ASHRAE standard includes amendments to the general business credit for commercial building energy credits under section 45R(a). Conforming amendments are made to section 1016 of the Code, and a clerical amendment is added to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments made by this section apply to property placed in service after the enactment of this Act."
