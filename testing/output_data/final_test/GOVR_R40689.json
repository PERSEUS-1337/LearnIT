    "content": "The terms short-time compensation and work sharing are sometimes used interchangeably. Work sharing involves reducing work hours for all workers instead of laying off a smaller number. Workers with reduced hours may receive STC, equivalent to prorated unemployment benefits. STC benefits can replace almost half of an average worker's wages, with variation among states. For a worker with a 20% reduction in hours, STC would amount to about 10% of their wages before the reduction. This allows employees to receive 90% of their full-time wages for four days of work: 80% as wages and 10% as STC. In the U.S., work sharing has a long history, dating back to the early 1930s when President Hoover encouraged employers to reduce hours instead of laying off workers. The federal government introduced a temporary STC program in 1982 with TEFRA, which expired in 1985. The recession of 1990-1991 brought renewed attention to STC, leading Congress to enact permanent STC legislation in 1992. In February 2012, Congress passed P.L. 112-96, which clarifies requirements related to STC programs. P.L. 112-96 clarifies requirements for short-time compensation programs, where employers reduce work hours instead of layoffs. Employees' workweeks are reduced by at least 10% and no more than 60%. STC is a portion of unemployment compensation, and eligible employees do not need to actively seek work but must be available for their normal workweeks. They can also participate in training programs. Employers in state-approved training programs must certify continued health or retirement benefits for STC participants. P.L. 112-96 provides federal financing for STC benefits in qualifying states. Over half of states and D.C. have STC programs. The federal-state unemployment insurance system allows for payment of partial unemployment benefits to workers with reduced hours or those working part-time while searching for full-time employment. States provide benefits to part-time workers earning less than their weekly benefit amount, reducing benefits by the amount of earnings from work. Partial unemployment benefits are available to workers with reduced hours, typically replacing around 50% of average wages up to a cap. To qualify, workers must have a 50% or more reduction in normal hours. State Short-Time Compensation (STC) programs cap work hour reductions at 60% and are available to employees with as little as a 10% reduction in hours. STC benefits are not offset by work earnings, but only about half of states have implemented these programs. Over half of states have STC programs, but usage remains limited. The ratio of STC beneficiaries to regular unemployment compensation beneficiaries has been low historically, but increased to 2% in 2009 and nearly 3% in 2010. STC usage is countercyclical, peaking during recessions like in 1992, 2001, and 2009-2011. In 2010, about 314,000 workers received STC benefits. In 2013, STC usage fell significantly to under 74,000 beneficiaries, and by 2015, new STC beneficiaries had decreased to just over 60,000. STC usage varies among states with programs, with some states showing negligible usage while others, like Missouri, have over 9% of regular unemployment compensation beneficiaries also receiving STC benefits. Manufacturing firms in California were found to be more likely to use STC compared to other types of firms. In 2009, manufacturing firms in Connecticut and California were more likely to use STC, with wholesale trade also showing higher usage. STC firms tended to be older, larger, and have jobs requiring lengthy apprenticeships or on-the-job training programs. Industries within manufacturing that used STC the most included electronics, industrial machinery, fabricated metals, and furniture. Within the construction sector, STC firms were more likely to be \"specialty trades contractors\" such as plumbers and electricians. The decision to seek STC as part of a work sharing arrangement depends on various factors, including whether it is suitable for both the firm and its employees. Work sharing programs with STC can offer macroeconomic benefits by preserving jobs during downturns, maintaining consumption, and ensuring the continuation of employer-sponsored benefits. The National Governors Association promoted STC as a recommended policy for assisting workers in an economic downturn in 2010. However, the administrative costs of STC programs have been a concern for state labor agencies, as many states still use paper-based systems and approve work sharing plans on a case-by-case basis. STC may increase processing costs for state agencies compared to layoffs, as it affects a larger number of workers. Some suggest that states would see offsetting savings by not laying off workers. Some states have responded to high administrative costs of STC programs by reducing layers of approval, automating claims processes, and switching to employer-filed claims. Strategies to automate STC filing have helped reduce administrative costs, with Massachusetts fully automating its program in 2001 and 2002. Massachusetts fully automated its STC program in 2001 and 2002, offering its software to other states. The impact of STC benefits on state unemployment trust fund accounts is likely small, with negative immediate effects during recessions. STC benefits are experience-rated similarly to regular unemployment benefits, resulting in minimal long-term effects on state UTF accounts. When STC was first implemented, it aimed to protect affirmative action gains by helping vulnerable workers. However, a 1997 study found no evidence that STC disproportionately benefits minorities or women. Under P.L. 112-96, the Labor Secretary could award grants to states for STC programs, with funds allocated for implementation, administration, and program promotion. The maximum amount of grants authorized under P.L. 112-96 for program promotion and enrollment of employers was $100 million, with states ultimately receiving $46 million. Employers may choose between layoffs and work sharing with STC based on financial and non-quantifiable factors like employee morale. Work sharing and STC arrangements can help reduce total costs for some firms during a downturn, with immediate cost savings coming from reduced wages and salaries. STC can save employers in wage costs if it involves all employees as an alternative to laying off low-seniority employees. Some employers find work sharing and STC programs attractive as they prevent skilled employees from leaving during economic downturns. STC can help retain highly skilled workers, with older and better-paid employees benefiting from these programs. Employers use work sharing and STC to protect specific groups of skilled workers during layoffs. The State's STC program allows employers to apply percentage reductions to hours and wages in different departments. A 1997 study found that employers using STC were satisfied and would use it again, with some using it repeatedly over a three-year period. Work sharing and STC arrangements help sustain morale and productivity compared to layoffs, which can lead to \"survivor's guilt\" and reduced productivity. The survey conducted by Berkeley Planning Associates and Mathematica found that firms using the STC program experienced higher unemployment insurance charges compared to non-participating firms. This led to layoffs and increased economic distress for STC firms. In states where STC is charged to the firm based on regular unemployment program rules, using STC does not result in higher UI tax costs compared to layoffs. The study found that firms using the STC program faced higher unemployment insurance charges, leading to layoffs and economic distress. Some states impose additional tax provisions on work sharing employers to ensure fairness. Reimbursing employers can pay unemployment benefits directly instead of contributing to the state's trust fund, but STC may not be cost-effective for them. Employers may find STC not cost-effective due to various reasons such as lack of awareness, high production costs, and non-wage employment costs. Some industries, like manufacturing, face challenges in implementing shorter work schedules due to high equipment shutdown costs. Additionally, health and pension benefits, considered quasi-fixed costs, may not decrease proportionally with reduced work hours. Work sharing arrangements under STC programs ensure that health insurance and pension benefits are maintained without reduction, alleviating layoffs and spreading earnings reductions. Employees receiving STC in conjunction with work sharing appreciate the opportunity amid a tough job market. Analysts suggest that work sharing could shift the employment landscape. Analysts suggest that work sharing under STC programs could shift the impact of an economic downturn from younger to older workers by spreading the pain of a workforce reduction among workers of all ages. Younger employees stand to gain the most from work sharing, while more experienced and highly paid workers may lose out. Employees with seniority may oppose such programs that share reductions across the labor force. Research indicates that reduced work hours may affect professional employees differently from hourly workers, with professionals valuing work-life balance and hourly workers relying on overtime to make ends meet. When STC was introduced in the 1970s and 1980s, labor groups warned about potential impacts on workers' health insurance and pensions due to reduced work hours and pay. Concerns about pension contributions and benefits were addressed in a temporary STC program from 1982 to 1985, but safeguards were not included in the permanent law passed in 1992. By 2012, these concerns resurfaced, leading to P.L. 112-96 requiring employers to address health and pension benefits for workers. In 1992, concerns about health insurance and pension benefits resurfaced, leading to P.L. 112-96 requiring employers to certify that benefits will not be reduced during work sharing arrangements. Work sharing and STC arrangements in declining industries may cause workers to delay job searches or retraining efforts. STC cannot prevent inevitable layoffs. States began promoting work sharing arrangements with income support after the recession of 1973-1975. New York was the first state to consider STC legislation in 1975. In 1975, New York was the first state to consider STC legislation, but it died in committee. California enacted an STC law in 1978 in response to potential public sector layoffs from tax reductions. Arizona followed in 1981, and Oregon in 1982 with support from Motorola. The federal government introduced a national STC program in 1982 with TEFRA. In 1982, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) authorized states to use funds from the Unemployment Trust Fund to pay Shared Work Compensation (STC) benefits to eligible employees with reduced work hours. Employers had to submit a formal work sharing plan for approval by the state agency and relevant union(s). AFL-CIO initially opposed but later supported STC with safeguards for pension and health benefits. TEFRA expired in 1985 after three years. TEFRA authorized states to use funds from the Unemployment Trust Fund for Shared Work Compensation (STC) benefits to employees with reduced work hours. Employers had to submit a work sharing plan for approval by the state agency and relevant union(s). STC recipients were exempt from state work search requirements but had to be available for work. Employers had to continue providing health and pension benefits as if employees worked their normal hours. The Secretary of Labor was tasked with developing model STC legislation for states and evaluating the program. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) published model state legislative language and guidelines for the Shared Work Compensation (STC) program in July 1983. After the three-year experimental period of the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act (TEFRA), eight more states implemented STC programs. Despite the expiration of the temporary federal law in 1985, existing state programs continued. The DOL ceased promoting STC after the mandate expired but allowed states to use the 1983 federal guidance and collect reporting data. The recession in 1990-1991 brought renewed attention to STC, leading to the enactment of permanent legislation in 1992 (UCA; P.L. 102-318) allowing states to pay STC benefits. The Unemployment Compensation Act (UCA) of 1992 allowed states to pay Shared Work Compensation (STC) benefits, which included a five-point definition of STC program requirements. STC beneficiaries had reduced workweeks, received a portion of full unemployment benefits, were not required to meet work search requirements, could participate in training programs, and the reduction in work hours was in lieu of layoffs. The UCA also directed the Secretary of Labor to assist states in implementing STC programs. The Unemployment Compensation Act of 1992 (UCA) allowed states to implement Shared Work Compensation (STC) programs without the employee and employer safeguards present in TEFRA. UCA did not require employers to submit work sharing plans for approval, certify reductions in work hours, obtain consent from unions, or contribute to health insurance or pension plans. Additionally, UCA did not include provisions for charging STC to employers in a manner consistent with state law for determining unemployment taxes. The U.S. Secretary of Labor did not have the authority to determine additional program elements beyond the five definitional items specified in the 1992 law. The 1992 law allowed states to implement Shared Work Compensation (STC) programs without certain safeguards present in TEFRA. The U.S. Department of Labor largely avoided implementing STC until 2012, when Congress passed P.L. 112-96. A study of the program was supported in 1997. Government officials found the 1992 law restrictive and unworkable, putting existing state STC programs at risk of non-compliance. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 clarified the definition of Shared Work Compensation (STC) and provided incentives for states to adopt and modify STC programs. Employers could submit STC plans for approval, eligible workers would receive unemployment compensation and training, and employees would meet certain requirements. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 clarified the definition of Shared Work Compensation (STC) and provided incentives for states to adopt and modify STC programs. Employers could submit STC plans for approval, eligible workers would receive unemployment compensation and training, and employees would meet certain requirements. The act allowed states to request approval for additional provisions in their STC laws and provided federal financing for 100% of STC benefits for up to three years in compliant states. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 provided federal financing for states to adopt and modify Shared Work Compensation (STC) programs. States meeting the new STC program definition received 100% federal financing for up to three years. States without existing STC programs could receive federal reimbursement for 50% of STC payments for up to two years, with employers covering the other 50%. States enacting laws meeting criteria in P.L. 112-96 could receive 100% federal financing for STC programs for a maximum of three years. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 provided federal funding for states to implement Shared Work Compensation (STC) programs for up to three years. Grants were awarded to states under P.L. 112-96, with funds allocated for program implementation, promotion, and enrollment of employers. U.S. DOL was tasked with providing technical assistance and reporting requirements on averted layoffs. States had to apply for grants by December 31, 2014, and U.S. DOL was allocated $1.5 million for reporting to Congress and the President within four years of enactment. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 provided federal funding for states to implement Shared Work Compensation (STC) programs. Currently, 27 states and the District of Columbia have active STC programs, with a similar structure in each state where eligible individuals have their workweeks reduced by at least 10% in lieu of temporary layoffs. STC remains a little-used program despite efforts to promote state adoption and implementation. The Shared Work Compensation (STC) program allows eligible individuals to have their workweeks reduced by at least 10% instead of facing temporary layoffs. Participants receive a pro rata share of unemployment compensation and are not required to meet the \"able and available for work\" requirement. STC agreements vary among states, with durations ranging from 6 months to approximately 1 year. Benefits can last up to 18 weeks in some states and up to 52 weeks in others, with no limits in California, Michigan, Washington, and Wisconsin. California, Michigan, Washington, and Wisconsin have no limits on the number of weeks a worker may receive STC benefits, but there are caps on total benefits paid to an individual."
