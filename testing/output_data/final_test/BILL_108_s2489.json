    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act\" and establishes an Integrated Ocean and Coastal Mapping Program. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will establish a program with the Interagency Committee on Ocean and Coastal Mapping to develop a Federal ocean and coastal mapping plan for various US waters. This plan aims to enhance ecosystem approaches for conservation, establish research priorities, support research platforms, and advance ocean and coastal science. The program will identify all Federal and federally-funded programs conducting shoreline delineation and ocean or coastal mapping. The program aims to enhance ecosystem approaches for conservation, establish research priorities, support research platforms, and advance ocean and coastal science by promoting cost-effective, cooperative mapping efforts among Federal agencies, facilitating technology adaptation, and developing standards for testing innovative technologies. Developing standards and protocols for testing new mapping technologies and transferring them between the Federal government and private sector or academia, centrally archiving, managing, and distributing data sets, providing mapping products and services to the public, and creating data presentation standards for documenting various marine activities and resources for environmental protection and conservation. The curr_chunk focuses on coordinating Federal data with State and local government programs for the protection and management of living marine resources. The curr_chunk establishes an Interagency Committee on Ocean and Coastal Mapping. Establishment of an Interagency Committee on Ocean and Coastal Mapping with senior representatives from various Federal agencies involved in mapping and surveying responsibilities. Membership includes officials from agencies like NOAA, USGS, NGA, USACE, and others. The Interagency Committee on Ocean and Coastal Mapping, chaired by NOAA, meets quarterly and may create subcommittees or working groups as needed. It coordinates with other Federal efforts, international mapping activities, and engages with States and user groups through workshops. The Interagency Committee on Ocean and Coastal Mapping, chaired by NOAA, coordinates with other Federal efforts, international mapping activities, and engages with States and user groups through workshops. NOAA Integrated Mapping Initiative. The Administrator, in consultation with the Committee, must develop and submit a plan for an integrated ocean and coastal mapping initiative within NOAA. The plan should identify all mapping programs, establish priority programs, and update priorities for geographic areas. The plan for an integrated ocean and coastal mapping initiative within NOAA includes surveying, mapping standards, technology development, best practices, resource requirements, and a centralized mechanism for coordination. The plan includes designating data processing centers and a repository for ocean and coastal mapping data within NOAA to streamline services for Federal and State programs. A timetable for implementation and completion is also outlined. The plan includes establishing up to 3 joint ocean and coastal mapping centers, conducting research on mapping technologies, mapping the outer continental shelf, processing non-traditional data, and advancing remote sensing technologies. Advancing remote sensing technologies for mapping essential fish habitat, coral resources, ocean observations, and exploration. Providing graduate education in ocean and coastal mapping sciences for NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps, other agency personnel, and civilians. SEC. 5. INTERAGENCY PROGRAM REPORTING. The Chairman of the Committee must provide a report every 18 months detailing progress in implementing the Act, including an inventory of ocean and coastal mapping data, identification of priority areas for survey coverage, and a resource plan for conducting modern mapping surveys. The report must include progress in implementing the Act, inventory of mapping data, priority survey areas, resource plan, digital map status, products from mapping efforts, data standards, federal mapping efforts, resource requirements, and declassification efforts. The report must include progress in implementing the Act, inventory of mapping data, priority survey areas, resource plan for a digital coast integrated mapping pilot project for the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the status of efforts to coordinate Federal programs. The report must include progress in implementing the Act, inventory of mapping data, priority survey areas, resource plan for a digital coast integrated mapping pilot project for the northern Gulf of Mexico, and efforts to coordinate Federal programs with State and local government programs. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of Appropriations:\n- $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2005\n- $26,000,000 for fiscal year 2006\n- $32,000,000 for fiscal year 2007\n- $38,000,000 for fiscal year 2008\n- $45,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2012\n- Amounts allocated for Joint Ocean and Coastal Mapping Centers:\n  - $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2005\n  - $11,000,000 for fiscal year 2006\n  - $12,000,000 for fiscal year 2007\n  - $13,000,000 for fiscal year 2008\n  - $15,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2012 Authorization of Appropriations:\n- $15,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2012.\n- Interagency Committee may allocate up to $10,000,000 per fiscal year for interagency activities. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include the terms Administrator, Coastal state, Committee, Exclusive economic zone, and Ocean and coastal mapping. The curr_chunk discusses the use of various technologies to map ocean and coastal areas, resources, and sea beds. It also defines the term \"territorial sea\" as the belt of sea measured from the baseline of the United States. The Senate passed S. 2489 on November 16, 2004, establishing a program in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to integrate Federal coastal and ocean mapping activities."
