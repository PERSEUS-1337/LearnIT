    "content": "The \"Uranium Resources Stewardship Act\" or \"URSA\" amends the Mineral Leasing Act to allow leasing of federal lands for uranium mining. Upon enactment of the Uranium Resources Stewardship Act, all Federal lands are permanently withdrawn from uranium entry. After a 2-year period, uranium production on Federal lands is only allowed through leases issued under the Act. The Secretary has the authority to divide lands available for uranium leasing under applicable law. The Uranium Resources Stewardship Act permanently withdraws Federal lands from uranium entry. The Secretary can divide lands for uranium leasing and must ensure fair market value for uranium leases through competitive bidding. The Secretary must determine the fair market value of uranium for leasing, considering public comments. The judgment and comments do not need to be disclosed. Leases on lands under other federal agencies require consent and may have additional conditions. Before issuing any uranium lease, the Secretary must consider the potential impacts on the environment, agriculture, cultural resources, economic activities, and public services in the affected area. Notice of proposed lease sales must be published in a local newspaper for three consecutive weeks, and lands will be leased to the highest responsible qualified bidder through auction. The lease section requires leasing to the highest bidder in units of up to 2,560 acres through oral bidding. Lessees must pay a royalty of at least 12.5% of production value and annual rentals starting at $2.50 per acre for the first five years, increasing to $3 per acre thereafter. The lease term for uranium mining is 10 years initially, with the option to continue as long as uranium is being produced in paying quantities. Revenues from the lease can be used for cleaning up uranium mill tailings and reclaiming abandoned mines on Federal lands. The Secretary may issue exploration licenses for uranium exploration on lands subject to the Act for up to two years with a fee. These licenses do not grant rights to a lease and do not prevent the issuance of uranium leases by the Secretary. No exploration license can be issued on land with an existing uranium lease. An exploration license is required for uranium exploration in each State, limited to specific areas determined by the Secretary. The license must comply with environmental protection conditions and all relevant laws. Violations may result in license revocation. Licensees cannot disturb natural land significantly or sell uranium, but can remove a reasonable amount. The licensee can remove a reasonable amount of uranium for analysis and study under the Secretary's license. They must comply with applicable rules and regulations. Data obtained during exploration must be shared with the Secretary. The Secretary must maintain data confidentiality obtained during exploration until areas are leased or until it won't harm licensee's competitive position. Conducting uranium exploration without a license may result in a fine of up to $1,000 per day. Data collected must be shared with the Secretary and made public promptly. The Uranium Resources Stewardship Act allows mining claim owners to convert their claims to leases by demonstrating discovery within a specified timeframe. No penalty can be imposed without notice and a hearing for violations. The Uranium Resources Stewardship Act allows mining claim owners to convert their claims to leases by demonstrating discovery of uranium. Those who do not convert their claims or cannot demonstrate discovery will have their claims null and void after three years. A royalty of 6.25 percent on the value of uranium produced under the lease is required until ten years after conversion."
