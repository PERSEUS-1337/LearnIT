    "content": "The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides up to 26 weeks of income support for eligible workers who lose their jobs. Benefits may be extended for up to 13 or 20 weeks through the Extended Benefit (EB) program. No state is currently in an active EB period. The UC program is authorized by the Social Security Act of 1935 and provides benefits for federal workers and military servicemembers through separate programs. The Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX) program provides benefits to ex-servicemembers similar to other unemployed workers. Each state determines specific details of UC benefits, resulting in 53 different programs. Eligibility is based on earning qualified wages and employment in covered work over a 12-month base period. States vary in methods used to determine eligibility for UC benefits. The UC program provides benefits to workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Eligibility requirements include being able to work, available for work, and actively seeking work. The program is funded by federal and state taxes, with employers paying a 0.6% effective net FUTA tax on employees' earnings. The UC program is funded by federal and state taxes, with employers paying a 0.6% effective net FUTA tax on employees' earnings. Federal law limits SUTA taxes to fund regular UC benefits and the state share of EB payments, with each state having flexibility in determining its SUTA structure based on UC benefits paid out. Funds from FUTA and SUTA are deposited in the Unemployment Trust Fund. The sequester order under the Budget Control Act of 2011 affected certain types of UI expenditures, with EB and administrative funding subject to reductions. The FY2019 sequestration order mandates a 6.2% reduction in nonexempt nondefense mandatory expenditures. EB expenditures are required to be reduced by 6.2% for weeks of unemployment in FY2019. EB has not been activated in any state during FY2019. The partial government shutdown from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, impacted operations. During the partial government shutdown from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, furloughed federal employees were without pay. States operate the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program based on state laws. Federal employees in furlough status are treated as laid off with an expectation of recall. State laws may exempt them from job search requirements. During the government shutdown, furloughed federal employees may be eligible for regular UC benefits based on state laws. There are proposals to provide UCFE benefits to excepted federal workers working without pay. During the recent government shutdown, furloughed federal employees could receive regular UC benefits based on state laws. There were proposals to pay UCFE benefits to excepted federal workers working without pay. The lapse in federal appropriations from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, may result in UCFE overpayments subject to state UC laws. Recovery of overpayments is determined by state UI agencies, with some states requiring employers to collect overpayment amounts from employees. During a recession, states may face insufficient funds to pay for UC benefits, leading to the need for loans within the UTF framework. If not repaid promptly, states may incur interest charges, and employers may see increased costs. Coordination between Federal and state agencies is necessary to determine actions in line with state UI laws, including collecting overpayment amounts from employees. Federal agencies are advised to provide lists of employees' details for retroactive payments to states. As of January 18, 2019, the U.S. Virgin Islands had an outstanding loan of $68.4 million from federal accounts within the UTF. Fewer than half of states had enough funds to meet the minimally solvent standard. The DOL funded state efforts to address individual reemployment needs of UI claimants through the RESEA program. The DOL administers a RESEA program to ensure claimants comply with eligibility rules, provide reemployment services, and offer labor market information. Section 30206 of P.L. 115-123 outlines state requirements for evidence-based interventions and funding allocation. DOL proposed a methodology for base RESEA funds and outcome payments, seeking feedback from states and the public. The President's budget for FY2020 proposes changes to the UI system, including new standards for state account balances and a benefit entitlement for paid parental leave. Additional integrity measures are also proposed, such as using databases to confirm UC eligibility and offsetting SSDI benefits with UI benefits. States would be required to maintain a minimum level of solvency in their UTF account balances. The President's budget proposal for FY2020 includes requiring states to establish a paid parental leave benefit by 2020, using the UC program as a base. States would need to provide six weeks of benefits for the birth or adoption of a child, with discretion on eligibility and financing. States would also be required to use specific data sources to confirm UC eligibility. The proposal includes new integrity measures for the UC program, such as giving the Secretary of Labor authority to implement corrective actions for poor state performance, allowing states to retain UC overpayments for program integrity, requiring states to deposit penalty and interest payments into a special fund for improving UI administration, and offsetting SSDI benefits for concurrent receipt of UI benefits. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 allowed states to conduct drug testing on UC applicants discharged for unlawful drug use or in occupations that regularly conduct drug testing. DOL implemented new regulations for drug testing UC applicants in suitable work occupations. Congress repealed the UC drug testing rule in response to concerns, and the DOL proposed a new rule to identify occupations that regularly conduct drug testing. This is the first time an agency has attempted to reissue a rule under the CRA after it was disapproved. The DOL proposed a new rule under the CRA allowing states to require drug testing for a larger group of UC applicants. Senator Richard Blumenthal introduced a proposal to amend UCFE law for excepted federal employees during government shutdowns. During a government shutdown, excepted federal workers may be eligible for UCFE benefits without a waiting period. Proposed bills aim to provide UCFE benefits to these workers permanently or until the end of FY2019. H.R. 1117, the Shutdown Fairness Act of 2019, introduced by Representative Katie Hill, would allow excepted federal employees and unpaid military servicemembers to be eligible for UCFE or UCX during FY2019. S. 136 and H.R. 556, the ELEVATE Act, introduced by Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Danny Davis, propose new self-employment and relocation assistance benefits for unemployed workers, providing weekly income replacement for up to 26 weeks. The ELEVATE Act proposes self-employment and relocation assistance benefits for unemployed workers, offering weekly income replacement for up to 26 weeks. Eligible individuals can receive up to $2,000 for relocation expenses, based on family size, and must have a viable business plan approved by relevant authorities. On March 7, 2019, H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019, was introduced by Representative Karen Bass. Section 703 of this bill would allow individuals who quit employment due to sexual harassment, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking to be eligible for unemployment benefits. On March 14, 2019, H.R. 1759, the BRIDGE for Workers Act, was introduced by Representative Stephanie Murphy, extending eligibility for unemployment benefits to more claimants. Both bills were passed by the House in April 2019. The Extended Benefit (EB) program, established by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, provides extended benefits at the state level based on certain economic conditions. EB is triggered when a state's insured unemployment rate reaches specific levels. As of now, EB is not active in any state. States may choose to enact optional thresholds for EB triggers. The Extended Benefit (EB) program provides additional weeks of benefits based on state's unemployment rates. There are two options for triggering EB: one based on IUR and the other based on TUR. EB benefits are not phased out when a state triggers off the program. The benefit amount is equal to the individual's weekly regular UC benefits. FUTA finances half of the EB payments under permanent law. H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019, would allow individuals who quit employment due to sexual harassment, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking to be eligible for UC benefits. H.R. 1759, the BRIDGE for Workers Act, proposes extending eligibility for unemployment benefits to all claimants, including those likely to exhaust benefits. The House passed H.R. 1759 on April 9, 2019, extending eligibility for unemployment benefits to all claimants."
