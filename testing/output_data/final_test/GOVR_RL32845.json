    "content": "The \"Orange Revolution\" in Ukraine has generated interest in Congress and elsewhere, with hopes for comprehensive reforms and Euro-Atlantic integration. Analysts see a new wave of democracy in the post-Soviet region, following events in Georgia and Kyrgyzstan. The 2004 presidential elections were seen as crucial for Ukraine's geopolitical orientation. The 2004 Ukrainian presidential elections were seen as pivotal for the country's future direction, with the choice between closer integration with Euro-Atlantic institutions, democracy, and a free market economy, or alignment with Russian influence and oligarchic control. President Leonid Kuchma and his oligarchic supporters backed Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, while opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko represented pro-reform and pro-Western ideals. International observers criticized the election process for lack of fairness, including media bias and other irregularities. The 2004 Ukrainian presidential elections were marred by bias in favor of Yanukovych, abuse of absentee ballots, and inaccurate voter lists. Yushchenko narrowly won the first round but Yanukovych was declared the winner in the runoff. Yushchenko's supporters protested the fraud in the \"Orange Revolution,\" leading to a repeat runoff on December 26, which Yushchenko won with 51.99% of the vote. After winning the re-vote with 51.99% of the vote, Yushchenko was inaugurated as President of Ukraine on January 23, 2005. Yulia Tymoshenko was approved as Prime Minister by the Ukrainian parliament. Yushchenko accused authorities of trying to poison him during the campaign, falling seriously ill in September 2004. Doctors at Rudolfinerhaus clinic in Austria confirmed that Yushchenko was poisoned with a massive dose of dioxin. Ukrainian officials are investigating the poisoning plot, hinting it may have originated from Russia. President Yushchenko has set domestic priorities, including reducing the \"shadow\" economy by cutting taxes. President Yushchenko's goals include reducing the \"shadow\" economy, maintaining macroeconomic stability, fighting corruption, reforming the judiciary, attracting foreign investment, and prosecuting those guilty of crimes. He does not plan to reverse past privatization deals but will revisit questionable ones. President Yushchenko aims to address questionable privatizations, potentially allowing current owners to keep companies by paying the government the difference in value. The Kryvrizhstal steelworks privatization has been overturned, attracting interest from international steel companies. Prime Minister Tymoshenko is conducting a broad inquiry into hundreds or thousands of firms, causing uncertainty in Ukraine's privatization and government policies. The government's focus on overturning previous privatizations and other policies is unsettling Ukraine's investment climate. Potential investors fear expropriation of their property due to politically-determined rules. Western observers are concerned about the government's emphasis on tax collection over reforms to attract foreign investment. Yushchenko's priority is to strengthen ties with the EU and gain market economy designation. President Yushchenko aims for Ukraine to become a market economy and seeks EU membership. The EU is cautious about Ukrainian membership but offers assistance in various forms. Yushchenko also supports Ukraine's eventual NATO membership. In 2002, NATO and Ukraine developed a NATO-Ukraine Action Plan to outline goals for political and military reform. However, Ukraine's lack of progress on reforms made these efforts ineffective. In 2005, NATO launched an \"Intensified Dialogue\" with Ukraine on membership aspirations without committing to a decision. Ukraine's readiness to join NATO by 2008 is debated due to challenges in reforming its armed forces and broader political and economic tasks. President Yushchenko faces obstacles to Ukraine's NATO membership, including lack of public support and skepticism from government members with ties to Russia. A 2005 poll showed 56.7% opposed to NATO membership, while only 22.4% supported it. An extensive public information effort is needed to address misinformation and Soviet-era prejudices. Some suggest delaying a stronger push for NATO membership until after the March 2006 elections to avoid giving opponents a campaign issue, especially in pro-Russian regions. President Yushchenko aims to address public concerns about Ukraine's potential NATO membership through a national referendum. Despite Russia's support for his opponent, Yushchenko seeks good relations with Russia while prioritizing Euro-Atlantic integration over participation in Russian-led economic and political unions. Ukrainian leaders consider a free trade zone within the Single Economic Space but not a customs or currency union. Russian observers are wary of Ukraine's shift towards Europe and reprivatization plans. Ukraine's new European orientation and reprivatization plans raise concerns about bilateral economic ties with Russia. The majority of Ukraine's oil and natural gas supplies come from Russia, and Russia is also Ukraine's largest export market. There is a joint consortium between Russia and Ukraine for gas supply to Western Europe, but Ukraine is looking to involve Western European firms as well. Ukrainian officials assure Russia that NATO aspirations will not impact the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Ukraine. Possible areas of controversy between Moscow and Kiev could arise regarding policy towards post-Soviet countries. Possible areas of controversy between Moscow and Kiev could be policy toward post-Soviet countries, particularly in relation to Ukraine's potential role in the GUAM group. These countries share a desire to maintain their sovereignty, which they sometimes see as threatened by Russia. One area of cooperation could be the diversification of energy sources and pipelines. Ukraine is considering extending an oil pipeline to Poland, which could transport Caspian Sea oil to Western Europe. The Odesa-Brody pipeline in Ukraine currently runs in reverse mode, transporting Russian oil to the Mediterranean Sea. The new government faces challenges in restoring its original direction due to a lack of oil supplies and Russian pressure. Ukraine supports Moldova's desire to reintegrate Transnistria, offering a peace plan with internationally monitored elections and autonomy within Moldova. Moldova welcomed the initiative but reacted cautiously to some details. Ukraine supports Moldova's desire to reintegrate Transnistria, offering a peace plan with internationally monitored elections and autonomy within Moldova. Kiev welcomes the initiative but reacts cautiously to some details and omissions, such as the lack of mention of a Russian troop withdrawal from Moldova. There are concerns about cracking down on illegal trade between Ukraine and Transnistria, which could pressure Transnistria's leadership and potentially lead to a negotiated settlement. Russia may see Ukraine's stance as undermining Moscow's influence in Transnistria. Additionally, there are fears among Russian observers that Ukraine may try to export its democratic revolution to other countries in the region, including Belarus and Russia. Ukrainian leaders deny such intentions, but Ukrainian NGOs, like the youth group \"Pora,\" have expressed such goals. The successful democratic revolution in Ukraine could inspire other CIS countries, leading to fears of a \"color revolution\" in Belarus. Lukashenko intensifies crackdown on opponents and media to prevent democratic ideas from spreading. Ukraine's new leadership, with competent and motivated figures, aims to reform the country and move closer to the West. Yushchenko enjoys strong public support, while former regime supporters are aligning with the new regime. The opposition in Ukraine lacks cohesion and principles, with some former regime supporters aligning with the new leadership. The country benefits from goodwill from the US and Western countries, but faces challenges in rooting out corruption and potential temptation for new leaders to engage in corrupt practices. There is concern about businessmen from the \"Orange Revolution\" becoming new oligarchs and possible power struggles. Yushchenko forms pro-presidential bloc People's Union-Our Ukraine, in coalition with other groups. Reforms hindered by internal coalition conflicts, impacting government policies and economic control. Concerns arise over potential power struggles between \"old\" and \"new\" oligarchs in Ukraine. Key legislation for Ukraine's admission to the World Trade Organization has been voted down by parliament, jeopardizing President Yushchenko's goal of joining the WTO in 2005. Observers criticize Yushchenko for not exerting consistent discipline and leadership over the government. Regional differences in Ukraine also pose challenges. The new government in Ukraine faces challenges in gaining support in eastern and southern regions due to previous propaganda. They have replaced loyalists of the old regime and arrested figures for various crimes. The new government in Ukraine is facing challenges in gaining support in eastern and southern regions due to previous propaganda. Efforts to characterize actions as political repression have failed, with more support for the government in western Ukraine than in the east. In a June 2005 poll, strong support for President Yushchenko was higher in western Ukraine compared to eastern Ukraine. The new government in Ukraine faces challenges in gaining support in eastern and southern regions due to fears of economic resource transfer and language pressure. Constitutional changes approved in December 2004 will reduce presidential powers, with potential impact in September 2005 or January 2006. Ukrainian officials have assured no forced use of the Ukrainian language in eastern Ukraine. The Cabinet of Ministers will be the supreme executive body in Ukraine under the approved constitutional changes. The President will nominate key ministers, subject to parliament approval. Legal challenges may arise, but if the reforms take effect, the March 2006 parliamentary elections will be crucial. Ukraine may face international obstacles, particularly from Russia, which could exploit Ukraine's energy dependence. Ukraine's heavy dependence on Russian energy is somewhat limited by its control of main pipelines for Russian energy exports to Western Europe. Recent incidents suggest Russia may be pressuring Kiev through energy tactics. In April 2005, gasoline prices surged in Ukraine, leading to accusations against Russian energy firms. President Yushchenko intervened to resolve the issue after Prime Minister Tymoshenko imposed price controls and called for more government control in the energy sector. Gazprom also demanded significant price hikes for natural gas. The Russian natural gas giant, Gazprom, has called for large price increases in gas supplied to Ukraine in 2006, accusing Ukraine of gas theft. Ukraine is diversifying its oil and gas supplies through deals with other countries. Russia may support pro-Russian opposition in Ukraine, but past attempts to exploit regional differences have not succeeded. Western assistance is crucial for Ukraine's reform efforts. One indicator of success for Ukraine will be a substantial increase in foreign investment, showing progress in fighting corruption and enforcing the rule of law. Improved living standards and decreased poverty are important for the majority of Ukraine's population. International observers will monitor the March 2006 parliamentary election campaign for signs of free and fair elections. Ukraine's foreign policy success in the longer term is also crucial. In the longer term, Ukraine's foreign policy success may be measured by signals from the EU and NATO regarding possible membership. However, success depends on various factors including intra-EU politics, trans-Atlantic ties, and perceptions of Russia's future. Maintaining good relations with Moscow is emphasized by France, Germany, and other EU countries for regional stability and economic ties. Possible EU membership for Ukraine presents challenges for the EU, which is already struggling to incorporate new members. Many EU countries, including Poland and the Baltic states, aim to counterbalance Russia and stabilize their eastern borders by incorporating Ukraine into the EU. If Ukraine faces obstacles in joining the EU, it may turn to NATO for integration. The US supported Ukraine's \"Orange Revolution\" and provided assistance to monitor elections. President Bush showed support for the new leadership in Ukraine. President Bush and other NATO leaders met President Yushchenko at a NATO summit on February 22, 2005. Yushchenko visited the United States from April 4-7, meeting with President Bush and Secretary of State Rice. They signed a joint statement supporting Ukraine's democratic revolution and its integration into European and Euro-Atlantic institutions. The US pledged assistance for Ukraine to join the WTO in 2005 and supported its NATO aspirations. The US supports Ukraine's NATO aspirations and calls for ending the Jackson-Vanik amendment. They will establish an energy dialogue and cooperate on fighting terrorism and weapons proliferation. The US pledges to help Ukraine fight AIDS/HIV and provide $45 million to the Chernobyl Shelter Fund. Ukraine will receive $93.5 million in US aid in FY2005 and $115.9 million in FY2006. The US provided $115.9 million in aid for Ukraine in FY2006, with an additional $60 million sought for reform efforts. Aid focuses on anti-corruption, rule of law, media development, and democracy-building programs. The US aims to increase exchange programs and monitor issues like weapons proliferation and human trafficking. Arms trafficking scandals during the Kuchma era damaged Ukraine's reputation internationally. The Yushchenko government approved the sale of banned radar systems to Iraq and is investigating other arms sales, including nuclear-capable missiles to Iran and China. The US is leading efforts to help Ukraine destroy outdated weapons. Ukraine is designated as a \"Tier 2\" country for human trafficking, making significant efforts to combat it but facing challenges like government corruption. The report highlights Ukraine's efforts to combat human trafficking, with recommendations to improve victim protection and legal definitions. US policymakers are concerned about Ukraine's democratic shortcomings, particularly regarding troop withdrawal from Iraq. President Yushchenko confirmed the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from Iraq after consultation with coalition members and the Iraqi government. Over 130 troops were withdrawn in March 2005, with more to follow by the end of the year. The Administration downplayed the significance of the withdrawal, with President Bush acknowledging Yushchenko's campaign promise fulfillment. President Bush acknowledged President Yushchenko's fulfillment of a campaign promise to withdraw Ukrainian troops from Iraq. The United States may consider providing additional support to Ukraine, such as helping it obtain loans for reform plans and enhancing trade relations. Analysts suggest Ukraine could receive funding under the Millennium Challenge Account and that Western countries should hold an aid donor conference to coordinate assistance. The United States and EU should provide tailored assistance to Ukraine to support democratic forces before the 2006 parliamentary elections. There are concerns about the perceived drift in Ukraine's reform process, with suggestions for a more direct approach to push reforms forward. Additionally, there is a debate on whether the United States should hold an aid donor conference this year to coordinate assistance efforts. The United States is cautious about Ukraine's NATO membership, urging them to focus on implementing reforms before joining. President Bush supports Ukraine's NATO aspirations but notes that membership is not guaranteed. The political crisis in Ukraine also impacts the US-Russia relationship. The political crisis in Ukraine has strained the US-Russia relationship, with Russian observers seeing it as a threat to their interests. The US emphasizes promoting democracy but Russian elites fear it could undermine their power. The 108th Congress supported free and fair elections in Ukraine. The 108th Congress supported free and fair elections in Ukraine by passing resolutions urging the Administration to warn Ukraine of consequences for electoral fraud. The resolutions pledged Congress's support for Ukraine's democracy and called for the President to ensure a fair election. The Senate passed S.Res. 473 before the second round of the election, urging the Administration to impose sanctions against election fraud in Ukraine. Senator Richard Lugar monitored the runoff and warned President Kuchma of consequences for a \"tarnished election.\" The 109th Congress passed resolutions congratulating Ukraine for its commitment to democracy and peaceful resolution of political crisis, pledging U.S. help for democracy and economic development. Further legislation could be considered if the \"Orange Revolution\" progresses. The \"Orange Revolution\" progress may lead to further legislation on Ukraine, potentially ending the Jackson-Vanik amendment. This amendment restricts PNTR status for countries with non-market economies that limit emigration. Other factors affecting NTR status include efforts against anti-Semitism and returning property to Jewish groups. Intellectual property rights, high agricultural tariffs, and trade disputes may also impact PNTR and U.S. support for Ukraine's WTO membership. Several bills have been introduced to grant Ukraine PNTR status, including H.R. 1053, H.R. 885, and S. 410. These bills aim to terminate the Jackson-Vanik amendment for Ukraine and establish permanent normal trade relations. Additionally, S. 46 and H.R. 1170 propose safeguard measures against import surges from Ukraine and express concerns about a U.S.-Ukrainian bilateral agreement on WTO accession. The House approved reducing U.S. aid to Ukraine from $60 million to $33.7 million in the Iraq/Afghanistan supplemental appropriations bill. The funding is intended to support the Yushchenko government and upcoming parliamentary elections, with criticism for containing non-emergency items. The Senate restored $60 million for Ukraine in the foreign aid appropriations bill, signed by President Bush on May 11, 2005. The House passed a bill providing $477 million for former Soviet countries, $5 million below the President's request. H.Res. 44 calls for a staff exchange program between the House of Representatives and the Ukrainian parliament."
