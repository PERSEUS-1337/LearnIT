    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Media Marketing Accountability Act of 2001\". Children have easy access to various media and entertainment options at home, with the majority having a VCR, CD player, and either a video game console or personal computer. They spend a significant amount of time watching movies, playing video games, and listening to music. For example, children ages 8 through 13 spend about 3 hours per week in a movie theater and 62 percent of children ages 9 through 17 watch video tapes for an average of 52 minutes per day. Additionally, 82 percent of children play video games for an average of 33 minutes per day, and teenagers ages 14 through 18 listen to music. Teenagers aged 14-18 spend approximately 2.5 hours daily listening to music. They also spend millions annually on entertainment products like movies, music, and video games, making them a valuable demographic. Studies show a strong link between exposure to media violence and aggressive behavior, as well as desensitization to violence in society. The Federal Trade Commission reported that industries target children under 17 in their marketing efforts. The Federal Trade Commission found that industries target children under age 17 in marketing adult-rated products. 80% of R-rated movies and all music recordings with explicit content labels were aimed at children under 17. The Federal Trade Commission found that 70 percent of Mature-rated video games were targeted at children under 17, with 51 percent explicitly mentioning them as the target audience. 91 percent of video game manufacturers had identified children under 17 as the core audience. The Commission called for industries to adopt policies prohibiting these practices and enforce them with sanctions. Only the video game industry has taken steps to address this issue. The Federal Trade Commission found that the video game industry has agreed to adopt a marketing code to address the targeting of children with adult-rated products. Despite some improvements, companies in all three industries still market adult-rated products to children. Legislation is needed to prohibit targeting children in advertising and marketing of adult-rated products. Prohibition on targeted marketing of adult-rated media to children as unfair or deceptive practice. The targeted advertising or marketing of adult-rated media to minors is considered deceptive and unlawful under the Federal Trade Commission Act. This includes intentional targeting of minors or presenting to an audience where a substantial proportion is minors. SEC. 102. SAFE HARBOR. In General, advertising to minors of adult-rated media is not considered targeted marketing if the producer follows a self-regulatory system with specific criteria set by the FTC. This system includes age-based ratings and prohibitions on targeted advertising for adult-rated products. The FTC sets criteria for producers to follow, including prohibitions on targeted advertising to minors and policies to restrict access to adult-rated products. Sanctions are in place for non-compliance to ensure adherence to these regulations. The Federal Trade Commission will define deceptive acts or practices and establish criteria for determining if an audience includes a substantial number of minors. Regulations may also include measures to prevent deceptive practices. SEC. 104. The Federal Trade Commission will prescribe rules under sections 102 and 103 within 12 months. The Federal Trade Commission enforces this title under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission has the authority to prevent violations of section 101 and rules under section 103, with the same powers as under the FTC Act. Rules under section 103 are treated as rules under the FTC Act, and violations are treated accordingly. Violations of section 101 or rules under section 103 are treated as unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Penalties and privileges for violators are in accordance with the FTC Act. This title does not limit the Commission's authority under other laws. SEC. 106. DEFINITIONS.
