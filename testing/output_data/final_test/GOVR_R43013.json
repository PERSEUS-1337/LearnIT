    "content": "Congress is concerned about the timely implementation of regulatory systems by federal agencies, as delays can impact effectiveness and create uncertainty for regulated entities. Courts have addressed agency delay, noting that it can erode public confidence and disrupt future plans. The Administrative Procedure Act sets a general time restraint on agencies to act within a \"reasonable time.\" When there is no hard deadline imposed on an agency, courts are often reluctant to compel action within a reasonable time. Congress can establish statutory deadlines for agencies to act promptly. Judicial remedies for delayed agency actions are limited, usually involving ordering the agency to act by a specific deadline. The APA does not set concrete time limits for agency actions but allows for compelling agency action if unreasonably delayed. Courts can hear claims for unreasonable delay even if the agency has not taken final action. Congress can establish statutory deadlines for agencies to act promptly. The APA allows for compelling agency action if unreasonably delayed, even without final agency action. Courts can hear claims of unreasonable delay, and Congress can establish statutory deadlines for prompt agency action. The APA allows claims for unreasonable delay against agencies for actions they are legally obligated to take. The Supreme Court has specified that a claim can only proceed if an agency fails to take a required action. If an action is within agency discretion by law, no claim can be made for unreasonable delay. Judicial remedies are limited when determining unreasonable delay. When a court finds an unreasonable delay, it can order an agency to act promptly but cannot dictate the agency's decision. Regulations issued after a deadline still hold legal weight, and a plaintiff cannot challenge their validity based on tardiness. Courts have limited remedies for agency delays, such as imposing deadlines or ordering prompt action. They may also require agencies to report progress regularly until the action is completed. Courts fashion remedies for agency delays, avoiding compelling action to respect agency priorities. The Blackletter Statement of Federal Administrative Law states that delays without statutory deadlines may not be unlawful unless unreasonable, considering agency priorities and legislative intent. Courts are deferential in such challenges. Courts are deferential to agencies' allocation of resources and consider agency delays in light of legislative intent. The D.C. Circuit established guidelines in TRAC v. FCC for determining if agency delay warrants mandamus, including factors like the \"rule of reason\" for decision-making time and statutory timetables. The TRAC factors provide guidelines for determining if agency delay warrants mandamus, considering factors like the \"rule of reason\" for decision-making time and statutory timetables. Mandamus is seen as a drastic remedy, suitable only in extraordinary situations, and courts may issue it after several years of agency delay in adjudication. The D.C. Circuit has no set rule on how long is too long to wait for agency action, making it difficult to predict court rulings on unreasonable delay. Court decisions vary on what constitutes reasonable delay, with cases showing delays of 10 years deemed reasonable in one instance and 8 years unreasonable in another. Each claim of agency delay is determined on a case-by-case basis. The court found that the FCC unreasonably delayed in determining whether AT&T should reimburse ratepayers for alleged overcharges. Despite the five-year proceeding, the court did not grant mandamus due to the mere economic interests involved. Instead, the FCC was required to provide an anticipated resolution date, with the court maintaining jurisdiction to ensure timely action. In a similar case, a court issued a writ of mandamus for an eight-year adjudication on railroad rates, requiring a final agency order within sixty days. In Kokajko v. FERC, the court dismissed a claim despite legislative history requiring speedy consideration for rate proceedings. The court found that a five-year delay was not unreasonable for an economic interest case, but stated that it was approaching unreasonableness. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found that a four and one-half year delay in approving a water pipeline construction project was not unreasonable, despite concerns for human health and welfare. The court declined to compel immediate agency action based on assurances from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that the project was a high priority. Similarly, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld a ten-year delay by the Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) on an application for permanent residence, noting that the application received considerable attention from the agency. The court found that delays in reaching a final determination on a proceeding within 10 years were not unreasonable, partially caused by changes in legislation. Courts apply TRAC factors to determine if delays in rulemaking are unreasonable. In one case, a three-year delay by the EPA in regulating strip mines under the Clean Air Act was deemed reasonable. The court found that delays in reaching a final determination on a proceeding within 10 years were not unreasonable, partially caused by changes in legislation. In a case regarding strip mines under the Clean Air Act, the court noted that agency control over the timetable of rulemaking procedures is entitled to deference. The court considered the progress made by the agency in holding public meetings, accepting comments, and issuing reports on the issue. Ultimately, the court deemed a three-year delay in agency deliberation as reasonable given the complexity and controversial nature of the proposal. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) delay in finalizing safety standards for ethylene oxide (EtO) and cadmium exposure was deemed unreasonable by the court. Emphasizing the importance of human health, the court ordered OSHA to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking within thirty days and expected a final rule within a year. The court also found a six-year delay in cadmium exposure standards to be unreasonable, despite the agency acknowledging the need for a new standard. The court found OSHA's delay in finalizing safety standards for ethylene oxide and cadmium exposure unreasonable, ordering the agency to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking within thirty days and a final rule within a year. The court warned against further postponements, compelling OSHA to promulgate a final standard within seven months. This highlights the challenge of predicting when a court will compel agency action without statutory deadlines. The Supreme Court in Norton v. SUWA stated that courts can compel agencies to act within a certain time period. Some courts distinguish between actions unlawfully withheld and unreasonably delayed, with missed statutory deadlines prompting court-mandated agency action. The D.C. Circuit applies the TRAC test to decide on compelling agency action despite statutory deadlines. In Forrest Guardians v. Babbitt, the Tenth Circuit also addressed compelling agency action. In Forrest Guardians v. Babbitt, the Tenth Circuit ruled that agencies must act by statutory deadlines, and courts can compel them to do so. The court emphasized that failure to meet specific deadlines constitutes unlawfully withheld action, mandating agency compliance without discretion. The Ninth Circuit has held that agencies must act by statutory deadlines, and courts can compel them to do so. In Biodiversity Legal Foundation v. Badgley, the court issued an injunction to require the Fish and Wildlife Service to comply with a deadline imposed by the Endangered Species Act, stating that no balancing of factors is required or permitted when a specific deadline is provided by Congress. The Ninth Circuit has ruled that agencies must meet statutory deadlines, and courts can compel them to do so. In contrast, other courts do not strictly adhere to this principle, viewing statutory deadlines as just one factor in determining unreasonable delay under the TRAC test. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia criticized the Tenth Circuit's approach in a specific case, emphasizing that courts still have discretion in deciding whether to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed. The court emphasized that courts retain discretion in deciding whether to issue a writ of mandamus or injunction against an agency, citing Section 702 of the APA. It stated that statutory deadlines alone do not justify judicial intervention, as seen in the case of the FDA missing a deadline for reviewing generic drug applications. The court declined to grant mandamus relief to Barr Laboratories, despite the FDA's significant delay in reviewing their application. The court considered various factors and concluded that prioritizing one manufacturer's case would not align with Congress's goal of timely processing all applications. The court did not grant mandamus relief to Barr Laboratories despite the FDA's delay in reviewing their application. The D.C. Circuit found a nine-year delay by the Coast Guard in promulgating oil tanker standards unreasonable and ordered prompt action, applying the TRAC factors to determine unreasonable delays in agency actions. The D.C. Circuit acknowledges the lack of a clear standard for determining unreasonable agency delays. Statutory deadlines and public health or safety concerns are key factors in assessing delays. Congress often pushes agencies to resolve issues quickly, with statutory deadlines being a powerful tool. Rulemakings with imposed deadlines are completed faster on average. However, tight deadlines can lead to hasty agency actions and limit public participation. Congress can use \"hammer\" provisions to impose consequences on agencies for missing statutory deadlines in rulemaking, forcing them to act quickly. These provisions vary in their consequences, such as establishing a regulatory scheme or withholding funding until rules are promulgated. However, they can be challenging for Congress to establish. Congress can use \"hammer\" provisions to impose consequences on agencies for missing statutory deadlines in rulemaking, forcing them to act quickly. Subject matter expertise may be necessary to establish a statutorily imposed regulatory scheme. Congress also has the power to restrict appropriations or exert political pressure on agencies to act promptly. Congressional committees can hold oversight hearings and individual members can send letters to pressure agencies. Ultimately, courts will determine if an action has been unreasonably delayed. Congress can establish priorities for federal agencies' agendas using tools like \"hammer\" provisions to enforce statutory deadlines, with courts having the final say on unreasonable delays."
