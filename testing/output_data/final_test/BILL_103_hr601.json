    "content": "The Act titled \"Energy Price and Supply Information Act of 1993\" requires a survey of fuel prices and inventories. The Energy Information Administration conducts surveys on wholesale and retail prices, inventory levels of home heating fuel, natural gas prices, and automotive fuel prices. The Energy Information Administration conducts weekly surveys on wholesale prices, inventory levels, and primary inventory levels of automotive fuel without disclosing company names. The surveys for home heating fuel and natural gas are conducted and published weekly during each winter heating season, while automotive fuel surveys are conducted and published weekly throughout the year starting six months after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3. RECOMMENDED ADEQUATE INVENTORY LEVELS. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant agencies, establishes recommended inventory levels for home heating fuel, natural gas, and automotive fuel to prevent supply disruptions and price increases. Levels are set nationally, by state, and by PADD for home heating fuel before each winter season. For natural gas, inventory levels are set nationally for underground storage before each winter heating season. For automotive fuel, levels are established nationally and by PADD for primary and secondary inventories every 6 months after the enactment of the Act. Notification of inventory levels is required. The Secretary must notify Congress, the President, and State energy offices about home heating fuel and natural gas inventory levels before October 1 each year. If inventories fall below recommended levels during the winter heating season, the Secretary will notify and make recommendations for actions. The Secretary will notify Congress, the President, and State energy offices if automotive fuel inventories fall below recommended levels, making recommendations for legislative and administrative actions to restore inventories. The Secretary will conduct a study on interruptible natural gas contracts' impact on home heating fuel supply during the 1989-1990 winter season. A report with recommendations on fuel storage requirements and other relevant matters will be issued within 6 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 6.
