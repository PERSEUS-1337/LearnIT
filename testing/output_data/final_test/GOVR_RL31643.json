It aims to increase knowledge about languages and cultures of foreign nations, especially those of national security concern. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) aims to enhance the diversity and quality of teaching and learning in foreign language and area studies critical to national security. It also expands the pool of applicants for government agencies, increases knowledge base for citizens and government employees, and advocates for international education. Congressional interest in NSEP has grown since 9/11, with bills passed to alter funding and administration. The Intelligence Community Scholarship Program (ICSP) was created under the intelligence reform bill to further support these goals. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) aims to enhance foreign language and area studies critical to national security. It includes a service requirement for aid recipients and is administered by the Department of Defense. The program supports international travel for American undergraduate students. The NSEP pilot program, known as the National Flagship Language Initiative, provides three types of assistance: scholarships for undergraduate students to study in critical foreign countries, grants to institutions for programs in critical language and area studies, and fellowships for graduate students in critical foreign language disciplines. The NSEA aims to allocate one-third of grants for each type of aid annually. The National Security Education Board (NSEB) determines fund allocations and criteria for awards. Only US citizens are eligible based on merit and diversity. Language skills are assessed before and after instruction. Recipients can attend the Defense Language Institute. Financial need is not a factor in selection but influences grant levels. The National Security Education Board (NSEB) determines fund allocations and criteria for awards for scholarship and fellowship recipients. Undergraduate students may receive up to two scholarships, while graduate students may receive grants for up to six semesters. The number of students receiving scholarships and fellowships has increased over the years, with recipients traveling to various countries for study. The National Security Education Program (NESP) supports study in over 100 countries, with popular destinations being Russia, China, Japan, Egypt, and Brazil for undergraduates, and also Vietnam and Thailand for graduate students. NESP funds study in various languages including Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish, as well as less commonly taught languages like Zulu, Tibetan, and Mongolian. Funding ranges for individual grants are detailed in Table 1. Institutional Grants under the National Security Education Program (NESP) shifted focus in 2003 to the National Flagship Language Initiative, moving away from supporting establishment of international education programs. This change was piloted in 2002 and authorized by the 107th Congress. The National Flagship Language Initiative, established by the 107th Congress, provides grants to develop advanced foreign language study programs for national security. The program aims to increase the number of students reaching professional language competency levels, with special consideration for federal employees. Grant competitions were not held for FY2003 or announced for FY2004. This initiative addresses perceived weaknesses in previous institutional grant programs under the National Security Education Program. The National Flagship Language Initiative provides grants for advanced foreign language study programs for national security. The program aims to increase student competency levels, with a focus on federal employees. The NSEP is administered by the Department of Defense's National Defense University under the guidance of a 12-member National Security Education Board. The National Security Education Board oversees the NSEP program, which aims to enhance foreign language proficiency for national security purposes. The Board develops criteria for awards, reviews program administration, and identifies critical areas for support based on federal government needs and language expertise. The NSEP program is largely administered through non-governmental organizations. The NSEP program is administered through non-governmental organizations like IIE, AED, and the National Foreign Language Center. Recipients of NSEP fellowships and scholarships must seek federal employment in a national security position for a limited time. Recipients of NSEP fellowships and scholarships must fulfill a service requirement in a national security position or in higher education related to their field of study. Failure to meet the requirement results in repayment of the grant plus interest. The service period is determined by the NSEB, typically equal to the length of educational aid received. The original NSEA allowed flexibility in meeting the service obligation through employment in any Federal agency. Approximately 73% of scholarship and fellowship recipients have met the service requirement through federal employment, while 27% have done so through employment in higher education. The pattern of service differs between undergraduate scholarship recipients (93% through federal employment) and graduate fellowship recipients (50% through federal employment). Funding for the program comes from the National Security Education Trust Fund. Funding for the program is provided from the National Security Education Trust Fund (NSETF) in the U.S. Treasury. Money can be used for grants and administrative costs as specified in legislation. An initial $150 million was appropriated for the Fund in FY1992. Legislation in the 104th Congress aimed to eliminate the program and return the funds to the Treasury, but the final version (P.L.104-6) retained half of the original appropriation. The NSETF funds have fluctuated over the years, with expenditures exceeding income leading to a decline in the Fund balance. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY2003 allocated $8 million from the NSETF, consistent with previous years. Table 2 displays annual appropriations from FY1995-2004 and projected Fund balances for FY2002-2004. P.L. 107-306 mandates the Secretary of Defense's responsibilities. P.L. 107-306 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the effectiveness of the NSEP and the possibility of converting to annual appropriations. It also authorizes funding for a National Flagship Language Initiative and a report on establishing a Civilian Linguist Reserve Corps. The report discusses issues with the National Security Education Program (NSEP) funding, which was originally intended to be supported by a trust fund but has seen reduced earnings in recent years due to legislative rescissions and declining interest rates. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) trust fund has seen declining earnings of $2-3 million annually, much lower than the $8 million in annual appropriations. The fund's balance is decreasing, and if trends continue, it will be depleted by FY2006. Options include increasing the fund size significantly or shifting to annual appropriations. There is a need to ensure aid awards target \"critical\" foreign languages, regions, and disciplines. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) identifies \"critical\" foreign languages, regions, and disciplines important for national security. The NSEB conducts an annual survey to determine these critical areas, including both frequently taught languages like Spanish and infrequently taught ones like Farsi. Scholarship and fellowship awards focus on a subset of these languages, regions, and disciplines. The National Flagship Language Initiative, authorized by P.L. 107-306, aims to identify critical languages for institutional grants starting in 2003. Efforts are focused on languages, regions, and disciplines not commonly taught in American institutions, aligning with national security interests. The NSEP's emphasis on meeting national security needs and its service requirement for aid recipients set it apart from other federal language and area studies programs. The NSEP aims to increase understanding and availability of advanced instruction in less commonly taught world languages and regions. Coordination with other federal programs like ED's Title VI and Fulbright-Hays Act can enhance efficiency in federal aid funds. However, there is a need for statutory provision for NSEP officials to have representation on decision-making bodies for related programs administered by other federal agencies. The NSEP institutional grants, including the National Flagship Language Initiative, are similar to programs under the Higher Education Act (HEA) Title VI. Both provide grants to US institutions to enhance foreign language instruction, with a focus on less commonly taught languages and regions. The NSEP is restructuring its grants to emphasize critical languages and regions, aiming to avoid duplication with other federal programs like Title VI. The NSEP institutional grants aim to complement federal programs like HEA Title VI by focusing on critical languages and regions. There is a suggestion to consolidate NSEP grants with Title VI programs to reduce administrative costs and improve coordination. Additionally, there are proposals to transfer administrative responsibility for NSEP from the Secretary of Defense to the Director of Central Intelligence. Shifting responsibility for the NSEP to the Director of Central Intelligence or the Secretary of Education could improve program coordination. There are debates on whether federal funds should prioritize foreign travel grants for undergraduate students under the NSEA. Legislation in the 107th Congress considered eliminating the NSEP's undergraduate scholarship program in favor of graduate fellowships and institutional grants. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report states that the graduate program of the NSEP is more effective in achieving its goals compared to the undergraduate program. Graduate students are more likely to pursue careers in national security positions, while the undergraduate program does not guarantee federal employment. There is ongoing debate about the future of undergraduate scholarships in the NSEP. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report suggests that the NSEP should focus on graduate students for federal employment in national security positions due to their higher language proficiency. Supporters of the undergraduate program argue it offers unique opportunities for foreign travel. The Gilman International Scholarship Program supports foreign travel opportunities for U.S. undergraduate students, not focused on critical foreign languages or world regions. Data shows that undergraduate scholarship recipients are more likely to take federal positions compared to graduate fellowship recipients. Graduate fellowship recipients are more likely to meet their service requirement by taking positions in higher education. Some members of the U.S. academic community have expressed concern about the linkages between the NSEP program and national security agencies, due to the service requirement and other connections with the DOD and CIA. The NSEA prohibits recipients from undertaking activities for federal agencies as a condition for assistance. The service requirement is broadly interpreted and typically lasts a few months to two years. Data shows that most recipients fulfill their service requirement by working in federal agencies. Recipients of the NSEA have met their service requirement by taking positions outside of national security agencies like the DOD and CIA. Some have taken positions in higher education institutions, while others have expressed concerns about safety and cooperation if the program is linked to U.S. intelligence and defense agencies. Critics have expressed concerns about the NSEP's linkages to national security agencies, particularly focusing on institutional grant programs like the National Flagship Language Initiative. The Middle East Studies Association has reservations about the NSEP's administration being located in the Department of Defense and the involvement of the CIA on the overseeing board. Maintaining administrative independence is deemed essential. The CIA's involvement in overseeing the NSEP raises concerns about the proposed university programs linking students to Defense Department funding. This government-funded program may hinder academic collaboration and give the impression of direct involvement in government activities, potentially undermining research efforts. The curr_chunk discusses concerns about the NFLI-Pas program and urges funding for second-language acquisition to be administered through the Department of Education. Supporters argue that the service requirement and NSEP linkages with national security agencies align with the program's primary purposes. The NSEA focuses on meeting national security needs, expanding the pool of applicants for government agencies, and promoting foreign language and area studies critical to the nation's interests. Supporters argue that these purposes align with the program's linkages to national security agencies. The NSEP's purpose is to increase individuals with specialized language skills in national security positions. The service requirement may be tightened by lengthening the required period of service or narrowing the variety of federal agencies where the requirement can be met."
