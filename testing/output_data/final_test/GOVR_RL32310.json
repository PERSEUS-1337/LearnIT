    "content": "The President signed two bills into law in 2004 related to military construction and defense authorization. The Department of Defense manages a vast infrastructure covering millions of acres and worth billions of dollars, with millions of personnel working on military installations. The military construction appropriations bill funds projects to enhance and maintain infrastructure on Department of Defense land in the US and foreign countries. It also covers defense-wide construction, NATO Security Investment Program, military family housing, and Base Realignment and Closure account for base realignment and closure costs. The military construction appropriations bill funds projects for infrastructure on Department of Defense land, including new facilities and environmental cleanup. Other national security appropriation legislation includes the national defense appropriations bill and the energy and water development appropriations bill. Supplemental appropriations bills may be passed for additional Department of Defense funding. The Department of Defense requires specific authorization and appropriations bills for funding. The Military Construction Appropriations Act is for military construction, while the National Defense Appropriations Act covers other defense appropriations. Major debates on defense policy and funding are associated with these bills. The military construction appropriations bill dates back to the late 1950s and was established due to the surge in military construction during the Korean War. The Soviet Union threat led to continuous high spending on military infrastructure, prompting the creation of separate military construction subcommittees and bills. The first stand-alone military construction bill was written for FY1959 (P.L. 85-852). The military construction appropriations bill for FY1959 (P.L. 85-852) is not the sole source of funds for defense agencies. Other funding sources include national defense appropriations for minor construction and property maintenance. Special accounts within the military construction appropriation fund functions ancillary to building military infrastructure. Most congressional appropriations must be obligated in the same fiscal year. The military construction appropriations bill allows funds to be obligated for up to five fiscal years, unlike most congressional appropriations which must be obligated in the same fiscal year. The process for enacting the FY2005 military construction appropriations begins with the President's budget delivery to Congress in early February. Key legislative steps are outlined in Table 1, which will be updated as the appropriation process progresses. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction held nine hearings between February 25 and June 22, 2004, covering various topics related to military construction programs. The subcommittee reported its bill to the full committee on July 6, and the full committee reported its mark on H.R. 4837 on July 15, 2004. H.R. 4837 was introduced on the floor of the House on July 21, with debate focusing on the legislation. H.R. 4837 was introduced in the House on July 21, with debate on Section 129 regarding military housing privatization budget authority. A separate bill, H.R. 4879, incorporating Section 129 language, passed with a large majority. On July 22, H.R. 4837 was revisited, with Mr. Nussle raising a point of order against the measure. The House debated Section 129 of H.R. 4837, which sought to change existing law. A point of order was sustained, striking Section 129 from the bill. Mr. Obey attempted to recommit the bill with instructions to increase military housing privatization budget authority, but his motion failed. The bill was eventually passed with amendments. The House agreed to disagree with an amendment and appointed conferees. The Senate Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee held hearings on construction projects and reported its mark on S. 2674. Senator Hutchison offered two amendments on September 15. The Senate passed amendments to allocate additional funds for the Commission on Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure and to assess the impact on the military family housing program. The Senate incorporated S. 2674 into H.R. 4837 and passed the amended bill by a recorded vote. Senate conferees were appointed for further action. On September 22, 2004, Senate and House conferees added Division B and Division C to the bill. The conference report was filed on October 9, and the House agreed by a vote of 374-0-58. The Senate agreed by Voice Vote on October 11, and the bill was signed by the President on October 13, 2004. The bill (P.L.108-324) regarding military construction was signed by the President on October 13, 2004. Key issues discussed include overall funding levels, realignment of overseas bases, base closure, and perchlorate groundwater contamination remediation. The FY2005 budget requested $9.6 billion in new budget authority, with Active Component military construction below the FY2004 levels. Requests for Reserve Components are also below the previous year's amounts. The Reserve Components, excluding the Air Force Reserve, have decreased below last year's enacted amounts, resulting in a $110.5 million decline. The overall military construction request for FY2005 is $489 million lower than FY2004. Family housing construction and operation, along with debt servicing, show an increase of over $351.5 million from FY2004. It is important to note that the military services are responsible for their own family housing needs, and there is a significant privatization effort underway for military housing. Additionally, there is a nine-year initiative to increase the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). The military is considering increasing the Basic Allowance for Housing to cover all expenses for military members living in civilian communities. There is a global reassessment study to realign overseas bases, separate from the process of realigning military installations within the United States. Details of the Global Posture Study have not been released yet. The Senate Committee on Armed Services has scheduled a hearing on the matter for Thursday, September 23, 2004. The Commission on Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States was created by Congress last year to assess the adequacy of the Department of Defense plan for altering overseas basing requirements. The commission is tasked with studying the military facility structure overseas and evaluating if it meets the current and future mission of the Department of Defense. The Commission on Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States was established by Congress to assess future force requirements and propose an overseas basing strategy for the Department of Defense. The commission's report with findings, conclusions, and recommendations is due to Congress by December 31, 2004. The Commission on Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States, established by Congress, is facing issues with the Department of Defense's lack of a formal plan for overseas basing. Congress did not fund some construction projects for FY2004 due to this reason. The Senate Committee on Appropriations noted the Department's delay in submitting its master overseas basing plan and recommended against funding several overseas construction projects for FY2005. The Senate Committee on Appropriations extended the deadline for the Commission's final report to August 15, 2005, aligning it with the funding expiration on September 30, 2005. This allows the Commission to interact with the Base Closure and Realignment Commission. The Overseas Basing Commission is urged to present its findings for consideration in the fiscal year 2006 military construction appropriations bill. The Overseas Basing Commission is urged to present its preliminary conclusions to Congress by March 31, 2005. The House-passed version of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2005 would repeal the provision that established the commission. President George W. Bush announced the redeployment of 60,000 to 70,000 troops and 100,000 family members from overseas garrisons to bases within the United States from 2004-2014. Analysts expect the majority of forces redeployed to the United States to come from countries hosting large U.S. garrisons like Germany, Korea, and Japan. Comparing troop numbers in these countries in 1986 and 2003 provides historical context. Troops from the Philippines and Panama were also redeployed in the late 1980s and 1990s. The text discusses the redeployment of U.S. troops from overseas locations in the late 1980s and 1990s, with a focus on U.S. garrisons in Germany, Korea, and Japan. It mentions the historical context of troop numbers in these countries in 1986 and 2003, as well as the completion of four Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) rounds since 1989. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to carry out a fifth round of base realignment or closures during FY2006 through FY2011. Criteria have been established for recommending base closure and realignment actions, with a detailed evaluation of each installation's capacity and necessary changes to meet future force needs. The Secretary will submit a list of BRAC actions to an independent commission in May 2005. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a list of BRAC actions to an independent commission in May 2005 for review. The final presidential list of BRAC actions is due to Congress on November 7, 2005. The House-passed version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 contains a provision that could delay the BRAC process for two years, which the Administration strongly opposes. If presented with a bill that weakens the BRAC authority, the Secretary of Defense will recommend a presidential veto. The Secretary of Defense, along with other senior advisors, will advise the President to veto a bill that delays the BRAC process. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld expressed his opposition to a two-year delay in BRAC during a Senate Committee hearing. The issue of BRAC delay was highlighted as one of the significant issues in the conference committee's deliberations on the Ronald Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005. The conference report for the Ronald Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 does not delay the implementation of the 2005 BRAC round. Sections in the bill address BRAC issues, including requirements for an updated force-structure plan and infrastructure inventory by March 15, 2005, and final criteria for calculating the \"military value\" of installations considered for closure or realignment. The Act's language specifies criteria for the Secretary's recommendations for BRAC actions in 2005, emphasizing military value and removing flexibility in selection. It repeals the authority to place military installations in inactive status as an alternative to closure or realignment. The Act's language repeals the authority for placing military installations in inactive status as an alternative to closure or realignment. It now requires a 15-day warning before adding an installation to the Secretary of Defense's list of recommendations for closure or realignment, with specific criteria for BRAC actions in 2005. Additionally, at least two members of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission must visit any installation before making a closure or realignment recommendation. The Military Housing Privatization Initiative allows the Department to enter into public-private partnerships for housing projects for military personnel. Contracts for 32 projects are in progress to create or refurbish over 61,000 housing units. The initiative leverages appropriated funds and is limited to $850 million in budget authority. The Department of Defense is seeking to raise the budget authority limitation for military family housing projects. Contract negotiations are ongoing for the creation of privatized housing units, with plans to privatize more units in the future. The Department estimates that the current budget authority will be exhausted before the end of the fiscal year and has requested an increase in the limitation. Section 2806 of H.R. 4200 aims to repeal the budget authority limitation for military family housing. The House seeks to repeal the budget authority limitation for military family housing, while the Senate version of the bill does not contain similar language. The difference between the two versions needs to be resolved in conference. Additionally, a section in the Military Construction Appropriations Act for FY2005 that would have raised the budget authority cap on military family housing was struck down during floor debate. An independent bill, the Military Housing Improvement Act of 2004, was introduced to achieve the same goal and passed by the House. The Senate received an amendment to the Military Construction Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2005, requiring the Department of Defense to assess the impact of budget authority exhaustion on military family housing. The amendment was accepted and incorporated into the House version of the bill, allowing the issue to be discussed in conference. The Senate passed the amended bill on September 20, 2004. The amended bill repealed the budget authority cap and termination date for the use of alternative authorities. The Congressional Budget Office disagreed with the Office of Management and Budget's scoring of the Department's alternative authorities, arguing that the Department exercises significant control over supplying family housing to military personnel. The CBO argues that the Department of Defense controls privatized housing projects, considering them inherently governmental and all investments as borrowing authority. The Department maintains that private corporations, not the government, control privatized housing. Military members are free to use their housing allowance. The Department of Defense uses OMB's accounting methodology to record obligations for family housing projects, totaling $580 million. The CBO estimates the Department's commitments at $6 billion. The Office of Management and Budget explains its position on the housing privatization cap in the Senate version of the Military Construction Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2005. The President's Budget includes a request to increase the military housing privatization cap from $850 million to $1.85 billion. This increase aims to improve the quality of life for military families by providing high-quality housing options covered by housing allowances. The current limit would be reached by November 2004 without this increase. The provision does not incur additional costs to the Department of Defense as the projects are privately funded and managed. The Administration urges the Senate to eliminate or raise the military housing privatization cap to $1.85 billion to meet the FY2007 DOD goal of eliminating inadequate housing units. Funding for military construction declined between FY1985 and FY1998 but began to rise in FY1998 to replace outdated facilities and improve the quality of life for military personnel. The Administration requests military construction funding to improve facilities for military personnel. Funding requests have fluctuated over the years, with a rise in FY2001 and FY2002. The FY2005 request is higher than FY2004 but lower than previous projections. DOD anticipated a significant increase in construction requests between FY2003 and FY2007. Tables break down the FY2005 request and compare it to FY2004 levels. The congressional action on military construction appropriations is compared to FY2004 levels. Issues highlighted include inadequate Department requests for funds and the tension between new construction and maintenance of existing facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the inappropriate use of minor construction funds for unauthorized projects, citing the authority of the Secretary of Defense to initiate construction projects not specifically authorized by Congress. This authority is meant for unforeseen circumstances where construction is necessary to correct life-threatening deficiencies. The House Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Military Construction criticized the frequent use of authority for projects like gates and firing ranges post-9/11, which should be part of the normal appropriation process. H.R. 4837 is about appropriations for military construction, family housing, and base realignment for the Department of Defense in 2005. The House Committee on Appropriations supported the Department of Defense's privatization efforts in the Military Construction Appropriations Act. They endorsed raising the budgetary cap on MHPI and addressing scoring methodology changes proposed by CBO. Section 129 of the reported bill, H.R. 4837, aimed to increase the limit on available budget authority from $850 million to $1.35 billion. The House Committee on Appropriations supported raising the budget authority cap on MHPI from $850 million to $1.35 billion. A separate bill, H.R. 4879, passed with a vote of 423-0-11 to raise the cap without invoking questions of Committee of the Budget jurisdiction. However, during debate on H.R. 4837, a Rule XXI point of order was raised against Section 129, which was sustained by the Chair. Mr. Nussle raised a Rule XXI point of order against Section 129, which was sustained by the Chair, striking the section from the bill. Mr. Obey made two unsuccessful motions to recommit the bill, which was then passed with a vote of 420-1-13. The Senate replaced the original language of H.R. 4837 with S. 2674, passing the amended bill with a vote of 91-0-9. The House and Senate appointed conferees, with the House adding Division B and Division C to the bill. The Natural Gas Pipeline Act was signed into law on October 13, 2004 (P.L.108-324) after the House and Senate agreed to the conference report. The bill, S. 2674, made appropriations for military construction, family housing, and base realignment and closure for DOD for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005. The Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction held hearings on Defense-wide and Air Force appropriations requests on March 30, 2004, and on Army and Navy appropriations requests on April 7. The bill S. 2674 was reported by the full committee on July 15, 2004, and was later laid before the Senate on September 15, 2004. The Senate made amendments to the bill twice and incorporated its language into companion measure H.R. 4837. Mr. Young introduced an emergency supplemental bill on September 28 to enable continued funding through November 20, 2004. On September 28, a bill was introduced to fund military construction projects and operations until November 20, 2004. The bill passed in the House and Senate without amendments and was signed into law the same day. H.R. 5212 (Young) was introduced for hurricane disaster relief, including $148.9 million for construction and repair funding related to damage caused by Hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne. The bill passed the House unanimously and was received in the Senate. The bill H.R. 5212 was introduced for hurricane disaster relief, including funding for construction and repair related to damage caused by Hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne. It was referred to the House Committee on Armed Services for military construction and defense activities, with various subcommittees holding hearings and completing markup by May 6. The Subcommittee on Readiness inserted an amendment requiring the Department of Defense to provide reports on Base Realignment and Closure actions. The Subcommittee on Readiness inserted an amendment in bill H.R. 5212 for hurricane disaster relief, requiring the Department of Defense to provide reports on Base Realignment and Closure actions. The bill was debated, amended, and passed by recorded vote on May 19 and 20, 2004, and was later received in the Senate where it passed with an amendment by Unanimous Consent. The bill S. 2400 was passed with an amendment by Unanimous Consent in the Senate and then sent to the House for consideration. Conferees met and filed their report, which was brought up for consideration in the House. The House agreed to the report by a vote of 359-14-59, and the Senate also agreed by Unanimous Consent. The bill was presented to the President and signed into law as P.L. 108-375 on October 28, 2004. The original bill S. 2400 was reported to the Senate from the Committee on Armed Services by Senator Warner. It was debated on the Senate floor between May 17 and June 23, 2004, and passed with amendments on June 23 by a vote of 97-0. The bill was then incorporated into H.R. 4200 as an amendment in the nature of a substitute.
