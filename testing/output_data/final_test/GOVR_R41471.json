    "content": "The Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes the Short-Term Energy and Winter Fuels Outlook (STEWFO) annually in October to estimate average heating fuel expenditures. Factors affecting expenses include regional variations, weather conditions, market size, home characteristics, fuel prices, and consumer decisions. Weather conditions, measured by heating degree-days, also play a key role in expenditure levels. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides heating degree-day estimates to the EIA for the STEWFO, which is a projection based on assumed key prices. Actual average heating expenditures will reflect changes if price estimates are incorrect or weather varies from forecast trends. NOAA forecasts a 2.8% reduction in heating degree-days for the 2010-2011 season compared to the previous season for the US. Regional differences in weather and fuel specialization can change regional expenditure projections. In the Northeast, heating degree-days are expected to increase by 5.5%, while in the West they are expected to increase by 0.4%. Estimated heating degree-days are expected to decline 14.9% in the South and 0.7% in the Midwest. Household expenditure on heating fuels is projected to increase by 2.5% this winter, with natural gas expenditures expected to rise the most in the Northeast and Midwest. Expenditures on heating oil and propane are also expected to increase in various regions. Expenditures on propane and electricity are projected to increase in certain regions, but may differ from actual prices due to changing market conditions. For example, the assumed heating oil price in calculations was $3.06 per gallon, while the actual price was $2.62 per gallon in August 2010. This discrepancy could lead to overestimating expenditures for heating oil consumers unless prices rise to match the assumed price. The U.S. natural gas market is part of a North American regional market, with 83.5% of supplies coming from domestic sources. Consumers include households, commercial customers, electric power generators, and industrial consumers. Winter conditions can affect consumption for households, commercial, and electric power generators. Winter conditions can impact natural gas consumption, especially for households. Table 2 shows stable winter gas consumption and prices from 2006-2011. Prices have been relatively steady, with a slight increase projected for 2010-2011. The price-consumption relationship suggests that demand for natural gas is price inelastic for households, likely due to the necessity of home heating. Existing metering technology makes it difficult for consumers to access consumption and cost data easily. Metering technology hinders easy access to natural gas consumption and cost data. Income levels and weather impact consumption. 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating. Total consumption decreased by 2% from 2008 to 2009, with only the electric power sector seeing an increase. STEWFO projects a 4.6% increase in consumption for 2010, mainly in industrial and power generation sectors. Production is expected to rise by 3.5% in 2010 but decrease by 1.5% in 2011. Natural gas production is expected to decrease by 1.5% in 2011 due to lower prices and a shift towards liquid-rich deposits. Imports are projected to increase by 1.5% in 2011, mostly from Canada. Natural gas demand peaks in winter for households and commercial customers, leading to storage accumulation in off-peak seasons. Liquefied natural gas remains a small component of the U.S. gas picture due to lower prices in North America compared to Asia and Europe. At the start of the winter heating season, natural gas storage was 5% above the five-year average at 3.5 trillion cubic feet. Home heating oil, closely linked to oil and diesel prices, is used by 7% of U.S. households, mainly in the Northeast. Average heating oil expenditures per household are expected to rise by $218, with the Northeast seeing a 13.3% increase. Diesel fuel, similar to heating oil, has been pricier than gasoline in 2010 by about $0.20 per gallon. The price differentials between gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil are due to U.S. refiners focusing on gasoline production and high world demand for diesel fuel. The costs of these fuels are directly related to crude oil prices, which are projected to rise to $85 per barrel during the 2010-2011 heating season. The key risk factor for home heating oil consumers is the volatile price of crude oil. Oil prices can fluctuate, and the economic recession in 2007 led to a decrease in demand. Liquid fuels consumption in the U.S. is expected to increase by 1.1% in 2010. Liquid fuels consumption in the United States is projected to increase by 1.1% in 2010 and 0.6% in 2011, with gasoline consumption expected to rise by 0.2% in 2010 and distillate consumption by 2.7%. Propane is used for home heating by 5.6 million households, but the number of households using propane has been declining. Propane consumers are expected to see an 8% increase in heating expenses for the winter 2010-2011 season. Propane expenditures are expected to rise in the Midwest, Northeast, and West for 2010-2011, with a decline in the South. Propane is a by-product of gasoline and natural gas production, leading to supply fluctuations. A leak in the TEPCO propane pipeline in New York complicates the Northeast's propane outlook. The propane pipeline leak in New York threatens supplies to New England for the winter heating season. Propane prices are influenced by factors like distance to consumers and distribution methods. Electricity prices are linked to natural gas, coal, nuclear power, and alternative fuels. In the U.S., natural gas competes with electricity as a home heating source. 37% of households use electricity for heating, with the South having the highest usage at 61%. The number of households using electricity is growing by 2.9% annually, especially in the South. Propane and heating oil customers are declining, while natural gas usage is expected to expand by 1.2% in 2011. Expenditure on electricity heating is projected to increase by 4.1% in the Northeast, decrease by 3.9% in the South, and decline by 0.4% in the West. Electricity prices have been stable with little volatility. The primary risk factors are weather and economic conditions. Total household expenditures on home heating are determined by fuel price and quantity used. Weather, measured by heating degree days, largely determines fuel quantity. Conservation can reduce fuel consumption. The 2010-2011 winter is expected to be colder in the Northeast and warmer in the South. Fuel prices are determined by various factors. The price of fuel for heating is influenced by economic conditions, with crude oil prices impacting home heating oil and propane costs. Natural gas prices are expected to rise during the 2010-2011 heating season. The Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides federal funding to supplement home heating expenses. The Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides federal funding to supplement home heating expenses. For FY2011, the Administration has proposed $2.51 billion for LIHEAP regular funds and $790 million for emergency contingency funds. The plan includes trigger mechanisms to increase funds based on energy prices or participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Senate Appropriations Committee has reported $3.3 billion for LIHEAP in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill for the 2010-2011 winter heating season. The LIHEAP program provides federal funding for home heating expenses. CITGO operates its own Low Cost Heating Oil Program independently from the U.S. government, offering a 40% discount on heating oil. In 2009-2010, 157,000 households, 245 homeless shelters, and 250 Native American communities benefited from the program. CITGO has not announced if the program will continue. The STEWFO projects increased heating costs for Americans in the winter of 2010-2011 due to higher fuel prices, offsetting lower consumption from milder weather. Costs are expected to rise by about 2.5%, impacting consumers facing high unemployment levels. Uncertainty in LIHEAP funding and the continuation of the CITGO program add to the burden of higher heating costs."
