In 2012, US health care spending was $8,915 per resident, accounting for 17.2% of GDP. Expenditures surpassed $2.3 trillion in 2008, with chronic disease treatment costs making up over 75% of national health expenditures. The World Health Organization linked diet to chronic diseases, which cause 7 out of 10 American deaths annually. Heart disease, cancer, and stroke are major causes of death, accounting for over 50% of all deaths each year. Approximately 81.1 million Americans have cardiovascular disease, with 2,300 deaths daily. In 2010, cardiovascular disease cost $189.4 billion, projected to triple to $818 billion by 2030. Following a healthy diet can reduce heart disease symptoms and reverse artery damage. Two-thirds of Americans are overweight, with one-third of children being obese. In 2008, the United States spent $190 billion on obesity-related health care costs. An estimated 25.8 million Americans have diabetes, with another 79 million adults having prediabetes. Cancer kills approximately 570,000 Americans each year, with more than 1.5 million new cancer cases diagnosed annually. The direct costs of cancer were $102.8 billion in 2010, expected to rise to $172 billion by 2020. Over 33% of cancers are diet-related and preventable with a healthy diet. Nutrition education for clinicians can help identify effective strategies for counseling. Physician counseling on weight loss has been shown to increase patient motivation. Physician counseling on weight loss is recommended by leading medical bodies like the National Institutes of Health, American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and Obesity Society to help overweight and obese patients with lifestyle changes such as diet and physical activity.
