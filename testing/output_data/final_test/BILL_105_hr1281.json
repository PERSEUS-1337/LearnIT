The Act \"Student Health Insurance Portability Protection Act of 1997\" extends health insurance portability protections to college-sponsored health plans, defining them as health benefits offered by or through an institution of higher education for students, excluding benefits from group health plans. The Act extends health insurance portability protections to college-sponsored health plans, with references to group health plans replaced with college-sponsored health plans for students. The Act extends health insurance portability protections to college-sponsored health plans by amending various acts to include coverage under a college-sponsored health plan as creditable coverage. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include coverage under a college-sponsored health plan as creditable coverage. The effective date for this amendment is for students enrolling on or after August 1, 1997, with creditable coverage starting from July 1, 1996. Creditable coverage after July 1, 1996, applies to section 2724(a) of the Public Health Service Act. Certification requirements under section 2743 do not apply to college-sponsored health plans, with subsection (e) of section 2701 applying to issuers after April 7, 1997. No certification is needed under section 2724 before 60 days post-enactment."
