    "content": "During World War II, the United States gained control of the Northern Mariana Islands from Japan. After the war, the islands became a trusteeship of the United States under the United Nations. In 1975, an agreement called the \"Covenant to Establish A Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America\" was reached between the United States and the island representatives. In 1986, residents of the Northern Mariana Islands were granted U.S. citizenship. The Commonwealth has the authority to make its own laws and elects a Resident Representative to represent the government to the United States. The Resident Representative of the CMNI government in Washington has no official status in Congress but has testified before congressional committees. There have been proposals for non-voting representation in the House for the Northern Mariana Islands, but no action has been taken on this recommendation. Since the population of the Mariana Islands has grown, there have been debates in the House about creating a non-voting delegate position for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Bills for this have been introduced since 1994, with the most recent committee action in 1996 approving a bill for the election of a Delegate starting in 1999. The House committee approved a bill for a non-voting delegate position for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in 1996. Some committee members opposed the measure, citing the small population of NMI as a reason for not having a delegate despite support from the Federal Government. The House committee approved a bill for a non-voting delegate position for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in 1996. Representative Miller opposed the recommendation, citing labor law abuses in CNMI and the need for reform. Representative Miller opposed the recommendation for a non-voting delegate position for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, citing the need for labor law reform. He believes that sustained and substantive reforms must be implemented before CNMI can have equal participation in Congress. H.R. 5135, introduced by Representative Richard Pombo in the 108th Congress, proposed establishing a non-voting Delegate position from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The bill outlined eligibility requirements for the Delegate, including being a U.S. citizen for seven years, a resident of the territory, and meeting certain voter qualifications. The bill did not progress further in Congress. The bill H.R. 5135 proposed a non-voting Delegate position from the Northern Mariana Islands, addressing concerns about labor abuses and worker exploitation. The committee supported Governor Juan Babauta's actions in labor law enforcement and coordination with federal agencies. The bill aimed to keep Congress informed of progress and request assistance for the territory's unique economic base. Testifying before the committee were key officials from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, including the Governor, Resident Representative, and President of the Senate. The Administration supports the idea of a non-voting delegate for the CNMI in the U.S. House of Representatives, with all three CNMI officials testifying in favor of the proposal. Governor Babauta, Resident Representative Tenorio, and President of the Senate Cohen testified in support of the proposal for a non-voting Delegate position in Congress for the CNMI. The estimated cost would be $1.1 million annually, funded through the legislative branch appropriation. Representative George Miller expressed past concerns but now supports the idea. George Miller expressed concerns in 1996 but now supports the proposal for a non-voting Delegate position in Congress for CNMI. House measures regarding Delegates are referred to the Committee on Resources. On February 17, 2005, Representative Pombo introduced legislation for a non-voting delegate for the Northern Mariana Islands (H.R. 873). The House Resources Committee ordered the bill reported on May 18, 2005. A written report (H.Rept. 109-110) addressed concerns about the population threshold, stating that the CNMI meets the criteria. Further action in the House during the 109th Congress is expected, with Senate action needed for the bill to become law. In the 109th Congress, there is a discussion about granting voting rights to the Delegate from the District of Columbia. Legislation introduced by House Government Reform Chair Tom Davis (H.R. 5388) would give DC a full-fledged Member of the House of Representatives with voting rights on the House floor. This bill would also create a new House seat for another state, likely Utah. Davis's plan considers the District of Columbia as a congressional district for electing a Member to the House, granting them the same rights as other Members. The bill proposed by House Government Reform Chair Tom Davis (H.R. 5388) aims to grant voting rights to the Delegate from the District of Columbia by giving them a full-fledged Member of the House of Representatives with voting rights on the House floor. The bill also includes provisions for an additional House Member to be added to the state delegation with the highest population until the next reapportionment, increasing the total number of Members in the House permanently to 437. The bill has been approved by the House Committee on Government Reform and referred to the House Judiciary Committee for further consideration. Some Members have raised concerns about the constitutionality of granting voting rights to an individual who does not represent a state. The House proposed granting voting rights to DC residents through various bills, including H.R. 398 and H.R. 190. H.R. 398 treats DC as a state with a House Member and two Senators, while H.R. 190 allows a House Member to represent DC in exchange for a new Member from another state. District of Columbia residents would be counted as residents of Maryland for federal purposes. The bill proposes counting District of Columbia residents as Maryland residents for federal elections, allowing them to vote for a Representative in Congress, Maryland Senators, and President. It also aims to abolish separate electoral votes for DC and the position of DC Delegate. Representative Rohrabacher introduced similar legislation in the past. In the 108th Congress, a hearing was held on the proposal with testimonies from various officials. In the 108th Congress, Representative Regula introduced legislation (H.R. 381) that would have returned most of the territory now associated with the current District of Columbia to Maryland and transformed the DC Delegate into a House Member from Maryland. The bill would have created a National Capital Service Area under Congress's control. The Davis, Rohrabacher, and Regula bills were referred to the House Judiciary Committee and the House Government Reform Committee. In the 108th Congress, legislation was introduced regarding the apportionment process and the replacement of Delegates and the Resident Commissioner. The House passed H.R. 841 in 2005, requiring expedited special elections to fill vacancies in the House of Representatives after a catastrophic event. This bill included territories like the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Senate did not take action on a similar bill in 2004. The office of Delegate, sometimes called \"nonvoting Delegate,\" dates back to the late 1700s. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established territorial representation in Congress, with provisions for elected representatives once the population reached 5,000. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established territorial representation in Congress, with provisions for elected representatives once the population reached 5,000. This elected house, along with an appointed legislative council, would elect a Delegate to Congress. In 1790, Congress extended these privileges to the territory south of the Ohio River, and four years later, the territory sent its first territorial Delegate to Congress. In 1794, James White applied to be the first territorial Delegate to Congress, sparking a debate on whether he should serve in the House or Senate due to the Northwest Ordinance's vague language. Some argued for Senate placement due to his election method, while others suggested he could sit in both chambers. Discussions included seeking Senate concurrence and limiting his right of debate. The House approved the resolution to admit Delegate White to a nonvoting seat in 1794. Debate ensued over whether White should take the oath, with differing opinions on his status as a member of Congress. Representative Madison argued that White was not a member and should not be required to take an oath, while Representative Smith described him as an \"Envoy to Congress.\" The House decided that Delegate White, not being a voting member, was not required to take the oath. Despite this, he was granted the same privileges and compensation as Members of the House. This case set precedents for the treatment of future Delegates. In 1802, legislation extended privileges and compensation to future Delegates in Congress. All future Delegates would sit in the House with a right to debate but not vote. The decision not to administer the oath to Delegate White did not set a precedent, as all future Delegates would take the oath. After the U.S. acquisition of overseas territories following the Spanish-American War, the Supreme Court distinguished between \"incorporated\" and \"unincorporated\" territories in the Insular Cases. Incorporated territories were considered integral parts of the United States, bound for statehood, while unincorporated territories had only the \"fundamental\" parts of the Constitution applied. Congress granted representation to Puerto Rico and the Philippines, but their political status was determined by legislation. After the U.S. acquisition of overseas territories following the Spanish-American War, Congress granted representation to Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Resident Commissioners were appointed from these territories to the United States, with a broader mandate than serving in the U.S. legislature. Their role was more akin to that of a foreign diplomat than a legislator, although they did serve in the House of Representatives. The Resident Commissioners did not have the same privileges as nonvoting Delegates initially. In 1902 and 1908, the House of Representatives granted Puerto Rican Resident Commissioners the right to the floor. The Resident Commissioners from the Philippines were never allowed to serve on standing committees. The Philippines had two Resident Commissioners serving three-year terms until the Tydings-McDuffie Act of 1934 leading to their independence. In 1972, Guam and the Virgin Islands gained congressional representation, and in 1978, American Samoa gained the right to send a Delegate to the House with committee assignment rights and privileges. The Delegate from American Samoa is entitled to privileges and immunities granted to the nonvoting Delegate from Guam. The House has debated the role Delegates should play, with concerns about their rights and responsibilities being unconstitutional. Delegates have varied roles in committees, with periods where they could not vote on measures. Currently, Delegates in Congress have powers, rights, and responsibilities similar to House Members from the states. They can speak, introduce bills, and vote in House committees, but cannot vote on the House floor or offer a motion to reconsider a vote. They are not counted for quorum purposes. The House defines the functions of Delegates, allowing them to serve on select committees and chairing them. William Henry Harrison was the first Delegate to chair a select committee in December 1799. Delegates also serve on standing committees under House rules. The House allowed Delegates to serve on select committees and chair them, with the first regular assignment occurring in December 1871. Additional committee assignments were authorized in 1876, 1880, and 1887, leading to the growth of Delegates' non-legislative roles. Earl Pomeroy noted that Delegates gained more influence and functions similar to congressmen, serving as disseminators of information, lobbyists, and interceding in territorial matters. The House debated the voting rights of Delegates on standing committees, with historians differing on the timeline. Evidence suggests Delegates may have been allowed to vote in committees around 1841, granting them significant influence. The House debated the voting rights of Delegates on standing committees, with historians differing on the timeline. Delegates may have had the right to vote in committees around 1841, but by the late 1880s, they had lost that privilege. In 1930s, the issue resurfaced, but a House committee found no constitutional or statutory support for Delegates voting in committees. In the 1970s, the system of territorial representation in Congress changed as more territories were granted Delegates with increased powers. The House rule on Delegates was amended to allow them to debate but not vote in committees. The House rule on Delegates was amended to allow the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico to serve on standing committees with the same powers and privileges as other Members, abolishing the privilege of being an \"additional member.\" The House rule was amended to grant the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico voting rights in committees, supported by Representative Thomas S. Foley. The power to grant voting rights in committees to delegates lies within the House's authority. The Resident Commissioner's votes in committee are not final decisions without majority support from elected Members of Congress. In 1971, the House amended rule XII to grant the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico voting rights in committees, supported by Representative Thomas S. Foley. The amendment was opposed by Representative B.F. Sisk, but ultimately agreed to by voice vote. This granted voting rights in committee to the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico as well as the newly authorized DC Delegate. During the 103rd Congress, Delegates were allowed to vote in the Committee of the Whole, sparking intense partisan controversy. A proposed amendment to House Rule XII granted Delegates voting rights, but a subsequent amendment required a re-vote in the full House if the Delegates' votes decided an issue. Republicans sued, arguing the rule change violated the Constitution by granting legislative power to non-Members. During the 103rd Congress, Delegates were allowed to vote in the Committee of the Whole, leading to a legal dispute. Plaintiffs argued that non-member voting impaired their constitutional rights as Representatives and voters. The House defendants countered that the House had the authority to determine its proceedings, including the Committee of the Whole. During the 103rd Congress, Delegates were permitted to vote in the Committee of the Whole, sparking a legal dispute. Plaintiffs claimed this violated their constitutional rights, but the House defendants argued that the House had the authority to set its own procedures. Judge Harold H. Greene upheld the House rules changes, noting that the automatic re-vote provision was crucial for constitutionality. In January 1995, the House of Representatives, under a Republican majority, amended Rule XII to prohibit Delegate voting in the Committee of the Whole. This change followed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholding the constitutionality of the House rule changes in January 1994. The First Congress re-enacted provisions of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 with changes necessitated by the ratification of the Constitution."
