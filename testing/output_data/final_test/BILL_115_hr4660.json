The Congress finds that women have the same rights as men, and US law prohibits sex discrimination in various areas. Sex-selection abortion is considered a form of gender-based violence. Sex-selection abortions are elective procedures motivated by sex or gender bias, targeting overwhelmingly female victims. Only 7 states in the US ban abortions for sex selection reasons. Sex is an ascertainable characteristic at early stages of human development through medical technology. These abortions diminish the representation of women in the American population. The representation of women in the American population and electorate is crucial. Sex-selection abortion reinforces discrimination and has no place in society. The history of the US shows examples of discrimination, but efforts like the 19th Amendment have aimed to eliminate such practices. Implicitly approving sex-selection abortion perpetuates discrimination. Congress has a compelling interest in prohibiting sex-selection abortion to prevent sex discrimination and uphold the value of females. This action is supported by Congress' constitutional authority under the Commerce Clause, the 14th Amendment, and article I. SEC. 3. DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE UNBORN ON THE BASIS OF SEX. Sec. 250 of Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code, prohibits discrimination against the unborn based on sex through actions such as performing sex-selection abortions, using force to coerce such abortions, soliciting funds for them, or transporting women for this purpose.

Appropriate relief can be obtained through civil action. In a civil action, appropriate relief for violations of abortion laws includes verifiable money damages for injuries and punitive damages.
