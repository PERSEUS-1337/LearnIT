    "content": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) was established by Congress in 1950 to promote science, national health, prosperity, and defense. It is a major source of federal support for university research, particularly in mathematics, and plays a significant role in STEM education programs and student aid. This report discusses the Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request for NSF and tracks legislative action on FY2017 appropriations to the foundation. The National Science Foundation (NSF) has six major appropriations accounts: Research and Related Activities (RRA), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC), Agency Operations and Award Management (AOAM), National Science Board (NSB), and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). NSF's budget justifications detail activities and obligations at the RRA subaccount level. The majority of NSF's primary mission activities are funded through RRA, EHR, and MREFC. NSF adopted its current appropriations account structure in FY2003. The Obama Administration requested $7.964 billion for NSF in FY2017, a $501 million increase from FY2016. This included $7.564 billion in discretionary budget authority and $400 million in new one-time mandatory budget authority. The request aimed to increase budget authority in three accounts: RRA by $392 million, EHR by $73 million, and AOAM by $43 million. The NSB and OIG accounts would have received similar funding. The requested mandatory budget funding for NSF in FY2017 would have been split between two accounts\u2014$346 million for RRA and $54 million for EHR. The total funding provided by the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 would have been $7.510 billion, slightly above the FY2016 estimated funding level. Funding for major accounts would have remained nearly the same as in FY2016, except for a decrease in the MREFC account by $7 million. The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 would have provided $7.406 billion to NSF for FY2017, slightly below the FY2016 estimated funding level. Funding for major accounts would have remained nearly the same, except for an increase in the RRA and AOAM accounts and a decrease in the MREFC account. The Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) provided $7.472 billion in discretionary funding to NSF, slightly above the FY2016 amount. The FY2017 NSF budget justification highlighted Clean Energy Research as a major emphasis. The FY2017 budget document emphasized Clean Energy Research and Development (R&D) and strengthening support for core activities. The budget proposed a $141 million increase in funding for Clean Energy R&D, totaling $512 million, and a new mandatory budget authority request of $400 million for fundamental research, supporting early-career investigators. This funding would allow for an estimated 800 additional research grants to be funded. The FY2017 budget aims to bring researchers together from different fields to address cross-disciplinary questions. Activities include Understanding the Brain, Risk and Resilience, Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems, and NSF INCLUDES. NSF identified ongoing priorities like Cyber-Enabled Materials and Cyberinfrastructure Framework for 21st Century Science. The NSF FY2017 budget includes funding for various programs such as CIF21, I-Corps, BioMaPS, SEES, and SaTC. The NRT program was not included in the foundation-wide priorities list, with a requested budget of $58.6 million, showing an increase from FY2016. The FY2017 budget for NSF includes funding for programs like CIF21, I-Corps, BioMaPS, SEES, and SaTC. The requested budget for the NRT program was $58.6 million, an increase from FY2016. The Senate and House reports supported funding for programs focusing on cybersecurity and increasing STEM participation from underrepresented groups. The reports recommended additional funding for I-Corps to enable greater national participation. P.L. 115-31 directed NSF to provide $30 million for I-Corps. The Obama Administration sought a $392 million increase in funding for RRA in FY2017, with $346 million requested as new mandatory budget authority. S. 2837 would have provided $6.034 billion in discretionary funding, while H.R. 5393 would have provided $6.079 billion, representing a $45.8 million increase over FY2016. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) provides $6.034 billion for RRA, equal to the FY2016 estimate. The FY2017 budget request sought increases for all RRA subaccounts except for the U.S. Arctic Research Commission. The largest percentage increase would have gone to Engineering (ENG, 9.4%), with Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) receiving the largest increase in dollars ($87.3 million). Other subaccounts would have received increases between 6.0% and 6.5%, except for Integrated Activities (IA) which would have received a 2.9% increase. The FY2017 request also included an increase for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) from $160 million to $171 million (an increase of 6.7%). The FY2017 budget request sought increases for all RRA subaccounts except for the U.S. Arctic Research Commission. The largest percentage increase would have gone to Engineering (ENG, 9.4%), with Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) receiving the largest increase in dollars ($87.3 million). Other subaccounts would have received increases between 6.0% and 6.5%, except for Integrated Activities (IA) which would have received a 2.9% increase. S. 2837 and H.R. 5393 did not specify funding allocations within RRA, but specified funding levels for specific programs within the Research and Related Activities (RRA) account. The House and Senate reports supported NSF's peer review process and directed agency actions on research abstracts. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 did not specify funding allocations within RRA but directed funding for polar research, U.S. Antarctic program activities, and EPSCoR. The FY2017 budget request included a $73 million increase for EHR. The FY2017 budget request included a $953 million for EHR, with $54 million as mandatory budget authority. Both S. 2837 and H.R. 5393 proposed keeping EHR funding at the FY2016 level, while P.L. 115-31 provided $880 million in discretionary funding for EHR. The request included increases for each division within EHR, with the largest increases for DRL and DGE. New mandatory funding was requested for each division except for DGE. The FY2017 EHR budget request included a $52 million increase for ECR: STEM Learning, double the FY2016 estimate. Congress did not fund a similar increase for FY2016. NSF's budget justification noted no significant shifts in EHR's priorities and highlighted ongoing programs like CyberCorps: Scholarships for Service, for which President Obama requested a $70 million increase. The FY2017 budget requested $70 million for CyberCorps, a $20 million increase from FY2016. The Senate recommended $55 million (10% increase), while the House did not specify. The explanatory statement directed NSF to provide $55 million for CyberCorps and at least $7.5 million for community colleges as per the Senate's direction. President Obama requested no change in funding for various EHR programs. The Senate and House reports recommended funding various STEM programs at requested levels, including ATE, LSAMP, HBCU-UP, and TCUP. They also suggested establishing a broadening participation program at Hispanic Serving Institutions. P.L. 115-31 directed NSF to provide funding for AISL, STEM+C, TCUP, the HBCU program, LSAMP, and to establish an HSI program with at least $15 million. The MREFC account supports large construction projects and scientific instruments. The Obama Administration requested just over $193 million for MREFC in FY2017, with the Senate recommending an increase to $247 million and the House recommending a decrease to $87 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, provided $209 million for MREFC, the only NSF account to receive an increase over FY2016 funding levels. The budget request included support for the construction of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) with $67 million requested. The Senate and House reports recommended funding for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). The budget request included funding for the construction of two Regional Class Research Vessels (RCRVs), with the Senate report proposing an increase to support three new RCRVs. The House report did not discuss this program, but the explanatory statement directed NSF to provide funding for three RCRVs. The explanatory statement directs NSF to provide $122 million for the construction of three RCRVs, amounting to $41 million per ship. The House report fully funds the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science program and specifies that up to $544 million shall remain available for polar research and operations support. The Government Accountability Office is directed to provide an independent perspective on technical risks and cost overruns for MREFC programs. NEON is transitioning to the operational phase with construction expected to be complete by the end of FY2017, resulting in no MREFC funding requested for NEON. The Obama Administration sought $373 million for the Agency Operations and Award Management (AOAM) account, with a $43 million increase over FY2016. The Senate recommended $330 million, while the House recommended $340 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, provides $330 million for AOAM, with $40.7 million allocated for NSF relocating to the new headquarters. The budget request included funding for the National Science Board (NSB) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG). The funding for the National Science Board (NSB) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) in FY2017 was nearly equal to FY2016 levels. The FY2017 request also included funding for NSF activities under three multi-agency initiatives, including the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD), and U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). The funding for the National Science Board (NSB) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) in FY2017 was nearly equal to FY2016 levels. The FY2017 request also included funding for NSF activities under three multi-agency initiatives, including the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD), and U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). However, authorizations of appropriations to NSF expired in FY2013, and measures to reauthorize provisions were introduced in the 114th Congress. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) would have authorized $7.510 billion for NSF in FY2017, but provisions for NSF funding were not included in the enacted bill. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015 proposed funding levels for NSF in FY2017, higher than actual budget amounts in FY2015 and FY2016. The FY2013 authorization levels, appropriations in FY2015 and FY2016, FY2017 requested amounts, and proposed funding levels for NSF in FY2017 under selected reauthorization measures from the 114th Congress are compared. Funding for NSB and OIG in FY2017 was similar to FY2016 levels, with provisions for NSF funding introduced in the 114th Congress but not included in the enacted bill. Since its establishment in 1950, NSF has seen fluctuations in appropriations, with periods of rapid growth in the 1950s and 1960s, followed by fluctuating appropriations until the late 1980s. Sustained growth occurred in the late 1980s to mid-1990s and again in the late 1990s to early 2000s. However, since 2004, budget growth has slowed. NSF obligations have mainly increased in the main research account, RRA, by about $1.890 billion since FY2003. Since FY2003, NSF's main research account, RRA, increased by $1.890 billion (45.6%) by FY2017. Total NSF obligations rose by $2.094 billion (39%) during this period. Continuing resolutions can cause uncertainty for agencies, impacting operations like hiring staff and starting new projects. Three CRs in FY2017 slightly reduced NSF operations below FY2016 levels. The FY2017 budget saw a decrease in funding levels compared to FY2016, with differences between program authorizations and appropriations causing planning challenges. Discrepancies in House and Senate recommendations for funding levels may reflect broader policy disagreements, highlighting the importance of a clear signal from Congress for future program planning."
