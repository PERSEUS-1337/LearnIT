    "content": "The \"Pay Stub Disclosure Act\" is the short title of this Act. The findings section follows. The lack of Federal requirement for pay stubs hinders wage violation identification. A survey found many low-wage workers underpaid or not receiving overtime. Some employers make pay calculation difficult by using cash or personal checks. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 requires employers to keep records of employees' pay, but lack of remedies diminishes its effectiveness. In Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., the Supreme Court ruled that if an employer fails to keep required records, the burden shifts to them to disprove employee testimony on work hours and compensation. Many courts have failed to shift this burden. Many courts have failed to shift the burden to the employer when they fail to keep adequate records, giving the employer's testimony equal weight to the employee's credible evidence. SEC. 3. PAY STUB REQUIREMENTS. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to include disclosure requirements for employers to provide initial information to non-exempt employees within 15 days of hiring or any changes in pay rates. This disclosure must include details such as the rate of pay, method of payment, employer's name, and any other business names used. Each employer must provide non-exempt employees with a pay stub each pay period, including details such as the pay period covered, employee's name and last four digits of their SSN, total hours worked, and hours worked per workweek. In addition to basic pay stub details, the pay stub should also include specific wage information based on the employee's payment method, such as hourly wages, salary, piece rate earnings, or commission payments. The pay stub should include details such as overtime hours worked, hourly rates for overtime, additional compensation or benefits provided, deductions, allowances, and reimbursements. When disclosing compensation information, it should include bonuses, paid leave, employer contributions to health care and retirement accounts, transit benefits, and other required forms of pay under state or local law. The pay stub required by paragraph (2) must include allowances, reimbursements, and additional compensation itemized without using 'miscellaneous'. It should be provided to employees each pay period as a separate document or detachable part of a paycheck. The proposed amendment requires employers to provide pay stubs to employees either as a separate document, a detachable part of a paycheck, or electronically for those using electronic deposit. Additionally, employers must keep records of pay stub information for three years and provide copies of these records upon employee request for up to three years prior. The proposed amendment mandates employers to provide pay stubs to employees within 15 days of hire, detailing the right to receive a pay stub, contact information for the Department of Labor, and any additional information required by the Secretary. The Pay Stub Disclosure Act requires employers to provide pay stubs to employees within 15 days of hire. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the section heading of the Act. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. Section 16 of the Fair Labor Standards Act is amended to increase penalties for violations of subsections (e) or (f) of section 11. Employers who violate these subsections will be liable to affected employees for fines ranging from $50 to $100 per violation, not exceeding $4,000 per employee. Subsection (e) is also amended to redesignate paragraphs. The Fair Labor Standards Act is amended to increase penalties for violations of record-keeping requirements. Employers who fail to maintain records or allow employee access may face a civil penalty of $750 per violation. The Secretary has the authority to adjust penalties for inflation. Evidentiary standards are also updated for employers who do not keep sufficient records as required. The employee's credible evidence and testimony regarding work hours can create a rebuttable presumption of accuracy in the absence of proper records, in line with the Supreme Court's decision in Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act to define a pay stub as a written document itemizing wages and deductions. SEC. 6. REGULATIONS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary of Labor must create regulations within a year of this Act, including a list of similar state and local laws. They will also provide guidance on compliance and technical assistance to various entities. The Secretary of Labor will create regulations within a year of this Act, including guidance on compliance and technical assistance to entities such as organizations and professional associations. The amendments made by this Act will take effect 6 months after final regulations are issued by the Secretary of Labor, but no later than 18 months after the enactment of the Act."
