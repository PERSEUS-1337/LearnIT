    "content": "The Act titled \"Contact Lens Prescription Release Act of 2002\" mandates the release of contact lens prescriptions. The Federal Trade Commission will require prescribers to provide contact lens prescriptions to patients upon completion of the fitting process, regardless of patient request. Patients or their agents can request a copy of the prescription or have it verified electronically. The rule requires contact lens prescriptions to expire based on state laws or a date set by the Commission, unless the prescriber specifies a different expiration date for medical reasons. Violations of the rule will be treated as violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The rule on contact lens prescriptions requires compliance with state laws or a date set by the Commission, with violations treated as violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO INDUSTRY MEMBERS. The Federal Trade Commission will make it unfair or deceptive for industry members to advertise contact lenses without a valid prescription within 9 months of this Act. A rule will require sellers to obtain a valid prescription before selling contact lenses to consumers. The rule under this section requires sellers to record and preserve notifications and responses related to contact lens sales, as well as verify prescriptions by notifying the prescriber and allowing for error corrections. Violations of rules under this section will be treated as violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The Act and regulations will not impact State laws on contact lens fitting authorization. The Act defines the term \"Commission\" as the Federal Trade Commission and \"completion of the contact lens fitting process\" as the process starting after an eye examination, including determining lens specifications, initial fit evaluation, and necessary follow-up examinations. The Act defines terms like \"industry member\" as a person involved in contact lens manufacturing and \"prescriber\" as an ophthalmologist or optometrist issuing prescriptions. The prescription must indicate successful fit or no changes for renewals. Specifications for obtaining contact lenses include parameters for duplication, suitability notation, patient's name, exam date, prescription issue date, prescriber's information, and prescription expiration date."
