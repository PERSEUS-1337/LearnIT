    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act\" ensures that contact lens prescriptions are made available to patients. The Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act requires prescribers to provide patients with a copy of their contact lens prescription upon completion of a fitting. Prescribers must also provide or verify the prescription electronically if requested. Additionally, prescribers are prohibited from requiring patients to purchase lenses from them or pay additional fees for the prescription. Prescribers cannot require patients to sign a waiver or release as a condition of verifying or releasing a prescription. Prescribers can request immediate payment for eye examination fees before releasing a contact lens prescription if no need for ophthalmic goods is found. Proof of insurance coverage can be considered as payment. (a) A seller must sell contact lenses with a valid prescription presented directly by the patient or prescriber, or verified through direct communication. \n(b) The seller must keep a record of all direct communications related to prescriptions. \n(c) When verifying a contact lens prescription, the seller must provide specific information to the prescriber, including patient details, lens specifications, quantity ordered, request dates, and seller contact information. Verification of contact lens prescriptions is crucial under this Act. A prescription is verified if the prescriber confirms accuracy, provides correct information, or fails to communicate within a specified time. If a prescriber deems a prescription invalid, the seller cannot fill it without specifying the reason. The seller must correct any inaccurate prescription communicated by them to the prescriber. They are not allowed to alter a contact lens prescription, except when the same lens is sold under different labels by the same manufacturer. Direct communication includes phone, fax, or email. SEC. 5. EXPIRATION OF CONTACT LENS PRESCRIPTIONS. Contact lens prescriptions expire based on state laws or the prescriber's medical judgment. The prescription must last at least one year, unless the prescriber specifies an earlier date based on the patient's ocular health. If a prescription expires in less than a year, the reasons for this decision must be documented in the patient's medical record. The prescription expiration date must not be less than the period recommended by the prescriber for a necessary reexamination. The \"issue date\" refers to when the patient receives the prescription. SEC. 6 prohibits advertising contact lenses without a prescription. SEC. 7 prohibits prescribers from waiving liability for eye examination accuracy. SEC. 8 allows the FTC to make rules. The Federal Trade Commission will create rules under section 18 of the FTC Act to implement the Act, exempt from the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. Regulations will be issued following the procedures in section 553 of title 5, U.S. Code, with the first rules taking effect within 180 days. SEC. 9. VIOLATIONS.\n\nAny violation of this Act or the rules required under section 8 shall be treated as a violation of a rule under section 18 of the Federal Trade Commission Act regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The Federal Trade Commission shall enforce this Act in the same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as though all applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act were incorporated into and made a part of this Act.\n\nSEC. 10. STUDY AND REPORT. The Federal Trade Commission will conduct a study on competition in the sale of prescription contact lenses, examining exclusive relationships, online vs. offline sellers, brand name prescriptions, and the impact of FTC eyeglasses rule on competition. The Federal Trade Commission will conduct a study on competition in the sale of prescription contact lenses, including the impact of the FTC eyeglasses rule on competition. A report will be submitted to Congress within 12 months of the Act's effective date. SEC. 11. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"contact lens fitting\" as the process starting after an eye examination and ending with a successful fit or prescription renewal. It includes determining lens specifications, evaluating the fit, and follow-up exams. A \"prescriber\" refers to an ophthalmologist, optometrist, or other authorized person to issue contact lens prescriptions according to FDA regulations. The term \"contact lens prescription\" refers to a prescription containing necessary information for filling a prescription, including patient's name, examination date, issue and expiration dates, prescriber's information, lens specifications, and manufacturer details. The Act will take effect 60 days after enactment."
