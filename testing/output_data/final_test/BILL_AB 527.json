    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature declares the earthquake in Napa on August 24, 2014, caused economic hardship. A new exception to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act is added for the benefit of Napa County. Section 25503.40 is added to the Business and Professions Code, allowing certain alcohol manufacturers and license holders to sponsor events and purchase advertising space from live entertainment marketing companies under specific conditions. The live entertainment marketing company is a subsidiary of a non-publicly traded live entertainment company based in Napa County, which may also have interests in retail or winegrower licenses. The event venue in Napa County expects at least 5,000 attendees per day, with a limit of three events per year. The live entertainment company must confirm in writing that they comply with these limits to the retail licensee. Retail licensees for events with over 5,000 attendees per day must provide this confirmation to the department. The live entertainment company must confirm compliance with event limits to the department when obtaining authorization for events with over 5,000 attendees per day in Napa County. The sponsorship and advertising space is purchased for promoting live entertainment events at designated venues. Any on-sale licensee at a venue hosting live entertainment events sponsored or advertised as described in this section must serve other brands of alcohol in addition to the sponsoring brand. Any on-sale retail licensee owned by a live entertainment company must serve other brands of alcohol in addition to the sponsoring brand. Advertising space or time purchased under this section cannot be placed in on-sale licensed premises owned by the live entertainment company or its subsidiaries. Sponsorship under this section is not allowed at events held at on-sale licensed premises owned by the live entertainment company or its subsidiaries. An agreement for sponsorship or advertising during cultural events cannot be tied to the sale of alcoholic beverages by the event company or any related on-sale licensee. Any sponsorship or advertising at events must be done through a written contract between the alcohol manufacturer or licensee and the live entertainment marketing company. Any alcohol manufacturer or licensee who illegally coerces a wholesaler to fulfill contractual obligations may face misdemeanor charges, imprisonment up to six months, a fine equal to the value of the advertising involved, plus $10,000, and potential license suspension or revocation. Any on-sale retail licensee who solicits or coerces a wholesaler to purchase advertising time or space may face misdemeanor charges, imprisonment up to six months, a fine equal to the value of the advertising involved plus $10,000, and potential license suspension or revocation. (e) \"Beer manufacturer\" includes holder of beer manufacturer's license, out-of-state beer manufacturer's certificate, or beer and wine importer's license without wholesaler or retail license. \n(f) Prohibits purchasing advertising space or time for on-sale retail licensee. \n(g) Prohibits giving anything of value to on-sale retail licensee, except as authorized by law. \n(h) Legislature finds and declares specific provisions. The Legislature finds it necessary to prevent dominance in local markets and excessive sales of alcoholic beverages through vertical integration. Any exceptions to tied interests must be limited to prevent undermining the general prohibition. This section is effective until January 1, 2019, unless extended by a later statute. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for the unique conditions in Napa County. No reimbursement is required for local agencies due to new crime creation or penalty changes."
