China imposes stricter travel restrictions in Tibetan areas despite promoting tourism there. The Government of China restricts access to Tibet for foreigners, requiring permission from specific offices. The United States faced challenges in obtaining diplomatic access to Tibet, with limited opportunities to interact with local residents. The Government of China delayed United States consular access for over 48 hours after a bus crash in Tibet in 2013, where three Americans died and others were injured. This hindered US consular services and violated China's obligations under the Vienna Convention. In 2015, after an earthquake trapped US citizens in Tibet, the US Consulate General in Chengdu struggled to provide emergency consular assistance due to lack of access.
