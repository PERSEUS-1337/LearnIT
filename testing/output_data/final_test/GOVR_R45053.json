    "content": "The federal income tax system consists of various components. The individual income tax is the largest revenue generator, contributing $1.5 trillion in FY2016, accounting for 47% of the federal government's revenue. Corporate income tax generated $300 billion (9% of total revenue), while social insurance or payroll taxes contributed $1.1 trillion (34% of revenue). The individual income tax primarily consists of wages and salaries, but also includes a significant portion of business income from pass-through entities like sole proprietorships and partnerships. Partnerships, S corporations, and limited liability companies pass business income to owners for taxation under the individual income tax system. The Haig-Simons comprehensive income definitions are used to define taxable resources, including changes in a taxpayer's ability to consume. Employer contributions to employee health insurance are considered income but not included in taxable income. Individual income tax is based on gross income from various sources like wages, salaries, and interest. The individual income tax base includes various sources of income such as wages, salaries, tips, interest, dividends, capital gains, rental income, and alimony. Certain items like employer-provided health insurance, pension contributions, and life insurance proceeds are excluded from taxable income. Capital gains are realized when assets are sold, and unrealized gains are not taxed. Interest from certain bonds and employer contributions to Social Security are also excluded from taxable income. The individual income tax base includes various sources of income such as wages, salaries, tips, interest, dividends, capital gains, rental income, and alimony. Capital gains are realized when assets are sold, excluding unrealized gains. Income from operating a business or rental property is also subject to individual income tax, with deductions available to taxpayers to determine adjusted gross income (AGI). Above-the-line deductions are available to taxpayers regardless of whether they itemize deductions or claim the standard deduction. These deductions may include contributions to retirement plans, IRAs, moving expenses, student loan interest, higher education expenses, health savings accounts, and alimony payments. Tax liability is determined by the taxpayer's filing status, which can be married filing jointly, married filing separately, head of household, or single individual. The personal exemption and standard deduction amounts also vary based on filing status. Taxpayers can choose between claiming the standard deduction or itemized deductions. The standard deduction amount for 2017 varies based on filing status, with single filers at $6,350 and married taxpayers filing jointly at $12,700. Additional standard deductions are available for the elderly and blind. Personal exemptions of $4,050 per person are allowed, but phased out for higher-income taxpayers. The Personal Exemption Phaseout (PEP) begins when a taxpayer's AGI exceeds certain thresholds, reducing the personal exemption by 2% for each $2,500 in AGI above the threshold. Taxpayers can also choose to itemize deductions, including state and local taxes, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and real property taxes, with some deductions only available in excess of a certain floor, like medical expenses exceeding 10% of AGI. Casualty and theft losses can also be deducted in excess of 10% of AGI. The Pease limitation reduces itemized deductions by 3% above certain income thresholds. Thresholds for 2017 are AGI above $261,500 for single filers, $287,650 for head of household filers, $313,800 for married taxpayers filing jointly, and $156,900 for married taxpayers filing separately. The total reduction in deductions cannot exceed 80% of total deductions. Some deductions, like medical expenses and casualty/theft losses, are not subject to the Pease limitation. The income tax system is progressive with marginal tax rates increasing as income rises. Taxpayers pay the same tax rate within a bracket, but higher rates apply once income surpasses a threshold. There are seven marginal tax rates ranging from 10% to 39.6%. Threshold levels vary by filing status. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed separately. The income tax system is progressive with marginal tax rates increasing as income rises. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates, with a maximum rate of 20%. Taxpayers in different tax brackets face varying tax rates on capital gains and dividends, ranging from 0% to 20%. Higher-income individuals with many exemptions and deductions may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which has marginal tax rates of 26% and 28%. Few taxpayers file returns at the top statutory tax rate, but nearly 16% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is reported by those in the 39.6% tax bracket. Nearly 16% of AGI is reported on returns in the 39.6% tax bracket. Higher-income individuals may face an additional 3.8% tax on net investment income, with fixed threshold amounts of $250,000 for joint filers and $200,000 for others. This tax increases the maximum rate on capital gains and dividends to 23.8%. Tax credits are then subtracted from gross tax liability to determine the final tax liability. Tax credits offset tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis, with refundable credits exceeding tax liability resulting in a refund. Unused credits can be carried forward, and some are phased out as income rises. Refundable credits include the earned income tax credit (EITC) and the child tax credit (CTC), while nonrefundable credits can be claimed for child and dependent care expenses. Other credits exist for education and health care, such as the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC). The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) provides a partially refundable tax credit for tuition and related expenses. Effective marginal tax rates can differ from statutory rates due to credits like the earned income tax credit (EITC) which phases in as income increases. The alternative minimum tax (AMT) applies lower rates to prevent higher-income taxpayers from avoiding taxes. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) calculates tax liability by adding back certain tax items to taxable income, then subtracting the AMT exemption. The exemption amounts for 2017 are $54,300 for single filers and $84,500 for married couples, indexed for inflation. The exemption phases out for higher incomes starting at $120,700 for singles and $160,900 for married couples. AMT taxable income is subject to rates of 26% and 28%. Taxpayers pay the greater of their AMT or regular tax liability. Most nonrefundable tax credits can be used against the AMT. Less than 4% of taxpayers are affected by the AMT under current law. Under current law, less than 4% of tax filers pay the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Higher-income taxpayers, those with more children, and married taxpayers are more likely to be subject to the AMT. Corporate income tax applies to C corporations, which are taxed separately from their shareholders. Corporate income is taxed at the corporate level and again at the individual-shareholder level when dividends are paid or capital gains are realized. The corporate income tax applies to C corporations, which are taxed separately from their shareholders. Corporate profit is total income minus the cost associated with generating that income. Business expenses that may be deducted from income include employee compensation, depreciation, supplies, advertising, and interest payments. Business income is taxed only once for non-corporate businesses like S corporations and partnerships, known as pass-throughs, where income is passed through to owners who pay taxes at individual income tax rates. The corporate income tax allows for special deductions, credits, and preferences to reduce taxes paid by corporations. Tax liability is calculated as Taxes = [(Total Income \u2013 Expenses)(1 \u2013 p ) \u00d7 t ] \u2013 Tax Credits, where t is the statutory tax rate and p is the Section 199 deduction. NOLs can be carried back or forward, allowing for deductions from prior years' taxable income. The corporate income tax allows for deductions from prior years' taxable income through NOLs. Losses can be carried back up to two years or carried forward for up to 20 years to reduce future tax liabilities. The statutory tax rate for most corporate income is 35%, with higher \"bubble\" brackets increasing the effective tax rate for larger firms. The corporate income tax base excludes labor's contribution and debt capital returns. Equity investments are financed by retained earnings and stock sales, generating dividends and capital gains. The corporate income tax base is largely the return to equity capital, which has broad effects on capital investment allocation. It favors non-corporate and owner-occupied housing investments over corporate investments, and corporate debt over equity investments. The burden of the tax spreads to all owners of capital, including owners of unincorporated businesses, bondholders, and homeowners. The corporate tax system in the United States places most of the burden on capital owners, making it progressive as they are typically in higher income groups. U.S. corporations are taxed on their worldwide income but can claim a foreign tax credit for taxes paid to other countries. Income can be deferred from U.S. taxation until repatriated, except for certain types of passive income under \"Subpart F.\" Passive types of income like interest, dividends, annuities, rents, and royalties are subject to payroll taxes, which fund programs like Social Security and Medicare. The combined rate for Social Security and Medicare taxes is 15.3%, with 7.65% paid by both employees and employers. The Social Security tax is 6.2% for both parties, while the Medicare tax is 1.45%. There is no wage cap for the Medicare tax, and higher-income taxpayers may face an additional 0.9% tax. The tax system includes a 0.9% additional HI tax for high-income married taxpayers. Employers also pay a 0.6% federal unemployment insurance payroll tax on wages. Most taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes, with 75% of tax units having positive payroll tax liability in 2016. Payroll taxes are regressive, with higher-income taxpayers paying a smaller share of their income in payroll taxes than lower-income taxpayers due to the OASDI tax wage cap and non-wage income concentration. Estate tax applies upon death, with deductions and exemptions available. The effective estate tax exemption is $5.49 million for 2017. The estate tax operates alongside the federal gift tax to prevent tax avoidance. In 2017, the estate tax exemption amount was $5.49 million, with a tax rate of 40%. The first $14,000 of gifts is excluded from taxation. Few taxpayers pay the estate tax, with only 41% of estate tax returns being taxable in 2015. The estate tax is progressive, affecting roughly 0.2% of decedents annually. For taxpayers in the top income percentiles, the estate tax can be up to 0.5% of cash income. Excise taxes are imposed on specific goods and services, not income, and are collected at various points in the production and sales process. Unlike sales taxes, excise taxes are historically imposed by the federal government, with sales taxes left to the states for revenue. Excise taxes are collected on specific goods and services at production and retail levels. The largest excise tax is on gasoline, with others on diesel, fuels, trucks, aviation, alcohol, tobacco, ACA taxes, firearms, and ammunition. Most excise taxes support federal trust funds for specific activities. In 2016, $95 billion in excise tax revenue mostly went to trust funds, with the Highway Trust Fund being the largest. Devoted revenue sources include taxes on fuels, trucks, and tires. Federal excise taxes are collected on various goods and services, including fuels, trucks, and tires. These taxes support trust funds such as the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco, and ACA-related items are also part of the revenue sources. These taxes can lead to higher prices for consumers, with lower-income households bearing a larger burden compared to higher-income households. Overall, federal excise taxes are considered regressive, with varying degrees of regressivity depending on the type of tax. Federal revenues come from multiple sources and typically range from one-fifth to one-sixth of the economy. Federal tax revenues as a percentage of GDP have been around 17.8% in 2016, slightly above the post-World War II average. Individual income tax is the primary source of federal revenue, decreasing from nearly 10% of GDP in 2000 to just over 6% in 2010, but increasing to 8.4% in 2016. Corporate income tax has fallen in importance over time. In the late 1960s, corporate taxes were replaced by social insurance and retirement taxes as the second-leading revenue source. Excise and estate/gift taxes decreased in importance over time. Corporate income tax was 30% of federal revenue in 1946, but less than 10% in 2016. Excise tax revenue dropped from nearly 18% in 1946 to almost 3% now. Social insurance and retirement taxes have risen post-World War II and are now the second largest federal revenue source at nearly 35%. The U.S. tax system is generally progressive, with lower-income households paying a greater share of before-tax income compared to federal taxes. Households in the top quintile pay over two-thirds of federal taxes, resulting from the progressive income tax rate. After-tax income distribution is more even than before-tax income. Most taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes, with 62.3% paying more in payroll taxes. The U.S. tax system shows that the top quintile of households pay over two-thirds of federal taxes, mainly through the progressive income tax rate. Comparing U.S. taxes to OECD countries, the U.S. has lower taxes as a percentage of GDP. Among G-7 countries, the U.S. has the lowest revenue and spending as a percentage of GDP and the second highest deficit level. H.R. 1 includes significant changes to the federal tax system after the 2017 tax year, affecting both individual and business taxes. The act repeals personal exemptions, increases the standard deduction, modifies rates and brackets, and alters many individual income tax expenditures. It also changes how businesses are taxed, with most pass-through business income taxed differently from individual income tax rates. Corporations will face a reduced statutory tax rate, and the act moves towards a territorial tax system for multinational corporations. This report provides an overview of the federal tax system in 2017, with changes enacted in the 115th Congress addressed in subsequent CRS products. In 2016, individual income tax expenditures totaled $1.2 trillion, with the top 10 provisions accounting for $844.2 billion (69%). Corporate tax expenditures in 2016 amounted to $267.2 billion, with the top 10 provisions contributing $222.8 billion (83%)."
