    "content": "The ACA employer shared responsibility provisions apply to all common law employers, including government entities and nonprofit organizations exempt from federal income taxes. The employer penalty applies to firms with at least 50 FTE employees if one or more full-time employees obtain a premium tax credit through health insurance exchanges. Eligibility for a premium tax credit is based on income thresholds and employer coverage affordability. Determining potential exposure to the penalty is a multi-stage process. The employer penalty under the ACA applies to large employers with at least 50 full-time employees. The penalty is triggered if full-time employees do not have adequate and affordable health coverage. Large employers are defined as those with an average of at least 50 FTEs in the previous calendar year. Calculating FTEs involves considering both full-time and part-time employee hours. The calculation of full-time equivalent (FTE) workers includes part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week and seasonal employees. The total hours worked by part-time employees are divided by 120 and added to the number of full-time employees to determine FTE workers for penalty purposes related to health coverage status. The process to determine the employer's status may be complex. For ACA large-employer calculation, owners of multiple businesses must follow IRS aggregation rules. Independent contractors' classification as employees must adhere to IRS guidelines. Businesses using temporary staffing agencies must determine the employer for ACA purposes. Special rules apply for counting hours worked by seasonal employees. Franchise owners with multiple entities must follow IRS aggregation rules for controlled groups. For ACA large-employer calculation, franchise owners with multiple entities must follow IRS aggregation rules. The ACA defines an employer based on the common law standard, where workers are considered employees if subject to the employer's control. Independent contractors are workers who control their work and are not considered employees. The potential employer penalty applies to all common law employers, including government entities and nonprofit organizations exempt from federal income taxes. The IRS provides guidance on distinguishing between employees and independent contractors. For ACA large-employer calculation, franchise owners with multiple entities must follow IRS aggregation rules. Independent contractors are not considered employees for employer penalty calculation. Temporary agency workers are considered employees of the agency. Hours worked by individuals under TRICARE or certain VA health care programs are excluded from employer size calculations. Seasonal employees' hours may impact FTE calculation for large employer status. Large employers must calculate their full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) to determine their status. If the FTE calculation is above 50, the employer may exclude hours worked by seasonal employees to avoid being classified as a large employer. However, regardless of offering coverage, a large employer may face a penalty if at least one full-time employee obtains coverage through an exchange and receives a premium tax credit. Full-time employees are those working an average of 30 hours or more per week, while part-time workers are not included in penalty calculations. Large employers may face penalties under the ACA if full-time employees receive premium tax credits through an exchange. The penalty for not offering coverage is calculated based on the number of full-time employees minus 30, multiplied by $2,160 per month. Employers offering coverage must ensure it meets affordability criteria to avoid penalties. The ACA imposes penalties on large employers if full-time employees receive premium tax credits through an exchange. Penalties are based on the number of full-time employees minus 30, multiplied by $2,160 per month. Employers must offer affordable and adequate health insurance coverage to avoid penalties. The ACA employer penalty is based on the number of full-time employees working 30 hours or more per week. Regulatory guidance helps determine full-time status using 130 hours of service monthly equivalency. IRS Notice 2014-9 outlines methods for identifying full-time employees. An employer uses measurement, administrative, and stability periods to determine full-time employees for ACA compliance. The stability period ensures full-time employees identified during the measurement period receive health coverage. The IRS notice allows employers to choose different methods for determining measurement, administrative, and stability periods for different groups of workers. Ongoing employees are those employed for at least one complete standard measurement period, which is between 3 and 12 consecutive months. The employer has flexibility in determining the start and end months of the standard measurement period. During a measurement period, employers determine if employees worked an average of at least 30 hours per week. If so, they are treated as full-time during a subsequent stability period. Different measurement and stability periods can be created for various categories of employees. Employers may use an administrative period to determine ongoing employees' eligibility for health coverage. New employees are classified as variable hour employees if it's uncertain if they will work at least 30 hours per week on average. If a new employee is expected to work full-time, the employer must offer affordable health coverage within three months of their start date to avoid penalties. The ACA defines variable hour and seasonal employees based on expected work hours and duration of employment. Seasonal employees' work hours are treated differently for determining large employer status and full-time worker status under the ACA. The final regulations allow employers to use a 12-month measurement period for determining full-time status of seasonal employees, enabling firms to exclude them as full-time workers. The Treasury Department and IRS are considering additional rules for calculating hours of service for certain categories of employees like adjunct faculty and those with layover or on-call hours. Employers must use a \"reasonable method\" to credit hours of service for on-call hours, as outlined in Section 4980H of the IRC. This includes crediting hours for on-call time if the employee is paid, required to remain on-call on the employer's premises, or subject to substantial restrictions. Special rules apply for employees with challenging hours to track, such as commissioned sales staff. Certain capacities do not count as hours of service for determining full-time status. Certain capacities, such as unpaid volunteers and some nominally compensated volunteers, are excluded from ACA calculations for determining employer size or full-time status. Hours worked by students in federally subsidized positions are also excluded. However, all hours worked by student employees in other capacities must be counted for Section 4980H purposes. The Treasury Department and IRS are considering additional rules for determining hours of service. The Treasury Department and IRS are considering additional rules for determining hours of service for Section 4980H of the IRC regarding hours worked by members of religious orders. A religious order is allowed to not count work performed by individuals under a vow of poverty as full-time hours. Employers must provide affordable and adequate health insurance coverage to full-time employees and their dependents, defined as children under 26 years old. Applicable large employers can rely on an employee's representation about their children. Employer coverage is considered affordable if the employee's portion of the self-only premium for the lowest-cost health plan does not exceed 9.66% of their W-2 wages. Affordability is determined individually and does not include the cost of family plans. A plan provides adequate coverage if its actuarial value is at least 60%, including employer contributions to health savings accounts. The ACA employer mandate was delayed until 2015 by the IRS, with transition relief options available for employers. Large employers had flexibility in determining their status, an extra year to include dependent coverage, and no penalty for employers with fewer than 100 FTEs in 2015. Reporting requirements were also delayed until 2015 for large employers. In 2015, large employers were required to file a return with the IRS reporting health care coverage offered to full-time employees. They had flexibility in measuring FTEs and offering dependent coverage without penalty. Employers could qualify for dependent coverage transition relief if dependent coverage was not offered or was inadequate. For employers with fewer than 100 FTEs in 2014, the ACA employer penalty did not apply in 2015 if certain conditions were met. This relief applied if the employer maintained health care coverage and had not reduced their workforce size. Employers with 50-100 FTEs in 2014 could qualify for transition relief under the ACA. They had to maintain workforce size and health coverage from February 9, 2014, to December 31, 2015, to be eligible. Reducing workforce size for valid reasons did not disqualify them. Employers with 50-100 FTEs in 2014 could qualify for transition relief under the ACA by maintaining workforce size and health coverage from February 9, 2014, to December 31, 2015. They were not considered to have eliminated or reduced health coverage if certain conditions were met, such as offering a minimum employer contribution towards employee-only coverage. Large employers must report information about the health care coverage offered to full-time employees under Section 6056 of the IRC. They must also provide a statement to each full-time employee by January 31 of the following year. This includes details about exchanges, eligibility for premium credits, and cost-sharing subsidies. Large employers must report information to the IRS regarding health care coverage offered to full-time employees, including details about employer contributions, coverage options, and employee enrollment. This information must be provided by January 31 of the following year. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 repealed the automatic enrollment requirement for employers with more than 200 full-time employees. This provision, added by the ACA, would have required employers to automatically enroll new full-time employees in health benefits plans and provide the opportunity to opt out. In the 114th Congress, Section 4007 of P.L. 114-41 created a new requirement excluding hours worked by individuals under TRICARE or certain VA health programs from employer size calculations. Multiple bills related to the employer mandate were introduced, including H.R. 3236 and H.R. 1314."
