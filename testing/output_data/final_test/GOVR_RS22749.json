    "content": "The UIGEA was passed in 2006 as part of the SAFE Port Act to address foreign Internet gambling operations targeting U.S. customers. It prohibits accepting payments for unlawful Internet gambling but excludes financial institutions and service providers from liability. Entities involved in the operation of an Internet gambling site may face liability under UIGEA, with penalties including criminal fines up to $250,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. Civil and regulatory enforcement actions can also be taken against violators, such as injunctions and civil proceedings by the Attorney General. Financial institutions may be subject to civil suits in limited instances. Attorneys general may bring civil suits against financial institutions and Internet service providers under UIGEA to block transactions involving unlawful Internet gambling or to block access to unlawful gambling sites. UIGEA's definition of \"unlawful Internet gambling\" relies on underlying federal or state gambling laws to determine legality. The term \"unlawful Internet gambling\" refers to placing, receiving, or transmitting bets or wagers using the Internet, which is illegal under federal or state laws. Certain intrastate and intratribal Internet gambling operations are exempt, such as state lotteries and Indian casinos operating under state regulations. To qualify for the exceptions, bets must comply with state laws, including age and location verification, and not violate federal gambling laws. The intratribal exception for Internet gambling involves transmissions between lands of different tribes and may not be limited to the same state. Compliance with federal gambling laws, security, age, and location verification are still required. The definition of \"bet or wager\" under UIGEA includes staking something of value on the outcome of a contest, sporting event, or game of chance. Securities and commodities transactions are excluded from this definition. The UIGEA excludes certain activities from the definition of \"bet or wager,\" such as securities transactions, commodities transactions, and insurance contracts. It also raises questions about the Interstate Horseracing Act's impact on federal laws. The statute requires implementing regulations to be issued within 270 days. A federal appeals court ruled that UIGEA is not unconstitutionally vague in 2009. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected the claim that UIGEA was void for vagueness, stating that the Act prohibits gambling businesses from accepting certain financial instruments for online bets. The UIGEA prohibits gambling businesses from accepting certain financial instruments for online bets, referencing federal and state laws related to gambling. The Act calls for regulations to prevent restricted transactions through designated payment systems. The UIGEA prohibits online gambling businesses from accepting certain financial instruments, with regulations established to prevent restricted transactions through designated payment systems. The final rule implementing UIGEA provisions was adopted by the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department, effective January 19, 2009. The final rule implementing UIGEA provisions, effective January 19, 2009, identifies five relevant payment systems for Internet gambling: ACH, card systems, check collection systems, money transmitting business, and wire transfer systems. It defines \"restricted transactions\" as those prohibited by UIGEA, without specifying \"unlawful Internet gambling.\" The final rule implementing UIGEA provisions, effective January 19, 2009, identifies five relevant payment systems for Internet gambling: ACH, card systems, check collection systems, money transmitting business, and wire transfer systems. The rule directs participants in the designated systems to establish and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and block restricted transactions. Compliance can be achieved by adopting the policies and procedures of their payment system or by creating their own. Participants must comply with the UIGEA regulations by adopting payment system policies or creating their own. Procedures for due diligence of commercial customer accounts must be established, including assessing the risk of restricted transactions. Determinations on the risk of engaging in Internet gambling must be made based on due diligence. Participants must assess the risk of commercial customers engaging in Internet gambling. If unable to determine minimal risk, they must obtain certification from the customer. If engaged in Internet gambling, documentation of legal authority and third-party certification are required. The participant must obtain certification from commercial customers engaged in Internet gambling to ensure compliance with legal limits. Restricted transactions are prohibited, and notification must be given to customers. Payment systems involving card transactions are defined by the regulations. Merchant codes are a standard feature. Merchant codes are used to identify businesses for card transactions. Compliance with regulations is required, including screening merchants, prohibiting restricted transactions, and monitoring for compliance. Money transmitting businesses like Western Union and PayPal must also adhere to regulations, with procedures to identify subscribers' businesses. The regulations require businesses to have procedures in place to identify the nature of a subscriber's business, avoid restricted transactions, check for suspicious payment patterns, and take remedial actions when necessary. Exemptions are provided for certain payment systems to address the challenges of identifying unlawful transactions. For check collection systems, only limited information about the check is coded, with no requirement to analyze the payee information. The final rule exempts all participants in a check collection system except for the depository bank. Banks depositing or receiving checks are covered by the regulations, with examples provided for compliance in different scenarios. In domestic cases, compliant policies include due diligence in customer relations to identify business nature and prohibit tainted transactions. Wire transfer systems involve large bank transactions and customer-initiated transfers. Recipient banks determine payee business nature, with a need for additional safeguards for initiating banks. The Automated Clearing House System (ACH) is used for settling batched electronic entries for financial institutions, including recurring credit and debit transfers. Banks that receive wire transfers are covered by regulations, with compliant policies similar to those for check collection systems. Initiating banks are exempt from additional safeguards, with recipient banks responsible for identifying payee business nature and handling tainted transactions. The ACH system processes credit and debit transfers by sorting and assigning them to participating banks. Participants are identified as originating depository financial institutions (ODFI) and receiving depository financial institutions (RDFI). The final rule exempts most participants, except for the RDFI in ACH credit transactions, the ODFI in ACH debit transactions, and the receiving gateway operator for ACH debit transactions from foreign senders. These entities are not exempt to assess the nature of the beneficiary's business in tainted transactions. The ACH system operator, ODFIs in a credit transaction, and RDFIs in a debit transaction are exempt from regulations to assess the nature of the beneficiary's business in tainted transactions. Compliance policies for ACH systems are similar to those for check collection and wire transfer systems, including knowing the customer, having a no-tainted transaction agreement, and implementing remedial procedures for tainted transactions. U.S. participants processing outbound cross-border credit transactions must also follow these guidelines. The Agencies exempt U.S. participants from blocking restricted transactions in cross-border credit transactions and wire transfers due to practical limitations. Compliance with UIGEA protects financial firms from liability, with enforcement overseen by the Federal Trade Commission and federal regulators. The enactment of UIGEA had an immediate impact on Internet gambling activities, leading to agreements with payment processing companies and offshore Internet gambling businesses. Several offshore companies sought similar agreements, and large banking institutions underwrote the initial public offers for offshore Internet gambling. Several banking institutions underwrote the initial public offers for offshore Internet gambling companies on the London stock exchange. Some Internet gambling companies attempted to circumvent UIGEA's prohibitions through fraudulent methods but faced prosecution and shutdowns. For example, the founders of major Internet poker websites were indicted for federal offenses including bank fraud, conspiracy, violating UIGEA, money laundering, and operating an illegal gambling business. The indictment accused offshore Internet poker companies of disguising payments from U.S. gamblers as transactions with fake online merchants. They also persuaded struggling local banks to process payments in exchange for investments. The FBI seized domain names used for illegal poker games, effectively shutting them down. Despite attempts to repeal UIGEA, no changes have been made since its passage in 2006. Several bills in the 112th Congress aim to legalize and regulate Internet gambling, supported by members criticizing current restrictions as ineffective and a missed tax revenue opportunity. Interest groups also endorse regulation to protect consumers from fraud and societal costs associated with online gambling. The Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection, and Enforcement Act (H.R. 1174) in the 112th Congress would authorize and regulate Internet gambling, allowing operators to accept bets from individuals in the US under a licensing regime overseen by the Secretary of the Treasury. Qualified state or tribal regulatory bodies could also be involved in regulating Internet gambling facilities. H.R. 1174 would establish standards for Internet gambling licensees, including verifying customer age and location, collecting taxes, preventing fraud, and protecting privacy and security. The Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection, and Enforcement Act would establish standards for Internet gambling licensees, including age verification, tax collection, fraud prevention, and customer privacy protection. Indian tribes and states can opt out of the regime by providing notice to the Secretary of the Treasury within a specified timeframe. Customers located within the United States must have safeguards in place for processing bets or wagers made from the country. The legislation establishes standards for Internet gambling licensees, including age verification and customer privacy protection. Indian tribes and states can opt out, prohibiting customers from engaging in Internet gambling activities. The Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network must submit a list of \"unlawful Internet gambling enterprises\" within 120 days, to be posted on the Treasury Department website. Financial institutions processing transactions for licensees are provided safe harbor from liability. H.R. 1174 prohibits licensees from accepting credit cards for Internet gambling and bets on sporting events, except for pari-mutuel racing. It exempts state or tribal lottery Internet gambling. Representative McDermott introduced a companion bill for licensing fees for Internet gambling operators. H.R. 2230 proposes a 2% monthly Internet gambling license fee on deposits, leveling the playing field between online and land-based casinos. States and tribes can also collect a 6% fee on deposits from customers in their jurisdiction. Introduced by Representative Joe Barton, the Internet Gambling Prohibition, Poker Consumer Protection, and Strengthening UIGEA Act of 2011 (H.R. 2366) would legalize and regulate interstate Internet poker only. Operators would need a license from state or tribal gambling oversight commissions approved by the Office of Internet Poker Oversight within the U.S. Department of Commerce. This fee would exempt licensees from other fees or taxes related to online gambling services. H.R. 2366, introduced by Representative Joe Barton, aims to legalize and regulate interstate Internet poker. Qualified state or tribal agencies must comply with specified standards to participate in the licensing program. The bill allows states and Indian tribes to \"opt out\" of the license regime by informing the Secretary of Commerce of any limitations on bets or wagers for Internet poker. H.R. 2366 aims to legalize interstate Internet poker, requiring safeguards to prevent underage gambling and fraud. The federal Wire Act prohibits the use of interstate telephone facilities for transmitting bets, with differing interpretations on its application to online gambling. The U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division has maintained that the Wire Act applies to non-sports gambling, including non-sports Internet gambling, which discouraged states from legalizing Internet gambling. However, in late 2011, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel reversed its interpretation, allowing states like Illinois and New York to sell lottery tickets online without violating the Wire Act. The Office of Legal Counsel's opinion stated that non-sports Internet gambling falls outside the reach of the Wire Act, potentially leading to an increase in online gambling activities. States may now form compacts to operate online gambling across state lines. Most states allow some form of gambling, with a few expressly outlawing Internet gambling. Some states are considering online gambling as a way to generate revenue without raising taxes due to budget deficits. Several states are considering legalizing Internet gambling to raise revenue without increasing taxes. The District of Columbia became the first jurisdiction to legalize intrastate Internet gambling in 2011, but the law was later repealed due to criticism of the approval process. In 2011, the District of Columbia legalized intrastate Internet gambling, but the law was repealed in 2012. Nevada and New Jersey also made moves towards legalizing online gambling, with Nevada becoming the first state to allow Internet poker. New Jersey is currently progressing a bill to permit Atlantic City casinos to accept online bets. Utah prohibits Internet gambling within its borders and opts out of federal licensing regime. Iowa explores state regulation of intrastate Internet poker, with potential revenue of $3-13 million per year. Iowa senate approves measure allowing casinos and racetracks to offer Internet poker."
