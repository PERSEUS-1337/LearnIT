    "content": "The report discusses the District of Columbia Council's authority to implement the Education Reform Bill, which aims to reorganize the District of Columbia Board of Education and delegate authority over public schools to the mayor. It also considers the extent to which Congress would need to legislate for this reorganization. The D.C. Council has broad legislative power over District affairs, but limitations exist, such as the inability to amend the Home Rule Act without specific authorization. This could impact the implementation of the Education Reform Bill, requiring congressional action. The Education Reform Bill proposes significant limitations on the control of the District of Columbia Board of Education over public schools. The District of Columbia Council may have the authority to amend this portion of the Home Rule Act, as it has the power for governmental reorganization under \u00a7 404(b) of the Act. The Education Reform Bill proposes reorganizing public schools as a cabinet-level agency, separate from the District of Columbia Board of Education. The District of Columbia Council may have the authority to amend this portion of the Home Rule Act. The District of Columbia Board of Education, established in 1906 by Congress, had its method of selection changed in 1968 to election by District citizens. The Home Rule Act later designated it as one of five independent agencies with control over educational policy and teacher appointments. The District of Columbia Board of Education, established in 1906 by Congress, had its method of selection changed in 1968 to election by District citizens. The Board retained all authority granted by Congress, including \"control of the public schools.\" In 2000, the D.C. Council passed the School Governance Charter Amendment Act, allowing a referendum to change the size and authority of the Board by amending the Home Rule Act. This referendum was authorized under the Charter amendment process, giving the Council the power to amend Title IV of the Home Rule Act. The legislation passed in 2000 addressed the implementation date of the School Governance Charter Amendment Act but did not authorize reorganization. The current procedures for electing and appointing the Board of Education follow the 2000 amendment, not the original Home Rule Act. Future reorganizations, such as under the Education Reform Bill, would likely be valid. There is no case law on whether the D.C. Council can reorganize the Board under the Home Rule Act, but related case law may be relevant. In Shook v. District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, the Court of Appeals considered the Control Board's authority to reduce the Board of Education's powers during a fiscal emergency in 1995. Congress established the Control Board with broad powers to improve District government operations in response to the emergency. The Control Board issued an order reorganizing the administration of the District's public schools, establishing a nine-member Emergency Transitional Education Board of Trustees with full authority over the school system. The Board of Education was left with limited powers to license charter schools and provide advice. The Control Board reorganized the District's public schools, giving full authority to a new Emergency Transitional Education Board of Trustees. The Board of Education was left with limited powers to license charter schools and provide advice, leading to a challenge by school board members regarding the Control Board's authority over independent agencies like the Board of Education. The Control Board argued that \"any agency\" in the FRMAA includes independent agencies like the Board of Education. The D.C. Circuit agreed, citing the Act's preamble and legislative history to support a broad interpretation of the term \"agency.\" Congress did not intend to exclude independent agencies from the Control Board's power under the Act. The court concluded that the term \"agency\" in the FRMAA should include independent agencies, as supported by the Act's preamble and legislative history. This interpretation aligns with the use of the term \"agency\" in other provisions of the Home Rule Act and the District of Columbia Code. The D.C. Council's power extends to any \"office, agency, department, or instrumentality of the government,\" which is broad and comprehensive. The legislative history for the Home Rule Act indicates that independent agencies are subject to the authority of the Council. The D.C. Council has the authority to make changes in the function of independent agencies established by the Home Rule Act. The Board of Education and the Election Board were not specifically mentioned, but there is no clear distinction to suggest exclusion. The Education Reform Bill may require congressional action for budget amendments in the District of Columbia. The Education Reform Bill aims to amend the budget authority for D.C. schools by allowing the Mayor and Council to establish the maximum funds for the Board of Education without specifying how the funds are used. The D.C. Council has the power to reorganize independent agencies, potentially affecting the Board of Education's funding allocation. The Education Reform Bill proposes changes to the budget authority for D.C. schools, allowing the Mayor and Council to set funding limits for the Board of Education without specifying how the funds are spent. The D.C. Council could potentially reorganize independent agencies, impacting the Board of Education's budget allocation. The Education Reform Bill proposes changes to the budget authority for D.C. schools, allowing the Mayor and Council to set funding limits for the Board of Education without specifying how the funds are spent. The budget plan must detail how funds will be allocated to each school, with specific descriptions of funds available for school spending decisions and other responsibility center funds benefiting the school. Congress intended to restrict the D.C. Council and mayor from directing funds to individual public schools. The D.C. Council has authority to reorganize independent agencies like the Board of Education, but may not have budgetary authority to allocate funds to individual schools or delegate such authority to the mayor. Congressional implementation may be necessary to address public schools budget restrictions under the Home Rule Act."
