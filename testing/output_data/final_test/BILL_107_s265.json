    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"MTBE Elimination Act\". Findings and sense of the Senate are included in the Act. Congress finds that a single cup of MTBE can contaminate 5 million gallons of water, MTBE easily transfers from gasoline to air to water, and exposure to MTBE has been linked to tumors and nervous system disorders in animals. Exposure to MTBE during pregnancy can result in maternal toxicity. The Health Effects Institute reported in February 1996 that studies support MTBE's classification as a neurotoxicant with possible adverse effects on a developing fetus. Higher levels of MTBE in the bloodstream are linked to symptoms like headaches, eye irritation, and nausea. MTBE also reduces the efficiency of technologies used to clean water contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons. The costs of remediating MTBE water contamination in the United States could reach billions of dollars. Studies are ongoing to find cost-efficient solutions for cleaning drinking water contaminated by MTBE, but no practical engineering solutions have been found yet. Remediation of MTBE-contaminated drinking water can cost millions of dollars per municipality, with industrial cleanups averaging around $150,000. The reformulated gasoline program under the Clean Air Act has led to significant reductions in emissions from motor vehicles. Ethanol is considered an effective fuel-blending component that reduces carbon monoxide emissions and provides high octane. Ethanol is a viable alternative to reduce the use of aromatics in gasoline, leading to emissions reductions and air quality benefits. The Department of Agriculture found that ethanol production can be expanded to meet the needs of the reformulated gasoline program without significant price impacts or supply interruptions. Research efforts should focus on infrastructure challenges to allow ethanol to meet program requirements as MTBE is phased out. The Senate supports the EPA providing assistance for testing and remediation of drinking water contaminated with MTBE as part of the reformulated gasoline program. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the head of the EPA. An \"eligible grantee\" includes federal research agencies, national laboratories, universities, private research organizations, and state environmental research facilities. \"MTBE\" stands for methyl tertiary butyl ether. SEC. 4. USE AND LABELING OF MTBE AS A FUEL ADDITIVE. Section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to prohibit the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether as a fuel additive. Retailers selling gasoline containing MTBE must label the fuel dispensing system with information about MTBE. The Administrator will establish regulations for a phased reduction in the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether as a fuel additive over a 3-year period. Grants for research on MTBE groundwater contamination and remediation. The Environmental Protection Agency established a MTBE research grants program to fund research on developing cost-effective testing methods, remediation procedures, and studying the effects of MTBE on human health. The Administrator will accept proposals, determine their relevance and merit when making grants under this program. The Environmental Protection Agency established a MTBE research grants program to fund research on testing methods, remediation procedures, and studying the effects of MTBE on human health. Grants will be awarded based on merit, quality, relevance, and availability of matching funds. Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis for a term not exceeding 4 years. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2005."
