    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 10 of the Health and Safety Code establishes the Workplace Charging Stations Grant Program, providing grants to commercial property owners or lessees for installing electric vehicle charging stations in parking facilities. Eligible applicants can receive $2,500 for the first Level 2 charging port and $500 for each additional port until January 1, 2021. The Workplace Charging Stations Grant Program offers grants of up to $6,000 per facility. The state board considers cost effectiveness, timely completion, and economic benefits when reviewing grant applications. Priority is given to installations that provide free charging for at least three years or are available 24/7 to employees and the public. The Workplace Charging Stations Grant Program offers grants for charging stations in disadvantaged communities near major traffic corridors. Eligible applicants must report annually on charging session details, electricity usage, plug-in time, downtime for maintenance, and repair events. The state board must submit annual reports to the Legislature on the Workplace Charging Stations Grant Program, detailing data on charging station maintenance and repair events, program benefits, and recommendations for improvements. The program will be in effect until January 1, 2022, unless extended or deleted by a later statute. Section 44270.3 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define terms related to the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program. Definitions include \"benefit-cost score,\" \"commission,\" and \"full fuel-cycle assessment.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the program's evaluation criteria and environmental impact assessment. The curr_chunk provides definitions related to the Air Quality Improvement Program, including terms like \"vehicle technology\" and \"benefit-cost score\" which are essential for evaluating projects' emission reductions. The curr_chunk defines a \"Project\" as a category of investments for potential funding by the board, including grants, loans, guarantees, vouchers, rebates, and other funding measures for specific vehicles, equipment, technologies, or initiatives authorized by Section 44274."
