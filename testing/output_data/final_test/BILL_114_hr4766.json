FINDINGS.\" Congress makes findings regarding the capture of Guam and Wake Island by Japan during World War II, the surrender of soldiers from the United States and the Philippines, and the atrocities suffered by prisoners at the hands of the Japanese. During World War II, soldiers from the United States and the Philippines were taken prisoner and forced to march 65 miles without food, water, or medical care in the Bataan Death March. Thousands died from starvation, lack of medical care, exhaustion, or abuse by their captors. On May 6, 1942, Corregidor fell after a siege, and on May 10, 1942, American forces under Major General William F. Sharp surrendered in Mindanao. General Wainwright surrendered all Allied Forces in the Philippine Archipelago on the same day. During World War II, prisoners from the United States faced harsh conditions at Camp O'Donnell, leading to increased disease and malnutrition. They were later transferred by sea in overcrowded cargo holds on \"Hell Ships\", resulting in many deaths from asphyxia, starvation, and dysentery. Over 3,300 prisoners died at sea during these journeys. During World War II, prisoners from the United States faced harsh conditions at Camp O'Donnell and were later transferred to Santo Tomas Internment Camp. The prisoners suffered from mistreatment, malnutrition, and lack of medical care until their liberation in 1945. After their release, they formed support groups and were honored in memorials in the United States. The people of the United States are indebted to the men and women who showed courage and perseverance during World War II, fighting against enemy soldiers and enduring capture, imprisonment, and atrocious conditions with dignity, honor, patriotism, and loyalty. The Congressional Gold Medal is awarded to honor the courage and perseverance of individuals during World War II. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for the award of a gold medal to American military personnel who fought in defense of various locations in the Philippines during World War II. The medal will be designed by the Secretary of the Treasury and will honor their sacrifice and service. Following the award of the gold medal to American military personnel who fought in the Philippines during World War II, the medal will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research. Congress suggests that the Institution should also display the medal at other locations associated with the military prisoners. SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\nThe Secretary may strike bronze duplicates of the gold medal and sell them to cover costs.\n\nSEC. 4. NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\nMedals made under this Act are considered National medals."
