    "content": "The U.S. congressional objectives and concerns regarding Chinese labor focus on supporting labor rights in China and preventing the importation of goods made under poor labor conditions. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China was established to monitor compliance with international human rights standards, including worker rights. Legislation has been introduced to require U.S. companies in foreign countries to implement corporate codes of conduct related to labor rights. In 2002, the CECC and USCC recommended actions to improve labor rights and working conditions in China, including establishing corporate codes of conduct for U.S. businesses operating in China. The U.S. supports labor rights and rule of law programs in China through foreign operations. The U.S. supports labor rights and rule of law programs in China through foreign operations, including grants to organizations like the National Endowment for Democracy and the Asia Foundation. These organizations work on legal development, civil society, and local governance in China, with a focus on internationally recognized labor rights. The Department of Labor awarded a $2.3 million grant to the National Safety Council to improve safety in Chinese coal mines and promote awareness of labor laws among workers and employers. Foreign-owned factories in China's coastal provinces, mainly owned by investors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea, have been reported for labor exploitation. These factories produce toys, shoes, and apparel for American companies, employing around 23 million workers, mostly women. Approximately 10% of the urban labor force in China, around 23 million workers, are employed in foreign-owned factories mainly located in coastal provinces. Most workers are young women from rural areas and face severe labor rights abuses such as long work hours, lack of fair compensation, and restrictions on movement. Many workers are unaware of their legal rights and fear protesting due to the risk of losing their jobs or benefits. Dozens of workers die each year from overwork, according to local reports and government statistics. According to PRC government statistics, thousands of workers die annually in industrial accidents, with many cases of occupational diseases reported. Foreign enterprises often do not fully compensate employees for work-related injuries or provide adequate medical care. Labor abuses in some foreign firms include verbal humiliation, physical punishment, and restrictions on movement. The PRC has been slow to address labor rights in the private sector, attempting to improve conditions through the installation of enterprise unions. The People's Republic of China has set up enterprise unions in 40% of newly founded overseas companies to address labor disputes. The ACFTU represents both labor and the state, with most union leaders appointed by the Communist Party. Despite resistance from local officials and foreign investors, the government aims to promote unionization. In 2001, China ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, allowing the right to organize and form independent trade unions. However, China interprets the covenant in line with its constitution, labor law, and trade union law, permitting only the ACFTU. The covenant also emphasizes safe working conditions and workplace equality. In 2001, the National People's Congress amended the Trade Union Law to enhance the ACFTU's role in defending workers' interests. In 2002, the NPC passed laws on Work Safety, Prevention of Occupational Diseases, and handling dangerous chemicals. The ACFTU issued the \"Blue Book of Chinese Trade Unions\" in 2003 to explain workers' rights. Local officials sometimes ignore labor regulations to attract foreign investment. Non-governmental advocates for workers in China include the press, NGOs, researchers, and labor rights attorneys like Zhou Litai, who has represented many migrant workers in legal cases. Labor rights activists in Shenzhen, Guangdong province face harassment by local authorities. China has ratified 23 conventions, including three of the International Labor Organization's core conventions. In 2002, China ratified three ILO conventions on child labor, safety and health in construction, and labor administration. China is preparing to ratify a convention on discrimination. In 2001, the ILO and China signed a memorandum of understanding to improve labor practices and collaboration. In 2002, China was the third largest source of imports to the United States, with imports valued at $125 billion. The United States is the second largest single investor in China after Hong Kong, with investments in various sectors. American-operated manufacturing facilities in China offer good working conditions and high wages. However, much of the production of low-end goods for U.S. labels is contracted through other foreign investors. Toys, footwear, and apparel items made up about 25% of all U.S. imports from China in 2002. Many U.S. brand companies and retailers sourcing goods from China have adopted codes of conduct to ensure acceptable working conditions based on international labor standards and OSHA regulations. Non-compliance may lead to contract termination by U.S. buyers. Multi-stakeholder programs and individual corporate codes are used to monitor and certify U.S. companies for compliance with international labor rights standards. China's labor laws generally meet international benchmarks, but enforcement levels vary. Some argue that third-party auditors are more effective in ensuring compliance than in-house auditors. Independent monitoring organizations in China include Bureau Veritas and Global. Labor codes of conduct have led to improvements in some large factories in China, but there are issues with monitoring and verification, such as lack of transparency and subcontracting to companies without a code of conduct. Only one code addresses the problem of subcontracting, with Disney forbidding the use of subcontractors without written consent. Labor codes of conduct in China aim to ensure acceptable labor conditions and product quality by prohibiting manufacturers from using subcontractors without written consent. However, economic pressures in China, such as migrant labor suppressing wages and competition for foreign investment, often undermine the effectiveness of these codes. The Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee reported that global competition in the toy industry has led to shorter delivery times and lower prices, worsening labor exploitation. They recommended fair buying practices and reasonable prices for toys. Comparing 11 codes of conduct, including multi-stakeholder and company codes, as well as an industry code. The problem of underage workers in foreign invested enterprises (FIEs) in China is less than in rural areas. Export-oriented factories prefer hiring youthful workers, creating opportunities for underage Chinese to gain employment. Some reports indicate teenagers using fake IDs to work in foreign-owned assembly plants, with codes of conduct setting minimum age restrictions. Nike prohibits hiring workers under 18 for footwear, with higher standards if legal minimum age or compulsory education age is higher. SA8000 and ICTI prescribe a minimum age of 14 in developing countries. Mattel and Reebok codes require thorough identity document checks. The Ethical Trading Initiative and Mattel require employees under 18 to be exempt from hazardous duties. Chinese labor laws prohibit hiring workers under 16, with special protections for workers aged 16-18. Various codes prohibit forced labor practices, such as withholding wages and charging fees. Mattel requires written consent for employment and overtime, while Reebok prohibits the use of \"administrative detainees\" in supplier factories. The ICTI code emphasizes that workers should be free to choose employment. The ICTI code and Chinese labor laws protect workers' rights, including the freedom to leave after their shift ends. Codes also prohibit corporal punishment, harassment, and discrimination. Reebok's code specifically mentions not restricting workers' movement in various areas. In China, it is illegal for employers to insult or physically punish workers. Discrimination standards in various codes range from none to detailed regulations, protecting factors like age, ethnicity, gender, race, and religion. Some codes also include disability, sexual orientation, and union affiliation. External codes like SA8000, ETI, FLA, and WRC impose strict discrimination standards, while Nike and ICTI codes lack provisions on discrimination. China's Labor Law prohibits discrimination based on nationality, sex, race, and religious beliefs, with WRC and ICTI recognizing rights of pregnant women. WRC standards offer extensive protections for women, including forbidding firing of pregnant women and prohibiting forced contraception. The codes protect women from being fired, ensure equal pay, and address health and safety issues in the workplace. Standards cover areas like work environment, sanitation, and hazardous materials management. Regulations include national laws, International Labor Organization conventions, and OSHA rules. Some codes also require safety features on machines, health and safety training, and procedures for documenting injuries. Reebok follows these standards. Reebok follows detailed health and safety codes that protect workers' rights, including the right to refuse dangerous operations and criticize employers for harmful acts. Various codes promote environmentally-safe practices and the assignment of trained personnel for managing hazardous waste. Workers are also granted the rights to join trade unions and bargain collectively without fear of retribution. The SA8000 code ensures these freedoms are upheld, even where prohibited by law. In China, workers lack union representation in many private and foreign enterprises, and independent organization is not allowed by the government. Collective contracts are mainly for state-owned enterprises, with limited negotiation on pay, working hours, and other issues. Reebok successfully advocated for labor rights in Taiwanese-owned companies in 2001 and 2002. In 2001 and 2002, Reebok influenced Taiwanese-owned suppliers in China to hold free elections for trade union representatives, a first in China. Labor codes in Chinese factories limit work hours to 60 per week, with a maximum of 48 regular hours and 12 voluntary overtime hours. Some codes allow exceptions for extraordinary circumstances, while the SA8000 code permits mandatory overtime under collective bargaining agreements. Mattel, Wal-Mart, and ICTI require compliance with local laws on working hours. China's Labor Law mandates a 40-hour work week with one day off every seven days and limits overtime to 3 hours per day or 36 hours per month. Wages in China's labor-intensive industries attract migrants from rural areas with low incomes. Multi-stakeholder codes like SA8000, ETI, and WRC include clauses for \"basic needs\" or \"living wage\" and require written pay policies and accurate pay statements. Some codes of conduct include standards for overtime pay, rest day compensation, and holiday pay rates. Compliance guidelines vary, with some codes lacking detailed provisions. Disney's code emphasizes rigorous on-site inspections, while Nike requires inspections as well. Some codes of conduct lack detailed provisions for inspections, with Nike requiring inspections with or without prior notice. Wal-Mart only specifies \"personal interviews\" for monitoring. Few codes call for third-party auditors, while others mention self-monitoring."
