    "content": "The Uruguay Round Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) defines geographical indications as indications that identify a product's origin in a specific territory, region, or locality. Examples include Roquefort cheese, Idaho potatoes, Champagne, and Tuscan olive oil. Geographical indications protect consumers from deceptive labels and provide producers with recognition and commercial value. Geographical indications are commercially valuable intellectual property eligible for relief from infringement. The use of geographical indications for wines and dairy products is a contentious international trade issue. The TRIPS Agreement provides protection for geographical indications and requires WTO members to prevent misleading use and unfair competition. Members must refuse registration of misleading trademarks containing geographical indications. The TRIPS Agreement provides protection for geographical indications for wines and spirits, requiring WTO members to prevent misuse and misleading use. Registration of misleading trademarks for wines or spirits must be refused. WTO members are negotiating a multilateral system for notification and registration of geographical indications for wines. During the Uruguay Round multilateral negotiations, the EU and Switzerland proposed higher protection for geographical indications and a multilateral registry. They aimed to eliminate exceptions allowing the use of names like Chablis or Champagne based on prior or good faith use. During the Uruguay Round negotiations, the EU and Switzerland proposed stronger protection for geographical indications, aiming to eliminate exceptions for names like Chablis or Champagne. The United States suggested limited protections, such as registration of certification marks and guaranteeing protection for non-generic wine appellations. The resulting TRIPS compromise favored the EU's expansive proposals over the US's more modest ones. In the United States, geographical indications are protected under the U.S. Trademark Act through registration as certification marks for goods or services originating in a specific geographic region, including foreign indications like \"ROQUEFORT\" for French cheese. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) protects specific geographical indications like Bourbon Whiskey, Tennessee Whiskey, Canadian Whiskey, Tequila, and Mezcal. The D'Amato amendment allows the use of \"semi-generic\" names for wines with the true place of origin indicated. The Doha Development Agenda is considering negotiations for a multilateral registry for wine and spirits and extending protections for agricultural geographical indications. The EU has proposed a multilateral system of notification and registration for geographical indications in the context of the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations. Participation would be voluntary, but the multilateral registry would have a mandatory effect, creating obligations for WTO member countries to grant exclusive rights for individual geographic indications. The EU proposal suggests a multilateral registry for geographical indications, with mandatory effect, requiring countries to grant exclusive rights unless challenged in WTO dispute settlement. Benefits include providing information on protected indications, operationalizing TRIPS Article 23 for wines and spirits, and enhancing transparency in international trade. Concerns have been raised by the United States, Japan, Chile, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and others about potential new administrative burdens. The EU proposes a multilateral registry for geographical indications with mandatory effect, aiming to protect specific terms for wines. The US and EU are negotiating a bilateral wine agreement, with the EU seeking to end US use of \"semi-generic\" names and protect traditional wine terms, while the US aims to gain acceptance for its wine-making practices. EU regulations currently block a significant amount of US wine sales in the EU. The EU is blocking a substantial amount of U.S. wine sales due to regulations. Australia and Canada have bilateral wine agreements with the EU, agreeing to phase out generic names allowed under U.S. law. There is a debate in the TRIPS Council about extending geographical indications protection beyond wines and spirits, with proposals from the EU and other countries. The EU and other countries are pushing for increased protection for geographical indications of agricultural products to promote trade and quality agricultural products. Negotiations are ongoing in the TRIPS Council, with the EU linking this issue to agricultural trade negotiations. The United States and other countries argue that current TRIPS protection is sufficient for market access. The debate over extending protection for geographical indications of agricultural products is reflected in the U.S. request for consultations with the EU on EU regulations for the protection of geographical indications. The U.S. argues that the EU regulations violate TRIPS by imposing new administrative costs and legal obligations. The U.S. request, joined by Australia, challenges EU regulations for geographical indications, arguing they violate TRIPS by requiring specific bilateral agreements. This could create issues for U.S. trademark owners, such as Budweiser beer, if Czech Republic registers the name as a protected geographical indication in the EU. Discussions on geographical indications will be held at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun. The Chairman of the Agriculture negotiating group at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun has highlighted geographical indications for agricultural products as an unresolved issue. Congress is closely monitoring the Doha negotiations and the House Agriculture Committee is holding oversight hearings on the protection of geographical indications. If negotiations lead to agreements requiring changes in U.S. law on geographical indications, Congress would pass legislation under expedited procedures established in the Trade Act of 2002."
