    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protecting Girls' Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act\" or the \"Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act\". Congress finds that in 2017, over 65 million people were displaced globally due to disasters and conflicts, with more than 21 million being refugees. More than half of the displaced population are children, and nearly 4 million school-aged displaced children lack access to primary education. Education provides opportunities and stability for displaced individuals, especially women and girls who are at risk of trafficking. The Victims Protection Act of 2000 addresses issues like child marriage, sexual exploitation, and economic disenfranchisement, aiming to support long-term recovery and economic opportunities for displaced people and their host communities. Displaced children often struggle to access educational services, with less than 2 percent of global emergency aid directed towards education in 2016. Congress emphasizes the importance of ensuring access to education for displaced children, especially girls, to combat extremism, reduce exploitation, and alleviate poverty. It also highlights the need to consider the educational needs of vulnerable women and girls in US foreign assistance policies and programs. The United States aims to partner with other countries and organizations to ensure displaced children have access to education. Efforts include enhancing training for governments hosting displaced people and evaluating programs' impact on girls, particularly in reducing child marriage. The United States aims to partner with countries hosting displaced people to promote the inclusion of displaced children in educational systems and develop innovative approaches for providing safe educational opportunities. This includes extending school hours and increasing the number of teachers to educate more children. The United States aims to support educational services for displaced children in partnership with host countries, promoting inclusion in educational systems and developing innovative approaches for safe educational opportunities. The Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development are authorized to prioritize programs that provide safe education for displaced children, prevent discrimination against displaced girls seeking education, and increase access to educational and economic opportunities for displaced children. They are also authorized to coordinate with the World Bank. The Secretary and the Administrator are authorized to coordinate with the World Bank, United Nations, and other organizations to collect data on displaced people's access to education and economic activity. They can also work with private sector and civil society to promote safe education for displaced children. During the 5-year period after the enactment of this Act, reports to Congress on foreign assistance programs for disaster relief must include beneficiary demographics, benefits for displaced people, and educational services for displaced girls. Attest: KAREN L. HAAS, Clerk."
