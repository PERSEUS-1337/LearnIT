    "content": "Armenia has made unsteady progress towards democratization since gaining independence in 1991. International observers, including the COE, OSCE, EU, and the US, criticized the 2003 elections as not free and fair. The May 2007 legislative election was crucial for future relations, with significant events leading up to it, such as constitutional amendments in 2005 strengthening the role of the legislature. Amendments to the election law also played a role in the legislative process. In 2006, amendments to the election law in Armenia increased the legislative term to five years and restricted voting for citizens outside the country during elections. The Rule of Law Party left the ruling coalition in May 2006, strengthening the Republican Party of Armenia and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. The Prosperous Armenia Party, led by Gagik Tsarukyan, gained popularity in 2004. In 2007, Prime Minister Margoyan passed away, and Defense Minister Serzh Sargisyan was appointed as the new prime minister by President Kocharyan. Sargisyan led the Republican Party of Armenia in the campaign for seats, with the Central Electoral Commission registering 23 parties and one electoral bloc. Armenia registered 23 parties and one electoral bloc for the legislative election. Campaigning began on April 8 and ended on May 10. The Pan-Armenian National Movement dropped out in late April, calling for other opposition parties to follow suit. The National Democratic Union refused to participate, citing concerns of fraud. The political campaign was mostly calm, with some exceptions including explosions at party offices and arrests of opposition members on money laundering charges. The Disobedience Movement faced police force on May 9, resulting in injuries. Kocharyan accused Artur Baghdasaryan of \"betrayal\" for discussing election critiques with a British diplomat. Media coverage favored pro-government parties, with a focus on personalities over programs during the election campaign. The recent election in Armenia focused on domestic issues like rural development, education, and healthcare. The voter turnout was around 60%, with the Republican Party gaining more seats. The Prosperous Armenia Party did not perform as well as expected, and the United Labor Party failed to gain any seats. Opposition parties won fewer seats compared to the previous legislature, despite receiving a significant portion of the popular vote. Kocharyan praised the election as \"free, fair, and transparent,\" but pledged to address any shortcomings or violations that occurred. Observers from the OSCE, COE, and the EU praised Armenia's legislative elections for improvements and adherence to democratic standards. They noted inclusive candidate registration, dynamic campaigning, and a calm voting atmosphere. Concerns were raised about pro-government party dominance in electoral commissions, low candidate numbers in races, and inaccurate campaign finance disclosures. Instances of voter fraud and vote-buying were reported. Further assessments by observers highlighted additional concerns. The OSCE/COE/EU observers raised concerns about vote-counting problems potentially damaging public confidence in the election results. Opposition parties' inability to form a coalition and win seats raises questions about their future viability. The losing parties blamed their marginalization on being outspent, voter apathy, and electoral fraud. The opposition parties called for the election to be voided due to allegations of electoral fraud. The Central Election Commission assured that the vote count was normal, with only a few complaints received. Despite some cases resulting in criminal charges, only one involved falsification of election results. The opposition continued to demand a new election through rallies. Opposition parties held rallies on May 25 and June 1 to demand a new election in Armenia. The Republican Party's strong showing in the legislative election positions Prime Minister Sargisyan as a front runner for the 2008 presidential election. Analysts suggest that opposition parties may appeal to Armenian cynicism about electoral results and urge support for alternative candidates. There are concerns that opposition parties may fail to cooperate and field multiple presidential candidates, potentially fracturing the opposition vote. The upcoming election is seen as significant due to the enhanced constitutional powers of the legislature. The Republican Party of Armenia seeks to form a coalition government to increase legislative support and influence in the run-up to the presidential race. This move comes after the party's near-majority win in the recent legislative election, which positions Prime Minister Sargisyan as a front runner for the 2008 presidential election. The enhanced constitutional powers of the legislature are seen as significant in shaping the country's future political landscape. The Republican Party of Armenia aims to form a coalition government to boost legislative support and influence ahead of the presidential race. Plans to challenge government policies and counter non-\"constructive\" opposition parties may lead to clashes between Kocharyan and Sargisyan. Observers predict cooperation between the two leaders, who have a history in the conflict over Nagorno Karabakh, to achieve their political goals. The Republican Party of Armenia aims to form a coalition government to boost legislative support ahead of the presidential race. Kocharyan and Sargisyan may cooperate in negotiations with Azerbaijan to settle the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. Russia showed interest in the election outcome, with high-level officials visiting Armenia. Election observers judged the election as \"free and fair.\" European institutions like OSCE, COE, and the EU were inclined to accept Armenia's electoral outcome as progressive, leading to increased assistance and ties. German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the elections as fair and expressed support for deepening cooperation with Armenia. The Bush Administration also saw the election as a step towards democratization. The U.S. State Department noted improvements compared to past elections. The State Department praised Armenia's electoral progress but urged aggressive investigation of allegations of wrongdoing. Armenia's election may rank it with Georgia in democratization in the South Caucasus region, potentially deepening ties with NATO members and serving as an exemplar to local democracy advocates. Progress in elections is a condition for continued Millennium Challenge Account assistance. Armenia's low standing on \"political rights\" was raised as a problem when a $235.65 million MCA assistance compact was concluded with the United States in March 2006. After the latest election, Armenia's score on political rights may improve, making it a potential MCA \"co-partner in development.\" Congress has supported democratization efforts in Armenia with $225 million in foreign assistance from FY1992 through FY2006. Representatives Frank Pallone and Joe Knollenberg of the Congressional Armenia Caucus sent a letter in May 2007. Representatives Pallone and Knollenberg of the Congressional Armenia Caucus praised Armenia's recent election as \"free and fair,\" highlighting its positive impact on U.S.-Armenia relations and international reputation. Pallone also emphasized the effectiveness of U.S. democratization aid and urged Millennium Challenge to fully fund its compact with Armenia promptly."
