It also addressed issues such as securities fraud, penalties for violating securities laws, insider trading blackouts, and protections for corporate whistleblowers. Section 404, Management Assessment of Internal Controls, is a controversial provision of the act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires companies to maintain internal control structures for financial reporting and assess their effectiveness. Registered public accounting firms must attest to and report on the management's assessment. This provision has faced criticism for being burdensome and costly for small and medium-sized companies. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, criticized for being burdensome and costly for small and medium-sized companies, has faced opposition due to extreme costs.

The SEC adopted rule changes on December 15, 2006, giving smaller firms more time to comply with Section 404's internal controls reporting requirements.

The bills introduced in the 109th Congress aimed to amend Section 404, requiring public accounting firms to attest to and report on management assessments of issuers every three years.

The bills introduced in the 109th Congress aimed to amend Section 404, requiring public accounting firms to attest to and report on management assessments of issuers every three years. The bills would have permitted smaller public companies to be exempt from Section 404 if they met certain criteria. Additionally, the SEC and the Board would have been required to conduct studies on competition for audit performance and compare principles-based guidance from Great Britain to Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. Several other bills affecting compliance with Section 404 were introduced in subsequent Congresses. In the 110th and 111th Congress, bills were introduced to provide exemptions for small companies from Section 404 requirements. H.R. 3817, the Investor Protection Act, included a clause exempting businesses with a market capitalization up to $75 million from auditing requirements. The SEC would study ways to reduce compliance burden for companies valued between $75 million and $250 million. This bill was included in the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009.

The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) was passed in response to bills introduced in the 112th Congress, allowing certain companies with over $75 million in capital to be exempt from certain provisions of federal securities laws. Section 103 of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies with less than $1 billion in annual revenue from auditing requirements for up to five years.
