    "content": "The development of oil and natural gas resources in the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) has sparked debate in Congress. The NWRS, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, includes numerous national wildlife refuges and wetland management districts. Concerns about oil and gas wells in the NWRS revolve around private property rights, economic benefits, and potential environmental impacts on wildlife. Some view these activities as conflicting with the NWRS mission, while others see them as compatible. The debate over oil and gas activities in the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) involves balancing conservation concerns with economic benefits. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service aims to manage oil and gas activities in the NWRS while minimizing impacts on natural resources. In 2016, FWS issued a final rule to update regulations for nonfederal oil and gas rights in the NWRS. The 115th Congress has considered regulating nonfederal oil and gas activities in the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) and enacted legislation for a federal oil and gas program in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. Oil and gas operations on refuge lands often involve nonfederal resources when surface rights are owned by FWS but mineral rights remain in nonfederal ownership. FWS regulates these activities based on statutory authorities in a 2016 final rule and sections of the FWS Service Manual. Leasing and development of federally owned resources within the NWRS is typically prohibited, but federal leases and development may exist on refuge lands in certain cases. The administration of federal oil and gas resources in the NWRS is delegated to the Bureau of Land Management under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. BLM administers federal oil and gas leasing with regulations requiring FWS concurrence for oil and gas operations to protect wildlife populations and habitat. Oil and gas activities in Alaskan NWRS units are administered by FWS for nonfederal operations and by BLM for federal operations. The administration of federal oil and gas resources in the NWRS is typically delegated to the Bureau of Land Management. Alaskan activities are managed according to Alaska-specific laws, including ANILCA and ANCSA. The report discusses recent developments related to oil and gas wells in the NWRS, both federal and nonfederal, and highlights issues for Congress to consider. It includes information on the number and location of wells, compatibility with NWRS purposes, and regulatory mechanisms. President Trump signed P.L. 115-97 into law, creating an oil and gas program in a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. The law allows for at least two oil and gas lease sales in the next 10 years on the refuge's Coastal Plain, with limited surface development to 2,000 acres. Proponents argue that the program will boost economic activity and contribute to U.S. energy production. The oil and gas program in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is a contentious issue. Proponents argue it will boost economic activity, contribute to U.S. energy security, and generate royalty revenues. Opponents believe the region's reserves are not necessary for energy independence and development will harm the refuge's unique biological resources. P.L. 115-97 mandates the first ANWR lease sale by December 2021, with activities such as identifying lands to be leased, conducting environmental reviews, and geological surveys. Regulations govern nonfederal oil and gas operations in the NWRS outside of Alaska. The FWS amended regulations for nonfederal oil and gas wells in the NWRS outside of Alaska in November 2016 to align with state and federal laws. The changes aimed to increase consistency and best management practices. Congressional attention and administrative action were seen in the 115th Congress, with H.J.Res. 45 introduced to disapprove the FWS final rule but no further actions were taken. Some proponents of the CRA action to overturn the FWS rule argued that FWS had overstepped its authority and the rule would increase costs for oil and gas operators. Opponents believed the rule was a necessary update and established appropriate responsibilities for operators. President Trump's Executive Order 13783 required a review of oil and gas-related rules, including the FWS 2016 rule. The FWS 2016 rule was subject to review under Executive Order 13783, which aimed to promote energy development while reducing regulatory burdens. The FWS \"Management of Non-Federal Oil and Gas Rights\" rule updated regulations for nonfederal oil and gas activities in NWRS outside of Alaska. The 2016 final rule by FWS aimed to update management practices for nonfederal oil and gas activities in NWRS. It provides a process for refuge staff to minimize impact, including permitting requirements, operating standards, financial bonding, and penalty provisions. Operators must meet performance-based standards for surface use, resource protections, spill prevention, waste management, and reclamation, offering flexibility in compliance. The FWS regulations aim to provide flexibility for operators while protecting NWRS resources. The standards address resource protection needs in different environments by allowing managers to choose appropriate practices. FWS outlines its minerals management policy in the Service Manual, emphasizing the use of least damaging methods for nonfederal mineral rights. Prior to the 2016 final rule, FWS conducted an environmental impact statement on nonfederal oil and gas activities in NWRS. The EIS reported that 18% of NWRS units contain nonfederally administered wells, totaling 5,002 wells including gas, oil, and other types. 44% of the wells are inactive and 33% are active. The NWRS contains 5,002 wells, with 44% inactive and 33% active. Balancing mineral rights with conservation goals can be complex. The NWRS mission is to conserve and manage wildlife habitats for future generations. The Interior aims to permit compatible activities with the NWRS's mission, prioritizing conservation, management, and restoration of wildlife and habitats. Exceptions, like nonfederal oil and gas rights development, exist without compatibility determinations. FWS's Final Compatibility Policy outlines circumstances exempt from the determination process. The Final Compatibility Policy of the FWS exempts certain activities from compatibility determinations, such as refuge management, military overflights, emergencies, and reserved oil and gas rights. These exemptions allow for special use permits or agreements to mitigate impacts on the refuge. Questions have been raised about FWS's authority to regulate nonfederal oil and gas resources within the NWRS. FWS cites statutory authority through the NWRSAA and requires permits for oil and gas operations within the NWRS to minimize adverse impacts on refuge resources. BLM manages oil and gas leasing on federal lands, including in the NWRS, with approval from the Secretary of the Interior and the Fish and Wildlife Service. The Fish and Wildlife Service, with the concurrence of the Department of the Interior, regulates oil and gas operations within the National Wildlife Refuge System to protect wildlife populations and habitat. Limited exceptions allow for oil and gas development adjacent to NWRS units if it drains federal resources, with valid existing leases continuing in some cases. The Bureau of Land Management administers federal wells in 12 NWRS units. The National Wildlife Refuge System includes 12 units with oil and gas activities, with 10 in Alaska and 2 wetland management districts. Outside Alaska, 11 units have federal and nonfederal wells, totaling 35 producing oil wells, 65 producing gas wells, and 194 nonproducing wells. 34 wells are in the approval process in seven states. The FWS's compatibility policy may not require a compatibility determination in cases where refuge lands fall under the jurisdiction of another agency, such as BLM for federal subsurface resources in Alaska. ANILCA provides FWS with authority to ensure cooperation with operators accessing nonfederal mineral rights within NWRS in Alaska. Operators accessing nonfederal mineral rights within NWRS in Alaska work with FWS to avoid operational impacts and ensure reclamation standards. Regulations do not apply to refuges in Alaska, but performance-based standards can be used as guidance to protect refuge resources. FWS identified four NWRS units in Alaska with nonfederal wells. Nonfederal subsurface ownership in Alaska may arise from situations where FWS acquired split-estate lands without subsurface rights. FWS identified 199 nonfederal Alaska wells, with 191 in Kenai National Wildlife Refuge and 8 in other refuges. Kenai Refuge has active and inactive wells, while the rest are inactive. BLM found 92 federal wells in Kenai Refuge, with 30 producing oil, 12 producing gas, and 49 nonproducing wells. The federal oil and gas program in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) requires the development of wells. Section 304 of ANILCA mandates that refuge administration must be compatible with refuge purposes, including oil and gas activities. The Secretary of the Interior must assess proposed uses before permitting them, with potential alterations to the compatibility process for Alaska refuges. The federal oil and gas program in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) requires the development of wells. Section 1008 of ANILCA outlines a requirement for the Secretary of the Interior to establish an oil and gas leasing program for certain non-North Slope federal lands in Alaska. The Secretary must not identify lands for oil and gas development where it would violate applicable law or be incompatible with the purpose of the units. Section 1009 requires the Secretary to render a decision on oil and gas lease applications, considering compatibility with the purpose of the lands. The 115th Congress has debated the compatibility of oil and gas activities with the purpose of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). P.L. 115-97 established an oil and gas program for ANWR's Coastal Plain, amending ANILCA to include oil and gas development as a refuge purpose. This inclusion is expected to facilitate a compatibility decision for the oil and gas program, with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) preparing a compatibility determination as part of the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) development process. The 115th Congress has debated oil and gas activities in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). H.J.Res. 45 was introduced to disapprove a 2016 final rule on nonfederal oil and gas activities in NWRS. Congress may consider issues like permitting fees and wildlife protection. In the 115th Congress, P.L. 115-97 addressed energy development in ANWR by establishing an oil and gas program for the Coastal Plain. H.R. 49 and S. 49 proposed similar leasing programs, while H.R. 1889 and S. 820 aimed to designate the Coastal Plain as wilderness, prohibiting commercial activities. Key aspects of the ANWR debate include limits on development footprint, environmental protections, compliance with NEPA, management roles, legal challenges, and special treatment. The P.L. 115-97 addressed energy development in ANWR by establishing an oil and gas program for the Coastal Plain. Congress could address management roles, legal challenges, and treatment of special areas through future oversight or legislation. See CRS Report RL33872 for more information."
