    "content": "The Act titled \"Northern Nevada Rural Economic Development and Land Consolidation Act of 2003\" is established for the purpose of economic development in rural areas. The economy of Nevada is heavily reliant on mining for jobs and economic benefits, with a significant portion of employment in certain counties directly tied to the mining industry. Private ownership of public land subject to mining operations could lead to increased county services and school funding. The Federal Government owns a large percentage of land in these counties. Since 1994, Congress has placed moratoria on processing patent applications under the general mining laws in Humboldt Counties, Nevada. This has led to a backlog of land exchange and direct sale petitions, making it difficult for mining companies to obtain security of tenure for their operations. Since 1994, Congress has placed moratoria on processing patent applications under the general mining laws in Humboldt Counties, Nevada, leading to a backlog of land exchange and direct sale petitions in Nevada. This has made it impossible for mine operators to obtain title in a timely manner for their operations, creating economic uncertainty for mining companies, local governments, and citizens benefiting from taxes and jobs provided by these companies. The public lands addressed in this Act are difficult and uneconomic for the Bureau of Land Management to manage, and disposal of such lands will serve important public objectives. The Bureau of Land Management has determined that public lands in northern Nevada are suitable for consolidation or disposal into private ownership. The sale of these lands would generate income for rehabilitating lands previously used for mining activities. The Act aims to consolidate and sell public lands in Nevada for market value, with royalties on mineral production. The funds generated will be used for land rehabilitation and education in the state. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms such as Claimant, Counties, Department, Mining law, and Secretary. SEC. 4. DISPOSAL OF LAND. This section addresses the disposal of land as part of the Act's goal to sell public lands in Nevada for market value. The Claimant has the right to submit applications to acquire public lands depicted as \"Selected Lands\" within a one-year period. The Secretary will dispose of each parcel of public land by direct sale after appraisal and determinations are accepted. The Claimant can acquire public lands through direct sale after appraisal and determinations following specific procedures outlined in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The market value of the lands will be determined by the Secretary in accordance with appraisal standards and relevant valuation provisions. The Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976 requires an appraisal by a certified appraiser for public lands conveyance. The value of locatable minerals in lands subject to mining claims is not included in the appraisal. The Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976 requires an appraisal by a certified appraiser for public lands conveyance, excluding the value of locatable minerals in lands subject to mining claims. The Claimant must demonstrate the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit to develop vested minerals, with the Secretary applying general mining laws without a formal validity examination. The difficulty in accurately determining the value of locatable minerals in lands subject to unpatented mining or mill site claims is acknowledged. The Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976 requires an appraisal for public lands conveyance, excluding the value of locatable minerals. Royalties must be paid to the United States on locatable minerals in conveyances, with rates determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may accept a conveyance of private lands from Claimant for royalties on locatable minerals, with credit given for the market value of the conveyed lands applied against cash consideration for public lands conveyed to Claimant. Timing for applications is specified by the Secretary. The Secretary must complete appraisals, review mineral deposit assertions, and determine royalties within 180 days of application. Public lands must be conveyed to the Claimant within 60 days after completion of these actions. Independent transactions for the sale of public lands are also specified. The public lands to be sold under this Act may be included in one or more conveyances. The lands are depicted as \"Selected Lands\" on specific maps for Placer Dome U.S. Inc. in Northern Nevada. The Act allows for the sale of public lands in Northern Nevada, depicted as \"Selected Lands\" on specific maps for Placer Dome U.S. Inc. The private lands to be conveyed are shown as \"Offered Lands\" on separate maps for Graymont Western U.S. Inc. and Placer Dome U.S. Inc. These maps are available for public inspection at the State Office of the Bureau of Land Management in Reno, Nevada. The Act allows for the sale of public lands in Northern Nevada, with interim conveyance of unsurveyed lands to Claimants, who will receive the same rights as in a patent. The Secretary will conduct necessary surveys for land sales, and correct boundaries in patents as needed. The Secretary is authorized to conduct surveys of public lands for sale, using existing diagrams and GPS techniques. The cost of surveys will be covered by the Claimant, and technical errors in maps can be corrected by mutual agreement. The Secretary is directed to implement and administer all rights and obligations of the United States under this Act, including valid existing rights on conveyed lands. SEC. 5. DISPOSITION OF PROCEEDS. Proceeds from sales of land under this Act in a fiscal year are allocated as follows: 25% to the State of Nevada for education, 10% to a trust fund for the California Trail Interpretative Center, and 100% of costs incurred by the Nevada State Office and relevant Field Offices of the Bureau of Land Management. The remaining proceeds from land sales under this Act, including royalties, will be used by Nevada agencies in collaboration with the Bureau of Land Management and Army Corps of Engineers for land rehabilitation."
