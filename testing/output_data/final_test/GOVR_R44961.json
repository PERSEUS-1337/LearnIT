    "content": "The FDA's review of medical products is funded by Congress and industry user fees. Reauthorization every five years is necessary to continue these programs. The Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017 extended the user fee programs, allowing FDA to collect fees and address other related issues. The FDA's user fee programs were extended by the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017, allowing FDA to collect fees for reviewing medical products. The 21st Century Cures Act made significant changes to FDA approval processes and regulations. FDARA has nine titles, including provisions for FDA to collect fees for reviewing drugs, devices, and biologics. Titles I through IV authorize fee collection for specific activities. Title V focuses on pediatric drug and device development. Titles VI through IX cover various aspects of drug and device regulation, inspection processes, patient access to generic drugs, and reporting requirements. The report provides an overview of FDARA, detailing its titles and sections. FDARA reauthorizes the prescription drug user program for five years. Congress authorized FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs and biological products through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was established in 1992 to collect user fees from manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs and biological products. FDA, industry, and Congress agreed on performance goals and the use of fees to support the review of human drug applications. User fees made up 41% of the FY2017 FDA budget and allowed for increased staff and reduced application review times. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) established user fee programs for brand-name prescription drugs and biological products. These programs involve legislation and performance goal agreements developed with industry representatives, patients, advocates, experts, and congressional committees. FDA uses PDUFA fees to support the review process for human drug applications. The reauthorization process expands the activities covered by the program, setting fee revenue amounts for each year with adjustments based on inflation and workload. The Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017 (PDUFA VI) establishes a new user fee structure, including program fees and application fees, while eliminating establishment and product fees. 80% of the total fee revenue will come from program fees and 20% from application fees, with specified amounts for each fiscal year from 2018 to 2022. The Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017 (PDUFA VI) establishes a new user fee structure for FY2018 through FY2022. It modifies the inflation adjustment calculation, replaces workload adjustment with capacity planning adjuster, eliminates final year adjustment provisions, and establishes additional adjustments. The Secretary of HHS must establish and publish fees before each fiscal year, waive or reduce fees for public health protection or small business applications, and consider incomplete applications. The Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017 (PDUFA VI) establishes new user fee requirements, including fee payment conditions, triggers for fee collection, early payment options, and reporting obligations. These prescription drug user fees are authorized from October 1, 2017, through September 30, 2022. The Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017 (PDUFA VI) establishes new user fee requirements for prescription drugs from October 1, 2017, through September 30, 2022. Similarly, medical devices require FDA approval before marketing in the US, with user fees supporting FDA's premarket review program. The Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017 (MDUFA) provides revenue for FDA and sets performance goals for premarket review of medical devices. It amends FFDCA Sections 738 or 738A by adding a definition for \"de novo classification request\" and changing fees for premarket notification submissions. The PMA fee amounts start at $294,000 per application in FY2018 and increase to $329,000 in FY2022. The Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017 (MDUFA) sets fee amounts for PMA applications and establishment fees, with increases over fiscal years. It allows for fee adjustments based on inflation and offers reduced fees for small businesses. Repeals the waiver or reduction of fees for public health interests. The Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017 (MDUFA) sets fee amounts for PMA applications and establishment fees, with increases over fiscal years. It allows for fee adjustments based on inflation and offers reduced fees for small businesses. In addition, the amendments include changes to fee payment requirements, the specified amount for the \"trigger,\" elimination of a fifth-year fee offset, and the establishment of a pilot program for testing laboratories to assess device conformity. The pilot program progress report will be posted on the FDA website, with the program authority expiring on October 1, 2022. Amendments to FFDCA Section 523 specify that certain devices, like breakthrough devices or those intended for permanent implantation or life support, cannot be reviewed by accredited persons. The Secretary will issue guidance on eligible devices for review and post a list on the FDA website. Amends FFDCA Section 745A to allow FDA to develop electronic device submissions following draft guidance issuance. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 established an expedited pathway for generic drugs, allowing companies to submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to FDA for review without replicating animal and clinical research. The amendments in Title II make effective changes as of October 1, 2017, and authorize medical device user fees from October 1, 2017, through September 30, 2022. The Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA) was passed to expedite the review of generic drug applications by FDA. This was in response to the increased workload and backlog of applications, with the median review time being 31 months in March 2012. GDUFA allowed FDA to collect fees from industry to fund activities related to generic drugs. The Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA) aimed to speed up FDA's review of generic drug applications. A 2017 GAO report showed improvements in review times under GDUFA I, with FDA exceeding its goals for acting on applications within specified timeframes. Title III of the amendments made changes to FFDCA Sections 744A, 744B, and 744C, including modifying the definition of abbreviated new drug application. FFDCA Sections 744A, 744B, and 744C modify the definition of abbreviated new drug application, establish a sunset date for backlog fees, create a new generic drug applicant program fee, and make changes to various fees related to ANDAs and facility fees. The total fee revenue for FY2018 is set at $493,600,000, with fees derived from various sources including new generic drug applicant program fees, ANDA fees, DMF fees, generic drug facilities, and API facilities. Foreign facilities will have higher fees than domestic ones, and CMO facility fees are one-third of non-CMO facility fees. Minor adjustments are made to inflation and final year adjustments, and information about CMO facilities must be included in annual submissions. The generic drug applicant program fee must be paid to avoid being placed on a public arrears list and having ANDA submissions rejected. Fees must supplement congressional appropriations, with refunds if appropriations are insufficient. Annual performance and fiscal reports are required, and generic drug user fees are authorized from October 1, 2017, through September 30, 2022. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of biosimilars as biological products similar to brand-name products, regulated under the Public Health Service Act. Unlike chemical drugs, biosimilars have a more complex nature and method of manufacture. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 is also mentioned. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 allowed for the approval of generic chemical drugs under the FFDCA, while the BPCIA of 2009 established a pathway for biosimilars under the PHSA. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 amended the FFDCA to allow FDA to collect fees for biosimilar reviews. Title IV, the Biosimilar User Fee Amendments of 2017 (BsUFA), amends FFDCA Sections 744G, 744H, and 744I by adding a definition for \"adjustment factor\" and changing the definition of \"biosimilar biological product.\" It allows for a refund of the annual biosimilar biological product development fee under certain conditions, removes the supplement fee, modifies the application fee structure, and introduces a new biosimilar biological product program fee. The Biosimilar User Fee Amendments of 2017 limit product sponsors to five biosimilar biological product program fees per fiscal year. The total fee revenue for FY2018 is set at $45,000,000, with changes in fee allocation and amounts specified by the Secretary. Fees will not exceed 125% of the FY2018 amount until the capacity planning adjustment is available. Total revenue amounts for FY2019 through FY2022 are also established. The total revenue amounts for FY2019 through FY2022 will be based on a specified formula that considers base revenue, inflation adjustment, capacity planning adjustment, and operating reserve. The spending trigger requirements can be met if costs funded by budget authority are not more than 15% below the inflation adjusted amount. Performance and fiscal reporting requirements continue, but the independent study on workload volume and costs for biosimilar biological product applications is no longer required. The legislation authorizes biosimilar biological product user fees from 2017 to 2022, with a savings clause for applications filed before 2017. Congress incentivizes testing drugs in children through programs like BPCA and PREA. The legislation incentivizes pediatric studies to support pediatric use information in product labeling for medical devices. PMDSIA provides incentives for manufacturers to create pediatric medical devices and allows FDA to require postmarket studies for approved pediatric devices. Since 1997, over 600 approved labeling changes with pediatric-specific information have been made, resulting in new dosing, indications, safety information, and effectiveness data for pediatric populations. However, gaps in pediatric labeling information still exist. The PMDSIA legislation incentivizes pediatric studies for medical devices, with FDA requiring postmarket studies for approved pediatric devices. Gaps in pediatric labeling information still exist, especially for pediatric cancer, where manufacturers can obtain waivers from PREA requirements. Title V, Pediatric Drugs and Devices, makes amendments to prioritize issues in pediatric therapeutics, including biomarker identification for pediatric diseases. FDA publishes annual reports to Congress on pediatric medical devices, including approvals and review times. Amends PHSA and FFDCA to require posting of pediatric study reports on NIH website, reauthorize funding for pediatric drug studies, and add elements to annual report on pediatric medical devices. Nonprofit consortium to provide regulatory consultation for pediatric device sponsors. Amends FFDCA to reauthorize funding for pediatric medical devices and requires public meeting on pediatric device development and labeling. The amendment to the FFDCA requires sponsors to submit a pediatric study plan within specific timelines and mandates meetings to discuss deferrals or waivers. It also requires pediatric studies for new drugs targeting molecular targets relevant to pediatric cancer growth. The Secretary must maintain a list of these targets on the FDA website. The amendment to the FFDCA mandates pediatric studies for drugs targeting molecular targets relevant to pediatric cancer growth. The Secretary must maintain a list of these targets and convene a public meeting to develop guidance on implementation. GAO will study the effectiveness of the new requirements on drug development for pediatric cancer. The amendment to the FFDCA mandates pediatric studies for drugs targeting molecular targets relevant to pediatric cancer growth. It requires the Secretary to review and act on proposed pediatric study requests within 120 days and develop a plan for earlier submission of pediatric studies. Additionally, it authorizes expertise in neonatology in FDA's Office of Pediatric Therapeutics and requires draft guidance on clinical pharmacology considerations for neonatal studies. Title VI of the FFDCA mandates pediatric studies for drugs targeting pediatric cancer growth, requires expertise in neonatology at the FDA, and extends the period for considering single enantiomers in drug approvals. Amends various sections of the FFDCA to reauthorize funding for Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships, grants for orphan drug development, and to prohibit importation of foreign-made drugs without proper authorization. Amends FFDCA sections to increase penalties for counterfeit drugs, redefine patient experience data, allow the Secretary to require dissemination of drug information to healthcare providers, and require certain criteria for obtaining orphan drug exclusivity. The amendment requires applicants to demonstrate clinical superiority for orphan drug exclusivity. It expands circumstances for omitting pediatric information in drug labeling and allows for adult use approval. The Secretary can require applicants to include disclaimers for omitted information. A Sense of Congress urges engagement with Congress to lower prescription drug costs while promoting innovation. The Secretary must convene a public meeting on clinical trial criteria, issue guidance, and streamline IRB review. The bill aims to streamline Institutional Review Board (IRB) review for individual patient expanded access protocols and update relevant forms. GAO will report to Congress on access to investigational drugs through FDA's expanded access program. Changes are made to the date for posting expanded access policies on a company's website and requirements for tropical disease product applications. Medical devices encompass a wide range of products used in healthcare, from simple tools like tongue depressors to complex devices like implantable hips. The FDA regulates the marketing and monitoring of medical devices based on the risk they pose to patients, classifying them as class I (low-risk), class II (moderate-risk), or class III (high-risk). Manufacturers must provide essential reports for approval, and sponsors must attest that these reports were not submitted for approval in other countries before September 27, 2007. The FDA classifies medical devices as class I (low-risk), class II (moderate-risk), or class III (high-risk). Low-risk devices are exempt from premarket review, while moderate and high-risk devices can be brought to market through premarket approval (PMA) or premarket notification submission (510(k)). PMA involves clinical studies to prove safety and effectiveness, similar to the new drug application process. The FDA classifies medical devices into three risk categories: class I (low-risk), class II (moderate-risk), and class III (high-risk). Low-risk devices are exempt from premarket review, while moderate and high-risk devices require premarket approval (PMA) or premarket notification submission (510(k)). PMA involves clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness, while 510(k) demonstrates substantial equivalence to a predicate device already on the market. Postmarket activities include monitoring device safety and effectiveness, with manufacturer requirements such as labeling, postmarket surveillance, device tracking, and adverse event reporting. FDA's postmarket authority varies based on device characteristics. Amends FFDCA provisions related to device regulation, including changing inspection schedules to a risk-based approach, requiring uniform standards for inspections, and considering a device adulterated if an establishment delays or limits an inspection. Amends FFDCA provisions related to device regulation, including inspection schedules, third-party inspection program reauthorization, certification of devices for export, and allowing reviews for denial of certification. Amends FFDCA provisions related to device regulation, including international device establishment inspections, approval of diagnostic imaging devices, and supplemental applications for contrast agents. The review of drugs has jurisdiction over the supplement and provides definitions for \"new use,\" \"applicable medical imaging device,\" and \"contrast agent.\" It amends FFDCA Section 513 to change the classification of accessories used with medical devices, directing the Secretary to classify accessories based on their risks when used as intended. Additionally, it directs the Secretary to initiate voluntary postmarket pilot projects to gather safety and effectiveness information on approved medical devices using electronic health data. The bill requires a review of pilot projects for medical devices, with a deadline of October 1, 2022. It also mandates the FDA Commissioner to conduct an independent review to assess the reliability of evidence generated by these projects. Additionally, it introduces regulations for over-the-counter hearing aids, including the need for 510(k) premarket notification for safety and effectiveness assurance. State and local governments are prohibited from imposing laws that restrict the sale or use of these hearing aids. The bill mandates the FDA to review pilot projects for medical devices by October 1, 2022 and assess the reliability of evidence generated. It also introduces regulations for over-the-counter hearing aids, prohibiting state and local governments from imposing restrictions on their sale or use. Additionally, the bill requires the Secretary to submit a report to Congress analyzing adverse events related to over-the-counter hearing aids and to post a report on the quality, safety, and effectiveness of servicing medical devices on the FDA website. The Hatch-Waxman Act established an expedited pathway for generic drugs, allowing a generic company to submit an ANDA to FDA for premarket review. The generic product must be the same as the brand-name drug or reference listed drug (RLD). The Orange Book lists FDA-approved drugs based on safety and effectiveness, including those eligible to be RLDs. Generic drug companies can sell their products at lower costs due to avoiding costly research and marketing expenses. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association (now known as the Association for Affordable Medicines) reported that generic drugs saved the U.S. health system $1.46 trillion from 2006 to 2015. Generic drugs make up 89% of prescriptions but only 27% of total drug costs, while brand drugs account for 11% of prescriptions but 73% of drug spending. FDA is taking steps to increase generic competition and lower drug prices by prioritizing the review of certain ANDAs and listing drugs with no patents or exclusivities on its website. The FDA is expediting the review of ANDAs for drugs with no patents or exclusivities listed on its website. Title VIII aims to improve generic drug access by prioritizing the review of ANDAs for drugs with limited competition and on the FDA's drug shortage list. The agency will continue to expedite the review process until there are three approved generics for each drug. Title VIII of the FDA aims to improve generic drug access by expediting the review of ANDAs for drugs with limited competition. It requires applicants to provide detailed information on manufacturing facilities and testing processes. The Secretary will publish a list of drugs with expired patents and no approved ANDAs. Additionally, a new section allows for the designation of competitive generic therapies to address inadequate competition. The Secretary can expedite the development and review of an ANDA for competitive generic therapy, defined as having inadequate competition in the market. This includes drugs with no approved generics or only one generic available. The Secretary can facilitate communication between the applicant and review team, and the applicant must report on the drug's marketing status. The new FFDCA Section 506I requires drug holders to notify the Secretary before withdrawing approved drugs from sale and review information in the Orange Book. The new FFDCA Section 506I mandates drug holders to notify the Secretary before withdrawing approved drugs from sale and review information in the Orange Book. It also allows the Secretary to move drugs from the active to discontinued section if required information is not provided, and requires reporting to Congress on pending suitability petitions and inspection response timelines. The new protocol establishes a six-month timeline for completion of review and response to inspection reports for drug applications. It requires the Secretary to post quarterly reports on pending ANDAs and priority review applications. Amends FFDCA Section 505(j) to provide eligibility for a 180-day exclusivity period for approved ANDAs designated as competitive generic therapy. The text chunk discusses amendments to the 21st Century Cures Act and the Federal Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act. It includes requirements for drug marketing timelines, GAO study on generic drug approvals, technical corrections, and annual posting of inspection information on the FDA website. Amendments to the 21st Century Cures Act and the Federal Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act require quarterly posting of performance reports on the FDA website for human medical product user fee programs. It includes real-time reporting on draft and final guidance, annual reports on hiring changes, fee revenue amounts, and personnel data. Additional requirements include posting the number of NDAs and BLAs filed and approved, as well as other specified information. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act require the Secretary to include specific information in the annual reports of human medical product user fee programs, such as the number of applications filed and approved, progress of previous application cohorts, and analysis of performance goals met and missed. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act require enhanced communications with Congress, participation in congressional hearings, and limit the scope of allowed uses of user fee revenue for expenses related to facilities, furniture, and supplies. GAO is required to conduct a study on FDA expenses related to facility maintenance and renovation, and report the results and recommendations to congressional committees. Beginning October 1, 2023, \"leasing and necessary scientific equipment\" will replace certain allowed uses of user fee revenue."
