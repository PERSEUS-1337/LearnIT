    "content": "In FY2009, federal spending on programs for people with low income was almost $708 billion, with most of the growth related to the recession and policy responses. Four programs accounted for almost 60% of total spending, and 10 programs accounted for more than 75%. Federal programs for low-income populations accounted for almost 60% of total spending, with 10 programs making up over 75%. Unlike social insurance programs like Social Security and Medicare, these programs are funded through general revenues and provide benefits to those with limited income. Social insurance programs aim to protect American workers universally against lost wages and work-related benefits, while programs for low-income individuals specifically target those in need. Federal programs for low-income populations provide benefits and services to those with limited income, aiming to address economic disadvantage through cash or noncash assistance, education, training, and community support. These programs target basic needs like food, housing, and healthcare, as well as improving employability and earnings capacity. They may also incentivize participation in work or training activities and provide assistance to communities with low tax capacities. Federal programs for low-income populations offer diverse benefits and services, created independently and evolving over time in response to societal factors. Key findings are summarized in the report, which includes a brief history of federal low-income policy and an overview of current spending on low-income programs. The report provides an overview of federal low-income programs, including a review of budgetary classification and the 10 largest programs. It also examines how benefits are directed towards those with limited income through eligibility criteria and targeting assistance based on need. The report focuses on federal assistance programs, including criteria for eligibility and types of assistance provided. It also discusses the recipients of federal funds and nonfederal spending requirements. Additionally, it briefly mentions the participation of Indian tribes and U.S. territories. The report does not delve into the value of benefits but includes maximum benefit levels for selected programs and potential questions for further analysis. Several appendixes provide additional information on methodologies and program overviews. The report focuses on federal assistance programs, eligibility criteria, types of assistance, recipients of funds, and nonfederal spending requirements. It mentions the participation of Indian tribes and U.S. territories. Appendixes provide additional information on program overviews, methodologies, and references to federal poverty guidelines. The report emphasizes the target population as individuals with \"low\" or \"limited\" income, rather than \"poor\" people, due to varying income eligibility criteria across programs. The report focuses on federal assistance programs, eligibility criteria, types of assistance, recipients of funds, and nonfederal spending requirements. It mentions the participation of Indian tribes and U.S. territories. The number of programs included in this report is not meaningful as some could have been characterized as more than one program and others could have been consolidated. Only programs with new obligations of $100 million or more in a given year are included. The assignment of programs to broad categories is not perfect, as some programs provide multiple types of assistance and spending could not be disaggregated. The report does not include tax programs, with the exception of direct. The report focuses on federal assistance programs, eligibility criteria, types of assistance, recipients of funds, and nonfederal spending requirements. It provides a snapshot of policies and spending for low-income programs in FY2008 and FY2009, excluding tax programs. Spending is shown for FY2008 and FY2009 due to the economic stimulus law in FY2009. The report does not include long-term trend data on spending or address the effectiveness of the programs. The report focuses on federal assistance programs for low-income individuals in FY2008 and FY2009. It does not evaluate the effectiveness of these programs in achieving their policy goals. The report replaces the Cash and Noncash Benefits series but uses different methodologies, making it not directly comparable. It provides a historical overview of federal policy for low-income individuals, highlighting key milestones like the New Deal and the Great Society. Today's programs have evolved over decades in response to societal changes and expectations. Federal aid has evolved over many decades in response to societal changes, particularly regarding mothers working outside the home. Current federal policy generally favors work among aid recipients and includes incentives to \"make work pay.\" The policy also aims to address root causes of poverty and disadvantage, in addition to meeting basic needs. Federal involvement in providing benefits for low-income individuals began in the early 20th century after the Great Depression overwhelmed state and local resources. State and local governments play a significant role in programs for low-income populations, including veterans' benefits and tax credits for low-wage workers. These benefits date back to the early 1900s and expanded during the Great Depression. The Social Security Act of 1935 marked the federal government's entry into social insurance and cash relief programs. The Social Security Act of 1935 established income security programs for aged and retired workers, temporarily unemployed workers, fatherless children, and the blind. Aid to Dependent Children was later amended to Aid to Families with Dependent Children in 1962, providing assistance to parents, typically single mothers. Starting in the late 1960s, Congress imposed work requirements on parents receiving cash benefits, leading to the replacement of AFDC with TANF in 1996. States now have more flexibility in decision-making and use TANF funds for noncash services. The 1996 law also increased federal funding for child care for low-income working families. The U.S. Housing Act of 1934 and 1937 established federal housing programs, including the creation of the Federal Housing Administration and the Public Housing program. In 1949, Congress declared a goal of providing affordable housing for every American family, leading to the enactment of provisions to incentivize private developers to build low-cost housing. The Housing Act of 1974 introduced the Section 8 rental assistance program, which provided rental subsidies for private properties. The Section 8 program expanded to include portable rental vouchers administered by PHAs, replacing subsidies for new development. Housing units subsidized under earlier programs still provide affordable housing today, managed by PHAs or private properties under HUD. The Food Stamp program was revived in 1961 and made permanent in 1964 under the Food Stamp Act, transitioning to a national income guarantee in 1971. The Food Stamp program, later renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), was established in 1961 and made permanent in 1964 under the Food Stamp Act. Over the years, Congress made significant policy changes to the program, including removing the purchase requirement in the late 1970s and limiting access for certain individuals in 1996. States administer SNAP with some flexibility in determining eligibility, while benefit levels remain federally funded and uniform nationwide. The Great Society's War on Poverty in 1964 led to the creation of various programs to address economic disadvantage, including Head Start, Job Corps, and the Legal Services Corporation. These programs aimed to meet the needs of low-income individuals and empower communities. The Great Society, established in the 1960s, implemented various programs like Medicare and Medicaid to provide health coverage to elderly and low-income individuals. Medicaid replaced earlier federal grants for medical care. Both programs have been expanded over the years. Medicaid and Medicare have been expanded over the years, with Medicaid significantly expanding under the 2010 health reform law. This expansion includes coverage for low-income childless adults in addition to traditional target populations. The original Social Security Act's grants for cash aid to needy individuals were also expanded to include people with disabilities. In 1972, Congress federalized programs for low-income aged, blind, and disabled individuals, replacing earlier state-administered programs with Supplemental Security Income (SSI). In the early 1970s, welfare reform legislation was considered but not enacted, leading to the creation of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in 1978 as a permanent program to assist low-income working households. The welfare reform law of 1996 created TANF, conditioning cash aid on work activities and expanding funding for child care. In 1997, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provided health insurance for low-income families not eligible for Medicaid. The Child Tax Credit and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) were established in 1997, with the ACTC later expanded to target low-income families. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) was enacted in 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 aimed to stimulate the economy during recession by revising and expanding existing policies to benefit low-income populations. It resulted in a substantial increase in spending on benefits and services for low-income individuals between FY2008 and FY2009, totaling $708 billion in FY2009 and $578 billion in FY2008. The funding provided by ARRA was intended to be spent during FY2009 and FY2010 to help people meet basic needs and address economic disadvantage. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 aimed to stimulate the economy by increasing spending on benefits and services for low-income populations. Key target populations for these programs include low-income elderly, disabled individuals, dependent children, veterans, students, homeless individuals, Indians, and refugees. Spending for health care dominates the overall composition of spending in FY2008 and FY2009, with a notable portion attributable to ARRA. Overall, in FY2009, health care spending accounted for 45% of total spending for limited-income populations, followed by cash aid at 18%, food assistance at 11%, housing and development at almost 9%, education at 8%, social services at 6%, energy assistance at almost 2%, and employment and training at 1%. Federal benefits and services for low-income populations increased by 22% between FY2008 and FY2009, with two-thirds of the additional spending provided under ARRA. Medicaid and SNAP also saw growth in spending during this period. In FY2009, spending on various programs for limited-income populations increased. Energy assistance had the largest percentage increase, followed by housing, education, and employment and training. Food assistance, health care, and social services also saw spending growth. Cash aid appeared to drop due to a one-time tax rebate in FY2008. Health care accounted for the highest percentage of total spending, followed by cash aid, food assistance, and other programs. In FY2009, spending on programs for low-income families increased significantly. Health care saw the largest growth, with $61 billion in additional obligations, mainly due to provisions in ARRA that raised the federal share of Medicaid costs. Housing and development programs also grew by $20 billion, with most of the increase coming from additional appropriations under ARRA. Food assistance spending rose by almost $19 billion. In FY2009, spending on food assistance increased by almost $19 billion, with a significant portion attributed to ARRA provisions that raised SNAP benefits. Additionally, education spending grew by $16 billion, partially due to ARRA appropriations that prevented a potential decrease in funding. Pell Grants for postsecondary students also received support from ARRA. In FY2009, education programs like Pell Grants and grants for disadvantaged school districts were major beneficiaries of ARRA funding. Social services spending increased by $8 billion, with a significant portion from ARRA for programs like Head Start. Energy spending grew by $7 billion, mainly from ARRA funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program. Employment and training saw a $2 billion increase, with a majority from ARRA for programs like the Workforce Investment Act. Cash assistance spending appeared to decrease by about $4 billion in FY2009. In FY2009, cash assistance spending decreased by about $4 billion. FY2008 spending included a one-time $300-per-child tax rebate, not targeted towards low-income families. Changes in Earned Income Tax Credit and ACTC from ARRA did not take effect until tax year 2009. About 75% of total spending on low-income programs is classified as \"mandatory.\" Congress defines eligibility and payment rules for entitlement programs in authorizing laws, which control federal spending. Discretionary program spending is determined through the annual appropriations process. Mandatory spending can be open-ended or capped, with examples like Medicaid and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, respectively. The report discusses mandatory versus discretionary spending in various categories of benefits and services. Cash aid, health care, and food assistance are mostly mandatory and provided through open-ended entitlement programs. On the other hand, energy assistance, employment and training, housing and development, and education spending are mostly discretionary. Social services spending is a mix of mandatory and discretionary, with some capped and some open-ended programs. The report highlights the diversity in spending and policy across different categories. The report discusses the diversity in spending across different categories such as health care, cash aid, and food assistance. A few key programs account for the majority of spending for low-income populations, with Medicaid being the largest program. The top 10 programs contribute to over three-fourths of total spending. In FY2009, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) were among the top spending programs. Medicaid accounted for over half of the spending in the top 10 programs, with health programs making up 53% of the total. Cash assistance programs made up 23%, followed by food assistance at 10% and education at 9%. In FY2009, the top spending programs included SNAP, SSI, and EITC. Medicaid accounted for over half of the spending in the top 10 programs, with health programs making up 53% of the total. Cash assistance programs made up 23%, followed by food assistance at 10% and education at 9%. Low-income elderly, disabled, and families with dependent children are the focus of much of the spending under these programs. Medicaid provides health care for low-income individuals, while Medicare recipients receive subsidized prescription drug insurance. Cash aid goes to low-income elderly and disabled beneficiaries, as well as low-income working households through EITC and ACTC. TANF serves families with dependent children, with a focus on participation in work activities for recipients of cash aid. SNAP provides food assistance to low-income households, with a focus on children and the elderly. Able-bodied adults without dependent children must participate in work or training to receive benefits. Other top spending programs include housing vouchers, Pell Grants for college students, and aid for individuals with high family income. The top spending programs provide aid to low-income households, children, and the elderly. Grants are given to low-income school districts through Title I-A of ESEA. About 75% of spending for limited-income populations is mandatory, with close to 90% for the top 10 programs. Only TANF is capped, while the rest are open-ended. Three of the top 10 programs are discretionary, including Pell Grants, Title I-A of ESEA, and housing vouchers. The 10 largest programs providing aid to low-income households require individual eligibility based on income tests. Different programs use various criteria such as federal poverty guidelines multiples, specific dollar amounts, and area median income limits to determine eligibility. Pell Grants do not have an absolute income threshold for eligibility. Pell Grants do not have an absolute income threshold for eligibility, with the lowest-income students receiving the largest grants. Title I-A of ESEA uses allocation formulas to direct federal resources to schools with high concentrations of low-income students, allowing all students to benefit regardless of family income. Other programs like Medicaid, TANF, and Section 8 housing vouchers also use formulas to distribute funds, with Medicaid being an open-ended entitlement reimbursed by the federal government for all eligible expenditures. The federal government reimburses states for eligible expenditures with no cap on spending, using a formula based on per capita income. TANF allocates block grants to states based on spending patterns. Housing voucher funding is distributed to local authorities based on a formula set by Congress. Formula grants are one way federal programs distribute funds to low-income populations. The 10 largest federal programs provide benefits directly to individuals, with some funds allocated to states by formula. Programs like SNAP, SSI, EITC, ACTC, Pell Grants, and Medicare Part D subsidy offer benefits directly to eligible individuals, with states incurring administrative costs for some programs. The largest federal programs provide benefits directly to individuals, with some funds allocated to states by formula. States also operate their own earned income tax credit programs. Medicaid and TANF are federal-state programs, with states required to spend their own money to receive federal funds. Medicaid expenditures are reimbursed by the federal government at matching rates, while TANF block grant funds require states to maintain a certain level of prior-year spending. Local educational agencies receiving Title I-A grants must use federal funds to supplement nonfederal funds. Medicaid dominates federal spending on benefits and services for low-income individuals, accounting for 83% of health care spending in FY2009. It provides medical assistance to low-income parents, dependent children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. Medicaid finances a wide range of medical services, including long-term care. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides health coverage for low-income children without insurance. Other significant health programs include the low-income subsidy under Medicare Part D for seniors and individuals with disabilities, medical care for low-income veterans, services by the Indian Health Service for American Indians and Alaskan Natives, and health services by Consolidated Health Centers for low-income populations in underserved areas. The Maternal and Child Health block grant provides health services for low-income women, infants, and children. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program offers care for individuals with HIV or AIDS who lack insurance. Other programs focus on specific health services or populations, with SSI being the largest cash aid program for low-income individuals. The largest portion of cash aid spending in FY2009 came from resources, accounting for over 40%. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) also contributed significantly. The EITC supports low-income workers with children, while the ACTC is a refundable credit for families with low tax liability. TANF, a welfare reform program, is also part of cash aid spending, aiming to assist needy families and reduce dependence. In FY2009, TANF spending was allocated for cash aid, social services, and employment and training to assist needy families and reduce dependence. SNAP, the largest food assistance program, aims to alleviate hunger and malnutrition for low-income households. Food assistance programs include subsidies for breakfast and lunch for low-income schoolchildren, meals and snacks for children in child care and summer programs, and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to support nutrition for pregnant women and young children. The federal government supports children's health and provides food assistance programs for the elderly. Housing needs of low-income individuals are met through subsidies for rental units. Section 8 vouchers aim to offer decent housing, while Public Housing provides publicly owned housing options. Federal spending for Public Housing, including the HOPE VI program, aims to provide affordable rental units for low-income tenants. Other housing programs target supportive housing for elderly, disabled, and individuals with AIDS. Homeless Assistance Grants address the needs of homeless individuals and families for shelter and support services. Block grants like HOME and CDBG help communities with high poverty rates and aging housing stock. The housing and development category includes programs such as HOME and CDBG, which aim to provide housing assistance for low-income homeowners, homebuyers, and renters. Loans and rental subsidies are available for rural areas, along with support for water and waste disposal facilities. The Public Works and Economic Development program offers grants to distressed communities for infrastructure improvements. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program-1 and temporary programs created by ARRA aim to rehabilitate abandoned homes for low-income tenants and provide capital investments for LIHTC-financed properties in response to the financial crisis. The departure of tax credit investors made it difficult for developers to raise capital by selling tax credits. ARRA added funds to HUD's Homeless Assistance Grants for a new Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program. The Federal Pell Grant Program is a significant education program for low-income individuals, accounting for a large portion of federal education spending in FY2009. Other grant programs aim to help needy students with higher education costs. Federal TRIO Programs and GEAR-UP help low-income and minority students in high school and college. Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act provides grants to schools with disadvantaged children to ensure they receive a quality education. The Bureau of Indian Education operates programs for Indian children living on reservations. Other education grant programs aim to improve student achievement through teacher quality and literacy programs for adults. The government funds various programs to support children's educational development, literacy, and social services, with a focus on low-income and vulnerable populations. This includes initiatives like Reading First, Early Reading First, and 21st Century Community Learning Centers. The majority of social services spending is directed towards children, youth, and their families, with TANF being a significant contributor. TANF funds are used for noncash aid and social services for families with children, including programs like Head Start and the Child Care and Development Fund. These programs aim to promote school readiness and provide childcare support for low-income parents. The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) is a flexible program that supports various services to promote self-sufficiency, with decisions left to the states. Other programs target children and families, such as Child Support Enforcement, Foster Care grants, Adoption Assistance, and the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program. Social services programs focus on specific target populations, such as the elderly, people with developmental disabilities, American Indians, and low-income individuals and families. Programs like the Community Services Block Grant and Emergency Food and Shelter Grants aim to reduce poverty and provide assistance to homeless individuals. The Legal Services Corporation ensures equal access to the justice system for those who cannot afford legal counsel. Energy assistance programs like LIHEAP help low-income households with heating and cooling expenses. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and Weatherization Assistance Program help low-income households with heating and cooling expenses and improve energy efficiency. Programs like Workforce Investment Act (WIA) and Job Corps focus on providing employment and training opportunities for disadvantaged youth. Other services include work-related assistance for families with children under TANF and recipients of SNAP benefits. The federal programs for low-income individuals include employment and training programs for SNAP recipients, services for refugees and humanitarian entrants, programs for older Americans to become self-sufficient, and assistance for low-income older individuals to provide services to children with special needs. These programs target key groups such as the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and children and families. Some programs have specific income eligibility criteria, with varying levels and measures. Geographic differences exist, with some programs adjusting income criteria annually for inflation. Asset tests may be used alongside income tests, and categorical requirements like age or disability are common. Alternative criteria allow certain groups to qualify automatically. Automatic exclusions are in place for some programs. The section discusses how individual eligibility for programs is determined, including income tests, automatic exclusions, federal parameters, and state-set criteria. It also covers measures like federal poverty guidelines, specific dollar amounts, and asset limits. Categorical rules and Table 4 summarize eligibility concepts. Eligibility for programs is determined by specific concepts outlined in Table B-2 in Appendix B. Being eligible does not guarantee benefits as some programs are discretionary or capped entitlements. Not all programs require individual eligibility determination, some target resources to communities with low-income populations. Targeting mechanisms are discussed in the next section of the report. Targeting mechanisms for programs are discussed in the next section of the report. Programs do not strictly serve the poor but target populations with low or limited income. Most programs use federal poverty guidelines as a criterion for eligibility, with many setting eligibility as high as 200% or 300% of the poverty level. The poverty guidelines originated from a 1963 Social Security Administration study based on basic food needs and expenditure relationships. The poverty cutoffs, based on the Economy Food Plan, were adopted by the Census Bureau for counting the poor and are used for the HHS poverty guidelines. These guidelines are updated annually for inflation and are used as a criterion for eligibility in health care programs for people with limited income. Medicaid includes mandatory coverage groups with income ranging from 100% to 185% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. Optional coverage groups are also available. The CHIP program serves children with family income above Medicaid eligibility levels, with income thresholds established by states. Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for the low-income prescription drug subsidy under Part D if their income is no higher than 150% of FPG. The deepest subsidy goes to those below 135% of poverty. Other health programs prioritize people below 100% of poverty or provide services free of charge to those below 100% but allow higher-income participants on a sliding fee scale basis. The poverty guidelines are used in various programs to determine eligibility, with some programs allowing higher-income participants on a sliding fee scale basis. TANF eligibility thresholds set by states are generally below the federal poverty guidelines. Food assistance programs typically use multiples of the federal poverty guidelines, with SNAP serving those with gross income up to 130% of poverty. Child nutrition programs provide meals free to children with family income up to 130% of poverty. The WIC program caps eligibility at 185% of poverty, while the Older Americans Act gives priority to seniors with the greatest economic need at 100% of poverty. CSBG and Head Start use 100% of the federal poverty guidelines as their income eligibility limit, with flexibility to adjust upwards. The Legal Services Corporation sets eligibility at 125% of FPG, but can increase it to 200% in certain circumstances. SSBG has no federal income eligibility limit except for TANF-funded services for families below 200% of FPG. The Older Americans Act grant programs prioritize seniors with income below 100% of poverty. LIHEAP uses 150% of poverty as its income limit. Weatherization increased its income eligibility to 200% of FPG in FY2009. Job Corps limits eligibility to 100% of FPG. Youth activities under WIA set eligibility at 100% of FPG. Activities under WIA set eligibility at 100% of FPG or 70% of the lower living standard income level if higher. Priority is given to certain adult activities under WIA based on the same criteria. Community Service Employment for Older Americans and Foster Grandparents limit eligibility to those with income no higher than 125% of poverty. Different measures of income are used to determine eligibility for various federal programs. Financial assistance programs use various measures of income to determine eligibility and benefit levels, including area median income, family resources, actual cost of education, and specific dollar amounts. These measures are used in programs such as pensions for needy veterans, free medical care for veterans, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Adjustments for price inflation are made annually for veterans' benefits and SSI, tied to Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. Veterans' benefits, SSI, and EITC are adjusted for inflation. TANF sets dollar limits for eligibility. Housing programs use area median income to determine eligibility. Section 8 vouchers prioritize extremely low-income individuals. The Section 8 vouchers prioritize extremely low-income individuals, with eligibility based on income levels ranging from 30% to 80% of the area median. Public Housing serves low-income families, with at least 40% of units reserved for extremely low-income households. Supportive housing programs have income limits of 50% of the area median for the elderly and disabled. Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS and Indian Housing Block Grants serve individuals with income up to 80% of the area median. Rural housing loans have different income limits for guaranteed and direct loans. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) and LIHEAP use state median income for eligibility criteria. CCDF allows states to set income limits within 85% of state median income, while LIHEAP uses 60% of state median income as an alternative measure of low income. Postsecondary student aid programs use a relative concept for aid eligibility based on family income and assets. Applicants provide income and asset information through FAFSA to determine Expected Family Contribution (EFC) for student aid programs like Pell Grants. Different EFC formulas are used for dependent, independent with no dependents, and independent with dependents. Pell Grants cap aid, favoring low-income students. The lower living standard income level (LLSIL) is used in eligibility determinations for employment and training programs under WIA. It originated from family budgets developed by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1967, based on different standards of living. The LLSIL is updated annually based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The LLSIL is updated annually based on changes in the CPI-U. Under WIA, eligibility is determined by income at or below 100% of the federal poverty guidelines or 70% of the LLSIL, whichever is higher. LLSIL varies by region and metropolitan areas. Income eligibility criteria vary among federal programs, with differences in counting income. Income eligibility criteria for federal programs vary, with differences in how income is counted between programs. Wages are typically considered, but some programs may exclude a portion of earned income to encourage work. Social Security, retirement income, disability insurance, and other benefits may or may not be counted. Means-tested benefits are often excluded when determining eligibility for other programs. Programs also differ in whether they consider the income of the individual applicant or their household members. Income eligibility criteria for federal programs vary in how income is counted, with variations in pre-tax or post-tax income, monthly or annual basis, and allowable deductions. Eligibility rules may differ from benefit determinations, where individuals with the same income may receive different benefit levels due to specific calculation rules. Some programs also use asset or resource tests to limit eligibility based on asset values. Assets valued above a certain level are required for eligibility in certain programs, with varying limits on countable assets. Asset tests apply in health care programs like VA medical care and Medicare Part D, while Medicaid only requires asset tests for specific categories like those aged 65 or older, with disabilities, or high medical expenses. Cash assistance programs like pensions for needy veterans and SSI also have asset rules. States have the option to apply asset tests under CHIP, but few currently do. Several programs, including pensions for needy veterans and the SSI program, have asset rules. States can choose to apply asset tests in their TANF programs. SNAP is the only food assistance program with a resource test. Housing programs do not have asset tests but may impute income from assets. Higher education programs consider assets along with income to determine financial aid. Many programs, such as Foster Care and Adoption Assistance, still have remnants of the AFDC assets test. Legal Services Corporation grantees must establish \"reasonable\" asset limits. Categorical requirements and financial eligibility rules must be met for most programs, targeting specific low-income populations like the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and dependent children. Other target groups include veterans, students, homeless individuals, Indians, and refugees. Some programs have behavioral requirements for eligibility, such as work and training for TANF recipients, good academic standing for student aid recipients, and participation in self-sufficiency programs for Public Housing residents. Certain individuals are automatically excluded from some programs based on behaviors or characteristics. For example, to receive SNAP benefits for more than a limited time, able-bodied adults without dependent children must comply with work and training requirements. Additionally, CCDF-funded child care requires parents to be working or in training. Certain individuals are automatically disqualified from various programs based on behaviors or characteristics. For example, postsecondary students, households with members on strike, or individuals living in institutions are excluded from SNAP. Federal laws also disqualify individuals fleeing arrest, convicted of drug-related felonies, or fleeing prosecution for felonies from participating in certain programs like SNAP, TANF, and SSI. TANF allows states to test cash aid applicants for substance abuse. Additionally, federal housing laws prohibit individuals convicted of producing methamphetamine on federally-assisted housing property or on a state sex offender registry from Public Housing or Section 8 vouchers. Public housing authorities may have additional criteria for admission. Noncitizens' eligibility for federal programs serving low-income populations is determined by various factors such as immigration status, arrival in the U.S., legal residency duration, work history, and state policies. Federal policies on noncitizen eligibility are outlined in program statutes and overarching provisions from welfare and immigration reform laws. Public housing authorities can impose additional criteria for admission, including barring households with criminal convictions, poor credit or rental histories. Aliens living in the U.S. without legal authorization are generally barred from accessing most federal benefits. \"Automatic eligibility\" simplifies the process by deeming individuals eligible for multiple programs if they meet the criteria for one program. Medicaid, Medicare Part D low-income subsidy, and services for refugees allow some degree of automatic eligibility based on demographic groups or characteristics. Automatic eligibility simplifies access to various programs based on specific criteria. SSI recipients qualify for Medicaid and Part D subsidy, while unaccompanied minor children receive transitional medical services for refugees. Cash assistance programs vary in automatic eligibility, with TANF and SNAP recipients automatically qualifying for child nutrition programs. Other groups like Head Start children and homeless youth also have automatic eligibility for certain nutrition programs. In the education category, the Pell Grant program allows certain postsecondary students to qualify for an automatic zero EFC, ensuring they receive the maximum Pell Grant award if they meet specific criteria. The Pell Grant program allows postsecondary students to qualify for an automatic zero EFC if they meet specific criteria, such as having family income levels below certain thresholds. This greatly reduces the burden of completing financial aid forms. Alternative criteria are used in various programs to determine eligibility for participants. Adult Basic Education is for adults lacking basic skills, Title I Migrant Education serves children of migrant workers, and Education for Homeless Children and Youth is based on living situations. GEAR-UP targets students at risk of dropping out, while Reading First and Early Reading First focus on reading proficiency. Indian education programs cater to federally recognized tribe members. Child Support Enforcement serves families receiving TANF, foster care payments, or Medicaid. Head Start is for children receiving public assistance, foster children, homeless children, and some non-low-income children meeting specific criteria. Individuals with developmental disabilities, older foster children, and former foster children are eligible for specific programs regardless of income status. Energy programs provide automatic eligibility for TANF and SSI recipients. Weatherization allows LIHEAP recipients to be automatically eligible, and LIHEAP provides automatic eligibility for SNAP and certain veterans benefits. Certain groups like public assistance recipients, homeless youth, and foster youth automatically qualify for WIA youth activities and Job Corps. WIA adult program gives priority to certain individuals. The WIA adult program prioritizes low-income adults, including those receiving public assistance or homeless individuals. Federal funds are distributed to states or local governments based on factors related to need or eligible individuals. Targeting provisions help address variations in fiscal capacity at the state and local level. The distribution of federal funds to states or areas is based on factors related to need, cost-sharing rules vary by measure of need, and provisions limit funds to institutions serving low-income individuals. Targeting concepts vary widely and some programs use a combination of these concepts. Table 5 summarizes targeting concepts, and Table B-2 in Appendix B shows their use by program. There is overlap between programs with individual eligibility criteria and those targeting federal resources. Federal grant programs often use targeting mechanisms to distribute funds based on need, with some programs requiring individual income eligibility. Formula grants are common, allocating funding based on population factors to areas with high concentrations of the target group. These programs typically have a cap on federal spending. Federal grant programs often use allocation factors to determine each jurisdiction's share of total funding. These factors can be need-based or based on historic spending patterns. Provisions like \"hold-harmless\" and small-state minimums are used to mitigate large changes in funding allotments. Data sources used are significant and sometimes specified in statute. In low-income programs, allocation factors are used to distribute funds among states based on past and projected spending. The CHIP program allocates funds based on the number of low-income children without health insurance. The Ryan White program allocates funds based on population size and AIDS cases, without considering income levels. The Maternal and Child Health block grant allocates funds based on states' shares of funding and low-income children population. TANF block grants are allocated according to historic spending under AFDC. WIC and Commodity Supplemental Food Program allocate resources based on food costs and caseload. TEFAP allocates resources based on the number of poor and unemployed individuals. Nutrition for the elderly under the Older Americans Act allocates funds based on the population age 60. The Older Americans Act allocates funds based on the population age 60 and older, with no income factor. Various housing and development programs use different need-based formulas to allocate funds, considering factors like rural population, poverty, overcrowded housing, unemployment, elderly or disabled individuals, and housing units occupied by low-income households. Community Development Block Grants, Emergency Shelter Grants, Indian Housing Block Grants, and the HOME program also use specific criteria to distribute funds to eligible communities and states. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program-1 allocated funds based on home foreclosures, subprime mortgages, and homes in default. Congress establishes a formula for allocating Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers among public housing authorities. The distribution of vouchers may not reflect the current eligible population. Public Housing funds are allocated by formula, but the distribution of units receiving funds is based on decisions made by local communities in the past. Title I-A of ESEA distributes funds to local educational agencies based on factors like the number of school-aged children in poverty and average per-pupil expenditures in the state. Areas with high concentrations of poverty receive additional weighting under certain formulas. These allocations also determine state shares for other education programs like Education for Homeless Children and Youth and 21st Century Community Learning Centers. Reading First, Math/Science Partnerships, and Improving Teacher Quality Grants also use poverty levels as an allocation factor. Some education programs target specific populations without explicit income ties. The Migrant Education Program and Adult Basic Education allocate funds based on specific population factors, not explicitly tied to income. Other programs like Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants and Federal Work-Study Program allocate funds based on student \"need.\" Social services programs often include poverty-related factors in their funding formulas. Components of the CCDF are distributed using various formulas, including factors like a state's share of children under age 5 and children receiving free or reduced-price school meals. Head Start, Legal Services Corporation, Older Americans Act, Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, and other social services programs allocate funds based on specific population factors such as age, poverty population, and number of foster children. These allocation factors are not explicitly tied to income. The allocation of funds for various social services programs is based on specific population factors such as age, poverty population, and number of foster children. Different programs use different criteria for fund distribution, including factors like total state population, number of unemployed persons, low-income population, climate conditions, and residential energy expenditures. LIHEAP, for example, uses a complex formula that considers total residential energy consumption, temperature variation, and low-income heating and cooling consumption. Training programs like Community Service Employment for Older Americans receive funding based on state shares of the nation's population age 55-plus and per capita income. WIA funds are allocated based on unemployment rates and disadvantaged populations. Funding for employability services for refugees is determined by the number of refugees and humanitarian cases in the state. Federal government may cover a larger share of costs based on income levels or poverty concentration in the community. The federal government may cover a larger share of costs based on income levels or poverty concentration in the state or community being served. This can be achieved through a federal matching rate tied to income or need, or special provisions that increase the federal share under specific circumstances. Medicaid, a federal-state partnership program, is the largest program discussed, with no predetermined cap on federal spending. The federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) varies by state and is inversely related to per capita income. The federal government adjusts Medicaid costs based on state income levels, with lower-income states receiving more funding. The CHIP program uses an enhanced FMAP for funding. States must contribute their own money to receive full federal funds. The federal government adjusts federal funds allocation based on income levels for various programs such as the Medicaid FMAP, child care funds, and rural Water and Waste Disposal program. The Public Works and Economic Development program may increase the federal share of program costs up to 80% based on the relative needs of the area. The federal government adjusts federal funds allocation based on income levels for various programs. The 21st Century Community Learning Center program allows states to require local grantees to match federal funds, adjusted based on poverty levels. The developmental disabilities program requires a nonfederal match, which may be reduced for projects in poverty areas. Many programs for low-income people require eligibility tests for participants or beneficiaries. Some programs also require geographic areas or entities to meet income or need-related tests to target federal resources towards low-income populations. Consolidated Health Centers target medically underserved populations in designated areas with federal funding. TANF block grants are distributed to all states, while contingency funds are based on economic need. TANF supplemental grants are given to states with high population growth or low historic welfare spending. Some housing and development programs limit eligibility to areas in need. Some housing and development programs restrict eligibility based on community need. For example, Water and Waste Disposal grants and loans are for communities unable to finance projects otherwise. Public Works and Economic Development funding is for areas with low income, high unemployment, or special needs. Education programs like Institutional Aid target institutions with high proportions of students receiving need-based assistance or Pell Grants. Funding under the 21st Century Community Learning Center program is for high-poverty schools. Federal grants for education and social services have specific eligibility criteria based on poverty levels. Programs like GEAR-UP grants require partnerships with low-income middle schools, while Emergency Food and Shelter Grants are allocated to jurisdictions based on population, unemployment, and poverty rates. These grants are structured as nationwide programs, with funds distributed to specified jurisdictions for delivery to eligible individuals. Federal assistance for low-income individuals includes formula-based grants, competitive awards, and direct benefits. These funds are allocated nationwide based on specific factors like poverty levels. Matching requirements for state or local spending are also discussed, along with policies for Indian tribes and U.S. territories. Formula-based grants use cost-sharing formulas to determine federal funds for states, with some programs requiring states to pass funds to local entities. Medicaid payments are made to states in the health care category. In the health care category, Medicaid, CHIP, Maternal and Child Health block grant, Transitional Cash and Medical Services for refugees, and the Ryan White program allocate and award funds to states using formulas. Cash aid and TANF operate as formula grants to states, while other cash programs award benefits directly to individuals. Most food assistance programs are formula grants to states, with SNAP being a hybrid program that provides benefits directly to eligible individuals. SNAP benefits are a hybrid program where states administer the program and the federal government reimburses states for part of their administrative costs. Housing and development formula grants typically allocate funds at the substate level. Some programs make formula grants at the state level, awarding funds to state agencies. Community Development Block Grants go to substate \"entitlement communities\" and states on behalf of other local sponsors. Development Block Grants are allocated to substate \"entitlement communities\" and states for non-entitlement communities. Various programs like Emergency Shelter Grants, HOME, HOPWA, and NSP-1 distribute federal funds to metropolitan cities, urban counties, and non-metropolitan areas. Public Housing and Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers are awarded to local public housing authorities, while Indian Housing Block Grants go to Indian tribes. Education programs under ESEA provide formula grants to state and local educational agencies, with additional programs like Adult Basic Education and Education for Homeless Children and Youth operating as formula grants to states. Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants and Federal Work-Study program also allocate funds through formulas. Education Opportunity Grants and Federal Work-Study program allocate funds to institutions of higher education through formulas. Most social services programs are structured as formula grants to states, except for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program which allocates funding to local jurisdictions. Head Start and Legal Services Corporation use state-level data to allocate funds among states, with grants awarded directly to local programs. CSBG requires states to pass through allotments to local entities, while Older Americans Act grants are suballocated to local agencies. Weatherization and LIHEAP grants are awarded to states, which then use local agencies to operate programs. WIA allocates federal funds for employment and training programs. Federal programs, including WIA and the Community Service Employment Program, allocate funds through formulas or competitive grants. Grantees are selected based on criteria set by authorizing laws, with some programs having annual competitions or multi-year periods for funding. Formula grants are more common than competitive awards for limited-income populations. Several federal programs allocate funds through formulas or competitive grants, with grantees selected based on specific criteria. In health care, competitive grants are available for Family Planning, Consolidated Health Centers, Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection, and the Ryan White program. The Public Works and Economic Development program offers grants to various entities, including economic development districts, states, local governments, and nonprofit organizations. The Emergency Shelter Grants program is an exception, as it is formula-driven. Homeless Assistance Grants are awarded competitively to states, local governments, public housing authorities, private nonprofits, and community mental health centers. HOPWA and HOPE VI also have competitive grant components. The federal government administers discretionary education programs like Institutional Aid, TRIO programs, and GEAR-UP. TANF grants for social services promoting healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood are awarded competitively to public and private nonprofit agencies. Head Start and Legal Services Corporation also allocate funds by formula but award directly to local grantees. Employment and training programs like Foster Grandparents and Job Corps centers are operated through contracts with selected agencies. Among various programs, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Indian Health Service provide free medical care to eligible veterans and American Indians/Alaskan Natives. The Part D Medicare program subsidizes prescription drug insurance costs through contracts with drug plans. Cash aid, except for TANF, is directly provided to beneficiaries by the Social Security Administration under SSI. The Internal Revenue Service administers the EITC and ACTC, issuing refund checks directly to eligible workers. The VA makes direct payments to recipients of pensions for needy veterans. SNAP is a hybrid of direct benefits and formula grants to states, with states determining eligibility and benefit levels. Housing and development programs provide benefits directly, such as rural housing loans and payments to property owners participating in rental assistance programs. HUD also makes direct payments to property owners. The HUD makes direct payments to property owners in rental assistance programs like the Rural Rental Assistance Payments program and Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance Program. Pell Grants and Academic Competitiveness and Smart Grants are paid to schools for eligible students. Nonfederal spending related to federal programs for limited-income populations is significant, such as Medicaid where states contribute their own funds. In 2009, national health expenditures under Medicaid totaled $385 billion. In 2009, Medicaid expenditures totaled $385 billion, with $254 billion federal and $131 billion state or local. The decrease in state and local spending from CY2008 to CY2009 is attributed to the increased federal medical assistance percentage authorized by ARRA. Matching, maintenance-of-effort, and supplement and not supplant requirements are common in low-income programs. Matching grants in federal programs can be structured in two ways: reimbursement for eligible expenditures or requiring grantees to provide a nonfederal share. Nonfederal contributions can be in cash or in-kind, such as donated property or volunteer services. Examples of programs with matching requirements include Ryan White for HIV/AIDS, Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection, and Maternal and Child programs. Some federal programs, like TANF and School Lunch, have maintenance-of-effort requirements to ensure minimum nonfederal spending. Other programs with MOE provisions include The Emergency Food Assistance Program and Title I-A of ESEA. Education programs, such as Title I-A of ESEA, use the \"supplement and not supplant\" concept to prevent federal funds from replacing nonfederal funds. Programs for Indian populations like Indian Health Service and Indian Education are included, with tribes eligible for additional program participation through competitive awards or set-aside funding. Tribes and tribal organizations, as well as other Indian entities, are eligible to participate in various federal programs such as the Ryan White program, WIC, Water and Waste Disposal grants, and more. Additionally, tribes can apply directly for participation in block grant programs like TANF and LIHEAP. Several block grant programs, including TANF, CSBG, Weatherization Assistance, and LIHEAP, reserve funds for Indian tribes. Education programs like Title I-A of ESEA and social services programs like CCDF also set aside funds for Indian tribes. Certain programs have separate Indian components funded and administered independently, such as SNAP and the Older Americans Act. Title VI authorizes separate nutrition and social services programs for Native Americans, while Community Development Block Grants provide a separate Indian Community Development grant. United States territories are eligible for federal programs for people with limited income, with eligibility varying by program. Title V of P.L. 95-134 allows federal agencies to consolidate grants for territories like American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Eligibility of U.S. territories for federal programs is discussed in detail. Some federal programs include U.S. territories like Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Puerto Rico is often treated as a state in terms of eligibility. Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau are also included in some programs. Formula grants for U.S. territories like Puerto Rico may have different criteria for funding levels compared to states. Discretionary grants include territories as eligible entities. This report does not discuss the value of benefits received under programs for low-income individuals, as quantifying their value is complex and subjective. The value of benefits provided under various education, housing, food assistance, and service programs is difficult to estimate due to factors that vary for each individual case, such as family income and fair market rent. Pell Grants and other higher education benefits are calculated based on available resources and cost of attendance at the student's college or university. When calculating benefits for individuals and families, factors like income, assets, and cost of goods/services are considered. The value of cash and near-cash benefits, such as SNAP, depends on specific circumstances and can be complex. Benefits vary based on family size and other sources of income. Table 6 outlines maximum benefit amounts for programs like SSI, EITC, ACTC, veterans' pensions, TANF, and SNAP. The table outlines maximum benefit amounts for programs like SSI, EITC, ACTC, veterans' pensions, TANF, and SNAP for different family sizes. Benefits are adjusted annually for price inflation, except for SNAP which was raised by ARRA, suspending benefit adjustments. SNAP benefits were raised by ARRA, suspending benefit adjustments in 2010 and 2011. SSI, veterans' benefits, EITC, ACTC, and SNAP benefits are determined by federal law. States can supplement SSI benefits and have their own EITCs. TANF benefits vary by state and are not regularly adjusted for price inflation. The table displays maximum TANF cash benefits for states with varying levels, with some states increasing benefit amounts. Federal programs for low-income individuals are diverse and evolved over decades to address different policy goals. This report offers a snapshot of policies and spending in FY2008 and FY2009. This report provides an overview of policies and spending in FY2008 and FY2009 on benefits and services for low-income populations. It focuses on eligibility criteria and distribution of federal resources, without delving into program effectiveness or comprehensive evaluations. The report focuses on federal programs for low-income populations, which rely on federal poverty guidelines for income eligibility. Despite different eligibility rules, many programs have overlapping target populations, raising questions about potential duplication. Questions can be raised about potential duplication, ease of access to benefits, gaps in eligibility and available benefits, and efficiency of service delivery mechanisms in federal low-income programs. The variety of targeting provisions also raises equity concerns. Limited data in fact sheets raises questions about participation rates and characteristics of beneficiaries in these programs. The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data from the third quarter of 2008 shows that 24% of US households received benefits from means-tested programs, including Medicaid, school meals, SNAP, housing assistance, SSI, TANF, WIC, LIHEAP, and veterans' programs. The SIPP data shows that 24% of US households receive benefits from means-tested programs like Medicaid, school meals, SNAP, housing assistance, SSI, TANF, WIC, LIHEAP, and veterans' programs. The report highlights the growth of certain categories, such as health programs, and the implications of program size, budget classification, and design diversity on policymaking in times of fiscal constraint. Many programs for low-income individuals operate through formula grants to states. Many low-income benefit programs operate through formula grants to states, requiring nonfederal funds for access. States also play a role in determining eligibility and supplementing federal benefits. The ability of states to access federal funding and support low-income benefits is uncertain due to state budget constraints and federal deficit concerns. Programs included in the report are selected based on eligibility criteria tied to low income measures or targeting resources towards low-income individuals. Some programs serve disproportionately low-income populations, while others are designed for participants presumed to be low-income. The report includes programs like Pell Grants and Child Tax Credit, which target low-income individuals. Federal student loan programs were not included due to less targeted benefits, while the Additional Child Tax Credit was included for its refundable nature. The ACTC is a refundable credit for low-income families, with 87% of returns below $40,000 AGI claiming it in 2008. It is included in the report along with other categorized programs like health, cash aid, food assistance, and education. Some programs can have spending disaggregated into specific categories, while others must be assigned to a single category. For example, Transitional Cash and Medical Services for Refugees was categorized as health care, and Indian Human Services was categorized as social services. The social services category is not well-defined, and some programs like Head Start could be considered education programs. The curr_chunk discusses programs like Foster Care and Adoption Assistance, categorized as social services, providing cash to families or care providers. The measure of spending for the report is based on new obligations incurred in the fiscal year. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations, such as entering contracts and employing personnel. Outlays represent actual payments, sourced from the U.S. Budget Appendix for FY2011 and FY2010. Appropriations were used when obligations data was not available at the necessary program level for certain programs. The Budget Appendix for FY2011 and FY2010 shows appropriations used for various programs including Transitional Cash and Medical Services for Refugees, Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection, Title I Migrant Education Program, Social Services, Targeted Assistance for Refugees, and Foster Grandparents. Obligations for veterans' medical care were calculated from Department of Veterans Affairs data. The Budget Appendix does not show obligations solely for the low-income subsidy portion of the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. The curr_chunk discusses the subsidy for the calendar year, loan subsidy outlays for the Section 502 single-family rural housing loan program, TANF obligations disaggregated into cash aid, social services, and employment and training categories. Spending Threshold Programs with obligations of at least $100 million in FY2008 or FY2009 are included, while smaller programs are excluded to simplify the analysis. The curr_chunk discusses the exclusion of smaller programs that met low-income criteria, with only one program exceeding the spending threshold in one year but not the other. The spending totals for FY2009 include obligations for this program, while FY2008 totals do not, providing a snapshot of spending for low-income programs with obligations totaling at least $100 million. The comparison with the predecessor CRS report series from 1979 to 2006 is also highlighted. The current report replaces the Cash and Noncash series with different methodologies for program selection and categorization. It includes programs like the low-income subsidy under Medicare Part D and Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, while excluding smaller programs and student loans. The older series had no minimum spending threshold and categorized programs differently. The report categorizes programs differently than the older series, using obligations where possible. State-local spending estimates and tracing spending back to 1968 are not included in this report due to changes in programs and appropriations over time. Detailed Program Tables in Appendix B provide specific information about programs included in the report. Table B-1 in Appendix C shows obligations for each program for FY2008 and FY2009, including ARRA amounts. Table B-2 identifies target populations and income eligibility concepts for each program. The table in the report provides details on federal assistance programs, including allocation factors and types of assistance provided. It also explains the concept of \"immediate\" recipients and the further distribution of funds to other entities. Additional details can be found in fact sheets, CRS reports, or statutes. The table in the report details federal assistance programs, allocation factors, and types of assistance. It explains the concept of \"immediate\" recipients and further fund distribution. Fact sheets provide additional information on each program. The fact sheets provide detailed information on federal assistance programs, including CFDA numbers, administering agencies, program purposes, eligibility criteria, funding allocation, obligations in FY2008 and FY2009, budget classification, and program participation data. The information is sourced from statutes, regulations, agency websites, and CRS reports, focusing on key details relevant to the overall analysis in the report. The fact sheets contain detailed information on federal assistance programs, including CFDA numbers, administering agencies, program purposes, and eligibility criteria. The programs are described as they existed in FY2009, with references provided for significant changes enacted after that year. For complete information on a specific program, readers are directed to legal citations, federal administering agencies, or identified CRS reports. The VA provides specialized medical benefits to eligible veterans, including preventive services, primary health care, mental health services, and emergency care. Eligibility is based on veteran status, service-connected disabilities, and other factors such as former prisoners of war or Purple Heart recipients. Long-term care options are also available for some veterans. Priority Group 5 veterans, who have no service-connected conditions and are Medicaid-eligible or have income below certain thresholds, can enroll in the VA health care system. Services are provided directly by the VA or through contracts. In FY2009, 1,484,467 Priority Group 5 veteran patients received care from the VA, with estimated obligations of $11.644 billion. Family Planning program under CFDA #93.217 provides education, counseling, and medical services to help individuals determine the number and spacing of their children. Services include a broad range of family planning methods, infertility services, and services for adolescents. The program is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Family Planning, and is free for individuals with income below certain thresholds. The Family Planning program under CFDA #93.217 offers education, counseling, and medical services for individuals to determine family planning. Services are free for those with income below specific thresholds and are provided on a sliding fee scale for those with incomes between 100% and 250% of federal poverty guidelines. Priority is given to individuals from low-income families, and federal assistance is in the form of competitive grants to public and nonprofit agencies. Agencies in territories can also participate. The Title X Family Planning Program, funded at $307 million in FY2009, serves 5.051 million users through Title X-funded sites. The program has no matching requirements and is discretionary. The Consolidated Health Centers program operates under CFDA #93.224, authorized by Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. The Centers Consolidation Act of 1996 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act reauthorized the program to provide health care services to medically underserved groups. Services are delivered by community health centers, migrant health centers, health centers for the homeless, and health centers for residents of public housing. Eligibility is based on being designated as medically underserved by the Secretary. The Secretary designates populations with a shortage of health services based on economic factors. Grant funds cover services for individuals and families below federal poverty guidelines. Competitive grants are given to public and private nonprofit entities. Grantees are expected to collect fees from third-party payors. Health centers receive funding from various sources including federal funds, state, local, and other federal sources. In FY2008, 1.7 million patients were served with a budget of $2.021 billion. New obligations in FY2009 amounted to $3.665 billion, including funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Cash and Medical Services to Refugees (CFDA #93.566) is authorized by the Refugee Act of 1979 and provides cash payments and medical benefits to eligible individuals to assist in their resettlement and achieve economic self-sufficiency. The program is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Refugee Resettlement, and offers cash payments equal to the state's Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and medical benefits through payments to healthcare providers. Eligible individuals may also receive refugee cash assistance while awaiting Supplemental Security Income approval. Individuals eligible for Refugee Cash Assistance (CFDA #93.566) include adult refugees, asylees, humanitarian cases, and trafficking victims who meet income and asset tests for TANF or Medicaid. Unaccompanied refugee minor children are also eligible. Federal assistance is provided through formula grants to states and discretionary grants to alternative programs and voluntary agencies. Territories like American Samoa and Puerto Rico can participate. Formula funds are allocated to states based on eligible expenditures estimates. No matching requirements for formula grants, but voluntary agencies receiving discretionary grants must provide a $1 match for every 2 federal dollars. Discretionary grants for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) require a $1 match for every 2 federal dollars. Obligations for FY2009 were $282 million and for FY2008 were $296 million. The program is authorized by Title XXI of the Social Security Act and administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. No participation data is available. The Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administers the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to provide health coverage to uninsured, low-income children. Coverage can be through Medicaid expansion, a separate CHIP program, or a combination. States may offer benchmark benefit packages including Blue Cross/Blue Shield, state employee health coverage, or HMO plans. States have the option to provide coverage for uninsured, low-income children through Medicaid expansion or a separate CHIP program. They can offer benchmark benefit plans similar to those listed above and may waive basic benefit rules for demonstration projects. Medicaid expansion programs must follow nominal cost-sharing rules or apply alternative higher premiums. States with separate CHIP programs can vary cost-sharing requirements by family. States with separate CHIP programs may vary cost-sharing requirements by family income, but the total annual aggregate cost-sharing for a family may not exceed 5% of total income in a year. Children under age 19 who lack health insurance and do not qualify for regular Medicaid are eligible. States can set the upper income limit for targeted children at up to 200% of federal poverty guidelines. Pregnant women without health insurance and meeting income thresholds may also be covered. Other groups may be covered under certain circumstances, such as through Section 1115 waivers. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides federal assistance through formula grants to states and territories. The allotment methodology changed in FY2009, basing allotments on states' past or projected federal CHIP spending. Annual allotments are available for two years, with unspent funds redistributed to shortfall states or as bonus payments for states exceeding child enrollment targets. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides federal assistance to states based on past or projected spending. Funds are allocated for states exceeding child enrollment targets and implementing outreach initiatives. State expenditures are matched at an \"enhanced\" federal medical assistance percentage (E-FMAP), lowering the state's share of CHIP expenditures. The CHIP E-FMAP rate ranges from 65% to 85%. Mandatory funding for FY2009 was $9.534 billion, and for FY2008 was $6.360 billion. During FY2009, 7,717,317 children and 504,915 adults were enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The program operates under Part D of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act and was established by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. For more details on changes made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, refer to CRS reports R40444 and R41210. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-173) provides low-income seniors and people with disabilities with comprehensive prescription drug benefits, including reduced premiums and copayments. Eligibility is based on income below 150% of federal poverty guidelines, with certain individuals automatically eligible such as dual eligibles, Medicare Savings Program recipients, and Supplemental Security Income recipients. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 provides comprehensive prescription drug benefits for low-income seniors and people with disabilities. Eligibility is based on income below 150% of federal poverty guidelines, with certain individuals automatically eligible such as dual eligibles, Medicare Savings Program recipients, and Supplemental Security Income recipients. In calendar year 2009, 10 million beneficiaries received low-income subsidies under the program. The Medicaid program, established in 1965 under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, provides medical assistance to families with dependent children and aged, blind, or disabled individuals who cannot afford necessary medical care. Administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, the program aims to help recipients achieve independence and self-care by covering certain health benefits and providing rehabilitation services. Federal law mandates certain health benefits under Medicaid, with optional services available at the state's discretion. Mandatory services include inpatient hospital care, services from federal health centers, physician services, nursing facility care for those 21 and older, and home health care for those eligible for nursing home care. Optional services may include prescribed drugs, clinic services, psychiatric care, physical therapy, and transportation. Individual eligibility is based on financial criteria. Eligibility criteria for Medicaid include financial and nonfinancial requirements. Federal law defines over 50 eligible population groups, with some being mandatory for all states to cover and others optional. Income eligibility is often tied to federal poverty guidelines, with specific percentages determining coverage for pregnant women, children, parents, and individuals qualifying for Medicare Part A. Eligibility for Medicaid includes various groups such as Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs) and Specified Low-Income Beneficiaries (SLMs) based on income levels. Other mandatory and optional groups include families from the former AFDC program, pregnant women, children, disabled individuals, and elderly with income thresholds tied to federal poverty guidelines. The Medicaid program provides partial reimbursement to states for eligible expenditures, with no cap on federal spending. It includes Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs) and Qualifying Individuals (QI-1s) with income thresholds. The federal medical assistance payment (FMAP) is based on a state's per capita income, ranging from 50% to 83%. The Medicaid program provides reimbursement to states based on per capita income, with FMAP ranging from 50% to 83%. In FY2009, there was a temporary increase in FMAPs authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Participation data shows an average of 51.1 million individuals enrolled in Medicaid each month in FY2009. Total obligations in FY2009 were $265.058 billion. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (CFDA #93.917) was established by the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-381) and reauthorized by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-87). It aims to provide care and treatment for uninsured or underinsured individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, the program operates under Title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provides core medical services like outpatient care, drug treatments, and mental health services, as well as supportive services such as medical transportation and respite care. Services are free for those below the federal poverty guidelines and on a sliding fee scale for those above. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program offers medical and supportive services on a sliding fee scale basis for individuals and families with HIV disease. Federal assistance is provided through formula and competitive grants to eligible areas, health centers, clinics, and organizations. Territories can also participate in the program. Funds are allocated based on the number of living HIV and AIDS cases. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provides medical and supportive services on a sliding fee scale for individuals and families with HIV disease. Funds are allocated based on the number of living HIV and AIDS cases, with states having to provide a nonfederal match. The program serves over half a million low-income people with HIV/AIDS each year. Budgetary classification is discretionary. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, authorized by the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990 and reauthorized in 2007, aims to provide low-income, uninsured, and underserved women with access to cancer screening and diagnostic services. Services include clinical breast examinations, mammograms, Pap tests, pelvic examinations, diagnostic testing, and referrals to treatment. No fees are charged for women below 100% of the federal poverty guidelines. The Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act of 2000 provides optional Medicaid coverage for women screened through the CDC program. States must prioritize low-income uninsured and underinsured women with income at or below 250% of federal poverty guidelines. Competitive grants are given to states for providing medical services, with a required nonfederal match of $1 for every federal $3. Territories and Indian tribes can also participate in the program. In FY2009, the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant required a nonfederal match of $1 for every federal $3.
