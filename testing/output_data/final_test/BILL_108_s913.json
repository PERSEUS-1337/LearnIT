    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Deposit Insurance Fairness and Economic Opportunity Act\" and it involves the dividend of excess deposit insurance funds to insured depository institutions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to allow the distribution of excess deposit insurance funds to insured depository institutions in the form of a dividend. Excess funds in the Bank Insurance Fund and Savings Association Insurance Fund exceeding 1.40 percent of total insured deposits may be distributed as dividends to insured depository institutions. The Corporation determines each insured depository institution's contribution to the Bank Insurance Fund and Savings Association Insurance Fund for dividend distribution based on specified factors. The Corporation considers the assessment base of insured depository institutions when implementing this subparagraph. The assessment base of insured depository institutions includes the total amount of assessments paid, reflecting higher risk levels assumed by the institution, and other relevant factors. The Corporation may consider other factors deemed appropriate. References to the 'Bank Insurance Fund' and 'Savings Association Insurance Fund' include any successor funds. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will create regulations to implement a section of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act."
