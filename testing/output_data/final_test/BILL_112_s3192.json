    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Sustaining our Most Advanced Researchers and Technology Jobs Act of 2012\" or the \"SMART Jobs Act.\" It defines a STEM field as a field of study or occupation listed on the STEM-designated Degree Program List published by the Department of Homeland Security. The Act also addresses visas for graduate students in mathematics, engineering, technology, or the physical sciences. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to create a new STEM Nonimmigrant Visa Category for graduate programs in STEM fields. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to establish an F-4 Visa for aliens planning to attend accredited graduate programs in STEM fields for advanced degrees. The requirements for obtaining this visa include demonstrating an intent to return to their country of residence. The F-4 Visa allows aliens to attend STEM graduate programs and either return to their home country or pursue employment in the US in a STEM field to become a permanent resident. The visa is valid for the intended study period, with extensions possible for pursuing job offers in STEM fields and while applying for adjustment of status. The F-4 Visa allows aliens to attend STEM graduate programs and pursue employment in the US in a STEM field to become a permanent resident. The alien's application for adjustment of status under section 245(i)(4) is pending, and the Secretary of Homeland Security may adjust the status of an alien who meets specific requirements. An alien meeting specific requirements can apply for adjustment of status to become a permanent resident by submitting an application, being eligible for an immigrant visa, admissible to the US, and paying a fee determined by the Secretary. Fees collected under section 245(i)(4) are used for job training, scholarships, fraud prevention, and detection. The fees collected under section 245(i)(4) are used for job training, scholarships, fraud prevention, and detection, with an amendment to include 20 percent of the fees collected before the period at the end. SEC. 4. ALIENS with advanced STEM degrees and work experience in the US exempt from employment-based immigrant visa limitations. Applies to pending or new visa applications. SEC. 5. Annual report on STEM nonimmigrant visas. The Secretary of Homeland Security must submit an annual report to Congress on nonimmigrant visas granted under section 101(a)(15)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The report must include the number of visas granted, countries of origin of the aliens, degrees obtained by the aliens, fields of study, and employers of the aliens."
