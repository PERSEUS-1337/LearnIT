    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Azerbaijan Democracy Act of 2015\". The United States and Azerbaijan have mutual interests, but cooperation is hindered by Azerbaijan's human rights violations. Investigative reporter Khadija Ismayilova was arrested in 2014 on false charges. Khadija Ismayilova was initially charged with incitement to suicide in Azerbaijan and held in pretrial detention. After government witnesses refused to cooperate, the charges were dropped, but she was then charged with embezzlement, illegal entrepreneurship, tax evasion, and abuse of power. Ismayilova was convicted and is currently serving a 7 1/2-year prison sentence. The RFE/RL Baku Bureau remains closed. The Government of Azerbaijan in 2014 did not respect freedom of speech and press censorship laws, leading to limitations on media independence. Journalists faced intimidation, beatings, and imprisonment. Azerbaijan is the leading jailer of journalists in Europe and Central Asia and the fifth most censored country globally. Despite committing to free and fair elections as an OSCE participating State, Azerbaijan has not met the minimum requirements outlined by the OSCE since its independence in 1992. Parliament in Azerbaijan has shown a disregard for democratic elections, with arbitrary use of state power and violations of basic rights. The United States Department of State's report for 2014 highlights increased arbitrary arrests, politically motivated imprisonment, and lack of due process in the country. According to the 2015 report on religious freedom by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), the Government of Azerbaijan has deteriorated in its respect for religious freedom. The report details the Government's use of the 2009 religion law to limit religious freedom through fines, police raids, detentions, and imprisonment. USCIRF also cited poor conditions for religious minorities in Azerbaijan, with most Protestant denominations lacking legal status. The Government of Azerbaijan has silenced dissent through retribution against political opposition, journalists, and NGOs, using physical threats, beatings, dismissal from employment, and travel restrictions. Opposition candidates and activists in jail have faced harsh treatment, including beatings, denial of access to family and legal counsel, and lack of medical treatment.
