    "content": "The \"Electronic Securities Transactions Act\" aims to facilitate efficient and safe electronic securities transactions due to the growth of electronic commerce and the need to reduce unnecessary costs in the securities markets. The Electronic Securities Transactions Act aims to promote electronic commerce in securities transactions by clarifying the legal status of electronic signatures for documents used in relation to broker-dealers, transfer agents, and investment advisers. In this subsection, key definitions related to electronic documents and signatures are provided, including the definitions of \"document,\" \"electronic,\" \"electronic record,\" \"electronic signature,\" and \"record.\" These definitions clarify the use of electronic signatures in securities transactions. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 define key terms such as \"transaction\" and \"signature\" in the context of business activities regulated under these acts. The Securities Modernization Provisions are outlined in Section 5. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to allow registered brokers and dealers to accept electronic signatures on account opening applications and other documents from customers or counterparties, with legal validity. This provision is subject to Commission determination under specific sections of the Act. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 allows registered brokers and dealers to use electronic signatures for records, with legal validity, as determined by the Commission. Registered brokers and dealers can conduct business using electronic signatures without compromising their legal effect, validity, or enforceability. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 allows registered transfer agents to accept and rely on electronic signatures for documents submitted by customers or counterparties, with legal validity and enforceability. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 permits registered transfer agents to use electronic signatures for records, as long as they meet the requirements set forth in the Act or regulations. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 allows registered transfer agents to use electronic signatures, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 now permits registered investment advisers to accept and rely on electronic signatures for contracts and documents. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 permits registered investment advisers to use electronic signatures for contracts and documents with customers, as determined by the Commission. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 allows registered investment advisers to use electronic signatures for transactions with customers, ensuring that such signatures are legally valid and enforceable. Additionally, registered investment advisers are not subject to state regulations regarding the use of electronic signatures. The Commission has the authority to provide guidance on the acceptance, reliance, and use of electronic signatures by registered brokers, dealers, transfer agents, and investment advisers."
