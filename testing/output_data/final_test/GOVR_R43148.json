    "content": "The oil and natural gas industry has seen a shift in production due to advances in directional drilling and reservoir stimulation, making resources from tight formations more economical to produce. This has led to a rise in U.S. oil and natural gas production, with the United States becoming the third-largest oil producer and the fastest-growing producer. Production from tight formations is expected to continue playing a significant role in the future. The report focuses on the growth in U.S. oil and natural gas production driven by tight oil formations and shale gas formations. Congressional interest in unconventional natural gas and oil production has continued, with discussions on hydraulic fracturing legislation and rules. The House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Energy and Power discussed U.S. energy abundance in June 2013, focusing on unconventional formations like shales and similar rocks that serve as both the source and reservoir for oil and natural gas. Unconventional resources are described as petroleum accumulations pervasive throughout a large area and not significantly affected by hydrodynamic influences, unlike conventional deposits found in porous and permeable sandstone and carbonate reservoirs. Unconventional formations like shales trap oil and gas due to impermeable cap-rock. Prices of natural gas in the US have been volatile, with a significant increase from 2000-2004. Prices peaked in December 2005 but remained high until July 2008, leading to a 32% increase in US net imports of natural gas. U.S. net imports of natural gas rose 32% between 1995 and 2000 and 41% between 1995 and 2007. The industry responded by increasing LNG imports and developing techniques for shale gas production. Approximately 50 LNG import projects were proposed, with 8 eventually constructed. Advances in directional drilling allowed for better extraction from shale formations. Shale gas production in the U.S. significantly increased from 7% in 2007 to almost 40% in 2013, thanks to advancements in directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques. This led to many LNG import terminals becoming idle and transitioning to export terminals. The smaller molecules of methane and natural gas liquids made shale gas production more profitable as natural gas prices rose in the mid-2000s. The success of shale gas development in the U.S. has driven natural gas production to increase almost every month from 2008 through May 2014. This rise in production has led to a decline in natural gas prices, with industry improvements in extracting more gas from shale formations playing a significant role in the continued increase in production. The advancement in hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling has reduced production costs and increased output. With the rise in shale gas production, NGLs have become more important. NGLs are liquid products separated from natural gas, including ethane, propane, butane, and pentanes. When NGLs are present with methane, natural gas is called \"hot\" or \"wet\" gas. Once NGLs are removed, natural gas is referred to as \"dry\" gas. Each NGL has its own market and value, with the natural gas industry shifting towards more liquids-based production due to low dry gas prices. The natural gas industry has shifted its focus to producing in areas with more wet gas to increase value. Companies have moved production to tight oil formations like the Bakken and Eagle Ford to capitalize on shale gas development experience. Wet gas production has increased due to higher oil prices since 2008. Dry gas is often considered a byproduct of wet gas and oil production. The prospect of U.S. energy independence is tied to production growth from tight oil formations. The United States has increased oil production significantly, reducing crude oil imports by 24% since 2005. Energy independence is often linked to North American production growth, with Canada being the largest supplier of U.S. oil imports. Domestic crude oil production is projected to continue rising. Domestic crude oil production in the United States is projected to rise due to increases in production from the Bakken Formation in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford play in Texas. There are concerns about environmental risks and benefits associated with unconventional oil and gas resources, including impacts on water and air quality, as well as long-term effects from reliance on fossil fuels. The report focuses on addressing potential direct environmental impacts of unconventional oil and gas production. Many of these impacts can be mitigated with appropriate safeguards and existing technology. For example, managing wastewater from production activities can strain water resources and treatment plants not designed for removing contaminants. The potential risks of well stimulation by hydraulic fracturing have raised concerns about water quality, but direct connections to groundwater contamination have not been confirmed. Geologists note that the vertical distance between target zones and aquifers in shale formations acts as a barrier to flow, reducing the likelihood of contamination. Geologists and state regulators consider the risk of fracturing reaching potable aquifers in shale formations remote due to the layers serving as barriers to flow. However, developing shallow portions of shale formations could pose a greater risk to groundwater as the distance to potable aquifers would be shorter. In contrast, coalbed methane basins are often considered underground sources of drinking water. State regulators are more concerned about groundwater contamination risks from developing natural gas or oil wells, particularly in relation to hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulically fractured oil and gas wells pose more challenges than conventional wells, including sealing off groundwater and identifying contamination sources. Investigations have found difficulties in pinpointing causes due to complex processes, lack of baseline testing, and confidential compound information. The debate over groundwater contamination risks associated with hydraulic fracturing has been fueled by the lack of scientific studies. Congress has asked the EPA to conduct a study on the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. The terminology surrounding \"fracing\" or \"fracking\" has also complicated the debate. Water quality concerns related to oil and gas extraction include contamination risks from spills, leaks, and siltation. Issues also arise from the large volumes of water needed for hydraulic fracturing, impacting groundwater, streams, and aquatic life. Managing wastewater from production is another challenge. Water quality and cost issues arise from wastewater produced during natural gas production, especially in areas like the Marcellus Shale region. Limited capacity for disposal and restrictions on surface discharge are driving increased water recycling and reuse in the industry. Air emissions from unconventional oil and gas production have raised public health concerns and face regulatory scrutiny. Emission sources include construction activities and drilling. The oil and gas industry is a significant source of methane and VOC emissions, which react with nitrogen oxides to form ozone. Hydraulically fractured gas wells during flowback are identified as an additional source of emissions. Flaring reduces VOC emissions in cases where natural gas is produced without proper infrastructure for disposal. Natural gas flaring is a concern due to the rapid development of tight oil in Texas and North Dakota, leading to increased emissions without economic value. Oil and gas production is widespread in 32 states, primarily on non-federal lands, with states regulating activities. The federal government oversees oil and gas development on federally managed lands, while some states also regulate operators on federal public lands within state boundaries. Hydraulic fracturing, along with other well stimulation techniques, is regulated to varying degrees through state oil and gas codes. State regulations on well stimulation vary in detail and scope, with some states regulating it broadly without explicitly addressing hydraulic fracturing. State regulations on oil and gas production activities, including well construction, stimulation, operation, and wastewater management, have evolved to address the challenges posed by advancements in drilling and fracturing technologies. The development of shale gas and tight oil using high-volume hydraulic fracturing has raised concerns among state groundwater protection officials, leading to revisions in oil and gas laws and regulations in major producing states. States have updated their oil and gas laws and regulations in response to advancements in production technologies. Some have added provisions for hydraulic fracturing, including chemical disclosure requirements. States have also implemented measures for water resource protection, such as casing, cementing, and pressure testing. The number of states with regulations specifically for hydraulic fracturing increased from 4 in 2009 to 13 in 2013, with 21 states requiring reporting of fracturing chemicals by 2013. In 2013, the number of states with regulations for hydraulic fracturing grew to 21. By February 2015, 27 states required chemical disclosure, with 18 using the FracFocus website. New York prohibited high-volume hydraulic fracturing in 2014 based on public health findings. Maryland recommended allowing shale gas drilling with best practices in 2014. North Carolina enacted legislation in 2013 and 2014 regarding permits for oil and gas development using hydraulic fracturing. In 2014, states enacted legislation for shale gas development regulation. Some advocate for federal oversight due to varying state frameworks, while others, including oil and gas states, oppose greater federal involvement. In the 113th and 114th Congress, the debate over federal involvement in regulating oil and gas production, including hydraulic fracturing, has been ongoing. Some argue for greater federal oversight, while others believe states are better equipped to handle regulation due to their experience and ability to consider regional differences. Proposed legislation in Congress has been contentious, with bills aiming to either limit or expand federal involvement in oil and gas development. Legislation proposals regarding federal oversight of oil and gas production, including hydraulic fracturing, have been contentious. Congress has not enacted such legislation since 2005, when the Safe Drinking Water Act was amended to exclude certain fluids from the definition of underground injection. Various federal environmental laws, such as the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, currently apply to activities related to oil and gas production. EPA regulations require a permit for wastewater disposal through deep well injection, with specific requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations involving diesel fuels. In 2012, EPA issued regulations to reduce emissions from oil and gas production, including VOCs from hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. The Administration is pursuing initiatives to regulate unconventional oil and gas production, with EPA considering actions under pollution control statutes to control wastewater discharges and protect aquatic life from brine discharges. EPA is also working on establishing pretreatment standards for shale gas extraction wastewater and revising water quality criteria. In 2014, EPA finalized permitting guidance for diesel use in hydraulic fracturing operations. In 2009, Congress urged EPA to study the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. EPA published a final study plan in 2011 to address water usage in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA is conducting a study on potential contamination of drinking water sources and human exposure risks related to hydraulic fracturing. They are investigating reported incidents of drinking water contamination and have released a status report on their research projects. The study has been designated as a \"highly influential scientific assessment\" and will undergo peer review by the EPA's Science Advisory Board. The EPA is conducting a study on potential contamination of drinking water sources and human exposure risks related to hydraulic fracturing. The research projects are being synthesized into a draft report for peer review and public comment in 2015, with a final report expected in 2016. The White House issued a Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future in March 2011, emphasizing the need for safe domestic oil and gas development. The Secretary of Energy's Advisory Board convened a subcommittee to evaluate issues and make recommendations for mitigating impacts of shale gas development. The SEAB final report included recommendations for states, federal government, and industry regarding shale gas development. Recommendations included measures to protect water quality, manage water use and wastewater disposal, disclose fracturing fluid composition, and adopt best practices for well development. Additionally, actions were recommended to protect air quality through the reduction of emissions of air toxics, ozone precursors, methane, and other pollutants. In 2012, the President issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13605, \"Supporting Safe and Responsible Development of Unconventional Domestic Natural Gas Resources.\" The Executive Order 13605 was issued to coordinate federal agencies overseeing the development of unconventional domestic natural gas resources and infrastructure. An interagency working group was established to ensure coordination on research, resource assessment, and infrastructure development. The lead agencies signed a Memorandum of Agreement to develop a multiagency research plan. The federal government, through the Bureau of Land Management, manages oil and gas resources on federal lands. States regulate oil and gas development on state and private lands, with some states requiring compliance with state rules on federal lands within their borders. Debate continues over the federal role in regulating unconventional oil and gas production, including concerns about overlapping rules. The Bureau of Land Management oversees oil, natural gas, and coal leasing on federal and Indian lands, including split estates. They manage roughly 700 million acres of federal mineral estate and 56 million acres of Indian mineral estate. There are around 47,000 active oil and gas leases and 95,000 wells on public lands. BLM estimates that 2,800 new wells were drilled in 2013, with hydraulic fracturing used in about 90% of them. In 2015, BLM implemented a hydraulic fracturing rule for oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands. The Bureau of Land Management implemented a hydraulic fracturing rule for oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands in 2015. The rule, scheduled to take effect on June 24, 2015, aims to ensure that hydraulic fracturing is conducted in an environmentally protective manner. It is estimated to impact around 2,800 to 3,800 operations annually, with compliance costs potentially reaching $45 million per year. Over 177,000 comments were received on the proposed rule, leading to a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May 2013. The Bureau of Land Management implemented a hydraulic fracturing rule for oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands in 2015. BLM reviewed over 1.4 million comments on the Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking before issuing the final rule. The rule adds reporting and management requirements for fluids used in hydraulic fracturing, requires public disclosure of chemicals used, and ensures wellbore integrity and water resource protection. The final BLM hydraulic fracturing rule requires operators to submit a detailed request for approval before operations begin, including information on wellbore geology, planned wellbore trajectory, and source of fracturing fluids. The BLM hydraulic fracturing rule mandates operators to provide detailed information on water source, volume, and handling, as well as cement integrity and pressure testing before operations. Stricter rules for fluid storage require above-ground tanks, with limited approval for pits. Disclosure of all additives used in fracturing fluids is also required. Operators must disclose information on each additive used in hydraulic fracturing fluids, including chemicals and proppants, to BLM via the FracFocus website within 30 days of completing operations. Operators can request variances from the rule on a case-by-case basis if they can demonstrate alternative methods that meet the rule's objectives. States or tribes can collaborate with BLM to create variances that align with their own regulations. BLM does not allow statewide exemptions from the hydraulic fracturing rule and plans to update oil and gas rules to limit venting and flaring of natural gas. The Coast Guard regulates the shipment of hazardous materials on rivers and classifies cargoes for bulk shipment. In 2012, they received requests for approval to ship wastewater from shale gas extraction in the Marcellus Shale to storage or treatment centers in Ohio, Texas, and Louisiana. The Coast Guard has concerns about shipping shale gas wastewater in barges due to potential contamination with radioactive isotopes like radium-226 and -228. Currently, barge shipment of shale gas extraction wastewater is not allowed, but the Coast Guard is developing a policy to permit its transportation for disposal. In 2013, a draft document was submitted for review regarding the carriage of shale gas extraction wastewater in bulk, and a proposed policy letter was published in October of the same year. The Coast Guard is reviewing public comments on a proposed policy letter for barge shipments of shale gas wastewater. The final policy letter will outline conditions for barge owners to meet for approval. In contrast, bills in the 113th Congress addressed federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, with some proposing limitations and others advocating for expanded federal involvement. In 2013, the House passed H.R. 2728 to prohibit DOI from enforcing federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing. The House passed H.R. 2728 in 2013 to prohibit DOI from enforcing federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing, deferring to state regulations instead. H.R. 2728 aimed to prohibit the Department of the Interior from enforcing hydraulic fracturing regulations on Trust lands without tribal consent. It also required a study on the economic benefits of domestic shale oil and gas production from hydraulic fracturing. The bill included provisions from H.R. 2850 for the EPA to follow specific procedures in studying the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. A companion bill, S. 1743, was introduced in the Senate, and H.R. 2728 was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar. In September 2014, the House passed H.R. 2, which included the text of H.R. 2728. In 2014, the House passed energy legislation (H.R. 2) with provisions from H.R. 2728. The Senate did not act on the bills. H.R. 2513 and S. 1234 proposed giving states sole authority over regulating hydraulic fracturing. S. 1482, the Empower States Act of 2013, aimed to limit federal regulations on oil and gas production on federal land in states meeting federal law requirements. Several bills were proposed in 2013 regarding hydraulic fracturing regulations. H.R. 1548 aimed to require federal agencies to consult with affected state agencies and Indian tribes before issuing regulations, while H.R. 2 included similar language. In contrast, the FRAC Act proposed expanding federal regulation by requiring disclosure of chemicals used in fracturing and repealing certain exemptions. The EPAct 2005 exemption was amended to include hydraulic fracturing fluids under the SDWA. The Climate Protection Act of 2013 proposed chemical disclosure provisions and repealing SDWA Section 1425. Legislation also required testing of groundwater near fracking sites. H.R. 2983, the Safe Hydration is an American Right in Energy Development Act of 2013, aimed to regulate hydraulic fracturing by requiring testing and reporting on underground sources of drinking water. Other related bills included H.R. 1154, which proposed aggregating emissions from oil and gas operations for regulating toxic air pollutants, and H.R. 2825, which aimed to close loopholes in oil and gas regulations. H.R. 2825, the Closing Loopholes and Ending Arbitrary and Needless Evasion of Regulations Act of 2013, aimed to regulate hazardous wastes associated with oil and gas production. Legislation in this Congress focused on expanding and limiting federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing operations, with bills like H.R. 1482 and H.R. 1515 proposing public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process. H.R. 1515, Safe Hydration is an American Right in Energy Development Act of 2015, would require testing of groundwater near hydraulic fracturing sites and public disclosure of chemicals used in the process. The bill would mandate testing before, during, and after fracturing operations, with results posted on the EPA website. S. 15, Protecting States' Rights to Promote American Energy Security Act, would prohibit DOI from enforcing federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing for oil, gas, or geothermal production activities on land. The bill would require DOI to defer to state regulations for hydraulic fracturing activities on federal land. H.R. 1647 directs examination of economic benefits of domestic shale oil and gas production from hydraulic fracturing. S. 785, FRAC Act, would authorize EPA to regulate hydraulic fracturing fluids under the SDWA and require public disclosure of chemicals used. The Senate bill S. 828 clarifies state authority over regulating hydraulic fracturing on federal land. The U.S. could potentially become a major exporter of natural gas and leading oil producer by the end of the decade, driven by technological advances. Global perspectives on oil and gas resources have shifted, with increased concerns about greenhouse gas emissions. Other countries aim to replicate U.S. production success, but challenges remain in how the U.S. will develop further. The United States is developing its shale gas and tight oil resources with increasing efficiency. Initially, only 5% of shale gas could be extracted, now closer to 20%. Concerns over environmental impact and resource extraction rates are generating debate. The development of shale gas and tight oil resources in the United States has raised concerns about potential environmental and human health risks, including impacts on groundwater, surface water, and air quality. There are calls for greater federal oversight of oil and gas development, especially regarding deep-well disposal of wastewater and its potential link to increased seismic activity. While states have primary regulatory authority, federal environmental laws also apply to certain activities in the industry. EPA is involved in monitoring and regulation. The EPA and BLM are reviewing regulatory initiatives for oil and gas exploration. Concerns exist about the impact of low natural gas prices on energy efficiency and renewable sources. The importance of tight oil and shale gas resources to U.S. energy policy is a key focus in Congress. Bills have been introduced to expand or limit federal involvement in hydraulic fracturing. The Administration is taking actions to broaden energy development. The Administration is pursuing federal oversight of the hydraulic fracturing industry through administrative actions."
