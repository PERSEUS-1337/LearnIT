The curr_chunk discusses the benefits of using a unified model for multiple NLP tasks, showcasing improvements through multi-task learning. It emphasizes the use of span-relation representations and the insights gained from extensive experiments across 10 tasks. The curr_chunk explains the release of the General Language Analysis Datasets (GLAD) benchmark with 8 datasets covering 10 tasks in the BRAT format. It highlights the use of span-relation representations for various natural language analysis tasks. The curr_chunk discusses different tasks that can be expressed by defining different L and R, falling into span-oriented and relation-oriented categories. Span-oriented tasks include Named Entity Recognition, Constituency Parsing, Part-of-speech Tagging, and Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis. The curr_chunk discusses aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) as a task involving identifying aspect terms and predicting associated sentiments. Relation-oriented tasks include relation extraction, coreference resolution, semantic role labeling, open information extraction, and dependency parsing. The curr_chunk discusses various NLP tasks such as Dependency Parsing and Opinion Role Labeling. It mentions that sentence-level tasks like text classification and natural language inference are not covered. The focus is on tasks using phrase-like spans rather than entire sentences. The curr_chunk focuses on span-relation representations for natural language analysis, excluding tasks like machine translation, dialog response generation, and summarization. It mentions that a single model can solve various analysis tasks formulated in a single format, based on a span-based model adapted for different tasks. The curr_chunk discusses a model for representing spans in natural language processing tasks, utilizing a fixed-length vector to predict labels for spans or span pairs. It describes the span representation method using content and boundary components, incorporating embeddings like GloVe, ELMo, and BERT. The curr_chunk introduces additional labels NEG SPAN and NEG REL for invalid spans and span pairs in end-to-end relation extraction. It uses a multilayer perceptron to predict labels for spans and prunes spans with low NEG SPAN probabilities for efficiency before applying another MLP to produce relation scores. The curr_chunk discusses different training loss functions for tasks with varying requirements in relation extraction. Two loss functions are provided: Pairwise and Head, with Pairwise being used for all tasks. The curr_chunk discusses the time complexity of span prediction and relation prediction in various tasks, including coreference resolution and constituency parsing. Different inference methods are used for generating valid outputs, such as linking a span to the antecedent with the highest score for coreference resolution. The curr_chunk discusses the advantages of span-based models in modeling overlapping spans and exploring span-level information for prediction tasks. It highlights the task-agnostic nature of the SpanRelation model, which can be applied to various tasks by formulating them as span-relation prediction problems with defined labels. The model uses a unified approach for predicting relations for all span pairs and constructing outputs. The unified SpanRelation (SpanRel) model simplifies scaling to various language analysis tasks by enabling multi-task learning through shared span representations. It allows tasks to learn from each other, but the benefits may vary depending on the linguistic aspects captured. SpanRel offers a systematic way to evaluate the relative benefits of training on related tasks, compared to manually selecting tasks based on prior knowledge. The GLAD benchmark includes 8 datasets converted to BRAT format for natural language analysis evaluation. Evaluation metric is span-based F1, measuring precision and recall of extracted spans compared to ground truth. SpanRel model shows benefits in multi-task learning. The SpanRel model is evaluated using span-based F1 metric for precision and recall of extracted spans. Standard metrics are computed for different tasks, and hyperparameters are tuned on the development set. The model is compared with state-of-the-art task-specific models by training on data from a single task. The SpanRel model is compared to state-of-the-art task-specific models by training on a single task. It achieves comparable performance, showing that the span-relation format can represent tasks effectively. The SpanRel model demonstrates strong performance across various natural language analysis tasks, serving as a generic baseline for task-specific designs. Contextualized token representations outperform GloVe, highlighting the benefits of pre-training on large corpora. The SpanRel model shows strong performance in various NLP tasks, using span-based F1 for evaluation. Memory constraints limit constituency parsing to a span length of 10 in MTL. The performance of different NLP tasks varies when using GloVe-based models or contextualized representations. GloVe-based models struggle with tasks that have sparse data, while contextualized representations show mixed results across tasks. Stronger contextualized representations lead to better performance in multi-task learning with fine-tuning. SpanBERT, a contextualized embedding pre-trained with span-based training, improves performance in tasks like NER, RE, OpenIE, SRL, and ORL. SpanBERT, a contextualized embedding pre-trained with span-based training objectives, shows improvements in various tasks except ABSA. The GLAD benchmark is used to evaluate natural language analysis capability. Task Relatedness Analysis involves studying interactions between different tasks using multi-task learning with source tasks like POS, NER, Consti., Dep., and SRL, and target tasks like OpenIE, NER, RE, ABSA, ORL, and SRL. The benefit of pre-training overlaps with multi-task learning, with GloVe used initially to study task relatedness. In the previous paragraphs, SpanBERT, a contextualized embedding pre-trained with span-based training objectives, shows improvements in various tasks except ABSA.

Moving on to the current paragraph, it discusses the impact of different tasks on each other in multi-task learning, highlighting the varying degrees of improvement based on task relatedness and token representation strength. In multi-task learning, the benefits of large-scale pre-training and multi-task learning tend to overlap, leading to improvements in tasks like OpenIE and SRL. However, some source tasks like Consti. and POS can become harmful when shifting from GloVe to BERT. Multi-task learning effectiveness decreases with larger SRL datasets, suggesting it is more useful when target data is sparse. The development of general architectures for NLP tasks has gained interest, with a focus on sequence labeling frameworks. Researchers have developed general frameworks for multi-task learning in natural language processing, such as sequence labeling and sequence-to-sequence frameworks. They often combine related tasks to create a general framework for MTL, aiming to cover a wide range of tasks with a single output representation. In contrast to general frameworks for multi-task learning in NLP, our methodology formulates output of different tasks in a unified format. This approach is orthogonal to contextualized token embeddings like ELMo and BERT. Our SpanRel model can benefit from stronger contextualized representation models, providing a testbed for their use in natural language analysis. Large-scale benchmarks like SentEval and GLUE are essential for evaluating NLP models. GLAD benchmark focuses on token/phrase-level analysis tasks with diverse coverage of linguistic structures. Tasks can be easily evaluated in the same format, reflecting various aspects of natural language analysis capability. New tasks can be added in BRAT standoff format, commonly used in NLP community. The SpanRel model offers a unified framework for natural language analysis tasks, extracting spans and predicting relations between them. It achieves competitive performance across 10 tasks and merges 8 datasets into the GLAD benchmark. The model's performance with different token representations is shown in Table 7. However, BERT large requires too much memory for coreference resolution, as indicated in Table 8. The model's hyperparameters vary based on the task, with larger span lengths for tasks with longer spans and larger pruning ratios for tasks with more spans. Relation extraction keeps a fixed pruning ratio regardless of sentence length. Span-oriented tasks do not require pruning ratio."
