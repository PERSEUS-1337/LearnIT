    "content": "Congress provides appropriations to DOD for RDT&E activities based on a taxonomy outlined in DOD's Financial Management Regulation. This taxonomy includes seven budget activity codes (6.1 through 6.7) for basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development. Basic research (Budget Activity Code 6.1) is defined as a systematic study for greater knowledge of fundamental aspects of phenomena. Basic research is the systematic study for greater knowledge of fundamental aspects of phenomena in various scientific fields related to national security needs. It serves as the foundation for technological progress and can lead to advancements in defense-related technologies and military capabilities. [Budget Activity Code 6.2] involves systematic research to develop materials, devices, systems, or methods to meet specific needs. It focuses on designing, developing, and improving prototypes and processes to address military requirements. Applied research translates basic research into solutions for military needs, ranging from mission-directed research to feasibility studies and planning efforts. The key characteristic is that it is directed towards general military applications. Applied research in military efforts focuses on developing and evaluating proposed solutions for general military needs. It precedes system-specific technology investigations and includes the development of subsystems and components for system prototypes. This type of research aims to demonstrate technological feasibility and assess subsystem and component operability. Defense S&T projects focus on component operability and producibility for identified military needs, aiming to transition technology into the acquisition process within the Future Years Defense Program. This research is crucial for maintaining military competitive advantage and is of interest to Congress, private sector, and academia stakeholders. Defense S&T funding is crucial for innovation in the DOD, providing scientific and technological insights for future defense technology development. It supports both evolutionary and revolutionary technologies to maintain U.S. technological dominance and national security. This funding is essential for improving existing products and systems, as well as deterring conflict and defeating adversaries. Budget activities 6.4, 6.5, and 6.7 in DOD RDT&E focus on advanced component development, system development, and operational systems development respectively, with the goal of transitioning technology from the laboratory to operational use and meeting validated requirements for full-rate production. The Defense S&T program has received approval for full rate production and anticipates production funding in the current or subsequent fiscal year. Budget activity 6.6, RDT&E Management Support, includes management support for RDT&E efforts and funds to sustain and modernize installations required for general research. Defense S&T funding has averaged 17.1% of total Defense RDT&E from FY2007 to FY2017. US preeminence in science and technology is crucial for national security according to the National Academies' 2007 report Rising Above the Gathering Storm. The importance of DOD basic research is crucial for national security, with key products including night vision, stealth technology, satellites, and precision munitions. DOD investments in basic research are vital for maintaining university research and educating scientists and engineers. Steady funding is essential to ensure stability and prevent uncertainty that may drive out top talent. Former Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall expressed concern that cuts to Defense S&T in times of budget constraints could have serious long-term consequences on national security by depriving the U.S. defense sector of critical technological advancements necessary for maintaining global dominance. Former Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall emphasized the importance of maintaining investments in research and development (R&D) for modernization. He highlighted that cutting R&D hinders the ability to modernize, regardless of force size. Alan R. Shaffer, Principal Deputy, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Defense Research and Engineering, echoed this sentiment, stating that without R&D, the number of new systems developed would be zero, leading to lasting damage. Cutting R&D funding could result in lasting damage to the U.S. R&D infrastructure, leading to a transfer of knowledge and loss of capabilities to other nations. Without adequate support, research communities may struggle to expand knowledge and collaborate, potentially drifting to other countries. This could hinder U.S. innovative capacity and leadership in defense-critical fields. Increased competition for available funds in the appropriations process, due to budget control provisions, has led to greater competition within the defense budget. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 may ease resource competition in FY2018 and FY2019, but not eliminate it. This has resulted in competition within the defense budget, such as between RDT&E and procurement. Some question the effectiveness of defense investments in R&D, especially in light of challenges faced by U.S. troops in combat zones. The article questions the effectiveness of defense investments in R&D, highlighting the success of low-tech solutions for protecting U.S. troops against improvised explosive devices in Iraq and Afghanistan. It criticizes high-priced weapons systems for failing to deliver on promised capabilities due to scientific and engineering shortcomings, suggesting a shift towards utilizing off-the-shelf technologies for defense needs. Defense S&T is seen as a more viable option compared to other RDT&E activities criticized as wasteful spending by the Pentagon.

Congress makes decisions on funding for DOD RDT&E, Defense S&T, and basic research, impacting national security and economic strength. Appropriations decisions are made based on available funding and budget formulation. During DOD budget formulation and congressional appropriations, funding for Defense S&T and basic research is a key concern for lawmakers and policy analysts. Various approaches to determining appropriate funding levels are discussed, with a focus on the importance of scientific and technological insights for future defense technology development. Defense S&T funding has been a focus for Congress, with proposals suggesting setting it at 3.4% of total DOD funding, amounting to about $8.4 billion. Other recommendations include allocating 3% of total DOD funding for S&T programs. The Council on Competitiveness and Congress have called for increased funding for Defense S&T programs, with recommendations ranging from 2% to 3.4% of DOD spending. Congress has expressed concerns about the Secretary of Defense failing to comply with funding objectives, particularly for the Air Force Science and Technology Program. The Council on Competitiveness and Congress have recommended increased funding for Defense S&T programs, with Congress expressing concerns about the Secretary of Defense failing to meet funding objectives, especially for the Air Force Science and Technology Program. In response, Congress passed P.L. 105-261, urging a 2% increase in Defense S&T funding each year from FY2001 to FY2009. In 2002, Congress supported the DSB's recommendation for a 3% budget allocation for defense science and technology programs. The Council on Competitiveness and Congress have recommended increased funding for Defense S&T programs, with Congress expressing concerns about the Secretary of Defense failing to meet funding objectives. High technology industries invest about 3.5 percent of sales in research, equivalent to the DOD S&T program, and there is a recommendation to increase S&T funding to ensure U.S. military forces' technical superiority in the 21st Century. In 2009, the Senate-passed version of the National Defense Authorization Act included a provision stating the Secretary of Defense should increase Defense S&T by a percentage at least equal to inflation. Defense S&T funding reached $13.3 billion in FY2006, declined to $11.0 billion in FY2013, and peaked at $14.0 billion in FY2017. Defense S&T funding reached $13.3 billion in FY2006, declined to $11.0 billion in FY2013, and peaked at $14.0 billion in FY2017. Growth in S&T funding sought in P.L. 105-261 was largely achieved, with S&T as a share of DOD TOA declining from 3.0% in the late 1990s to 1.7% in 2011, then rebounding to 2.3% in FY2017. The DSB proposed using Defense S&T as a share of DOD RDT&E, noting that high-tech industries invest about 24% in research, well above actual S&T funding levels. The Coalition for National Security Research advocated for Defense S&T funding to be 20% of DOD RDT&E. Defense S&T's share of DOD RDT&E fluctuated between 15.2% and 21.5% from FY1996 to FY2017. Basic research within the Defense S&T program is highlighted for its role in advancing breakthrough technologies and supporting university-based research in certain disciplines. In 2004, the Council on Competitiveness and the Coalition for National Security Research recommended that DOD basic research should account for at least 20% of Defense S&T funding. DOD basic research funding steadily increased from FY1998 to FY2017, more than doubling in current dollars. Basic research's share of Defense S&T declined from 14.6% in FY1996 to 11.0% in FY2006, then rose to 18.4% in FY2015, its highest level in two decades. However, it fell to 16.2% in 2017. Defense S&T investments are complex and can be analyzed in various ways. Factors affecting performance include organizational structures, management, workforce, and funding stability.
