The \"Air Line Pension Act of 2003\" amends funding rules for defined benefit plans of commercial passenger air carriers with a funded percentage below 80% as of January 1, 2003. The \"Air Line Pension Act of 2003\" amends funding rules for defined benefit plans of commercial passenger air carriers with a funded percentage below 80% as of January 1, 2003. The act specifies the interest rate for determining current liability and allows for estimation of current liability if the valuation date is different. Additionally, a moratorium on deficit reduction contributions is established for plans with a funded current liability percentage of at least 90% for plan years after December 27. The \"Air Line Pension Act of 2003\" amends funding rules for defined benefit plans of commercial passenger air carriers with a funded percentage below 80% as of January 1, 2003. If the funded current liability percentage of the plan is 90% or greater during certain plan years, the moratorium on deficit reduction contributions will cease to apply. Amortization periods for net experience gains and losses will be extended over a period of 15 plan years. The \"Air Line Pension Act of 2003\" allows for combining and offsetting amortization bases for defined benefit plans over 15 plan years. Additionally, sponsors may elect to amortize 2008 unfunded current liability in a one-time, irrevocable manner as prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The \"Air Line Pension Act of 2003\" allows sponsors to elect to amortize the unfunded current liability for the first plan year after December 27, 2007, on an interest-only basis for the first 5 plan years and then in equal annual installments over a period of 15 plan years. The \"Air Line Pension Act of 2003\" allows sponsors to elect to amortize the unfunded current liability for the first plan year after December 27, 2007, using the actuarial value of assets. If the plan sponsor makes this election, the plan's unfunded old liability will be deemed equal to the unfunded current liability calculated for the first plan year after December 27, 2007. The \"Air Line Pension Act of 2003\" allows sponsors to elect to amortize the unfunded current liability for the first plan year after December 27, 2007. If the funded current liability percentage of the plan is 90 percent or greater for any plan year after December 27, 2002, this subsection will no longer apply. For plans described in subsection (a)(1), the amount referred to in clause (ii) of section 412(l)(8)(A) of the Code and section 302(d)(8)(A) of the Act will be deemed as the sum of certain amounts. The \"Air Line Pension Act of 2003\" allows sponsors to amortize the unfunded current liability. The amount under section 302(d)(8)(A) is the sum of plan assets and unamortized waived funding deficiency. SEC. 3. RESTORATION OF CERTAIN PLANS TERMINATING IN 2003. SEC. 3. RESTORATION OF CERTAIN PLANS TERMINATING IN 2003. In General, the provisions of subsection (b) apply to defined benefit plans maintained by a commercial passenger air carrier for its employees under a collective bargaining agreement that terminated in 2003. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation must restore these plans to their pre-termination status by December 31, 2003, unless the collective bargaining agreement states otherwise. The restoration of certain plans terminating in 2003 for defined benefit plans maintained by a commercial passenger air carrier under a collective bargaining agreement involves excluding expected increases in current liability and amortizing unfunded amounts under a restoration payment schedule. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation must restore these plans to their pre-termination status by December 31, 2003. The initial restoration amortization base for a plan described in subsection (a) is determined by subtracting the accrued benefit liabilities from the market value of plan assets returned by the Corporation. This base is then amortized in level annual installments over a 30-year period after the initial post-restoration valuation date. The funding standard account of the plan will be charged accordingly. The plan sponsor can choose to apply subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 2 for special funding rules. The 30-year amortization will use the valuation interest rate for accrued liability determination. The actuarial value of assets will be reset to market value with a 5-year phase-in period. The market value of assets will be reset with a 5-year phase-in period, and for plans using the FIL funding method, the initial unfunded liability for normal cost determination will be reset to the initial restoration amortization base. Quarterly contributions requirements do not apply until the initial post-restoration valuation date for a plan restored under subsection (b). In the case of a plan restored under subsection (b), any funding deficiency or credit balance in the funding standard account shall be reset to zero as of the initial post-restoration valuation date. PBGC liability is limited for certain plans described in specific sections of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Participants in these plans will receive no credit for benefit accrual purposes for service after a certain date. The provisions of this Act apply to plan years starting after December 27, 2002."
