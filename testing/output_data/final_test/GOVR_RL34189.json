    "content": "The increased international attention on North Korean refugees in China has prompted Congress to address the refugee situation and its causes. Food shortages, persecution, and human rights abuses drive North Koreans to seek refuge in China, where they face further mistreatment. Both the House and Senate have taken action, including passing the North Korean Human Rights Act in 2004. The 108th Congress passed the North Korean Human Rights Act, providing new funds for human rights efforts, information flow improvement, and appointing a Special Envoy on human rights in North Korea. North Korea is seen as a threat due to nuclear weapons, missile programs, and possession of chemical and biological weapons. The country is also on the U.S. list of states sponsoring terrorism. Amid tensions over North Korea's nuclear program, concerns persist about worsening humanitarian conditions and an increase in North Koreans fleeing the country. Questions arise about what more can be done by the US and the international community to address the abuses of the DPRK regime and alleviate the suffering of North Koreans. China's restrictions on access to North Koreans crossing its border raise concerns about international law and protection. China's obligations under international refugee law, including the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the principle of \"non-refoulement,\" are important considerations in the context of North Koreans fleeing the country. China and South Korea adhere to the principle of \"non-refoulement\" from the Refugee Convention, while North Korea is not a party to it. The UNHCR is dedicated to protecting refugees and coordinating international efforts for their safety. Refugees have special rights under international law. The UNHCR ensures rights and provides resources for refugees under the Refugee Convention. Challenges arise when national laws do not fully implement the Convention's provisions, and conflicts with bilateral agreements may occur. International law takes precedence over such agreements according to UNHCR, but governments may not always agree. UNHCR works to ensure refugee rights under the Refugee Convention, even when national laws conflict with international law. The organization may assist in finding solutions for asylum seekers facing deportation, collaborating with governments to uphold principles of the Convention. Estimates of the North Korean population in China vary widely, with figures ranging from 10,000 to 300,000. The State Department estimated the number to be between 30,000 and 50,000 in 2006. The estimated number of North Korean refugees in China ranges from 30,000 to 50,000, with some moving back and forth across the border. It is difficult to assess the full scope of the refugee problem due to the refugees' need to avoid detection and lack of access by international organizations. The number of people crossing the border does not seem to have overwhelmed the resources of the Chinese economy. The movement of North Korean refugees into China has been gradual and has not overwhelmed the Chinese economy. Recent reports suggest that nearly 75 percent of the refugees are women, a significant increase from previous years. Reasons for this trend include poverty, failed marriages, and potential family reunification. Men may be less mobile due to ties to their enterprises. Most refugees enter China from North Korea's northeastern provinces. Most North Korean refugees enter China from the northeastern provinces in search of food and employment. The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture is a popular destination, home to many ethnic Koreans who assist their North Korean kin for various reasons. Concerns are raised about exploitation at the border by organized gangs and intermediaries targeting refugees, leading to issues of human smuggling, trafficking, and exploitation, particularly affecting women. North Korean refugees in China face trafficking, extortion, and exploitation, with women being particularly vulnerable to prostitution, rape, and forced marriages. The State Department rates North Korea as a Tier 3 country in human trafficking due to lack of implementation of international standards. Many North Koreans in China end up as trafficking victims, living in danger of being discovered by authorities or turned in as undocumented immigrants for a reward. North Korean refugees in China face trafficking, extortion, and exploitation, with women being particularly vulnerable. NGOs report extreme poverty in northern China, similar to North Korea. Refugees live in dire conditions, working low-paying jobs. Push and pull factors drive people to leave their country, with deteriorating conditions being a key reason for North Koreans crossing into China. The deteriorating humanitarian conditions and human rights violations in North Korea, particularly food shortages and extreme poverty, are key factors driving North Koreans across the border into China. The food shortage, exacerbated by the collapse of the Soviet Union and severe famine in the 1990s, has had a significant impact on movement across the border. Food distribution in North Korea favors the ruling elite and military, contributing to the ongoing crisis. The food shortage in North Korea, exacerbated by the collapse of the Soviet Union and severe famine in the 1990s, has led to deteriorating humanitarian conditions and human rights violations. The ruling elite and military benefit from food distribution, worsening the crisis. International aid, primarily from the United States, China, and South Korea, has been crucial in addressing the food insecurity in North Korea. The WFP estimated that nearly half of North Korea's population lacked adequate food, with over a third being chronically malnourished. Food security remains a daily struggle for a significant portion of the population. In 2007, the government acknowledged a food shortfall and potential increase in food assistance. Flooding in 2006 and 2007 worsened the situation, with emergency relief efforts ongoing. UNOCHA reported that 1 million people were affected by flooding in nine provinces. According to UNOCHA, 1 million people were affected by flooding in North Korea, resulting in 454 deaths, 156 missing individuals, and 170,000 displaced. Reports highlight severe human rights abuses by the North Korean regime, with no signs of improvement in the near future. The regime restricts political, civil, and religious freedoms, controls media, and prohibits dissent or criticism of Kim Jong-il. The North Korean regime severely abuses its citizens, with reports of concentration camps housing political prisoners in harsh conditions. The State Department's 2006 report also mentions violations of human rights, including refugees facing mistreatment when crossing into China. The North Korean regime continues to inflict severe punishments on repatriated North Koreans for various reasons, including seeking asylum in third countries. Recent reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch confirm the State Department's description of human rights conditions in North Korea. Human Rights Watch notes a harshening of policy towards refugees going to China for economic reasons, with longer sentences in abusive prisons for those caught crossing the border. The United Nations confirms ongoing violations of basic freedoms in North Korea, despite some legislative improvements. The human rights situation remains grave, with violations persisting in various areas. North Korea has not cooperated with the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the DPRK. North Korea has not cooperated with the Special Rapporteur despite repeated requests. China focused on its unwillingness to view illegal migrants as refugees. North Korea considers border-crossers into China as criminals, with the refugee situation posing little threat to the regime. Most politically important individuals have either left or been caught, making new border-crossers politically insignificant to North Korea's leadership. China's provinces provide a way for North Korea to export its economic problems through migration. North Korea tightly controls travel within and outside the country, with strict punishments for violators. Only officials and trusted individuals are allowed exit visas. Defection is considered a capital crime, with severe penalties including death. North Korea imposes harsh penalties, including death, for defectors. Minor offenders face up to six months in labor training centers with harsh conditions. Enforcement is inconsistent due to bribery and corruption. Repatriated North Koreans endure brutal treatment, including detention, torture, and forced labor. Pregnant women carrying Chinese men's children are subjected to forced abortions. Authorities are particularly harsh towards those suspected of contact with South Koreans or foreigners. UNHCR has received reports that some people deported by China back to North Korea receive little punishment while others endure hard labor or beatings. Risk factors and the arbitrariness of the system in North Korea make it difficult to assess who is at risk before deportation. Families classified by loyalty to the regime are more at risk, especially if China passes along information indicating contact with embassies or foreigners. Despite being a party to the Refugee Convention, China has not allowed U.N. agencies, particularly UNHCR, to intervene. China has not allowed U.N. agencies, like UNHCR, access to North Koreans in China, viewing them as economic migrants rather than political refugees. UNHCR believes some may qualify as refugees, but China restricts access to the border and aid agencies due to suspicions about intentions. UNHCR faces challenges in providing assistance to North Korean refugees in China due to restrictions on access and suspicions about intentions. Despite efforts to work with Chinese officials behind the scenes, China typically does not allow North Koreans to apply for political asylum and is obligated to repatriate border crossers under a 1986 agreement with North Korea. However, Chinese officials have largely ignored this agreement, tolerating the presence of refugees and foreign NGOs. UNHCR recommends delaying deportations until refugee status is determined, as even those seeking food may qualify. Experts argue that deported North Koreans essentially become refugees due to known risks. China's deportations may violate international law by not adhering to non-refoulement principles. These issues were raised in high-level talks in March 2006. In March 2006, high-level talks between the UNHCR and the Chinese Foreign Ministry addressed the challenges of creating a refugee program in China. China is concerned about destabilizing the Korean peninsula, avoiding a \"pull\" factor for individuals crossing into China, and the impact of a potential collapse of the North Korean regime. The Chinese government, as a formal ally of North Korea, wants to prevent a situation that could lead to mass migration across its border and strain its economic development and relations with North Korea. China's influence over North Korea could be strained by allowing international groups access to the region, potentially setting an unwanted precedent for future refugee scenarios involving other ethnic groups in China. China wants to maintain distance from U.S. troops in South Korea with North Korea acting as a buffer. China favors a peaceful resolution to border issues through dialogue and negotiation with North Korea, as it holds significant leverage over the country as its most important diplomatic and economic backer. China's influence over North Korea is significant as it is the country's main diplomatic and economic supporter. China provides food aid and is the largest trade partner for North Korea. However, China's leverage is limited as the threat of withdrawing aid may lead to instability in North Korea. NGOs from various countries have developed networks to assist North Korean refugees, with some escaping to countries like Cambodia, Mongolia, and Thailand. These NGOs operate discreetly to avoid detection by Chinese authorities. Beginning in 2001, Chinese authorities started cracking down on North Korean refugees and those who helped them, leading to high-profile asylum bids in foreign diplomatic compounds and schools. China allowed most North Koreans to travel to a third country and then transit to Seoul. Reports indicated that Korean-Chinese individuals were being arrested for assisting North Koreans. China increased crackdown on North Korean refugees and those who helped them, leading to high-profile asylum bids in foreign diplomatic compounds. The harsh response aimed to discourage similar acts and raised international pressure for China to recognize North Koreans as political refugees. South Korea remains the primary destination for North Korean refugees. South Korea is the main destination for North Korean refugees, offering citizenship, resettlement programs, cash, and training. Over 10,000 defectors have arrived since the Korean War, with numbers increasing due to the North Korea famine. In 2006, 1,578 refugees arrived, with reports of integration challenges. South Korea is a party to the Refugee Convention, with UNHCR providing assistance in Seoul. Some observers believe Seoul adjusted its stance on North Koreans to appease Pyongyang, with changes in policy aimed at discouraging defections and illegal entry. This included reducing financial aid to refugees, strengthening screening processes, and defending the measures as necessary to combat exploitation by brokers. Critics argue the changes are meant to deter defections, while officials claim they are necessary for security reasons. Only a small percentage of North Koreans in China seek asylum in third countries due to uncooperative governments. Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and Burma are reluctant to assist defectors to avoid upsetting Pyongyang. Vietnam allowed 480 North Korean defectors to fly to South Korea in 2004, reducing the underground network in Vietnam as an escape route. Cambodia is also involved in assisting North Korean asylum-seekers. Thailand's role in the underground railroad for North Korean asylum-seekers has attracted an increasing number of refugees. In 2006, 1,000 North Koreans were detained in Bangkok, with 500 sent to Seoul. The Thai government has traditionally cooperated with sending North Koreans to South Korea for resettlement, but by 2006, the system was strained, leading to intensified measures to prevent illegal entry. The Foreign Ministry complained in December 2006 about NGOs assisting North Koreans. The Ministry complained in December 2006 about NGOs aiding North Koreans to reach Thailand, hindering efforts to prevent illegal entry of defectors. Some North Koreans in Thailand may be seeking resettlement in the United States. Mongolia is a preferred escape route for some North Korean refugees due to its humane practices and policy of not repatriating them. Advocates considered establishing a refugee camp in Mongolia, but experts concluded it would not be suitable as North Koreans transit through Mongolia quickly. Mongolia maintains strong official relations with both South Korea and North Korea. Both South Korea and North Korea have strong relations with Mongolia, which maintains a guest worker program with Pyongyang. Mongolia, although not a party to the Refugee Convention, has been cooperative in dealing with North Koreans. The Clinton Administration separated security issues from human rights concerns with North Korea, while the Bush Administration had shifting policies towards North Korea, including aggressive negotiations on dismantling its nuclear weapons program. The Bush Administration focused on North Korean human rights violations and criticized the regime in Pyongyang, especially during stalled nuclear weapons negotiations. Human rights issues were not a priority in high-level meetings, with the Administration prioritizing negotiations on the nuclear issue first. The Six-Party Agreement of February 13, 2007, calls for bilateral talks between the United States and North Korea to resolve issues and move towards full diplomatic relations. The Bush Administration previously linked normalization of relations with progress on human rights and other issues, but Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill now ties it solely to a satisfactory nuclear settlement. The 108th Congress passed the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004, authorizing funds for assistance to North Korean refugees, promoting human rights and democracy, and facilitating U.S. refugee status for North Koreans. Congressional attention to North Korean human rights and refugee issues has been consistent and critical. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 authorizes funds for assistance to North Korean refugees, promotes human rights in North Korea, and requires the appointment of a Special Envoy. It emphasizes the importance of human rights in negotiations with North Korea, conditions humanitarian aid on improved monitoring, supports radio broadcasting into North Korea, and calls for China to provide UNHCR access to North Koreans. This legislation sends a strong message that human rights will be central to U.S. policy towards North Korea. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 authorizes funds for assistance to North Korean refugees and promotes human rights in North Korea. Advocates argue that the legislation will enhance stability in Northeast Asia by addressing the issue of North Korean refugees. Critics fear it may strain relations with South Korea and China, hindering diplomatic efforts to denuclearize North Korea. They also worry that the legislation could worsen the plight of North Korean refugees by drawing more attention to them and leading to crackdowns by authorities. Critics have raised concerns about the slow and inadequate implementation of the North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA). They point out that China has not changed its practices despite pressure from the United States to treat North Korean refugees more humanely. Lawmakers have expressed frustration over the lack of progress in resettling refugees and appointing a Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea. Some critics have complained about the slow implementation of the North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA). Lawmakers questioned the Special Envoy's dedication to the issue and raised concerns about U.S. embassy officials in China turning away North Koreans seeking asylum. There are worries that the refugee provisions of the NKHRA could send the wrong message to North Koreans. The State Department officials caution against encouraging incursions into U.S. diplomatic missions overseas by North Korean refugees due to security risks and complex asylum vetting processes. Coordination with South Korea is crucial for effective implementation of the NKHRA, despite no explicit funding request for the program. The State Department provides funding for UNHCR's regional budget for East Asia, including assistance for North Korean refugees. The Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Bureau gives grants for democracy promotion in North Korea, including human rights and media freedom programs. The Broadcasting Board of Governors requested funds for increased radio broadcasting into North Korea. The NKHRA authorizes increased radio broadcasting into North Korea, with funding labeled under general assistance programs due to the need for discretion in reaching refugees hiding from authorities. NGOs assisting refugees may struggle to effectively absorb large amounts of funding due to their small, grassroots nature. The NKHRA authorizes increased radio broadcasting into North Korea with funding for general assistance programs to reach refugees. The Broadcasting Board of Governors requested $2.9 million to establish a 10-hour daily stream of Voice of America and Radio Free Asia programming. Content includes news briefs, interviews with defectors, and international commentary on events in North Korea. The BBG cites an InterMedia survey showing North Koreans have access to radios altered to receive international broadcasts. $2 million was allocated in FY2005 to Freedom House for conferences raising awareness of human rights in North Korea. The second forum in Seoul in December 2005 caused tension between U.S. officials and the South Korean government. Special Envoy Lefkowitz urged the Roh Administration to speak out against North Korea's human rights abuses and tie humanitarian aid to improvements in Pyongyang's human rights record. A third conference in Brussels in March 2006 was attended by Lefkowitz, Japanese Special Envoy Saigo, and North Korean representatives. The Brussels conference in March 2006, attended by the Japanese Special Envoy for Human Rights Issues Humiko Saigo and North Korean defectors, coincided with a hearing in the European Union parliamentary session condemning human rights conditions in North Korea. The NKHRA aims to resettle North Korean refugees in the United States, with Section 302 stating that North Koreans are eligible for refugee status or asylum in the US regardless of their citizenship rights in South Korea. The NKHRA aims to resettle North Korean refugees in the United States, with a focus on urging China to allow access to North Koreans for refugee protection. Section 303 directs the Secretary of State to facilitate refugee applications under the Immigration and Nationality Act, despite challenges highlighted in a report to Congress. The report highlighted the importance of cooperation from governments hosting North Korean refugees for U.S. refugee admissions processing. It suggested the possibility of admitting some North Korean refugees to the United States from South Korea after vetting. Security checks were identified as a significant obstacle to North Korean refugee resettlement in the U.S., citing genuine security concerns. The Department of Homeland Security was acknowledged for assessing North Koreans on a case-by-case basis. The report highlighted challenges to North Korean refugee resettlement in the United States and efforts to address them. In written testimony, Arthur E. Dewey described actions being taken to obtain access to North Koreans in China, emphasizing the State Department's funding of UNHCR's efforts. Assistant Secretary Dewey emphasized the limits on direct U.S. assistance to North Koreans due to security concerns and the lack of access to necessary information for background checks. He stressed the need for a reliable mechanism for security screenings and consultations with regional governments. Special Envoy Lefkowitz reported progress in gaining access to North Korean refugees and conducting security screenings in April 2006. In 2006, the US began admitting North Korean refugees from Southeast Asia. By 2007, 37 refugees had been admitted with no set limit on acceptance. The Six-Party Talks focused on nuclear weapons, and the Bush Administration linked diplomatic relations with Pyongyang's re-entry. In 2007, the Bush Administration focused on nuclear disarmament negotiations with North Korea, linking diplomatic relations to this issue rather than human rights. The NKHRA urged policymakers to include human rights as a key element in talks and pursue a dialogue modeled on the Helsinki process. The State Department's diplomatic talks with North Korea are influenced by the requirements for admitting refugees and funding for human rights NGOs. Some observers question the effectiveness of a Helsinki process-based linkage policy, citing the lack of necessary factors in North Korea for such an approach to succeed. Outside NGOs struggle to find local partners for political movements in the closed state. Critics of the NKHRA argue that a push for regime change in Pyongyang drove the legislation, which was supported by a network of NGOs focused on North Korean issues. The predecessor, the North Korean Freedom Act, was more critical of South Korea and China, limited the President's negotiation flexibility, and linked security and human rights issues, aligning itself with regime change. Some critics point to Lefkowitz's statements characterizing Pyongyang as a repressive government. The Bush Administration criticized North Korea for repression and illegal activities, leading to strained relations with South Korea. Despite initial skepticism, bilateral talks were initiated in 2007, resolving financial restrictions linked to North Korean counterfeiting operations. The House International Relations Committee report on the North Korean Human Rights Act disavowed any interest in bringing down the Pyongyang government, emphasizing a humanitarian focus. Former officials reiterated that the Act's motivations were solely humanitarian, not aimed at regime change. Despite public statements, observers remain skeptical about the true intentions behind the Act. Many observers believe that securing cooperation from China and South Korea on North Korean human rights and refugee issues is challenging due to distrust of some U.S. government officials' goals. South Korean Unification Minister Lee Jong-seok opposes applying a Northeast Asian version of the Helsinki Process to North Korea, citing concerns about regime change. The passage of the NKHRA strained the U.S.-South Korea bilateral relationship under the Bush and Roh Myoo-hyun Administrations. The NKHRA strained the U.S.-South Korea relationship under the Bush and Roh Myoo-hyun Administrations, highlighting differences in approaches to North Korea. However, the Bush Administration's policy shift in 2007 aligned more with South Korea's conciliation strategy. The election of Lee Myung-bak as president in December 2007 further improved ties between Seoul and Washington, with a focus on constructive criticism towards North Korea for societal improvement. South Korea aims for economic integration and warmer relations with North Korea. South Korea has refrained from criticizing North Korea's human rights record and downplayed accepting North Korean refugees. In 2006, South Korea voted in favor of a U.N. resolution criticizing North Korea for human rights abuses, but abstained in 2007 citing North-South Korean relations. This tension on human rights issues may threaten relations with Washington. The tension between Washington and Seoul on human rights issues may affect bilateral cooperation on refugee problems. South Korea's reluctance to antagonize Pyongyang could hinder information sharing for vetting North Korean refugees. South Korean law granting automatic citizenship to defectors complicates U.S. efforts to accept North Korean refugees. Minister Ban Ki-Moon criticized the ruling, State Department sources clarified that the case did not reflect U.S. refugee policy due to the defector's established citizenship. Seoul officials reject claims of discrimination against North Korean defectors in South Korea. The NKRHA highlights the challenges faced by refugees in China and Beijing's repatriation policy. Congressional hearings criticized Beijing's treatment of North Korean refugees, with suggestions of boycotting the 2008 Olympics in protest. The suggestion to boycott the 2008 Olympics in protest against Beijing's treatment of North Korean refugees has raised concerns. The Bush Administration's criticism of Chinese human rights abuses has been limited due to the need for Beijing's cooperation in various international matters. The White House highlighted the case of Kim Chun Hee, a North Korean seeking asylum in China, urging China to honor its obligations under the Refugee Convention. President Bush raised the issue of human rights violations with Chinese President Hu Jintao in 2006, but received no response. Japan imposed sanctions on North Korea after their missile and nuclear tests in 2006, with former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe taking a hardline stance on the issue. Japan is urging the United States to keep North Korea on the terrorism list until the abduction issue is resolved. The North Korea-Japan normalization working group focuses on resolving the abduction issue and historical grievances. The United States is considering removing North Korea from the state sponsors of terrorism list. The Japanese Act passed in 2006 calls for greater awareness of North Korean human rights violations, particularly the abductions of Japanese citizens. It also emphasizes international coordination to prevent further abuses by North Korea, including potential economic sanctions if violations persist. The issue of North Korean refugees is mentioned, but specific measures to assist them are not outlined. The NKHRA in Congress includes a provision linking non-humanitarian aid to North Korean progress in addressing the Japanese abductee issue. The House hearing in April 2006 focused on North Korea's abductions of foreign citizens, with testimony from former abductees and their relatives, including Sakie Yokota, the mother of Megumi Yokota. President Bush met with Yokota and other relatives, emphasizing the link between U.S. policy and Japan's priority in its relations with North Korea. Some Members of Congress support Japan's call for resolution of the abductions before North Korea is removed from the U.S. state sponsors of terrorism list. Some commentators suggest using North Korean refugee flows to weaken the regime in Pyongyang, with the United States potentially advocating for fleeing North Koreans to pressure Beijing for assistance in relocation. This could lead to a collapse of the regime. Some argue that a large outflow of North Korean refugees could lead to a collapse of the regime, while others believe it would result in a bloody crackdown by Chinese and North Korean authorities. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is examining the legal aspects of North Koreans in China qualifying for refugee status. South Korea recognizes its obligation to protect refugees once they are on its territory. The UNHCR is considering the legal aspects of North Koreans in China qualifying for refugee status. South Korea acknowledges its duty to protect refugees on its territory, but cannot protect North Korean refugees in China. China faces political challenges in acknowledging refugee status for North Koreans, and granting humanitarian status may be a more politically acceptable solution to protect them. The UNHCR proposed a humanitarian enclave with other agencies to provide refugees access to services in China. China is considering a \"good neighbor approach\" without addressing human rights or deportation. Progress on this option is limited, with concerns about the emphasis on the \"pull factor\" and border control by both China and North Korea. China and North Korea have shown border control abilities. UNHCR is engaging in dialogue with China to avoid confrontation. The proposal for humanitarian status for North Koreans in China is seen as less provocative than refugee status. UNHCR aims to minimize visibility for progress. Some advocate for a program to accept more North Korean refugees. Granting U.S. asylum to North Koreans could help share the burden with South Korea. Some Korean-American groups are willing to facilitate increased resettlement in the United States to share the burden of accepting North Korean refugees with South Korea. Administration officials cite reluctance from China and Southeast Asian countries to transfer refugees to the U.S. due to complicated vetting procedures. Refugee experts express concerns about North Koreans adjusting to American lifestyle, especially with weak language skills. The U.N. Charter emphasizes promoting human rights but also upholds non-intervention in domestic affairs. Article 2(7) states the UN cannot interfere in a state's internal matters. This provision is often used by states accused of human rights violations to deflect criticism. Critics argue it hinders human rights implementation. Advocates argue for state responsibility in protecting human rights and international community intervention when rights are violated. Tension exists between state sovereignty and obligations to protect rights. Some believe the DPRK government threatens its people and warrants action by the international community and U.N. Security Council. The 2005 U.N. World Summit introduced the \"Responsibility to Protect,\" emphasizing each state's duty to prevent genocide, war crimes, and human rights violations. Lee Feinstein notes that this concept shifts focus towards individual rights over state sovereignty. The U.N. Resolution acknowledges the obligation of states to protect their citizens and the international community's role when states fail to do so. The \"Responsibility to Protect\" emphasizes each state's duty to prevent genocide, war crimes, and human rights violations. China and North Korea, as U.N. members, are bound by international treaties to change their human rights practices, but implementing these principles remains a challenge, as seen with North Korean refugees. China's ratification of the Refugee Convention and Protocol and the U.N. Convention Against Torture prohibits repatriating refugees at risk of human rights abuses. China and North Korea are bound by international treaties to prevent human rights violations. China has ratified various conventions, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, while North Korea is party to treaties like the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Both countries face challenges in implementing these principles, particularly concerning the repatriation of refugees at risk of abuse. The NKHRA advocates for the U.S. to raise human rights issues to the international community, led by Special Envoy Jay Lefkowitz. This \"name and shame\" strategy aims to pressure North Korea to improve its human rights practices, potentially by singling out China and South Korea for their lack of condemnation. The \"name and shame\" strategy of the NKHRA aims to pressure China and South Korea to address human rights violations. Security analysts warn that this approach could disrupt nuclear weapons talks with North Korea, but others believe it could lead to dialogue if Kim Jong-il is willing. European countries have successfully used diplomatic recognition and incentives to engage North Korea on human rights issues. The European Union has become a significant trade partner with North Korea, offering food aid and assistance. \"Human rights dialogues\" have been held between Pyongyang officials and E.U. ambassadors. Supporters believe regular exchanges may build trust for progress on human rights, although North Korea's record has not visibly improved. Some argue that increased contact with North Korean leadership is crucial for improving human rights, advocating for early normalization of relations with the U.S. contingent on nuclear disarmament. Some advocates suggest that behind-the-scenes discussions with Pyongyang and Beijing could be more effective in improving human rights in North Korea. Direct bilateral contact between high-level North Korean and U.S. officials may provide opportunities to discreetly address human rights concerns, such as protecting individual North Korean refugees. Refugee advocates believe that Beijing may be receptive to taking small humanitarian steps if the exchange remains out of the public eye, such as quietly stopping deportations and arrests. High-level U.S. officials could address human rights concerns with Chinese counterparts in bilateral talks. Quiet pressure on regional countries to support North Korean refugees and streamline asylum cases with South Korea and UNHCR could help. The Bush Administration hopes for diplomatic normalization with DPRK after nuclear disarmament, including a peace treaty, security organization, and economic aid. Humanitarian and human rights issues are not currently a focus in these discussions. One option for Congress is to develop legislation that ties North Korea's progress on human rights to diplomatic relations and the lifting of U.S. economic sanctions, similar to the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. This act imposed sanctions on Burma, leading to the termination of most economic relations with the country, particularly affecting imports of Burmese textiles into the United States. The United States bans imports from Burma, mainly affecting Burmese textiles. The absence of an ambassador to Burma since 1992 is due to human rights abuses. Congress favors maintaining U.S. sanctions until major human rights abuses cease. The President has the authority to lift sanctions under existing legislation. The United States authorizes the resettlement of refugees under the Immigration and Nationality Act. A refugee is someone outside their country unable to return due to persecution based on various factors. The President sets the refugee admissions ceiling each fiscal year after consulting with Congress. For FY2008, the worldwide refugee ceiling is 80,000 with 70,000 allocated among regions and an unallocated reserve of 10,000 numbers. Refugees are processed and admitted to the United States from abroad through a system of three priorities for admission, reflecting the urgency of resettlement needs. Priority One (P-1) covers compelling protection cases and individuals with no durable solution. North Koreans are eligible for P-1 processing in the U.S. refugee program. They are not eligible for P-2 processing but can apply for P-3 processing for family reunification cases. All refugee applicants undergo security checks through the State Department's system. Individuals preliminarily determined to qualify for processing priority undergo in-person interviews with USCIS for refugee status eligibility and admissibility to the United States."
