The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin, connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, played a crucial role in the nation's history and westward expansion. Its rivers served as a major transportation corridor, linking communities from the Atlantic to the Great Lakes. The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin, including the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area, is densely populated with over 15,000,000 people. Effective communication and cooperation among various entities are essential for the area's water resources. The New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary is a complex natural harbor at the junction of three major water bodies. The New York Bight is a natural harbor receiving freshwater inputs from the Hudson, Passaic, and Raritan Rivers. The Hudson originates in the Adirondack Mountains and provides a natural break in the Appalachian Mountain chain. The Mohawk Valley has abundant natural resources. The Mohawk Valley's natural resources and fertile soils supported the Mohawk nation, European settlement, and industry. The Mohawk River drains into the Hudson River, contributing to its ecosystem. The river is connected to the Erie Canal, linking its health to the Canal system. Communities in the Basin have faced severe flooding. The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin has experienced devastating flooding, leading to high costs for businesses and governments. A holistic approach to river monitoring, updated floodplain maps, and improved floodplain management strategies can make communities safer and more resilient. Various organizations support subwatersheds in the Basin, but there is a lack of integrated planning. New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut have a history of collaborating on resource management issues. Development and implementation of projects to control flooding and improve water quality in the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin must involve local communities, respect private property rights, and align with state and local authorities. Collaboration on resource management issues among various states is facilitated through memberships in multiple commissions and programs. The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin includes the drainage areas of the Hudson, Mohawk, Passaic, and Raritan Rivers in New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. The Commission established under section 4 manages water resources within the basin. The President will establish the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Commission to coordinate activities addressing environmental, economic, and cultural issues in the watershed. The Commission will include a Federal representative designated by the President and the Governors of the 5 States in the basin. The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Commission, consisting of representatives from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont, will develop plans and policies for water resources management in the basin. Each Governor appoints an alternate to attend meetings and vote in their absence. The Commission will adopt an annual capital budget for proposed projects. The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Commission will develop plans and policies for water resources management, adopt an annual capital budget for projects, and coordinate the development and financing of projects. The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Commission will develop plans and policies for water resources management, adopt an annual capital budget for projects, and coordinate the development and financing of projects. SEC. 5. COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. The Commission will develop a comprehensive plan for water resources in the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin, consulting with relevant agencies and stakeholders, publishing a draft plan for public comment, and periodically reviewing and revising the plan. The plan will address all projects and facilities needed for the development, conservation, and management of water resources to meet current and future needs. The plan for the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin will identify water resource needs related to various aspects such as water supply, quality, flooding, ecosystems, and more. It will also inventory historic and cultural resources, assess the status of water resources, and establish goals for protection and enhancement. The plan for the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin aims to identify water resource needs, assess the status of water resources, and establish goals for protection and enhancement. It also seeks to promote communication and coordination among organizations engaged in water resource management activities in the basin. The Commission adopts an annual water resources program based on a comprehensive plan, outlining specific projects to be undertaken by various entities over a 5-year period. The program includes needs, projects, studies, facilities, and budgets for each sub-basin. SEC. 7. SAVINGS PROVISIONS.\n\nThis Act does not limit the authority of the Federal Government, State government members of the Commission, or local governments to enact legislation or regulate land use within their jurisdictions.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n$500,000 is authorized for the Commission annually, and $25,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary of Interior each year from 2014 to 2020 for projects consistent with the comprehensive plan adopted by the Commission."
