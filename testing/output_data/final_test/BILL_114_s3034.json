    "content": "The \"Protecting Internet Freedom Act\" is the short title of this Act. The findings section follows. The Department of Commerce and the NTIA are responsible for maintaining the stability of Internet technical management functions, including IANA, which involves coordinating Internet protocol parameters, domain name system root zone management, and allocation of numbering resources. The NTIA recognized the importance of continuing IANA functions for Internet stability as the Tera-node Network Technology project ended in 1999. The NTIA may use its contract authority to maintain the continuity and stability of services related to the IANA functions. The contractor must establish a close working relationship with various parties, including the multi-stakeholder model represented by ICANN, the Internet Engineering Task Force, and Regional Internet Registries. The Internet Architecture Board, Regional Internet Registries, top-level domain operators, governments, and the Internet user community are involved in the IANA functions contract. The contract states that all deliverables belong to the U.S. Government, including the automated root zone. Former President Bill Clinton's Internet czar emphasized that the U.S. funded and oversaw the creation of the Internet. Congress has the exclusive power to regulate US territories and property. The .gov and .mil domains are US Government property, and they should have exclusive control and use of them indefinitely. The Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information must maintain the IANA functions contract, including control of the Internet domain name system functions and the .gov and .mil domains, unless granted authority by a new Federal statute. The Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information must certify to Congress that the US Government has sole ownership of the .gov and .mil domains and exclusive control in perpetuity through a contract with ICANN."
