    "content": "The \"Job Opportunities Between our Shores Act\" or the \"JOBS Act\" is a pilot program to support advanced manufacturing workforce development. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act is amended to include an Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development Program, which aims to provide education and training in advanced manufacturing through demonstration and pilot projects targeting skills development in communities with expected growth in this sector. The Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development Program aims to provide education and training in advanced manufacturing through various credentials, prioritize incumbent workers, dislocated workers, and unemployed individuals, and partner with manufacturers for grants or contracts. Eligible entities include those in states or territories working with manufacturers employing individuals with advanced manufacturing skills. Entities eligible to grant or be party to a contract under the Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development Program include community or technical colleges, community college districts, State community college systems, local workforce investment boards partnering with one-stop career centers, and other relevant entities. Entities eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development Program must demonstrate capacity to support strategic objectives and show expected participation and responsibilities. Priority is given to consortia leveraging non-Federal funding. Applications must be submitted as determined by the Secretary. The eligible entity or consortium must outline education and training activities that develop skills demanded by advanced manufacturing firms, lead to industry-recognized credentials, and promote career advancement. Additionally, they should describe how the local economy would benefit from their program. The eligible entity must provide evidence of advanced manufacturing growth, potential job creation, and exposure of workers to new technology skills. They should describe how they will use evidence-based training models to meet performance goals and coordinate with local workforce investment. Activities under a project funded for advanced manufacturing may include classroom and on-site learning, on-the-job training, industry-recognized competency training, apprenticeship programs, coordination with educational partners, and distance learning. The activities funded for advanced manufacturing aim to enhance the skill-sets of incumbent workers in growing communities and provide industry-recognized credentials. Additionally, they aim to develop competencies for individuals with limited experience in advanced manufacturing. The Secretary aims to strengthen partnerships with advanced manufacturing firms, community colleges, workforce investment boards, and local education agencies to enhance training for incumbent workers and help them develop skills leading to higher earnings. Performance measures will be negotiated with eligible entities receiving grants to evaluate the program's effectiveness. Performance measures will evaluate the activities of eligible entities, including the number of workers receiving credentials and attaining basic skills in advanced manufacturing. The evaluation of programs funded under this subsection will include assessing the number of incumbent workers trained to meet employer's needs, earnings growth from additional training, and other necessary measures to achieve program goals. The Secretary will conduct ongoing evaluations and report to Congress within two years of the first fund disbursement. The amendments made by this Act will take effect as part of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act."
