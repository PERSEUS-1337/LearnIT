    "content": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) is the first permanent international court with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for serious crimes. It is located in The Hague, funded by States Parties, and has jurisdiction over certain offenses since July 1, 2002. 110 countries are States Parties to the ICC. The Chief Prosecutor conducts preliminary analyses before initiating investigations based on referrals received. The Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has opened investigations into referred cases and requested authorization to investigate post-election crimes in Kenya. The ICC has issued 12 arrest warrants, with four resulting in arrests. There are currently nine cases before the Court, with some defendants still at large. The ICC Prosecutor has announced preliminary investigations into situations in Palestine and Afghanistan. The report focuses on the ICC's jurisdiction over U.S. nationals, investigating war crimes, and U.S. policy towards the ICC. It addresses how the ICC determines jurisdiction, admissibility of cases, concerns about surrendering U.S. nationals, and U.S. efforts to prevent ICC jurisdiction. The U.S. executive branch initially supported the idea of creating an international criminal court but ultimately voted against the Statute due to concerns over jurisdiction over U.S. civilians and soldiers. President Clinton signed the treaty in 2000 but did not submit it for ratification. President George W. Bush's Administration and the U.S. Congress took steps to weaken the ICC's potential effect on the U.S. The U.S. Congress and Bush Administration took steps to weaken the ICC's impact on U.S. citizens, including \"unsigning\" the Rome Statute, securing a U.N. resolution deferring ICC prosecution of U.S. personnel, bilateral immunity agreements, and enacting the American Servicemembers' Protection Act. The United States threatened to veto a U.N. Security Council resolution on extending a peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina unless U.S. personnel were granted immunity from the ICC. A compromise was reached for a one-year deferral of prosecution for U.S. soldiers and officials by the ICC. The U.N. Security Council extended the deferral of potential ICC prosecutions of American soldiers until July 1, 2004. However, by 2005, opposition to the resolution prevented further extensions, leading to its expiration. The U.S. also began signing bilateral immunity agreements to prevent surrender of its citizens to the ICC. The U.S. signed bilateral immunity agreements to prevent surrender of its citizens to the ICC without consent. These agreements aim to limit surrender under Article 98 of the Rome Statute, superseding obligations to hand over suspects to the ICC. The United States signed bilateral immunity agreements to prevent surrender of its citizens to the ICC without consent. President George W. Bush signed the American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002 into law, which restricts U.S. government cooperation with the ICC and provides protections for members of the U.S. armed forces. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002 imposed restrictions on U.S. cooperation with the ICC, prohibiting assistance for bringing foreign nationals accused of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity to justice. Despite initial objections, the Bush Administration later showed acceptance of some ICC activities, and the Obama Administration continued this approach by engaging directly with the ICC. Recent actions by Congress have removed sanctions affecting U.S. assistance for ICC member countries. The ICC is a treaty-based court with jurisdiction over crimes committed on the territory of member countries or by their nationals. The Court can also intervene if a non-State Party accepts its jurisdiction. To obtain ad hoc jurisdiction, a country must declare its cooperation with the ICC. The ICC may be precluded from hearing a case if it is inadmissible under Article 17, which outlines various scenarios where a case may not be heard. This includes situations where a State is already investigating or prosecuting the case, or if the case has been investigated but not prosecuted by a State. Additionally, cases may be deemed not of sufficient gravity for the Court to take further action. The ICC's jurisdiction is triggered when a case is of sufficient gravity, and its interpretation of Article 17 is crucial for admissibility. The principle of complementarity allows the ICC to be the court of last resort, depending on the willingness and ability of countries to prosecute suspects. The ICC's principle of complementarity allows it to investigate and prosecute suspects if a country is unwilling or unable to do so. The Court assesses a State Party's willingness through a three-part analysis to determine if the country is acting in good faith in investigating and prosecuting suspected war criminals. The ICC's principle of complementarity assesses a country's willingness to investigate and prosecute suspected war criminals. This can be proven by the country's express statement or inferred from unambiguous facts. The Court also considers whether a country has the ability to carry out proceedings due to a collapse of its judicial system. The ICC Office of the Prosecutor, led by Luis Moreno-Ocampo, consists of three divisions. The Prosecutor is elected by secret ballot by the Assembly of States. The Prosecutor of the ICC is elected by secret ballot with an absolute majority of the Assembly of States Parties. They must have high moral character, competence, and extensive experience in prosecuting criminal cases. The Prosecutor serves a nine-year term and cannot be re-elected. The Office of the Prosecutor acts independently, receiving referrals on war crimes, conducting investigations, and prosecuting cases before the Court. The Prosecutor must maintain impartiality and recuse themselves if there is a conflict of interest. The ICC Prosecutor must have high moral character, competence, and experience in prosecuting criminal cases. They serve a nine-year term and cannot be re-elected. The Prosecutor acts independently, receiving referrals on war crimes, conducting investigations, and prosecuting cases before the Court. If the Prosecutor decides to prosecute someone, the Court can request their arrest and surrender from any country. However, countries not party to the Rome Statute are not obligated to comply. The US has entered into bilateral immunity agreements with States Parties to avoid surrender requests inconsistent with international law. The proliferation of Article 98 Agreements has sparked an international debate over whether these agreements prevent the ICC from requesting the surrender of a U.S. citizen. The interpretation of Article 98 in the context of Bilateral Immunity Agreements (BIAs) has led to conflicting views on its meaning and whether it allows ICC States to avoid surrender requests. The debate over Article 98 Agreements centers on whether they prevent the ICC from requesting the surrender of a U.S. citizen. The EU argues that Article 98(2) only protects international treaty obligations that provide immunity to persons on official business in a requested State. The EU argues that the ICC can ignore treaty obligations preventing surrender of individuals not on official business in a requested State, citing Vienna Convention and Rome Statute provisions. The EU and some scholars argue that Article 98 of the Rome Statute was meant to allow States Parties to adhere to pre-existing agreements, not new ones. They believe that the focus of Article 98 was to remove obstacles to ratification posed by existing agreements. The Rome Statute's Article 98 is debated for its application to existing treaty obligations, with critics arguing it applies to all agreements regardless of timing. The ICC's stance on requesting surrender of a U.S. citizen from a State Party with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement (BIA) is uncertain. Despite differing interpretations, the Rome Statute grants the ICC final legal authority. The Rome Statute grants the ICC final legal authority to interpret requirements and obligations. The Court's decision making may consider practicalities such as the cost of requesting surrender in a BIA context and the possibility of the sending State not honoring the request. When the Office of the Prosecutor receives information about potential war crimes, it goes through a preliminary investigation to decide on launching a formal investigation. Factors considered include the reasonable basis for a crime, meeting Article 17's requirements, and serving the interests of justice. The Prosecutor assesses the factors of whether a crime occurred, if a potential case satisfies complementarity, and the gravity of the alleged crime to serve the interests of justice. The ICC considers the severity of the alleged offense in comparison to other crimes under its jurisdiction. The ICC's Office of the Prosecutor evaluates communications alleging crimes to determine if they meet the requirements for an investigation. The Pre-Trial Chamber must also find a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation before granting authorization. If the Prosecutor deems the requirements are not met, they will inform the relevant parties. The Prosecutor will inform those who provided information if requirements for an investigation are not met. The Office of the Prosecutor has publicly acknowledged considering information on various situations in 2009. The analysis process is kept confidential to protect privacy and integrity. The Office of the Prosecutor maintains confidentiality of submitted information and the integrity of analysis. However, they may disclose reasons for requesting or not requesting an investigation in certain situations. Preliminary analyses have generated public interest in the United States, but none have led to formal investigations or trials. In 2006, a preliminary investigation into alleged offenses in Iraq was concluded. The Prosecutor conducted a preliminary analysis of alleged crimes in Iraq, focusing on war crimes, willful killing, and inhumane treatment of civilians. The investigation considered jurisdiction issues due to Iraq not being an ICC State Party. Some argued that nationals of ICC States Parties were involved in crimes committed by non-member countries. The Office of the Prosecutor conducted a preliminary analysis on whether to launch a formal investigation into the involvement of States Parties' citizens as accessories to war crimes or crimes against civilians. They reviewed submitted communications, identified substantiated information, and examined relevant documentation and video records. Open source information from NGOs like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch was used, along with additional information from relevant countries and entities. The Office of the Prosecutor analyzed allegations of war crimes, focusing on attacks on civilians and excessive attacks on military objectives. While many civilians were harmed during military operations, there was insufficient evidence to prove intentional attacks on civilians, excessive attacks, or involvement of States Parties' nationals. The Office of the Prosecutor analyzed allegations of war crimes, focusing on attacks on civilians and military objectives. Gaps in intelligence led to seeking more information about the alleged crimes. The United Kingdom provided additional details on target identification, compliance with international law, use of computer modeling, and precision-guided weapons. The Prosecutor concluded that the available information did not provide a reasonable basis for further action. The Prosecutor concluded that, in light of available information, there was a reasonable basis to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC had been committed, but did not meet the gravity prong for initiating a formal investigation. The Prosecutor found that the crimes in Iraq did not meet the gravity threshold for initiating a formal investigation under Article 53 of the Rome Statute. On September 9, 2009, Prosecutor Moreno-Ocampo confirmed gathering information on possible war crimes by NATO, U.S. soldiers, Taliban, and al Qaeda in Afghanistan. No specific details or decisions on formal investigation have been disclosed. The U.S. has not taken a stance on the Prosecutor's actions. Eikenberry and McChrystal did not dispute the ICC's authority to investigate alleged crimes in Afghanistan. The ISAF did not dispute the ICC's authority to investigate alleged crimes in Afghanistan but argued that the U.S.-Afghanistan agreements prevented ICC custody of U.S. troops. They stated that any wrongdoing would be handled by the U.S. military justice system. General McChrystal and Ambassador Eikenberry opposed ICC arrest and prosecution of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Afghanistan's accession to the Rome Statute gave the ICC jurisdiction over crimes committed there. Afghanistan's accession to the Rome Statute granted the ICC jurisdiction over crimes committed on its soil. The ICC must assess jurisdiction, investigate requirements, and admissibility under complementarity rules. If the US demonstrates genuine investigations and prosecutions, cases may be deemed inadmissible. If the Prosecutor proceeds with investigating and prosecuting crimes allegedly committed by U.S. citizens, concerns arise about extradition to the ICC. Only States Parties to the Rome Statute are required to comply with arrest and surrender requests. Afghanistan, unlike the United States, is a party to the Rome Statute. Afghanistan, as a party to the Rome Statute, is mandated to comply with ICC requests for surrendering American nationals. However, agreements like the U.S-Afghanistan Bilateral Immunity Agreement and the U.S.-Afghanistan SOFA may prevent the ICC from requesting extradition. The impact of these agreements on extradition requests to Afghanistan is uncertain due to the debate surrounding Article 98. Without ICC guidance, it is unclear if these agreements would preclude surrendering a U.S. citizen. The ICC may face challenges in requesting Afghanistan to surrender a U.S. national due to conflicting obligations imposed by the BIA and SOFA. The interpretation of Article 98 could determine whether Afghanistan would comply with an extradition request from the ICC. The ICC may struggle to request Afghanistan to surrender a U.S. citizen due to conflicting obligations under the BIA and SOFA. The interpretation of Article 98 could impact Afghanistan's compliance with an extradition request from the ICC. The ICC's jurisdiction over crimes committed during the 2008/2009 conflict in Gaza is complicated by the PNA's declaration, as it is not recognized as a State. Concerns arise regarding Palestinian statehood and ICC involvement. The Prosecutor received 326 communications regarding the situation between Israel and the Palestinian Territories after the PNA sought ad hoc jurisdiction. No further information has been released. The Prosecutor received 326 communications regarding the Gaza Conflict. The U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Gaza presented the Goldstone Report, which found war crimes and crimes against humanity had been committed. The report recommended national level investigations and prosecutions, and if not conducted within six months, the situation should be referred to the ICC Prosecutor. The ICC may have jurisdiction over Israel and Palestine despite their non-membership. The US has opposed ICC involvement in investigating war crimes in Gaza. The US opposes ICC involvement in investigating war crimes in Gaza, preferring the issue to be handled in the Human Rights Council rather than the ICC or Security Council. This marks a shift in US policy towards the ICC based on sovereignty concerns and potential overreach by the ICC prosecutor. The US government's views on the ICC have shifted, recognizing its potential usefulness in bringing perpetrators of atrocities to justice. Despite ongoing concerns, the Obama Administration believes engaging with the ICC is in the best interest of the United States. Congress has also moved to ease restrictions on US foreign assistance to ICC States Parties. The Obama Administration has shown support for the ICC by engaging with the court and participating as an observer in its annual Assembly of States Parties. The US government is expected to complete a review of its ICC policy in 2010. The Obama Administration supports engagement with the ICC but does not plan to become a party to the Rome Statute at this time. Concerns remain about politically motivated prosecutions of U.S. service members. Ambassador Rapp reaffirmed the commitment to justice for atrocities through international criminal tribunals. The Obama Administration supports engagement with the ICC but does not plan to become a party to the Rome Statute at this time. Ambassador Rapp reaffirmed the commitment to justice for atrocities through international criminal tribunals. The U.S. participated as an observer in the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute to gain a better understanding of the issues being considered. The United States will participate in the Review Conference of the Rome Statute in Kampala, Uganda in May-June 2010. Ambassador Rapp discussed amending the Rome Statute to include the crime of aggression within the ICC's jurisdiction, reflecting U.S. opposition. The U.N. Security Council referred allegations of crimes by President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan to the ICC in 2005. The United States abstained from a Council vote on Resolution 1828 regarding President Omar al-Bashir's prosecution. The Obama Administration opposes deferral of the prosecution and supports ICC efforts to enforce the arrest warrant. Ambassador Susan Rice called for restraint in Darfur and cooperation from Sudan's government. The Obama Administration supports ICC efforts to enforce arrest warrants and has expressed general support for the ICC as a tool for prosecuting war crimes. Resolution 1888, adopted by the U.N. Security Council, includes a reference to sexual violence crimes listed in the Rome Statute. The U.S. will back international tribunals when necessary for justice but prioritizes helping individual States establish their own systems. The Obama Administration prioritizes assisting individual States in setting up their own justice systems to address atrocities. They have shown willingness to support the ICC's work but have cited concerns about the security of U.S. armed forces as a barrier to joining the Rome Statute. Hillary Clinton stated that the Administration would end U.S. \"hostility\" towards the ICC and acknowledged the Court's professionalism and fairness. The Obama Administration supports the ICC's work but has concerns about the security of U.S. armed forces. They will review the U.S. position on joining the Rome Statute. Ambassadors and officials have praised the ICC's professionalism and fairness in handling cases in Darfur, Congo, and Uganda. The United States regrets not being a party to the Rome Statute but will support the ICC in its investigations and prosecutions. The Obama Administration encourages local justice systems to prosecute atrocities and create special tribunals. Ambassador Rapp is committed to holding individuals accountable for war crimes and atrocities. The United States supports international efforts for justice in cases of atrocities, emphasizing the importance of accountability at the local level. While preferring specialized courts, the U.S. will cooperate with the ICC when necessary. This stance aligns with the principle of complementarity. The United States supports international justice efforts, emphasizing local accountability and cooperation with the ICC when needed. Secretary Clinton hoped Kenya would use its own justice system for 2007 election violence, but urged cooperation with the ICC if necessary. The United States supports international justice efforts, emphasizing local accountability and cooperation with the ICC when needed. In Kenya, if a special tribunal is not established, the U.S. supports action by the ICC. In the DRC, the ICC has charged military commanders for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and sexual crimes. Some criticize the ICC for hindering conflict resolution by issuing arrest warrants for alleged perpetrators. Ambassador Rapp defends negotiations with governments wanted by the ICC, stating the U.S. is working towards justice. Rapp addresses concerns about US efforts for peace in Sudan and accountability for violations of international law. Indictments of Charles Taylor and Joseph Kony are seen as enhancing peace prospects in Sierra Leone and Uganda. The US has executed Bilateral Immunity Agreements (BIAs) with many countries to limit ICC's ability to request surrender of US nationals. The most recent BIA was with Montenegro in 2007. Several countries have BIAs with the United States despite not being States Parties to the Rome Statute. These agreements are in effect, but their legality under international law is questioned. Recent Congresses have removed sanctions affecting U.S. assistance for ICC States Parties, possibly due to concerns about hurting U.S. interests. The ASPA in 2002 prohibited U.S. military aid to ICC States Parties. The American Service Members Protection Act (ASPA) in 2002 prohibited U.S. military aid to ICC States Parties, with specific definitions and exemptions outlined in the act. Presidential waivers could be granted under certain conditions, allowing for exceptions to the prohibition on military assistance. The American Service Members Protection Act (ASPA) in 2002 prohibited U.S. military aid to ICC States Parties, with exemptions outlined in the act. The President could waive the prohibition under certain conditions, including entering into a BIA with the United States. NATO members, designated major non-NATO allies (MNNAs), and Taiwan were exempt from the prohibition. Additional provisions in the 2005, 2006, and 2008 Foreign Operations Appropriations bills also restricted Economic Support Fund (ESF) assistance to ICC States Parties. The American Service Members Protection Act (ASPA) in 2002 prohibited U.S. military aid to ICC States Parties, with exemptions outlined in the act. Additional provisions in the 2005, 2006, and 2008 Foreign Operations Appropriations bills also restricted Economic Support Fund (ESF) assistance to ICC States Parties. The FY2005, FY2006, and FY2008 Appropriations Acts contained provisions prohibiting ESF assistance to ICC States Parties for funds available through specific years. Each Nethercutt Amendment provision differed somewhat from the other two, with specific conditions and exemptions outlined. The American Service Members Protection Act (ASPA) in 2002 prohibited U.S. military aid to ICC States Parties, with exemptions outlined in the act. The 2005, 2006, and 2008 Foreign Operations Appropriations bills further restricted Economic Support Fund (ESF) assistance to ICC States Parties. Subsections (a)-(d) of the legislation detail provisions for waivers and exceptions to the prohibition on ESF funds for countries that are ICC parties. The FY2006 Appropriations Act included a general prohibition on ESF assistance to ICC States Parties without an Article 98 agreement with the United States, with provisions for Presidential waivers and exemptions. The Nethercutt Amendment from the 2005 Act also provided an exemption from the prohibition. The FY2006 Appropriations Act included a general prohibition on ESF assistance to ICC States Parties without an Article 98 agreement with provisions for waivers and exemptions. Subsections (a) through (d) of the FY2008 Appropriations Act mirrored those of the FY2006 Act, with similar provisions for national interest waivers, Article 98 agreement waivers, and exemptions for MCA-eligible countries. The FY2006 Appropriations Act included a general prohibition on ESF assistance to ICC States Parties without an Article 98 agreement with provisions for waivers and exemptions. The FY2008 Appropriations Act also had similar provisions for national interest waivers, Article 98 agreement waivers, and exemptions for MCA-eligible countries. The Nethercutt Amendment provisions and ASPA articulated a strong policy of opposition to the ICC, with questions arising within the executive branch on the costs and benefits of such sanctions. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice criticized the sanctions as hindering military aid to key U.S. allies, and President Bush granted numerous waivers of ASPA or Nethercutt prohibitions on national interest grounds. In 2007, Congress repealed Section 2007 of ASPA, ending the prohibition on military assistance and credit sales for ICC States Parties. The Nethercutt Amendment language was not included in the recent foreign operations appropriations legislation. Recent foreign operations appropriations legislation has removed ICC-related prohibitions on military and ESF assistance. No bills have been introduced in the current Congress regarding the ICC or U.S. becoming party to the Rome Statute. House members have proposed non-binding resolutions, such as H.Res. 867, which criticizes the Goldstone Report on the Gaza conflict and calls on President Obama to veto any UN Security Council resolution endorsing it. The Goldstone Report recommended referring the Gaza case to the ICC if no national prosecutions are done within 6 months. H.Res. 241 commends the ICC for issuing a warrant for Omar al-Bashir. H.Con.Res. 97 calls for U.S. support of ICC referrals and reactivation as a signatory to the Rome Statute. The curr_chunk discusses the provisions of a statute related to U.S. cooperation with ICC investigations and participation in ICC activities. It was referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on April 2, 2009."
