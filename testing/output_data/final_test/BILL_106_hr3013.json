ELIM NATIVE CORPORATION LAND RESTORATION. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act is amended by adding a new section for Elim Native Corporation land restoration. The Congress finds that approximately 350,000 acres of land were withdrawn in 1917 for the use of the United States Bureau of Education and the Natives of Indigenous Alaskan race, including the Norton Bay Reservation set aside for the benefit of the Native inhabitants of Elim, Alaska. In 1929, 50,000 acres were deleted from the Reservation without the consent of the Native residents, violating the Act of March 3, 1927. Minimal consultation was conducted by the United States Government with the inhabitants. The lands were deleted from the Reservation for the benefit of others without offering restoration to the original Reservation, causing deep concern and frustration among the indigenous people of Elim. This unresolved issue continues to be a source of great loss for the shareholders of the Elim Native Corporation and their descendants. The lands deleted from the Norton Bay Reservation in 1929, meant for the Village of Elim, should be replaced with 50,000 acres for the Elim Native Corporation. These lands are temporarily withdrawn for 2 years for selection by the Corporation within a designated area near Elim, Alaska. The Elim Native Corporation is authorized to select and receive title to 50,000 acres of lands to replace those deleted from the Norton Bay Reservation. The lands are temporarily withdrawn for 2 years for selection by the Corporation near Elim, Alaska. The Elim Native Corporation is authorized to select up to 60,000 acres of land adjacent to U.S. Survey No. 2548 in Alaska. The selection must be compact, contiguous, and prioritized, remaining withdrawn until conveyed or full entitlement is achieved. The Elim Native Corporation is authorized to select up to 60,000 acres of land in Alaska, subject to valid existing rights. Easements for public benefit will be reserved by the Bureau of Land Management in the conveyance to the Corporation. The Elim Native Corporation is authorized to select up to 60,000 acres of land in Alaska, with the Bureau of Land Management reserving easements for public benefit. Final selection and conveyance of lands to the Corporation will satisfy their land entitlements and extinguish the Norton Bay Reservation. SEC. 8. CLARIFICATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONTAMINATION.
