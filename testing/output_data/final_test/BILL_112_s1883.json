    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Wasatch Range Recreation Access Enhancement Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds interest in providing direct public access between ski resorts in the Wasatch Range in Utah through a transportation connection called \"SkiLink\", proposed by The Canyons Ski Resort and Solitude Mountain Resort. This connection would cross approximately 30 acres of national forest land. The land management plan prohibits new ski lifts on National Forest land in Big Cottonwood Canyon. Despite efforts to increase transit access, winter weekend traffic remains high. SkiLink could reduce traffic between The Canyons Resort and Solitude Mountain Resort by 18,000 cars per year. SkiLink would bring immediate traffic benefits, reduce emissions in Parley's and Big Cottonwood Canyons, and use environmentally friendly construction techniques. The preliminary environmental review found no impact on federally listed species or critical habitat, with any issues addressable through mitigation. Utah's winter sport industry significantly contributes to the state's economy. The ski/snowboarding industry is a significant contributor to Utah's economy, bringing in $1.26 billion during the 2009/2010 ski season and creating 20,000 jobs. An economic analysis of SkiLink project shows it would add $50 million annually to Utah's economy, creating 500 new jobs in tourism and hospitality by connecting ski resorts and providing access to 6,000 acres of ski terrain. The text chunk discusses the conveyance of national forest system land in Salt Lake County, Utah. The Secretary of Agriculture will convey 30 acres of National Forest System Land in Utah to Canyons-SkiLink, LLC for the construction of a ski-lift or tramway. Canyons-SkiLink, LLC must pay the fair market value for the land. The fair market value of the National Forest System land to be conveyed must be determined through an appraisal within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. If the land is not used for its intended purpose for 10 years, the Secretary of Agriculture may choose to reclaim ownership. The Secretary of Agriculture may reclaim ownership of National Forest System land if not used for its intended purpose for 10 years. The United States has the right of immediate entry onto the land, and environmental compliance must be ensured before conveyance."
