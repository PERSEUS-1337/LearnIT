The Congress aims for U.S. students to excel in science and math by 2000. TIMSS study revealed American students lag behind in math compared to other nations. Lack of unified effort in defining and implementing a process for national leadership contributes to poor performance in science and math. The United States faces challenges in science and mathematics education due to inadequate assessment tools, insufficient teacher training, outdated teaching methods, and superficial math concepts. A comprehensive framework is needed to focus on basic skills, conceptual understanding, problem-solving, reasoning, communication, and technology use. In the United States, there are challenges in science and math education due to inadequate assessment tools, insufficient teacher training, outdated teaching methods, and superficial math concepts. A systematic retraining of teachers and emphasis on professional development is necessary. Teachers of math and science should be well-trained professionals with sound subject knowledge and understanding of student learning and assessment. The commission is established.
