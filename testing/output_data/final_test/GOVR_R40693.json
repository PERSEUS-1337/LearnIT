    "content": "The 111th Congress passed a budget bill containing funding for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and related agencies totaling $48.9 billion for FY2010, $3.3 billion below the President's request. The Department of State received $16.1 billion, while Foreign Operations received $32.8 billion. The President signed the budget measure into law on December 16, 2009. The FY2010 funding for the State Department and related programs was $15,789.3 million, slightly below the FY2009 appropriations. The Diplomatic and Consular Programs account was funded at $8,227.0 million, about 9% below the request. The Human Resources Initiative received $158.8 million, close to 26% above the request, to increase the number of employees by 25% by FY2014. The FY2010 funding for the State Department and related programs was slightly below FY2009 appropriations. The Human Resources Initiative aimed to increase hiring by 565 people in FY2010, following an additional 520 positions filled in FY2009. Studies highlighted understaffing in the Foreign Service and Civil Service, impacting diplomatic and military objectives, as well as U.S. trade and economic interests. The FY2010 appropriations for public diplomacy more than doubled the funding request for PD specialists personnel, reaching $138.0 million. Funding for the construction and maintenance of secure U.S. embassies and consulates was below the request by 5.3%, at $1,724.2 million. The Civilian Response Initiative also received funding for operations and staffing in FY2010. The FY2010 appropriations did not fully fund the Civilian Response Corps, part of the Civilian Response Initiative aimed at deploying civilians for reconstruction and stabilization efforts globally. Funding for U.S. contributions to International Organizations and peacekeeping forces was below request, while non-military international broadcasting received near-request funding. The total foreign operations funding for FY2010 was $32.8 billion, nearly 6% lower than requested. The FY2010 foreign operations funding level of $32.8 billion is $2.0 billion below the President's request. Congress provided more funding for Global Health and Child Survival programs, Migration and Refugee Assistance, Peace Corps, International Organizations and Programs, and Peacekeeping Operations than requested. However, accounts like the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Development Assistance Account, International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, and Foreign Military Financing received less funding than requested. Within the FY2010 Foreign Operations budget, significant amounts were allocated for assistance to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. The House Appropriations Committee approved $49.0 billion in State-Foreign Operations appropriations, with additional funding for climate change programs. Amendments were made before final passage on July 9. Before final passage on July 9, amendments were proposed to increase funding for sanitation, democracy programs, maternal health, oversight, and implementation of the U.S.-Brazil Joint Action Plan to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Discrimination. The amendments would also restrict FMF funds to Sri Lanka and first-class travel by employees of agencies funded by the bill. Additionally, there were proposals to strike presidential waiver authority regarding blocking aid to Saudi Arabia and to prohibit funds for negotiating agreements conflicting with Congress requirements for U.S. participation in the IMF and World Bank. Amendments to reduce funding for the Peace Corps, diplomatic and consular programs, and USAID were rejected by the House. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its FY2010 302(b) allocations, including $48.7 billion for discretionary spending within the State-Foreign Operations appropriation. On July 9, the committee approved S. 1434, the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agency Appropriations Act, 2010, totaling $48.8 billion. The Senate bill provides more funding for the Department of State Operations but less for Foreign Operations compared to the House bill. It includes increases for the Capital Investment Fund, Civilian Stabilization Initiative, and Educational and Cultural Exchanges. The Senate's FY2010 State, Foreign Operations appropriations bill allocated more funding for the Department of State Operations, Educational and Cultural Exchanges, and multilateral assistance compared to the House bill. However, it provided less funding for bilateral economic assistance and military aid. The bill funds various international affairs programs and activities but was not taken up by the full Senate except in the context of consolidated appropriations legislation. The State-Foreign Operations bill funds international broadcasting programs, but does not cover all international affairs programs. Some programs, like food aid and certain commissions, are funded through other appropriations bills. The report focuses on accounts funded through the State-Foreign Operations bill, providing appropriations figures for the entire international affairs budget. The State-Foreign Operations bill funds international broadcasting programs and accounts funded through the State-Foreign Operations bill provide appropriations figures for the entire international affairs budget. The rationale for foreign affairs programs has shifted from anti-communism to national security and anti-terrorism post 9/11. Foreign aid and diplomatic programs also serve U.S. policy interests such as economic development, trade, education, health care, human rights, and environmental protection. Other objectives include nuclear weapons proliferation prevention, arms control, drug trafficking, peace efforts in the Middle East, regional stability, and environmental protection. Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, U.S. foreign aid and diplomatic programs have focused on global development as a key pillar of national security, alongside defense and diplomacy. The war on terrorism has become a top priority in foreign assistance budget justifications, with an emphasis on aiding \"front-line\" states. The Bush Administration implemented new aid initiatives focusing on using foreign aid to combat terrorism, with large reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. State Department efforts emphasized diplomatic security and public diplomacy. The Obama Administration is expected to continue some of these initiatives, including a transformational diplomacy initiative announced in 2006. The Obama Administration has not nominated a USAID Administrator, leading to separate individuals acting as Deputy Secretary of State-level Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA) and USAID Administrator. The DFA created a new Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance to promote democracy and improve coordination, transparency, and accountability for aid programs. The Obama Administration's international affairs budget proposal continues to use this framework, addressing development and global health concerns. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was proposed by President Bush in 2002 and established in 2004 to provide aid to low- and low-middle income countries committed to reforms. Funding has not reached promised levels, with the Obama Administration requesting $1.43 billion in FY2010, the smallest amount since MCC's inception. The Obama Administration announced plans to dedicate $63 billion to global health programs through FY2014, with a focus on HIV/AIDS. The FY2010 budget proposal includes slight increases to global health programs, emphasizing food security and climate change. The House-passed FY2010 State-Foreign Operations bill supports these priorities. The Administration's FY2010 international affairs budget request of $52.20 billion, with 97% for the Department of State and foreign operations. The FY2010 international affairs budget request of $52.20 billion allocated 97% for the Department of State and foreign operations. Supplemental resources were used for programs related to reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan during the Bush Administration. The Bush Administration relied heavily on supplemental appropriations for predictable expenses, criticized for keeping funds off-budget. The Obama Administration pledged to discontinue this practice starting with the FY2010 request. The FY2010 request for State-Foreign Operations is 36% higher than FY2009, but only 3% higher when including supplemental appropriations. The FY2010 State-Foreign Operations budget request is $17.36 billion, a 6% increase over FY2009, excluding stimulus bill funding. The request includes funding for the Department of State, international broadcasting, and related agencies. The FY2010 State-Foreign Operations budget request is $17.36 billion, a 6% increase over FY2009, excluding stimulus bill funding. The House passed H.R. 3081 with $16.05 billion for the Department of State and related agencies, 7% less than the Administration request. Many account recommendations fall short of the request due to significant FY2009 supplemental funding considered a down payment on FY2010 priorities shared by Congress and the Administration. The State Department's FY2010 budget request is $17.36 billion, with the House passing H.R. 3081 at $16.05 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported $16.15 billion for State operations. The Department's mission is to advance U.S. interests globally through staffing overseas missions, foreign policy, passport issuance, and more. It coordinates with over 40 U.S. government agencies at 260 diplomatic posts in 180 countries, employing around 30,000 people, with 60% working abroad. The State Department's FY2010 budget request includes funds for salaries, expenses, exchanges, embassy construction, and security. The Administration seeks $12.23 billion, a 10% increase from FY2009. The House bill sets funding at $11.16 billion, while the Senate committee recommends $11.23 billion. The D&CP account covers salaries, benefits, overseas operations, foreign policy activities, passport and visa applications, public diplomacy programs, and more. The Administration is requesting $8.96 billion for the FY2010 budget of the former U.S. Information Agency and Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. This includes an increase in personnel and funding for public diplomacy and worldwide security protection. The increase reflects the Obama Administration's intention to expand U.S. diplomatic capacity. The House-passed bill provides $8.23 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) in FY2010, including funding for worldwide security protection, public diplomacy, and new positions for diplomatic and development personnel. The Senate committee also reported a similar funding level for D&CP. This account supports the maintenance and security of U.S. diplomatic missions abroad, with increased funding since the embassy bombings in Africa in 1998. The Administration seeks $876.9 million for ongoing ESCM operations and $938.2 million for worldwide security upgrades in FY2010. The total request for the ESCM account is $1.82 billion, representing a 32% decrease from FY2009. Both the House-passed bill and the Senate-reported bill provide $1.724 billion for ESCM, with differences made up for in FY2009 supplemental funds. The Civilian Stabilization Initiative aims to improve U.S. civilian capabilities. The Civilian Stabilization Initiative, established in 2004, aims to enhance U.S. civilian agencies' ability to promote stability in post-conflict situations internationally. The Office of the Coordinator of Reconstruction and Stabilization was created at the State Department to coordinate interagency responses and develop a Civilian Response Corps for rapid deployment to post-conflict environments. Congress allocated $65 million for these efforts in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008. The Civilian Stabilization Initiative, established in 2004, received additional funding in FY2009 through the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009. The Obama Administration's FY2010 request includes a significant increase in funding for the Civilian Stabilization Initiative, with $323 million allocated for the Civilian Response Corps. H.R. 3081 provides $125 million for the initiative under the State Department, and an additional $30 million under USAID. The State Department and USAID received $125 million and $30 million respectively for the Civilian Stabilization Initiative (CSI). S. 1434 proposes $150 million for CSI, funding programs like the Fulbright Academic Exchange Program. Government exchange programs have faced scrutiny for duplication, but after 9/11, public diplomacy in Arab and Muslim populations became a focus. The Obama Administration requested $633 million for exchanges in FY2010, an 18% increase from FY2009. This would expand English language programs and support new staff positions. The House-passed bill includes $600 million for educational and cultural exchanges. The House-passed bill includes $600 million for educational and cultural exchanges, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommends $635.2 million. The Consolidated International Affairs (CIF) was established to provide for purchasing information technology and capital equipment for efficient resource management. The FY2010 budget request includes $160 million for CIF, a decrease from previous years. U.S. contributions to the United Nations and peacekeeping activities have been affected in recent years. The U.S. contributions to international peacekeeping activities have been impacted by various issues, including funding withholding for family planning policies, Iraq Oil for Food Program implementation issues, findings of misconduct in U.N. peacekeeping operations, and efforts for comprehensive U.N. reform. The Consolidated International Affairs (CIF) provides funds for U.S. membership dues in international organizations. The Administration argues that maintaining a membership in international organizations benefits the United States by advancing U.S. interests and principles while sharing costs with other countries. The President's FY2010 request includes $1.80 billion for this account, a 12% increase over the estimated FY2009 level. This funding covers payments to the United Nations, Inter-American Organization, and other international organizations to meet assessed contribution levels. Both H.R. 3081 and S. 1434 provide $1.7 billion for CIO, with $100 million less than the Administration requested for synchronization payments. The President's FY2010 request of $2.26 billion is intended to pay the full U.S. assessed share of U.N. peacekeeping mission expenses, representing a 5% decline from the FY2009 estimate. Both House and Senate bills contain $2.13 billion for CIPA, or 6% less than the Administration request. The International Commissions account includes the U.S.-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission, U.S. and Mexico, the American Sections Commission, and the International Fisheries. The President requested $132.5 million for various commissions, including the Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad and the United States-China Economic Security and Review Commission. The House and Senate bills provide slightly higher funding. The FY2010 request for these commissions is $13.0 million, with both the House and Senate bills funding them at the same amount. Additionally, several private, non-profit organizations receive U.S. funding through State Department appropriations, including The Asia Foundation. The FY2010 request for The Asia Foundation is $16.23 million, a 1% increase from FY2009. The International Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue Trust Fund would disburse $875,000 for programming activities. The National Endowment for Democracy faces a 13% budget cut to $100 million for FY2010. The East-West Center would receive $11.7 million, a 44% decrease from FY2009. The Administration's FY2010 budget includes a $49.2 million request for the U.S. Institute of Peace, a 59% increase from FY2009. The House and Senate bills match this request, except for funding for the East-West Center. The BBG's funding request for FY2010 is $745.5 million for broadcasting in 60 languages. The BBG's FY2010 budget request for broadcasting in 60 languages is $745.5 million, with $732.2 million allocated for International Broadcasting Operations and $13.3 million for Broadcasting Capital Improvements. This represents a 4% increase from FY2009 levels. Funding for broadcasts to Cuba is no longer separated out, but $32.5 million is allocated for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting within the budget. The House bill matches the Administration's request for funding for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, while the Senate bill sets the broadcasting funding level $16.1 million below the request. The Foreign Operations budget includes U.S. foreign assistance programs, managed by USAID and the State Department. The Foreign Operations budget supports independent foreign aid agencies and U.S. contributions to multilateral financial institutions. The budget request for FY2010 is $34.85 billion, a 1% increase from FY2009. The FY2010 Foreign Operations budget is $32.96 billion, 5% less than the Administration's request.

The FY2010 Foreign Operations budget request includes $503 million for West Bank & Gaza, a 45% reduction from FY2009. South Africa and Colombia are among the top 10 recipients, with requested funding similar to previous years. Obama Administration's FY2010 proposal was nearly a 9% increase over FY2009 funding. The FY2010 budget request for foreign operations saw a 1% increase over FY2009 funding, with a focus on economic assistance to combat the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Congress approved $7.04 billion for foreign operations, reducing the initial request of nearly 9%. Comparing FY2009 appropriations to the FY2010 request may not accurately reflect shifting policies and priorities due to timing of approvals. The FY2010 economic assistance request for Afghanistan and Pakistan is $2.78 billion and $1.28 billion, respectively, representing a 4% and 15% increase. The House bill provides $2.54 billion for Afghanistan and $1.46 billion for Pakistan, but does not specify funding for certain accounts included in the Administration's request. The Administration also proposes meeting financial commitments to multilateral development banks and the United Nations in its FY2010 budget request. The budget request for FY2010 includes $2.70 billion for multilateral development banks and international organizations, with a focus on leadership in forums and addressing food insecurity. There is also a request for $600 million for clean technology and climate funds at the World Bank to demonstrate commitment to addressing climate change. The House recommendation includes $2.35 billion for multilateral assistance, with less funding for clean technology and climate funds. The House recommended increases for various UN organizations and programs, while providing $257.9 million more for multilateral assistance than the House-passed bill. This includes $400 million for the International Clean Technology Fund. Other foreign operations accounts would also see significant changes in funding levels, such as USAID operating expenses and capital investment accounts. The proposal includes creating 350 new Foreign Service Officer positions at USAID, with a 36% and 74% increase in funding. H.R. 3081 provides $1.39 billion, a 31% increase for operating expenses over FY2009. Development Assistance would increase by 37% under the Administration request. Emergency Refugee & Migration Assistance would increase by 88% to reduce reliance on supplemental appropriations. International Disaster Assistance would receive a 7% increase to address emergency food needs. The House and Senate bills propose varying increases in funding levels for different programs. The Millennium Challenge Corporation would receive a significant increase, while the Treasury Department's Debt Restructuring Activities would see a substantial boost to meet U.S. commitments. International Military Education and Training would also see a notable increase in funding. The Senate bill provides less funding than requested but more than FY2009 levels for Non-Proliferation, Anti-Terrorism, and Demining. International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement would increase by 25% under the Administration request to fund various initiatives. The House bill provides a 14% increase for Non-Proliferation, Anti-Terrorism, and Demining. The bill is 22% below the request and 2% below FY2009 funding level. The Transition Initiatives (TI) account would receive a 152% increase over the FY2009 estimated appropriation under the Administration request. The House bill provides a 100% increase over the FY2009 level, while the Senate Committee recommends a 30% increase. Only a few accounts would receive less than their estimated FY2009 appropriation under the Administration's FY2010 request. The Economic Support Fund would decrease by 9% from the FY2009 total. Both the House and Senate bills provide $6.37 billion for this account, $134 million less than the Administration requested. The Senate committee recommends a 19% decline in assistance for Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance would increase by 88%, while regular Migration and Refugee Assistance funds would be cut by 11%.

The House bill includes increases for the Democracy Fund and Fund for Ireland, while the Senate Appropriations Committee allocates 3% for the Democracy Fund and no funding for the Fund for Ireland. Export-Import Bank assistance is restricted to countries violating nuclear non-proliferation treaties. The provision addresses concerns that current law does not prevent the Export-Import Bank from providing credit, insurance, or guarantees assistance to companies contributing significantly to Iran's petroleum industry. Proposed changes to bilateral assistance accounts are shown in Figure 6. The Administration's budget request calls for a new Shared Security Partnership funded through various accounts to develop strategic partnerships aimed at confronting common threats. The House bill supports expanding initiatives to improve coordination and cooperation on global terrorism and crime issues. President Obama announced a six-year, $63 billion Global Health Initiative to address HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other health needs. The initiative aims to move towards a more comprehensive approach to global health, but concerns have been raised about the funding not matching the rhetoric. The budget request for FY2010 shows a 3% increase in total global health funding. The FY2010 budget request for Global Health and Child Survival includes a 3% increase over FY2009 total. Critics argue that global health programs may have to take on more responsibilities without additional resources. The House funding for this account is $7.78 billion, 2% higher than the Administration's request. The Emergency Crises Fund, established by the Senate bill, allows the Secretary of State to respond to unforeseen crises. The State Department is developing crisis prevention and response capabilities to replace functions currently funded under DOD's Section 1207. The Senate committee recommends $100 million for FY2010 under the Department of Defense's Section 1207 funding. Africa would receive the most U.S. foreign assistance, with a focus on HIV/AIDS, agriculture, governance, education, and economic growth. South and Central Asia would see a 6% decrease in aid levels compared to FY2009, with a proposal of $4.87 billion. The Western Hemisphere aid levels would remain steady. The FY2010 foreign assistance budget proposal includes increases for East Asia & Pacific and reductions for the Near East, with a focus on ongoing support for Indonesia, assistance to Burma, and negotiations for North Korea's nuclear program. Funds would mainly go to Iraq, West Bank and Gaza, and the Trans Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership. Europe and Eurasia would see substantial cuts at -14%. The FY2010 foreign assistance budget proposal includes increases for East Asia & Pacific and reductions for the Near East. The share of U.S. bilateral foreign assistance going to Iraq and Afghanistan has increased sharply since FY2002. Foreign aid to Afghanistan has increased significantly since 2001, with the FY2010 request being $2.78 billion. Assistance to Iraq peaked in FY2004 at over $17 billion but has since decreased, with the FY2010 request at $500 million. The funding for Iraq and Afghanistan has decreased since its peak in FY2004. The FY2010 requested funding for both countries represents 9% of total foreign operations funding. Congress has shown interest in various aid sectors such as education, trade, maternal and child health, and biodiversity. Comparisons between FY2009 and FY2010 budget requests for key interest areas have been made. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2010 shows significant increases in funding for Clean Energy, Global Climate Change, Avian Influenza, and Other Public Health Threats. This demonstrates a heightened interest in global environmental issues and strengthening national capacities to prepare for pandemic-capable viruses."
