The Interactive Inference Network (IIN) uses neural network architectures to extract semantic features hierarchically from interaction space. The Densely Interactive Inference Network (DIIN) achieves state-of-the-art performance on NLI datasets, including a significant error reduction on the Multi-Genre NLI dataset. The Natural Language Inference (NLI) task involves determining the logical relationship between two sentences - entailment, contradiction, or neutral. It is a fundamental and challenging task for natural language understanding, requiring identification of language patterns and common sense knowledge. Recent progress in NLI is due to the availability of a large human-annotated dataset. Recent progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) is driven by a large human-annotated dataset and advancements in representation learning techniques, particularly the widespread application of attention mechanism in various NLU tasks. The attention function maps a query and key-value pairs to an output, allowing for alignment between representations and modeling dependencies regardless of sequence length. In this work, the focus is on enhancing the multi-head attention mechanism to create a word-by-word alignment tensor called the interaction tensor. This tensor captures high-order alignment relationships between sentence pairs, improving natural language inference tasks, especially with paraphrases, antonyms, and overlapping words. The experiments show that this approach effectively captures rich semantic features, leading to better task performance. The Interactive Inference Network (IIN) framework is introduced to solve natural language inference tasks, with a focus on paraphrase identification. A specific instance, Densely Interactive Inference Network (DIIN), achieves state-of-the-art performance on SNLI and MultiNLI datasets. The model is also tested on the Quora Question Pair dataset, showing new state-of-the-art results. The paper discusses the general framework of IIN and its performance on various datasets. The availability of SNLI dataset with 570k human annotated sentence pairs has enabled progress on natural language understanding. Representation learning techniques such as attention, memory, and parse structure are studied on SNLI, serving as an important benchmark. Models for NLI tasks can be categorized into sentence encoding-based and joint feature models. Neural attention mechanism, including various types such as hard-attention, self-attention, and multi-head attention, has been widely used in natural language processing and computer vision. This work aims to demonstrate that attention weights contain semantic information crucial for understanding the logical relationship between sentence pairs. While RNN and LSTM are effective for sequence modeling, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks in NLU tasks is desirable due to its parallelism. The use of Convolutional Neural Networks in NLU tasks is desirable due to its parallelism in computation. The convolutional structure has been successfully applied in various domains such as machine translation, sentence classification, text matching, and sentiment analysis. The Interactive Inference Network (IIN) is a hierarchical multi-stage process with five components compatible with different implementations, focusing on neural network approaches. The Embedding Layer converts words or phrases into vector representations to construct a representation matrix. The Encoding Layer enriches word representations with context information and desirable features for future use, utilizing models like bidirectional recurrent neural networks, recursive neural networks, and self-attention to capture temporal interactions, compositionality, and long-term dependencies in sentences. The Interaction Layer creates word-by-word interaction tensors using premise and hypothesis representations, modeling interactions through cosine similarity or dot product. Feature Extraction Layer utilizes feature extractors to extract semantic features from the interaction tensor, with CNN architectures like AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ResNet, and DenseNet being compatible. The Densely Interactive Inference Network (DIIN) utilizes a CNN architecture with 2-D kernels for semantic interaction feature extraction in NLI tasks. It incorporates word embedding, character features, and syntactical features in the Embedding Layer, updating word embeddings during training. The Output Layer predicts confidence on each class, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. In DIIN, character embedding is filtered with 1D convolution kernel and max pooled for each token to obtain a vector. Syntactical features include one-hot POS tagging and binary EM feature. The EM feature is activated for tokens with same stem or lemma in the other sentence. The premise and hypothesis representations are obtained, and the 1-D CNN and character features share parameters. The premise and hypothesis representations in DIIN are passed through a two-layer highway network to obtain new representations. These new representations undergo self-attention to consider word order and context information. A semantic composite fuse gate is used as a skip connection between the premise and hypothesis representations. The interaction layer in DIIN models the interaction between premise and hypothesis representations using a semantic composite fuse gate as a skip connection. The weights of intraattention and fuse gate are not shared, and penalization is used to ensure parallel structure learns similar functionality while being aware of subtle semantic differences. DenseNet BID31 is adopted as a convolutional feature extractor in DIIN, with experiments showing ResNet BID28 also works well. DenseNet is chosen over ResNet as it saves parameters effectively. Skip connection in ResNet is crucial for convergence. Batch normalization delays convergence without improving accuracy, so it is not used. ReLU activation function is applied after convolution. Interaction tensor is scaled down using 1x1 convolution. Dense block BID31 and transition block pair are used for feature extraction in DenseNet. DIIN uses a linear layer for classification and evaluates its model on three datasets, including SNLI with 570k sentence pairs labeled as \"entailment\" or \"neutral\". The MultiNLI dataset consists of 433k sentence pairs with labels such as \"entailment\", \"neutral\", and \"contradiction\". The data is collected from a broad range of American English genres, split into in-domain and cross-domain sets for training and testing. Test performance is evaluated without provided labels. The Quora question pair dataset contains over 400k real-world question pairs from Quora.com, with binary annotations for match (duplicate) or not match (not duplicate). The algorithm is implemented using Tensorflow BID14 framework with Adadelta optimizer and SGD optimizer. The model uses a learning rate of 3e\u22124 to improve local optimization. Dropout layers are applied before and after linear layers. Word embeddings are initialized with pre-trained 300D GloVe 840B vectors, while out-of-vocabulary words are randomly initialized. Character embeddings are randomly initialized with 100D and tokens are cropped or padded to 16 characters. 1D convolution kernel size for character embedding is 5. All weights are constrained by L2 regularization with specific parameters. The model uses L2 regularization with specific parameters for weight constraints. Different ratios are applied for regularization, with specific values chosen for L2FullRatio and L2FullStep. Various settings are adjusted for feature extraction layers, including the number of layers, growth rate, and scale down ratios. Experiments are conducted on different datasets with specific sequence lengths. Ensembling is done by majority voting of predictions from multiple model runs with different parameter initializations. The results are compared with other published systems. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of 80.0% on SNLI, surpassing current models using LSTM. Out-of-domain test performance is consistently lower than in-domain test performance, attributed to parameter selection. Comparison with other models on SNLI is presented in TAB4. In comparing model performance on SNLI, various sentence encoding models are evaluated. These models include BiLSTM, GRU encoder with pre-trained vectors, tree-based CNN, SPINN, intra-attention on BiLSTM, memory augmented neural network, cross sentence feature models with attention on LSTMs, mL-STM model, and LSTMN with deep attention fusion. The LSTMN with deep attention fusion decomposes tasks into sub-problems and proposes a neural tree indexer. The model DIIN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Quora question dataset. It evaluates effectiveness for paraphrase identification as a natural language inference task and compares with other models like BIMPM. The DIIN model explores different matching perspectives between sentence pairs and aggregates matching vectors with LSTM. Using in-domain paraphrase data, DECATT word and DECATT char pretrain n-gram word embeddings and n-gram subword embeddings in a decomposable attention model. Experimental results show DIIN outperforms other models, with an ensemble score surpassing the previous best by over 1 percent. Ablation studies reveal the importance of the exact match binary feature, as its removal leads to a decrease in performance on both matched and mismatched scores. In the experiment, the model's performance decreased to 78.2 on the matched score and 78.0 on the mismatched score. Removing the convolutional feature extractor resulted in a sentence-encoding based model, with a feature vector [p; h; |p \u2212 h|; p \u2022 h] used for classification. The model achieved 73.2 for matched score and 73.6 for mismatched data, competitive with other models. Further analysis showed that removing the encoding layer led to a score of 73.5 for matched and 73.2 for mismatched, demonstrating the importance of feature extraction. In experiment 5, self-attention and fuse gate were removed, leaving only the highway network, resulting in improved scores of 77.7 for matched and 77.3 for mismatched sets. However, in experiment 6, removing only the fuse gate led to decreased scores of 73.5 for matched and 73.8 for mismatched. Experiment 7 showed that using skip connections after the highway network and self-attention layers increased performance to 77.3 and 76.3, indicating that skip connections ease gradient flow. Comparing the base model to experiment 6, it was shown that the fuse gate is essential. In experiment 6, the fuse gate serves as a skip connection and helps in decision-making for representation. Replacing the dense interaction tensor with a dot product similarity matrix shows inferior semantic information capacity. Experiment 9 shares encoding layer weight, resulting in a decrease from the baseline, indicating learning of subtle differences between premise and hypothesis. Error analysis is conducted using annotated subset of development set. The provided set consists of 1,000 examples each tagged with various linguistic features such as CONDITIONAL, WORD OVERLAP, NEGATION, ANTO, LONG SENTENCE, TENSE DIFFERENCE, ACTIVE/PASSIVE, PARAPHRASE, QUANTITY/TIME REASONING, COREF, and QUANTIFIER. These tags help in analyzing sentence pairs for different linguistic phenomena. The study analyzed sentence pairs with various linguistic features such as WORD OVERLAP, ANTO, LONG SENTENCE, PARAPHRASE, and BELIEF. The model DIIN performed consistently better on these pairs, especially with WORD OVERLAP, ANTO, LONG SENTENCE, PARAPHRASE, and BELIEF tags. The exact match feature was found to help the model understand paraphrase better. The study found that the model DIIN performed well on sentence pairs with various linguistic features. Surprisingly, the model without the exact match feature did not perform worse on PARAPHRASE, but saw a 10% drop in accuracy on ANTO. DIIN also excelled on LONG SENTENCE pairs due to its large receptive field. Visualization of hidden representations showed correlated values in the interaction tensor I. The interaction tensor I and different channels of hidden representation reveal various aspects of text interaction. Different word pairs cause activation in different channels, showcasing the model's ability to understand text from diverse perspectives. The feature maps from the first dense block demonstrate activation in different positions, indicating the presence of different semantic features. The visualization of hidden representation in Figure 2 shows how different channels represent distinct semantic features.
