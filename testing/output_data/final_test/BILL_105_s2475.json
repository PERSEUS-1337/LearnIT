    "content": "The Act titled \"Pension Plan Participant Protection Act of 1998\" outlines the duties of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation when serving as trustee of a terminated plan. The Pension Plan Participant Protection Act of 1998 amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to outline the reporting, disclosure, and fiduciary duties of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation when serving as trustee of a pension plan. The Pension Plan Participant Protection Act of 1998 requires the corporation to maintain separate books and records, and retain separate counsel for carrying out its duties. Civil monetary penalties assessed by the Secretary of Labor shall be in full amount specified in the provision. A civil action for relief under section 409 may be brought by any affected party, and a replacement trustee can be selected by the court from a list of qualified candidates provided by the affected party. The Pension Plan Participant Protection Act of 1998 requires the corporation to issue a final determination on benefits within one year of being appointed as trustee. Failure to comply may result in legal action under section 4003(f)(1). Section 4023 of the Act is amended to clarify procedures for benefit determinations. Section 4023 of the Pension Plan Participant Protection Act of 1998 is amended to include a new subsection (b) stating that certain provisions do not apply when the corporation is serving in its fiduciary capacity according to section 4042(d)(3)(B). SEC. 3. Participants' committees are added to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, following section 4048. Sec. 4049 outlines the appointment of a committee of participants under a plan, with provisions for additional committees if necessary for adequate representation. Small businesses may request to not have a committee appointed. The subsection (a) consists of persons in pay status with the largest benefits under the plan or a committee chosen by participants. The committee appointed under subsection (a) can select attorneys, accountants, or agents with court approval. A committee appointed under subsection (a) may not have conflicts of interest and can consult with the trustee, investigate the plan's financial condition, and assess the plan's operation. The committee appointed under subsection (a) can participate in formulating the plan for distributing plan assets, advise those represented by the committee on distribution determinations, request the court for trustee appointments, and perform other services in the interest of plan participants and beneficiaries. The trustee must meet with the committee appointed under subsection (a) to conduct necessary business. \"Participants' committees are established under Sec. 4049 for the trusteeship of terminated plans.\" The court may appoint the corporation, a participants' committee, or any other person as trustee under paragraph (1) of Section 4042(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The determination of which applicant to appoint shall be based on qualifications to carry out fiduciary duties without conflicts of interest. Reasonable fees and expenses of a trustee appointed under this section will be paid or reimbursed. The reasonable fees and expenses of a trustee appointed under this section shall be paid from the assets of the terminated plan. SEC. 5. PARTICIPANT'S ADVOCATE. A new section titled \"office of participant's advocate\" is added to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The Secretary of Labor will establish an Office of Participant's Advocate to assist participants of terminated pension plans with counseling, legal representation, and appointing necessary staff. Fees for services will be regulated by the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Labor will establish an Office of Participant's Advocate to provide support for terminated pension plan participants. Notices of benefit determinations will include information about the services of the Participant's Advocate's Office. The Secretary of Labor will establish the Office of Participant's Advocate within one year of the enactment of the Act. Additionally, rules governing trusteeship by the Corporation will be implemented. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to require the corporation serving as trustee of a terminated pension plan to segregate assets, use assets only for benefit payments and administrative expenses, and obtain independent contractors for termination services. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 now requires the trustee of a terminated pension plan to use independent contractors for termination services through a competitive bidding process. The amendments made by this Act apply to plan terminations with termination dates on or after January 1, 1990, and final distribution of assets occurring after the enactment of this Act."
