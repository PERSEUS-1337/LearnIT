The \"Surface Transportation Security Improvement Act of 2018\" includes definitions for various transportation entities, such as railroad carriers, over-the-road bus services, bus terminals, and other transportation facilities as determined by the Secretary. Additionally, the act includes a provision for a national strategy for transportation security review. The Comptroller General of the United States will evaluate the 2016 Biennial National Strategy for Transportation Security within one year of the Act's enactment. The evaluation will assess the strategy's impact on Federal transportation security programs, budgets, research, and staffing levels. Key considerations include the strategy's forward-looking nature, its influence on future Federal efforts, and alignment with annual progress reports submitted to Congress. The annual progress reports submitted to Congress after the issuance of the 2016 Biennial National Strategy for Transportation Security evaluate how well the strategy guides Federal efforts in transportation security. SEC. 4. RISK SCENARIOS. The Secretary of Homeland Security annually develops risk-based priorities for transportation modes based on assessments of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. These priorities are informed by terrorist attack scenarios, including cyber attacks, and intelligence on evolving threats. A report must be provided to congressional committees within 120 days of each priority development. The Secretary of Homeland Security annually develops risk-based priorities for transportation modes based on assessments of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. A report is required to include copies of risk assessments, a summary ranking risks, and descriptions of risk-based priorities for securing the transportation sector. Information on methodologies used to assess risks and the basis for assumptions may be classified or unclassified. SEC. 5. ASSESSMENTS AND SECURITY PLANS; FRONTLINE EMPLOYEE SECURITY TRAINING. The Secretary of Homeland Security must submit a report to Congress and the Inspector General on the status of regulations for security assessments, plans, and training programs for transportation employees to address potential security threats.
