The Congress found that the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act established the Admiralty Island National Monument managed by the Forest Service. The Forest Service policy supports acquiring private land inholdings within the monument. The Greens Creek Land Exchange Act of 1996 facilitated a land exchange in the monument. Alaska Pulp Corporation's 54 acres in Hood Bay on Admiralty Island are available for transfer to Federal ownership. The United States owns reversionary interests to 143.87 acres near Silver Bay in Alaska, which could be transferred to Alaska Pulp Corporation for future development. Additionally, the acquisition of Chaik Bay property on Admiralty Island for incorporation into the Kootznoowoo Wilderness is deemed to be in the public interest. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
