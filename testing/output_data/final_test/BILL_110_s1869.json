The Voting Integrity and Verification Act of 2007 amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to include additional requirements for voting systems purchased after 2012, such as producing an individual permanent paper record for each ballot cast and providing verification options for voters. The Voting Integrity and Verification Act of 2007 amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to include requirements for voting systems purchased after 2012. These requirements include allowing voters to verify the accuracy of their ballot privately, review an individual paper version of their ballot before casting it, and correct any errors discovered on the paper ballot before it is cast and counted. The Voting Integrity and Verification Act of 2007 amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to include requirements for voting systems purchased after 2012. These requirements include allowing voters to verify the accuracy of their ballot privately, review an individual paper version of their ballot before casting it, and correct any errors discovered on the paper ballot before it is cast and counted. The Act also mandates the preservation of individual permanent paper records in accordance with specific provisions. The Voting Integrity and Verification Act of 2007 amends the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to include requirements for voting systems purchased after 2012. It mandates that voter verified paper ballots must be clearly readable by the naked eye and by a scanner for voters with disabilities. Additionally, it requires each individual paper record to be suitable for a manual audit equivalent to a paper ballot voting system. The Voting Integrity and Verification Act of 2007 mandates that electronic records produced by voting systems must be consistent with individual permanent paper records. These paper records must be preserved within the polling place or in a manner consistent with general paper ballot preservation methods. The Voting Integrity and Verification Act of 2007 requires that individual permanent paper records be the official record of votes cast in elections for Federal office. These paper records must be used for recounts or audits. Voting systems must also be accessible for individuals with disabilities at each polling place. The Voting Integrity and Verification Act of 2007 mandates that voting systems must allow voters to privately verify their permanent paper ballot in an accessible format for individuals with disabilities, without excluding the use of Braille or tactile ballots. The Voting Integrity and Verification Act of 2007 mandates the development of accessible voting systems. The Voting Integrity and Verification Act of 2007 requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish a program awarding cash prizes for the development of voting systems enhancing accessibility for individuals with disabilities. The Director will advertise prize competitions widely to encourage participation from various entities. Each competition will be announced through a Federal Register notice detailing the subject, duration, eligibility requirements, registration process, prize amount, and award criteria. The Director will also administer the competitions through an agreement with a private, nonprofit entity. The program will consist of technology competitions for individuals with disabilities, including hearing, visual, manual, tactile, and mobility impairments. Cash prizes will be awarded based on judges' criteria, with the option to not award a prize if no participants meet the requirements. The program involves technology competitions for individuals with disabilities, with cash prizes awarded based on judges' criteria for the functionality and usability of a prototype accessible voting machine. No more than 2 prizes of up to $1,000,000 each can be awarded. The criteria consider the challenges faced by voters with disabilities during voting. Voters with disabilities face challenges during the voting process, including the need for manual adjustments for font size, color content, and contrast to accommodate those with visual impairments. Voters with disabilities require various voter system interfaces such as synchronized audio output and tactile interface for electronic voting machines. The need for accessible voting systems for voters with disabilities, including the ability to adjust height, see visual cues from a seated position, use visual and audio cues simultaneously, and independently verify ballot accuracy. The accessible voting system should stimulate innovation, overcome obstacles, educate the public, and enhance accessibility. The Director shall consult with disability rights groups and Federal agencies to establish criteria to enhance voting accessibility and independence. The Director appoints qualified judges for each prize competition, including individuals from outside the Institute and the private sector. Judges must not have personal or financial interests in participating entities or familial relationships with participants. To be eligible to win a prize in the competition, a person must be incorporated in the US, be a US citizen or permanent resident, not affiliated with certain entities, and register by submitting required information. The Director may require information for an application. Trade secrets will be protected. No prizes after September 30, 2010. $2,000,000 authorized for awards each fiscal year 2008-2010. Funds of $1,000,000 for each fiscal year 2008-2010 are allocated to the Director for administrative costs. Prize award funds under this section are available until expended and can be used for other purposes after 10 fiscal years."
