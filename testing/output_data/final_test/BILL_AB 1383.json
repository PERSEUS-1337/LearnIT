The provisions of this part relating to discrimination on the basis of age do not prohibit an employer from altering, reducing, or eliminating health benefits or health care reimbursement plans for retired persons when they become eligible for Medicare benefits. This applies to all retiree health benefit plans and contractual provisions in effect on or after January 1, 2011. (b) A labor organization cannot discriminate based on various protected characteristics such as race, religion, disability, gender, age, sexual orientation, or military status in its membership, election of officers, staff selection, or treatment of members, employers, or employees. (c) Discrimination based on protected characteristics is prohibited in apprenticeship training programs, unpaid internships, or other limited duration programs. Employers and employment agencies are prohibited from expressing any form of discrimination based on various protected characteristics, including race, religion, disability, gender, age, sexual orientation, and military status. This does not prevent inquiries into an applicant's age if required by law. Employers and employment agencies are prohibited from requiring medical or psychological examinations, inquiries about disabilities or medical conditions, or the severity of such conditions from applicants. However, they may inquire about the applicant's ability to perform job-related functions and provide reasonable accommodations. Employers can require medical or psychological examinations of job applicants after an offer is made but before employment starts, as long as it is job-related and all employees in the same job classification are treated the same.

(j) It is unlawful to harass an employee based on various protected characteristics, and employers must take immediate corrective action if aware of such behavior. Employers may also be held responsible for harassment by nonemployees. An employer may be responsible for acts of nonemployees regarding sexual harassment in the workplace if they fail to take immediate corrective action. The employer's control and legal responsibilities with nonemployees' conduct will be considered. Employers must take reasonable steps to prevent harassment, and tangible job benefits are not required to establish harassment. An employee of an entity subject to this subdivision is personally liable for any harassment prohibited by this section, regardless of employer knowledge. The definition of \"employer\" in this subdivision includes any person regularly employing one or more persons. For purposes of this subdivision, \"employer\" does not include a religious association or corporation not organized for private profit, except as provided in Section 12926.2. Harassment because of sex includes sexual harassment, gender harassment, and harassment based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Sexually harassing conduct does not need to be motivated by sexual desire.

The person must be engaged in an independently established business, have control over work conditions and tools, and possess specific skills. Employers must take steps to prevent discrimination and harassment. Employers must accommodate religious beliefs in employment unless it causes undue hardship. Employers are required to reasonably accommodate religious beliefs in the workplace, including observance of religious holy days, necessary travel time for religious observances, and religious dress and grooming practices. This accommodation applies to various programs such as apprenticeships, internships, and unpaid work experiences. An individual's religious dress or grooming practice accommodation should not lead to segregation. Accommodation is not mandatory if it violates anti-discrimination laws. Employers cannot retaliate against someone requesting accommodation. Employers must provide reasonable accommodation for known disabilities without causing undue hardship. Retaliation or discrimination against those requesting accommodation is prohibited. The text outlines the obligations of employers to engage in an interactive process for reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities, prohibits genetic testing, and allows for the identification of military veterans for preference in employment. The \"Voluntary Veterans\u2019 Preference Employment Policy Act\" defines terms like DD 214, private employer, veteran, and veterans\u2019 preference employment policy for hiring or retaining veterans. Private employers can establish a veterans' preference employment policy for hiring, requiring veterans to submit a DD 214. Granting veterans' preference does not violate equal employment opportunity laws. The Department of Veterans Affairs can help verify veteran status for employers. This policy cannot be used to discriminate against job applicants based on protected classifications."
