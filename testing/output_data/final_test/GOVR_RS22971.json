    "content": "Interest in passenger natural gas vehicles (NGVs) has increased due to higher gasoline prices, environmental concerns, and policy proposals like the \"Pickens Plan.\" Despite availability for years, NGVs are mainly used in government and private fleets. Limited consumer adoption is attributed to high costs, performance concerns, and fuel infrastructure limitations. The Energy Information Administration estimated around 114,000 compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles in use. In 2009, the Energy Information Administration estimated 114,000 CNG vehicles and 3,000 LNG vehicles in the US, with two-thirds being light-duty vehicles. Only 0.004% of new light-duty vehicles sold in 2009 were NGVs. Currently, only two passenger NGVs are available for purchase by consumers. Despite higher initial costs, NGVs can save on fuel costs over their lifespan. The incremental price difference between a conventional Honda Civic EX and a natural gas-powered Honda Civic GX is over $5,000. The tax credit for new alternative fuel vehicles has expired. The cost of a home refueling system for a natural gas vehicle is between $3,400 and $4,500. Installing new alternative fuel refueling infrastructure can offset costs by $1,000 through a tax credit. Annual fuel savings when switching from gasoline to natural gas could be around $600. The payback period for a CNG vehicle and home refueling system is over 17 years, which may or may not be acceptable to consumers. Factors like fuel price differentials and tax incentives expiration can significantly impact this payback period. The payback period for natural gas vehicles (NGVs) compared to conventional vehicles may be shorter if discount rates or decreasing NGV prices are considered. Other benefits of NGVs include reduced petroleum dependence, lower emissions, and domestic natural gas production. NGVs have higher domestic output due to growth in unconventional natural gas sources. However, drawbacks include lower power, slower acceleration, shorter range, and reduced cargo space. These factors may impact the marketability of NGVs. Converting existing vehicles to operate on natural gas may affect marketability. Technical feasibility is high, with most engines capable of running on natural gas. Conversions typically involve changes to the fuel system. Previously, EPA restrictions made conversions more challenging. In the US, conversions must comply with the Clean Air Act, requiring rigorous emissions tests for new vehicles. After a vehicle is certified by the EPA, any modifications to the exhaust, engine, or fuel systems may be considered tampering under the Clean Air Act. It is prohibited to remove or alter any emissions control devices on a vehicle. EPA considers any changes leading to increased pollutant emissions as tampering. In 1974, EPA issued guidance to automakers and parts suppliers on what constitutes tampering with replacement parts. The guiding principle for alternative fuel conversions is that emissions should not increase after the conversion. EPA allowed flexibility in certifying emissions for converted vehicles, but in the 1990s, data suggested some converted vehicles might exceed emissions standards. In 1997, the EPA tightened testing standards for vehicle conversions to ensure compliance with emissions standards. Certifying conversions became costly for small producers due to the need for independent certification of each vehicle. Universal \"conversion kits\" were effectively prohibited, with estimated costs of up to $200,000 for design and manufacture. NGVAmerica estimated that it could cost up to $200,000 to design, manufacture, and certify a conversion for a single engine family under the then-current guidance. EPA issued final regulations on alternative fuel vehicle conversions on April 8, 2011, providing new flexibility for converters to certify their conversions without violating anti-tampering provisions. Certification costs for all vehicle classes are expected to be reduced, with significant cost reductions for intermediate age and outside of useful life vehicles due to less detailed testing requirements. The EPA's certification for vehicle conversions provides flexibility and cost savings, especially for older vehicles with minimal testing requirements. The certification remains valid as long as the conversion kit is not modified significantly. Concerns about voiding the original manufacturer's warranty only apply to directly modified systems, with the conversion manufacturer's warranty covering those. Other vehicle systems not affected by the conversion are not a warranty concern. Several bills have been introduced in recent years to promote NGVs and NGV infrastructure, notably in the 112th Congress with the Nat Gas Act of 2011 (H.R. 1380 and S. 1863). The Act would reinstate tax credits for NGV purchases and infrastructure installation, extend credits through 2016, provide tax credits to automakers producing NGVs, and authorize grants for natural gas engine development. Interest in NGVs has increased due to higher gasoline prices and concerns about U.S. oil dependence. Energy policy proposals like the Pickens Plan have further fueled interest in NGVs. The market for NGVs is currently limited due to the low number of new passenger vehicles and limited opportunities for converting existing gasoline vehicles. To expand the market, the differential between natural gas and gasoline prices needs to remain high or new incentives must be established. New EPA regulations on NGV conversions could help lower costs for conversion companies and promote the expansion of NGVs."
