    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH Woman) Act of 2017\". It includes findings related to abortion coverage. Congress finds that affordable, comprehensive health insurance, including coverage for pregnancy-related care and abortion, is essential for women's health regardless of income or insurance type. The Federal Government's restrictions on abortion coverage since 1976 disproportionately affect women insured through Medicaid and those with private insurance. In 2015, 58% of women aged 15-44 enrolled in Medicaid lived in states that do not cover abortion, totaling 7.5 million women, including 3.5 million below the poverty level. Women of color, especially Black and Hispanic women, are more likely to be insured by Medicaid. Additionally, 25 states prohibit abortion coverage in private insurance plans. Restrictions on abortion coverage disproportionately impact low-income women, women of color, immigrant women, and young women, hindering their access to resources and services for preventing unintended pregnancies or carrying a healthy pregnancy to term. This interference with personal decision-making and constitutionally protected rights is detailed in reports by the Center for Reproductive Rights, Center for American Progress, and Guttmacher Institute. \"Abortion coverage and care must be provided regardless of income or insurance source.\" The Federal Government is mandated to ensure abortion coverage in public health insurance programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and CHIP, as well as for its employees and beneficiaries. It must also make abortion care available in its own facilities or through contracted medical care providers. Additionally, federal restrictions are prohibited on private insurance coverage of abortion care. Federal restrictions prohibit the Federal Government from limiting insurance coverage of abortion care by State or local government or private health plans. State and local governments are also restricted from limiting insurance coverage of abortion care by private health plans. The Congress believes that the Federal Government should set an example by ensuring coverage of abortion care and that restrictions on coverage in the private insurance market should be eliminated. This Act does not affect laws that provide more protections for abortion coverage. If any part of the Act is deemed invalid, it will not affect the parts that can still be enforced."
