The curr_chunk discusses the role of the owner or operator of a publicly owned treatment works in assessing and communicating sewer overflow dangers, as well as defining terms like 'feasible' and 'timely'. States can request approval for their notification programs from the Administrator after regulations are promulgated. States can request approval for their notification programs from the Administrator if they can show that the program is substantially equivalent to the requirements of the regulations. If approved, the State can carry out their program instead of following the specified requirements. When reviewing a State notification program for substantial equivalency, the Administrator considers factors such as the scope of sewer overflows requiring notification, the time frame for notification, the entities to be notified, enforcement activities for ensuring notifications, and other relevant factors. The Administrator considers various factors when reviewing a State notification program for substantial equivalency, including the scope of sewer overflows, notification time frames, entities to be notified, and enforcement activities. If a State submits evidence for a notification program within 30 days of regulations promulgation, certain requirements will not apply until the Administrator completes a review. The Administrator may withdraw authorization of a State notification program if it is not being administered correctly. If corrective action is not taken within 90 days, the Administrator will enforce specific requirements for the State. Special rules apply after the promulgation of regulations. Beginning on the date of promulgation of regulations, the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (2) shall apply to publicly owned treatment works and supersede any less stringent notification requirements in permits until a new permit is issued, renewed, or modified.
