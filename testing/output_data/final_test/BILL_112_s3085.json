The enterprises are developing alternative methods for property valuation to eliminate costs for borrowers and lenders. If a junior lien holder fails to resubordinate the lien, refinancing into a new mortgage through the Program may be prevented. The holder of a junior lien may be liable for 5.0 percent of the first mortgage balance when refinancing into a new mortgage through the Program, unless certain conditions are met. These conditions include restrictions on increasing the mortgage payment or balance, using an adjustable rate mortgage, violating the due-on-sale clause, or putting the junior lien at risk of bankruptcy strip down. The FHFA may add exceptions to restrictions on junior lien holders when refinancing, based on increased risk. Enterprises must review documentation from lenders for eligibility. The FHFA may impose fines on junior lien holders who fail to resubordinate their lien, preventing refinancing. The fine can be recouped and applied to the borrower's first mortgage. Junior lien holders can avoid liability by agreeing to resubordinate within 30 days of notification. If a mortgage insurer fails to transfer coverage for a refinanced mortgage through the Program, they may be liable for 5.0 percent of the first mortgage balance unless certain conditions are met. Upon submission of documentation by a qualified lender or eligible borrower, the enterprise will charge the mortgage insurer a fine if they prevent the refinance of an eligible mortgage through the Program. The fine will be applied to the borrower's first mortgage balance. The mortgage insurer will not be liable for the fine if certain conditions are met within 30 days of the enterprise's determination. The enterprises are not allowed to prevent the refinancing of an eligible mortgage, and mortgage insurers must transfer coverage accordingly.
