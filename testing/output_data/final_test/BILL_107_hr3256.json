The National Center for Military Deployment Health Research is established within the Department of Health and Human Services. It conducts research on deployment-related health issues for members of the Armed Forces, veterans, and their families. The Center serves as the national coordination center for both private and public research on these issues. The National Center for Military Deployment Health Research focuses on issues related to injuries, diseases, disorders, and health conditions of Armed Forces members arising during deployment from combat, training, infectious diseases, and environmental exposures. It also addresses conditions emerging during or after deployment, including diagnosable conditions, medically unexplained symptoms, impacts on quality of life, family effects, and sequelae of combat injuries. Additionally, it covers conditions resulting from pre-deployment inoculations for protection during deployment. SEC. 102. FUNCTIONS. The Center's functions include developing a research plan, conducting research, creating policies, evaluating research results, and making policy recommendations related to deployment-related health issues for members of the Armed Forces, veterans, and their families. The Center for deployment-related health issues conducts research, sets priorities, synthesizes research for policy recommendations, reviews longitudinal monitoring data, facilitates national data resources for research, and communicates research results to the medical community and individuals with deployment-related health issues. The Center for deployment-related health issues conducts research, sets priorities, synthesizes research for policy recommendations, reviews longitudinal monitoring data, facilitates national data resources for research, and communicates research results to the medical community and individuals with deployment-related health issues. The Director of the Center consults closely with the Advisory Committee on Military Deployment Health Research on all aspects of the Center's activities. The text chunk \"SEC. 103. RESEARCH NETWORK.\" is a concise summary of the previous paragraph which discusses the activities of the Center for deployment-related health issues and its collaboration with the Advisory Committee on Military Deployment Health Research. The Center coordinates and conducts research on deployment-related health issues for members of the Armed Forces, veterans, and their families. This includes activities with other federal departments, maintaining an inventory of research programs, and consulting with federally sponsored researchers. The Center conducts broad-based research on deployment-related health issues, including making grants for research and soliciting proposals from federal agencies, universities, and research entities. It also awards contracts for research. The Center awards contracts for research and aims to establish a network of research sites at academic medical centers and other appropriate sources. Core research principles include scientific peer-review, dissemination of results, and collaboration with other agencies and academic institutions. SEC. 104. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The Center shall have an Advisory Committee on Military Deployment Health Research consisting of 21 members advising the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Center Director. Members are appointed by the President and the Secretary of Veterans, with qualifications in research fields and representation of veterans and the general public. The Advisory Committee on Military Deployment Health Research consists of 21 members appointed by the President and Secretaries of Veterans, Defense, and Health and Human Services. An independent scientific entity recommends candidates for appointments, with each member serving specific terms. The Advisory Committee members serve for three-year terms, with initial appointments staggered between one and two years. They receive pay at the rate of basic pay for level V of the Executive Schedule for each day engaged in committee functions. Members of the Advisory Committee appointed under subsection (b) receive no additional compensation. They are allowed travel expenses while away from home for committee services. The President designates a chair for the committee, and meetings are called by the chair or majority of members. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to the Advisory Committee. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must provide an annual report to Congress on the Center's activities, including a description of the previous year's activities and a detailed budget proposal for the next fiscal year. The President's budget must separately outline amounts requested for the Center's activities and research. Centers for research on post-deployment illnesses in the Department of Veterans Affairs are established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must provide an annual report to Congress on the Center's activities, including a description of the previous year's activities and a detailed budget proposal for the next fiscal year. The President's budget must separately outline amounts requested for the Center's activities and research. Centers for research on post-deployment illnesses in the Department of Veterans Affairs are established, known as 'National Centers for Military Post-Deployment Illness Research', focusing on studying health conditions related to military deployment missions. The Secretary designates up to 25 centers for research on post-deployment illnesses, ensuring geographic diversity. Research conducted by these centers is compiled and transmitted to a coordinating center. The Secretary designates up to 25 research centers in various US regions. The centers must meet high scientific and clinical standards and have arrangements with accredited medical schools for post-deployment education and training. The curr_chunk discusses the key components of a research center affiliated with an accredited medical school for post-deployment education and training. This includes arrangements for nursing and allied health personnel training, attracting scientists for research efforts, and a policymaking advisory committee for policy matters. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a panel to assess proposals for new research centers focused on post-deployment illnesses. The panel consists of experts in research, education, and clinical care, who review and provide feedback on the scientific and clinical merit of each proposal. The panel evaluates proposals for new research centers on post-deployment illnesses, assessing scientific and clinical merit. Funding is allocated by the Under Secretary for Health, with priority given to activities of clinical and scientific investigation at these centers. The Under Secretary for Health allocates funding for research projects on post-deployment illnesses, with priority given to activities at research centers. A new item is added to the table of sections in the relevant chapter. Centers for research on post-deployment illnesses are allocated funding by the Under Secretary for Health, with priority given to activities at research centers."
