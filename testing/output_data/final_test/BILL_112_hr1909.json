According to the Congress, over 60 million low- and moderate-income consumers in America are unbanked, underbanked, or underserved. Certain racial and ethnic groups, such as Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indian/Alaskans, are more likely to be unbanked or underbanked compared to the population as a whole. Minorities like Blacks, American Indian/Alaskans, and Hispanics are more likely to be underbanked, while Asians and Whites are less likely. Households with income under $30,000 make up 71% of unbanked households, with nearly 20% of lower-income households not having a bank account. As income increases, the percentage of unbanked households decreases significantly. Households with yearly income of $75,000 or higher are unbanked due to lack of access to affordable banking products and services, hindering economic advancement for low- and moderate-income consumers and communities. The purpose of this Act is to establish a market for underbanked and unbanked individuals to access financial services. The Act aims to establish a Federal Financial Services and Credit Company to provide financial services to underbanked and unbanked individuals. The Comptroller of the Currency is responsible for organizing and regulating Federal Financial Services and Credit Companies (FFSCCs) to provide credit alternatives to the underbanked. Companies seeking an FFSCC charter must have a history of serving underbanked individuals with financial products. The Comptroller of the Currency regulates Federal Financial Services and Credit Companies (FFSCCs) offering various services to consumers and small businesses, including credit extension, reloadable stored value cards, ancillary financial services, and short-term consumer credit services. Individuals involved in the company must not have been convicted of a felony within ten years. The company must not have any controlling person associated with someone convicted of a felony within ten years of the charter application date. The company must submit a business plan that reflects sound financial principles and realistic risk assessments for serving underbanked and unbanked populations. The plan should demonstrate overall management ability, especially in providing financial services to these populations. The company must have senior management familiar with consumer credit laws and regulations, and competent management with experience in designing financial services for the underbanked and unbanked population. Requirements placed on FFSCCs include providing clear and prominent statements in loan agreements for short-term and long-term credit extensions, disclosing the true cost of the loan in terms of an actual finance charge per dollar of credit extended, instead of the annual percentage rate disclosure required under the Truth in Lending Act. Each FFSCC must disclose the finance charge as an annual percentage rate, provide continuous account access, implement financial literacy programs, and offer at least three financial products to underbanked individuals. Each FFSCC must have a primary mission of providing financial services to underbanked, unbanked, and consumers with low credit scores, offer access to credit products, file necessary documents with the Comptroller of the Currency, and submit a detailed business plan for approval. The FFSCC must demonstrate knowledge of challenges faced by unbanked and underbanked individuals in accessing financial credit. It has the authority to offer financial products authorized by the Comptroller of the Currency and may be fined or imprisoned for violations. The Comptroller can authorize State attorney generals to enforce violations. The Currency Act allows State attorney generals to enforce violations, FFSCCs must pay an annual fee to the Comptroller of the Currency, State laws are preempted if discriminatory towards FFSCCs, and the Comptroller drafts model forms for FFSCCs to use. The Comptroller of the Currency will conduct a study on credit rates and terms, and develop financial products for FFSCCs to offer underbanked individuals with transparent fees and economically viable terms. For the purposes of this Act, the term \"company\" includes the entity applying for an FFSCC charter, any wholly owned subsidiary of the entity applying, and any other entity affiliated with the applying entity. The term \"consumer\" refers to the definition in the Truth in Lending Act, \"insured credit union\" and \"insured depository institution\" have meanings as defined in specific acts. The term \"depository institution\" is defined under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. \"Long-term credit\" refers to credit with a term of one year or more, while \"short-term credit\" has a term of less than one year. A \"small business\" is defined as a company with up to 500 employees. An \"underbanked\" individual or small business has a deposit account with an insured depository institution or credit union but limited access to non-depository services. The Comptroller of the Currency may issue regulations to define terms necessary for the Act, including \"underbanked person\" as someone with limited access to non-depository services."
