    "content": "Agricultural products are promoted through generic promotion programs funded by assessments collected from producers. Some producers have challenged the use of generic advertisements in court, leading to conflicting Supreme Court decisions. Lower courts have struggled with determining the level of scrutiny for check-off programs, but appellate courts have consistently rejected the government's arguments. The appellate courts consistently rejected the government's argument that check-off programs were \"government speech\" immune from First Amendment scrutiny. In Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association, the Supreme Court upheld the check-off program on \"government speech\" grounds, setting a precedent for future defense against First Amendment challenges. The report discusses check-off programs and First Amendment principles argued in related cases. It analyzes challenges reaching the Supreme Court and subsequent appellate court decisions. The report also examines Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association and its implications for check-off programs established by industries themselves under USDA oversight. The oversight of farm product check-off programs is provided by the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, with some debate over the extent of USDA's control. These programs aim to boost domestic demand and expand foreign markets for commodities. The Secretary of Agriculture appoints a board or council to manage the program, funded by assessments on product sales, production, or imports. The collected funds from farm product check-off programs finance various programs such as advertising, consumer education, and market research. The Secretary of Agriculture must approve promotional projects before implementation, with considerations for First Amendment rights regarding government regulation of speech. Courts consider the context and purpose of speech, allowing greater government regulation for some types. Challenges to check-off programs are analyzed using doctrines like commercial speech, compelled speech, and government speech under First Amendment jurisprudence. Commercial speech, which involves proposing a commercial transaction or economic interests, can be regulated by the government, including banning false or misleading advertisements. Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission of New York addressed the constitutionality of governmental regulation of commercial speech. The Central Hudson test evaluates if the speech is protected by the First Amendment and if the government's interest in restricting it is substantial. The restriction must directly advance the governmental interest and not be more extensive than necessary. Determining if the speech is commercial allows for the application of the intermediate scrutiny test. Compelled speech under the First Amendment has been a point of contention in court cases. The First Amendment prohibits compelled speech, where individuals are forced to express views or subsidize speech they disagree with. Agricultural check-off cases are typically analyzed within this framework. Courts have referenced cases like Abood v. Detroit Board of Education and Keller v. State Bar of California, which dealt with compelled speech or subsidies. In Abood, non-union employees objected to paying fees that subsidized activities unrelated to the union's collective bargaining agreement. The Supreme Court ruled that unions could fund ideological activities with separate funds. The Supreme Court ruled in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education that unions could fund ideological activities with separate funds, not using compulsory dues for activities unrelated to collective bargaining. Similarly, in Keller v. State Bar of California, the Court held that compulsory dues could not be used for activities outside the Bar's goals. This led to the development of a \"germaneness\" test for compelled subsidy cases. Courts must distinguish between activities relevant to government purposes and those that are not, a challenging task acknowledged by the Abood and Keller courts. Government speech allows regulation of content when the government is the speaker or uses private entities to convey its message. As long as the government's actions align with legitimate goals, it can speak even if citizens disagree. The government can deliver content-oriented messages to promote policies or ideas, being accountable to the electorate for its advocacy. The \"government speech\" doctrine allows the government to control and be responsible for its advocacy, providing immunity to First Amendment scrutiny. Parties under check-off programs have challenged mandatory assessments as unconstitutional restraints on free speech. Opponents argue against being required to pay for advertisements they disagree with. The claimants, traditional dairy farmers, objected to subsidizing generic advertisements promoting milk as a fungible product due to their non-use of genetically engineered \"recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone.\" Challenges against the dairy check-off program have been successful under a \"compelled speech\" analysis, but recent Supreme Court rulings on \"government speech\" have raised questions about earlier case law. In a similar case, producers of California tree fruits challenged the constitutionality of a USDA marketing order. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of USDA marketing orders that required assessments from fruit growers for generic advertising, citing them as a form of economic regulation promoting collective marketing. The Supreme Court upheld USDA marketing orders requiring assessments for generic advertising, citing them as promoting collective marketing. The Court found the orders did not restrict freedom of speech, compel endorsement of views, or fund political activities, leading to a constitutionality ruling based on the germaneness of advertising to marketing purposes and non-use of assessments for political or ideological activities. The Court also rejected the argument for heightened scrutiny typically applied in commercial speech cases. The Supreme Court upheld USDA marketing orders for generic advertising assessments, stating they did not violate the First Amendment. The Court found that the assessments did not restrict free speech and were part of economic regulation, deserving the same presumption of validity as other policy judgments made by Congress. In United States v. United Foods, the Supreme Court found that mandatory assessments for the mushroom check-off program violated the First Amendment. The Court determined that producers were required to subsidize speech they disagreed with, leading to the program being declared unconstitutional. The Court found that the mushroom check-off program's mandated support violated First Amendment principles, as it required producers to subsidize advertising they disagreed with. This differed from the regulatory scheme in Glickman, where assessments were ancillary to a broader program. The Court departed from the precedent set by Glickman and emphasized that the compelled support conflicted with First Amendment principles. The United Foods Court struck down the mandatory assessments for the mushroom check-off program, ruling that the compelled contributions were not related to an independent purpose and only served as an advertising scheme. The Court rejected government speech arguments and the Mushroom Council has since administered the check-off. The Mushroom Council reduced mandatory assessments for the check-off program and redirected funds to non-promotional activities like research on mushrooms' health benefits. Challenges to the constitutionality of beef, dairy, and pork check-off programs have been successful at the appellate level, with courts rejecting the government's argument of \"government speech.\" The courts found insufficient government control over the programs to support the government speech doctrine. The appellate courts found the beef, dairy, and pork check-off programs unconstitutional, similar to the United Foods case. The Supreme Court heard arguments in Livestock Marketing Ass'n v. Dep't of Agriculture regarding the beef check-off program's constitutionality and delayed decisions on the pork and dairy cases until after the beef case was decided. The Court released its opinion in May 2005. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the beef check-off program in a 6-3 opinion, ruling that it funds the government's own speech and is not subject to a First Amendment compelled-subsidy challenge. The Court vacated the Eighth Circuit's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the beef check-off program, stating that it funds the government's own speech and is not subject to a First Amendment compelled-subsidy challenge. The Court rejected the argument that the program was not government speech, finding that the promotional campaigns were effectively controlled by the Federal Government. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the beef check-off program, stating that it funds the government's own speech and is not subject to a First Amendment compelled-subsidy challenge. The Court found that the promotional campaigns were effectively controlled by the Federal Government, dismissing the argument that the program needed to be funded by general revenues to qualify as \"government speech.\" The Court upheld the constitutionality of the beef check-off program as \"government speech,\" stating that funding it does not violate the First Amendment. The program's political safeguards ensure separation from private interests, and objections to the message are considered compelled speech, not subsidy. The Court suggested a compelled speech claim could arise if objectionable ads were attributed to a party. The dissent argued that generic beef advertisements should not be considered government speech as the statute does not require the government to disclose itself as the sponsor. They believe that if the government wants to compel specific groups to fund speech, it must make itself politically accountable. The dissent suggested that the case should have been decided in line with United Foods, rather than upholding the beef check-off program on the \"government speech\" doctrine. The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the beef check-off program as \"government speech\" will have significant implications for similar programs, strengthening their constitutionality and Congress's ability to support agricultural products. This ruling will defend check-off programs from First Amendment challenges, clarify confusion from previous cases, and guide future legislation. Lower courts can now classify check-off programs as government speech, avoiding the need for commercial speech tests. The Supreme Court's decision in the Johanns case established a precedent that check-off programs may be immune from First Amendment scrutiny. The ruling questioned earlier appellate court decisions and vacated those that invalidated federal dairy, pork, and beef check-off programs. The decision clarified the constitutionality of such programs as government speech, avoiding the need for commercial speech tests. The Supreme Court's decision in the Johanns case established that check-off programs, including the beef check-off program, may be considered constitutional \"government speech.\" Opponents may try to reformulate their arguments, such as using an \"as-applied\" challenge, as suggested by the Court in the Ninth Circuit case Charter v. U.S. Dep't of Agriculture. The USDA is studying the impact of the beef check-off decision on other First Amendment challenges to check-off programs. Some believe the decision could prompt Congress to reconsider the authority and purposes of check-off programs to address concerns raised by parties and courts. This may include exempting certain producers from mandatory assessments for generic advertising. Congress may consider revising commodity promotion laws to exempt producers of 100% organic products. They may also reevaluate the requirement for advertisements to clearly indicate government sponsorship, as highlighted in dissenting opinions. Justice Ginsburg and experts suggest clarifying the speaker's identity in check-off programs to align with other government-sponsored messages like the \"Food Pyramid.\" The recent federal Dietary Guidelines promote greater consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy, while check-off programs encourage more consumption of both low-fat and high-fat beef, pork, and dairy products. This inconsistency could lead to consumer confusion and prompt the USDA to supervise check-offs more closely. Some programs may continue operating as usual, while others may return to their previous practices. The mushroom check-off program may revert to pre-United Foods practices, imposing mandatory assessments for generic promotion campaigns. The ruling is expected to bring more attention to the operation of check-off programs."
