    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Department of Energy Carbon Capture and Storage Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2007.\" It establishes a program for research, development, and demonstration of carbon capture and storage technologies. Section 963 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include storage research, development, and demonstration related to energy systems. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include large-scale testing of carbon sequestration systems in various geological formations to assess cost and feasibility. The Secretary is tasked with conducting research and development on carbon capture and storage technologies, including laboratory experiments and simulations to improve performance. The Secretary will integrate fundamental research into energy technology development and carbon sequestration field testing activities, including developing new carbon dioxide capture technologies, modeling geological sequestration demonstrations, and assessing risks at specific field sites. Additionally, the Secretary will promote field validation testing activities. The Secretary will promote regional carbon sequestration partnerships for geologic sequestration tests involving carbon dioxide injection in various geological settings. This includes operating oil and gas fields, depleted fields, unmineable coal seams, saline formations, and deep geologic systems for extracting heat from geothermal resources. The objectives of tests conducted under this paragraph include developing and validating geophysical tools for monitoring carbon dioxide containment, validating geological formations modeling, refining storage capacity estimates, determining carbon dioxide fate post-injection, and implementing best practices for operations. The Secretary shall ensure the safety of operations related to geological storage of carbon dioxide and promulgate policies for large-scale testing and deployment activities funded by the Department of Energy. The Secretary will conduct at least 7 large-volume sequestration tests for geological containment of carbon dioxide to validate commercial deployment feasibility. Various geological formations across the US will be studied, with characterization and modeling required. In competitive awards for research and development activities, preference is given to partnerships among industrial, academic, and government entities. Cost-sharing is required for these activities. Authorization of appropriations includes $90,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, $105,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, and $120,000,000 for fiscal year 2009."
