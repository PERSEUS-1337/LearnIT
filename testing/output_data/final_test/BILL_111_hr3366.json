    "content": "The Act titled \"Illegal Garnishment Prevention Act\" prohibits the use of funds to promote direct deposit of veterans and social security benefits until protection from attachment or garnishment is assured. The Act prohibits direct deposit promotion until protection from attachment or garnishment is assured for Veterans and Social Security benefits, ensuring minimum subsistence for veterans, elderly, and disabled. Social Security benefits are a vital income source for many recipients, with over 20 percent relying solely on these benefits. Financial institutions are garnishing accounts to recover debts, leaving some temporarily destitute when access to their funds is frozen. Despite lacking protections, the Treasury is promoting direct deposit for Veterans and Social Security benefits recipients. No funds can be used to promote direct deposit for Social Security or Veterans benefits until procedures are in place to protect the benefits from garnishment. An Advisory Committee named \"Social Security Benefits Protection from Attachment or Garnishment Advisory Committee\" with 7 members has been established to advise the Secretary of the Treasury on procedures ensuring adequate safeguards. The Advisory Committee on Social Security Benefits Protection from Attachment or Garnishment, consisting of 7 members including the Ranking Member of the Committee on Finance, the Chair of the Special Committee on Aging, and the Ranking Member of the Special Committee on Aging of the Senate, will review and advise the Secretary of the Treasury on procedures to protect Social Security benefits from attachment and garnishment. Meetings will be established by the Secretary of the Treasury for this purpose. Title II of the Social Security Act is protected from attachment and garnishment. The Committee overseeing this is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act."
