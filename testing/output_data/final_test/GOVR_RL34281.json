    "content": "Federal judges have expressed concern about the decline in their real salary level, with Chief Justice Roberts calling it a \"constitutional crisis.\" District court judges currently earn $169,300 and court of appeals judges earn $179,500. The median salaries for judges have decreased since 1991, with district judges earning $185,170 and court of appeals judges earning $196,419 in real terms. Four bills in the 110th Congress aim to increase federal judges' salary levels. One bill proposes a 1.7% adjustment, while the other three suggest larger increases of 16.5%, 28.7%, and 28.7% respectively. These bills also include provisions for annual cost-of-living adjustments and changes to retirement qualifications. H.R. 3753 and S. 1638 propose reducing annuity for retired federal judges with earned income exceeding annuity value. An annuity reduction of $1 for every $2 in excess income, capped at 67%, is suggested. Judges in senior status must work equivalent to an active judge for four months annually. S. 1638 limits seminar-related travel reimbursement to $2,000 per trip and $20,000 per year, with exceptions for approved events. Acceptance of honorary memberships valued over $50 annually is prohibited. The report reviews arguments for and against raising federal judicial salaries, analyzes data on the impact of pay levels on recruitment and retention of judges from 1955 to 2006, and explores options for Congress to address the judicial pay issue beyond salary increases. The report discusses options for increasing judicial salaries, including \"de-linking\" congressional and judicial salaries, adjusting salaries based on cost of living, revising retirement benefits, and changing outside income limits. It compares three bills proposing a substantial pay increase for judges to 1969 salary levels. Congress can raise but not lower judicial salaries due to constitutional restrictions. Real judicial salaries for district court judges decreased by 21.5% from 1969 to 2006. The real compensation of the average wage earner has grown 18.5% since 1991, with federal workers' salaries increasing by 15.1%. Judicial salaries have lost 24% of their purchasing power since 1969, which goes against Constitutional provisions. The lag in judicial salaries has raised concerns about the quality of American jurisprudence. Various professional organizations and the current administration support increasing federal judges' salaries. The majority of opinions favor a pay raise for federal judges. The debate over increasing federal judges' pay is divisive among judges, policymakers, and professional organizations. Low judicial salaries are causing recruitment and retention issues in the judiciary, leading to judges opting for retirement over senior status. Abner Mikva, a former judge and White House counsel, chose retirement to pursue more lucrative opportunities after leaving his judicial position. Abner Mikva, a former judge and White House counsel, left his judicial position for a more lucrative opportunity at JAMS, a dispute-resolution firm. He believes that inadequate judicial pay limits attracting qualified judges to the bench, as lawyers at the peak of their earning power in the private sector are reluctant to take on lower-paying judicial roles. Opponents argue that federal judges' salaries are already high compared to the average American household income, with district court judges at the 90th to 95th percentile and appeals court judges and Supreme Court justices above the 95th percentile. This high salary level is a key point in the debate over raising judicial salaries. Opponents argue that federal judges' salaries are already high compared to the average American household income. Some believe that the perks of being a federal judge compensate for any shortcomings in salary. Raising judicial salaries may not attract commercial lawyers to judgeships, according to Judge Richard Posner. Opponents argue that federal judges' salaries are already high compared to the average American household income. Advocates for raising judicial salaries contend that a significant increase is unlikely from Congress, leading to inflation eroding any raise. The debate over the necessity of a salary increase for federal judges revolves around the potential consequences of low salaries, such as difficulties in recruiting talented candidates from private practice and judges leaving before retirement. Increasing turnover in the federal judiciary as judges leave for private practice before retirement, depriving the judiciary of manpower and expertise. Limited evidence exists on how fluctuations in judicial salary impact recruitment and retention patterns. This report aims to evaluate the effects of salary changes on the judiciary's ability to attract a diverse pool of professionals. The declining earning power of federal judges affects recruitment from private practice, leading to a judiciary populated by those from other government ranks. This shift may result in a bench comprised only of the independently wealthy or those seeking a salary boost. Justice Stephen Breyer has highlighted concerns about the impact of low judicial salaries on the diversity of the legal profession within the federal judiciary. Justice Stephen Breyer expressed concerns about the diminishing diversity in the federal judiciary due to low judicial salaries, emphasizing the importance of a varied background for federal judges. In Figure 1, Justice Breyer's indicator shows the occupations of federal district court judges before their appointments. The proportion of judges from private practice has decreased since Eisenhower's time but is similar to Roosevelt and Truman's administrations. Eisenhower's administration stood out for appointing 65.1% of federal judges from private practice, a trend not seen since. Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Clinton, and Bush appointed fewer than 40% of federal district judges. Since 1933, the percentage of federal judges appointed directly from private practice by Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Clinton, and Bush has been fewer than 40%. The proportion of district court judges appointed by President George W. Bush who were already judges is significantly higher compared to those appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Only Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush have appointed a smaller percentage of district court judges from the judiciary than their immediate predecessors. There is no clear relationship between judicial salary and the prior positions of federal district court judges. Since 1933, the real salaries of federal judges have fluctuated. During the Reagan Administration (1981-1988), salaries were below the median, leading to a decrease in judges appointed from another judgeship. In contrast, during the Nixon/Ford Administrations (1969-1976), salaries were mostly above the median. During this period, federal judges' real salaries were above the 1955-2006 median, with 51.4% appointed from private practice, the second-highest within 1933-2006. Lower judicial salaries may result in more judges from another judgeship. Judges concerned about salary could resign for higher compensation or retire with a fixed annuity. Federal judges may opt for a fixed annuity equal to their salary upon retirement instead of senior status for cost-of-living adjustments. Justice Samuel Alito highlighted that many judges resign to seek higher-paying opportunities, with some joining arbitration/mediation firms or entering private law practice for increased earnings. Five judges left their positions on the federal judiciary for higher-paying opportunities, including roles in private law practice, corporate in-house counsel, state judicial appointments, quasi-governmental positions, higher education, and the executive branch of government. The relationship between judicial salary and early departures could indicate the need to increase federal judges' salaries for greater stability in the judiciary. In the past 53 years, there have been significant changes to the retirement system for federal judges, including the option of taking senior status at a certain age and years of service. This allows judges to retain their office but retire from active service while still receiving their salary. The 1954 legislation allowed judges to retire with salary if they were 70 years old and had served for at least 10 years. In 1984, Congress replaced age and service thresholds with the Rule of 80, allowing judges at least 65 years old to take senior status. In 1984, Congress replaced age and service thresholds with the Rule of 80, allowing judges at least 65 years old to take senior status. Judges in senior status must handle 25% of an active judge's caseload or serve in an administrative capacity. Federal judges may retire or take senior status when they are at least 65 years old and their age and years of service in Article III judgeships add up to at least 80 (the Rule of 80). Unlike pension plans, judicial retirement is all-or-nothing, with no partial vesting of retirement benefits. Federal judges must meet age and years of service requirements to qualify for judicial retirement. If judicial salary decreases, more judges may resign or retire rather than take senior status. Judicial retirement is all-or-nothing, with no partial vesting of benefits. Federal judges have options to leave active service, including resigning or retiring. Resigning judges may sacrifice judicial retirement benefits for alternative employment. Analysis of judicial departures post-1984 legislation changes can help evaluate the relationship between departures and salary. Since 1985, the percentage of federal judges resigning and forgoing judicial retirement benefits has fluctuated. In the first 16 years after 1985, the percentage of resigning judges decreased while real judicial salary increased. Between 2001 and 2004, 6.4% of federal judges resigned as real judicial salary rose slightly. In 2005 and 2006, 7.9% of federal judges resigned. In 2005 and 2006, 7.9% of federal judges who left active status did so by resigning. The decision to resign is influenced by factors such as compensation and eligibility for judicial retirement benefits. Federal judges who do not qualify for retirement benefits may choose to resign and seek alternative employment, while those who meet the requirements for retirement can opt to retire or take senior status. Between 1985 and 2007, the percentage of federal district court judges opting for retirement instead of senior status decreased steadily. Only judges on senior status receive cost-of-living adjustments and raises approved by Congress. Between 1985 and 2007, the percentage of federal district court judges opting for retirement instead of senior status decreased steadily, with only 29 judges choosing retirement compared to 695 who took senior status. The data suggests a correlation between judicial salary and the departure decisions of federal judges, with retirement rates being lower in the 2001-2004 and 2005-2007 periods compared to the 1997-2000 period. The data suggests weak correlations between judicial salary levels and the pool of candidates for federal judges. Changes in district court judges' prior positions appear independent of salary influences on retirement or resignation trends. Changes in district court judges' prior positions seem unrelated to fluctuations in judicial salary. The decline in private practice as a prior occupation dates back to the Eisenhower administration, while the increase in service as a judge as a prior occupation dates back to the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. Establishing a correlation between judicial salary and early departures of judges requires more convincing data. The proportion of judges resigning declined in every four-year period between 1985. The proportion of judges resigning declined between 1985 and 2000, with a possible inverse relationship between judicial salary and resignations. However, this pattern did not hold for the 1997-2006 period, where resignations varied despite little fluctuation in salaries. The percentage of judges opting to retire rather than take senior status also declined between 1985 and 2007. The percentage of judges retiring rather than taking senior status declined between 1985 and 2007, despite fluctuations in judicial salary. Claims linking judicial salary to retirements or resignations require more conclusive evidence, as correlations may be influenced by other factors. The changing nature of the appointment process, with longer confirmation times, may deter potential candidates for federal judgeships. President Bush noted that the nomination and confirmation process may impact who serves in the federal judiciary. Some potential candidates for federal judgeships may decline nominations due to the ugliness, uncertainty, and delay in the confirmation process. Concerns about putting their law practices on hold, the impact on their families, and the risk of having their reputation dragged through the mud lead them to remove themselves from consideration. This decision not only deprives America of fair and impartial judges but may also be influenced by job satisfaction and caseload levels. Several studies suggest that judges with higher caseloads are more likely to resign, possibly due to increased workload and stress. Other factors such as personal security, collegiality, and job satisfaction also play a role in judges' decisions to stay or leave the bench. Real salaries for district court judges have declined significantly over the years, which may also impact retention rates in the federal judiciary. Federal judges may perceive their salaries falling behind despite actual dollar figures showing an increase. This perception could impact who becomes a judge, how long they stay, and the quality of their work. While statistical analysis may not show a strong effect of salary on career decisions, the morale of the judiciary could be affected by the perception of judges leaving due to lower salaries. Some former federal judges cite salary as a reason for departure, despite statistical analysis not showing a strong effect on career decisions. Advocates for higher judicial salary argue that its role in career considerations may grow. The departures of federal judges are increasing significantly, raising concerns about the impact on the judiciary's morale and quality of work. Congress needs to understand the fluctuations in judicial salary to address this issue effectively. Understanding the fluctuations in judicial salary over time is crucial for addressing the issue of judicial salary. Choosing an appropriate time frame for evaluation, such as considering changes in non-salary benefits like retirement packages, can provide valuable insights. Comparing judicial salary within specific eras defined by retirement benefits may be more useful than comparing across different time periods. The 1984 and 1989 legislation impacted federal judges' retirement options and salary adjustments. The Rule of 80 made it easier for judges to qualify for senior status or retirement, potentially increasing the attractiveness of judgeships. The 1989 legislation made senior status more appealing by allowing salary adjustments for judges in that status. However, it also required judges to meet a certain work level to remain in senior status, possibly prompting some judges to retire instead. The Judicial Conference and federal judges support addressing judicial salary concerns. In 1969, federal judges saw a significant salary increase to $40,000 from $30,000, the highest real salary for judges since 1913. Comparisons using 1969 as a baseline are favored by the Judicial Conference and federal judges. This baseline helps assess changes in judicial salaries relative to other professions. Comparing patterns in departure from the bench across different time periods may be misleading due to changing meanings of \"retire\" and \"resign.\" Judicial salaries have varied considerably since 1955, with the lowest real values occurring in 1986 and the highest in 1969. Current salaries are closer to the minimum real values, but not far from the median values for district and court of appeals judges. The median real salary for district court judges between 1955 and 2006 is $167,047, with the 2006 salary at $165,200. Congress has options beyond just increasing judicial salaries, such as restructuring salary and benefits, like location-based pay or retirement benefits. The Judicial Conference is requesting an increase in federal judges' salaries, with Justice Breyer emphasizing the importance of maintaining compensation levels. Congress has options beyond salary increases, such as restructuring benefits and retirement plans. Federal judges' salaries have been compared to those of lawyers in private practice, heads of non-profit corporations, judges in other countries, and law school professors and deans. Comparing salaries across professions may be problematic as federal judges come from various backgrounds including private practice, legal academia, state judiciaries, and government positions. Such comparisons may not fully account for the compensation federal judgeships offer. In 1969, the dean of Harvard Law School made $40,000, close to the salaries of U.S. district court judges and U.S. court of appeals judges. Today, deans of \"top\" law schools earn $430,000, 95.7% more than in 1969. Senior professors at Harvard Law School earned $28,000 in 1969, while senior professors at \"top\" law schools now earn $330,000, 114.6% more. District court judges earn $165,200, 21.5% less than in 1969, and judges on the U.S. courts of appeals earn $175,100, 21.1% less. Federal judges on the U.S. courts of appeals earn $175,100, 21.1% less than in 1969. They have job security, diverse workload, and prestige similar to law professors. However, law professors may have more freedom in setting schedules and choosing work. Law professors may earn additional salary as consultants, while federal judges may have more generous retirement benefits. Federal judges are limited in outside earned income, with a cap set at 15% of the annual base pay rate for Level II of the Executive Schedule. In contrast to law professors who can negotiate salaries in a competitive market, federal judges do not have the same opportunity for salary increases based on performance. Both legal academia and the judiciary compete for qualified individuals in the broader legal services market. The salaries of federal judges are not compared to state judges, who have varying workloads, salaries, and job security. State judges must often win elections to keep their positions. The average salary for state court associate justices in 2006 was $140,150, compared to $38,152 in 1976 ($135,175 in 2006 dollars). The average annual real salary of associate justices of state supreme courts rose 3.7% between 1976 and 2006, reaching $38,152 in 1976 ($135,175 in 2006 dollars). Federal district court judges saw a 6.0% increase in their annual salary during the same period, from $155,895 to $165,200 in real dollars. Comparisons to other professions or positions in legal services show the potential salaries federal district court judges could have received if their salaries had grown at a similar rate between 1969 and 2006. The salaries of various professions have increased in real terms since 1969, with some groups experiencing modest increases while others, like law partners and the legal academy, seeing more significant growth. However, federal district court judges are the only group where real salaries declined from 1969 to 2006. There is a discussion about the relationship between the salaries of federal judges and Members of Congress, with the suggestion that they are linked in some way. The salaries of federal executive branch officials, federal justices, and judges are not required to be limited by the salaries of Members of Congress. Unlike adjustments to Executive Schedule and congressional salaries, adjustments to judicial salaries require affirmative action by Congress to be raised. The recommended 1.7% pay increase for federal judges in 2007 was not enacted by Congress. S. 197, which would provide the increase, passed the Senate but has not been acted upon by the House. The legislation is currently pending before the House Judiciary Committee. There is no statutory linkage between congressional and judicial salaries, but the recommended annual increase is the same for members of Congress, Executive Schedule employees, and federal judges. Salary adjustments for Members of Congress, the Vice President, EX employees, and federal judges are based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI) for private industry wages. The adjustments reflect the December-to-December change in the ECI, reduced by 0.5%. Judicial, congressional, and executive officials covered by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 have their salary adjustments restricted to not exceed the rate of adjustment for General Schedule (GS) employees. The annual recommended salary adjustment is the same for federal judges, Members of Congress, and EX employees, but the process for enacting the adjustment into law differs for each group. In 2007, Congress blocked salary increases for Members of Congress but not for EX employees, marking the first time since 1989 that these groups received different salaries. EX Level II employees received $168,000, while Members of Congress and district court judges did not receive an increase. In 2008, EX Level II employees, federal judges, and Members of Congress will receive a 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment to their 2007 salaries. EX Level II employees will have a 2008 salary of $172,200, while Members of Congress and district court judges will receive $169,300. The practice of providing these groups with the same salaries is known as \"pay parity,\" rather than being linked salaries. The rise of judicial salaries has slowed since being linked to Members of Congress' salaries. From 1955 to 1986, district court judges' real salaries fell by 14.5%, but from 1987 to 2006, salaries rose by 5.9%. Judicial salaries have actually increased more under pay parity compared to when not linked to congressional salaries. Between 1955 and 2006, judicial salaries fared better when equal to Members of Congress' salaries. The National Average Wage Index increased by 28% from 1955 to 1986 and by 16.6% from 1987 to 2006. Judicial salaries fell by about 1.4% per year relative to all wage earners from 1955 to 1986, and 0.7% per year after 1989. Congressional salaries have grown slower than federal judges' salaries since then. Since 1955, congressional salaries have decreased by 11.9% in real terms, but have increased by 0.3% per year since 1987. This increase is slightly less than the growth in judicial salaries, which have also risen by 0.3% per year. Ending the parity between congressional and judicial salaries could allow for different rates of increase. The primary argument against pay parity is that it holds back judicial salaries, as legislators have matched their salaries to those of US district judges and cabinet secretaries for 20 years. However, this linkage has not produced the anticipated benefits for legislators' salaries and has hindered salary increases for judges and executives. Some Members of Congress argue in favor of pay parity, believing their work is equal to that of federal district judges. Representative F. James Sensenbrenner argues for salary parity between federal district judges and Members of Congress, emphasizing the importance of comparable compensation for constitutional officers. The debate centers on whether the duties and responsibilities of judges warrant higher pay than legislators, with some suggesting that pay parity could lead to salary increases for Congress members. Since 1928, district judges' salaries have generally increased before those of Members of Congress. If Congress were to separate salary increases, judicial salaries might rise first, followed by congressional salaries. This could lead to Members of Congress considering their own salary increases as separate legislative items. Pay parity is a key aspect of the debate over federal judges' salaries, with the advantages and disadvantages needing consideration by Congress. The three pieces of legislation introduced in the 110th Congress, H.R. 3753, S. 1638, and S. 2353, would end the practice of parity between congressional and judicial salaries. Federal judges have been paid the same salaries since 1891, regardless of location, unlike General Schedule federal employees. Higher salaries for federal judges are argued to be necessary to recruit candidates for judgeships in certain areas. Federal judges in high-cost living areas may face challenges in recruiting candidates due to salary constraints. Justice Antonin Scalia highlighted this issue in a 2006 speech, suggesting that Congress should consider adjusting salaries based on regional cost of living. Before 1891, judges in different districts received varying salaries, indicating historical precedent for such actions. This approach is similar to the locality pay for General Schedule employees, which is determined by duty station. Locality pay for General Schedule employees is based on duty station, not residence, which may pose challenges for federal judges in choosing their chambers' locations. The judiciary has some flexibility in selecting where to work, with district judges being assigned locations within their district and circuit judges having more freedom. Granting locality pay to judges could lead to chambers being concentrated in specific areas within each district or circuit. For example, the Northern District of Illinois has Eastern and Western divisions, potentially affecting judges' chamber locations. If Congress were to adopt the same locality pay areas used by the Office of Personnel Management, judges in Chicago would be paid more than those in Rockford, potentially leading to judges relocating their chambers. Congress could address this by allocating judgeships within the divisions of each district, limiting where judges may place their chambers. Congress could consider specifying the location of chambers for judges within a district or circuit, offering equal pay to all judges in a district or circuit, and adopting a locality pay system that better reflects judicial boundaries. This could address concerns about judges relocating based on pay discrepancies and potentially attract more candidates for federal judgeships. The retirement provisions for federal judges are generous compared to other federal government positions, allowing judges to receive an annuity equal to their salary upon retirement. Senior status judges must handle a reduced caseload to remain on senior status. Federal judges receive generous retirement provisions, with an annuity equal to their salary upon retirement after just 10 years of service. These provisions were enacted to encourage judges to retire while still healthy, as any less generous offer might deter them from leaving the bench. Imposing a mandatory retirement age for federal judges would violate the Constitution. The current retirement provisions may be challenging for judges to attain before they are eligible. Judge Paul G. Cassell resigned from the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah in 2007, citing financial concerns in his resignation letter. He suggested that allowing federal judges to earn partial retirement after a certain period of service could address this issue. Currently, federal judges face challenges in attaining retirement benefits before they are eligible. H.R. 3753 proposes changes to judicial retirement, including a new \"Rule of 84\" for federal judges seeking senior status. This could potentially attract more candidates but may also lead to judges leaving mid-career for other opportunities. H.R. 3753 and S. 1638 introduce a new \"Rule of 84\" for federal judges' retirement, requiring their age and years of service to add up to 84. Judges who retire and work elsewhere will have their annuities reduced if their income exceeds the annuity, with a maximum reduction of 67%. Survivors of judges are entitled to a survivor's annuity under the Judicial Survivors' Annuities System (JSAS). Spouses, former spouses, and dependent children of judges are entitled to a survivor's annuity under the Judicial Survivors' Annuities System (JSAS) if the judge dies while in office or receiving retirement compensation. Judges contribute a percentage of their salary or retirement annuity to the JSAS, with survivors eligible for an annuity between 25% and 50% of the judge's average annual salary. Congress may consider revising the JSAS system by looking at survivor benefits available to other federal employees under FERS and CSRS. Federal employees under FERS do not elect to participate and do not pay any salary for survivor benefits. Federal judges covered by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 have limits on outside income, with a cap of $25,830 in 2008. They are also prohibited from receiving honoraria for speeches, appearances, or articles. Before 1989, federal judges had no restriction on outside earned income, which led to controversy and affected judicial nominations. The Code of Judicial Conduct now requires judges to report outside compensation and limits outside income to $25,830 for federal judges covered by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. Congress may consider altering limits on federal judges' outside income to encourage longer service and attract more individuals to the judiciary. Imposition of income restrictions in 1989 did not significantly impact judges' departure rates. The proportion of judges leaving active service by resignation was lower between 1989-1992 compared to 1985-1988. The retirement rate increased slightly to 5.41% from 4.95% after the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. S. 1638 proposes limits on seminar-related travel expenses for federal judges and prohibits acceptance of honorary memberships over $50 per year. It also extends regulations on outside earned income to U.S. Supreme Court justices. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 established the Citizens' Commission on Public Service and Compensation to recommend salary levels for Members of Congress, federal judges, and other officials. The commission, consisting of 11 private citizens, would meet every four years to suggest pay rates for various government positions. The President would review and transmit his own recommendations based on the commission's report and prevailing market values. The Citizens' Commission on Public Service and Compensation, established by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, was meant to recommend salary levels for federal employees, including judges. However, the commission has never met, leading to a lack of salary recommendations for Congress to consider. It is suggested that Congress convene the commission to guide discussions on federal employee salaries. The Citizens' Commission on Public Service and Compensation, created in 1989, was intended to provide regular salary recommendations to Congress for top government officials. However, the commission has not met, resulting in only four cost-of-living salary adjustments for officials since 1993. This has led to an average annual increase of only about one percent. Salary adjustments for top government officials have averaged only about one percent. Congress may consider changing how cost-of-living adjustments are made to judges' salaries, which currently require annual legislation for changes to take effect. Members of Congress' salaries increase automatically unless Congress intervenes to prevent it. Congress could potentially allow judges' salaries to increase automatically without the need for yearly legislation. Changing the law to allow judges' salaries to increase automatically without Congress authorization may lead to more frequent salary increases. However, if Congress continues pay parity between judicial and congressional salaries and occasionally rejects recommended adjustments, judicial salaries could fall relative to private-sector workers. Legislation such as H.R. 3753 and S. 1638 aim to raise judicial salaries annually based on General Schedule employee increases. This would automate the current process of cost-of-living adjustments for federal judges. Other bills like S. 197 and S. 2353 propose different salary increases for judges. H.R. 3753 and S. 1638 propose significant raises for federal judges, with the new salary levels being the highest since 1913. The Bush Administration supports raising judicial salaries, and S. 2353 provides immediate salary increases without changing compensation practices. H.R. 3753 and S. 1638 propose annual salary adjustments for federal judges based on General Schedule pay changes. They also increase workload requirements for judges in senior status and introduce a new retirement eligibility rule. S. 1638 introduces provisions for reducing retirement annuity for judges who earn income after retirement, limits reimbursable seminar-related travel expenses, and restricts acceptance of honorary memberships valued over $50 per year. The bill S. 1638 introduces provisions to reduce retirement annuity for judges earning income after retirement, limit reimbursable seminar-related travel expenses, and restrict acceptance of honorary memberships valued over $50 per year. It also applies regulations on outside earned income to U.S. Supreme Court justices."
