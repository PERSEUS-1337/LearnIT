    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000\" and it protects land use as religious exercise. The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 prohibits governments from imposing substantial burdens on religious exercise unless it serves a compelling interest and is the least restrictive means. This applies to programs receiving Federal financial assistance. The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 prohibits governments from imposing substantial burdens on religious exercise, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, affects commerce with foreign nations or among states, or is imposed in the implementation of a land use regulation. No government shall discriminate or exclude based on equal terms. The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 prohibits governments from discriminating against or excluding religious assemblies based on equal terms. It ensures that no government imposes land use regulations that treat religious institutions unfairly or discriminate based on religion. SEC. 3. Protection of religious exercise of institutionalized persons. The government cannot burden the religious exercise of a person in an institution unless it is necessary for a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means. This applies to cases involving federal financial assistance or commerce with foreign nations, states, or Indian tribes. SEC. 4. JUDICIAL RELIEF. (a) A person can use this Act as a claim or defense in court against the government. Standing to do so follows general rules of standing under the Constitution. (b) If a plaintiff provides evidence of a violation of the Free Exercise Clause or section 2, the government must prove any element of the claim, except for whether the challenged law substantially burdens the plaintiff's religious exercise. (c) Claims of violations in a non-Federal forum do not receive full faith and credit. (d) Attorneys' Fees.--Section 722(b) of the Revised Statutes is amended to include the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000. The United States has the authority to enforce compliance with this Act through injunctive or declaratory relief actions. (g) Limitation.--Provisions of this Act do not apply if the government can show that removing substantial burdens on religious exercise nationwide would not have a significant impact on commerce with foreign nations, among states, or with Indian tribes. SEC. 5. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. Nothing in this Act shall burden religious beliefs or regulate religious exercise. It does not restrict funding for religious organizations or individuals, but may require government expenses to avoid burdening religious exercise. The Act does not authorize governments to impose conditions on funding. The Act does not authorize government regulation of activities or policies of non-government entities for funding. Governments can avoid preemptive force by changing policies that burden religious exercise or providing exemptions. It does not restrict funding for religious organizations but may require government expenses to avoid burdening religious exercise. The Act does not preempt state or federal laws equally or more protective of religious exercise. It is to be broadly construed in favor of protecting religious exercise without inferring Congress's intent on other laws. Severability clause: If any part of the Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. SEC. 6. ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE UNAFFECTED. This Act does not impact the Establishment Clause of the first amendment, allowing government funding, benefits, or exemptions within its limits. Denial of such government support is not considered \"granting\" under this Act. SEC. 7. AMENDMENTS TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT. SEC. 7 of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is amended to redefine terms like \"covered entity\" and \"religious exercise\" in a more specific manner. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to Section 6(a) of the Act. In this Act, terms like \"claimant,\" \"demonstrates,\" \"Free Exercise Clause,\" and \"government\" are defined. The term \"land use regulation\" refers to zoning or landmarking laws that restrict a claimant's use of land if they have a property interest in the regulated land. The term \"religious exercise\" includes any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief. The use, building, or conversion of real property for the purpose of religious exercise shall be considered religious exercise."
