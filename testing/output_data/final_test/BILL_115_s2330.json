    "content": "In the Senate, it is not allowed to consider any legislation that includes earmarks. If a Senator raises a point of order against an earmark, it will be removed. This rule also applies during the consideration of conference reports or amendments between the Houses. When the Senate considers a conference report or an amendment between the Houses, earmarks can be removed if a point of order is raised by a Senator. After addressing all points of order, the Senate will decide whether to recede from its amendment or concur with a further amendment. When a point of order is raised in the Senate against a conference report or amendment, it is debatable and no further amendment is allowed if the point of order is sustained. The point of order can only be waived by a two-thirds vote of the Senate members, and the ruling of the Chair on a point of order can be appealed with a two-thirds vote. The term \"earmark\" in this section refers to a provision requested by a Senator or Member of the House of Representatives for specific budget authority or spending targeted to an entity, State, locality, or Congressional district. The term \"earmark\" refers to a provision in the process that provides a Federal tax deduction, credit, exclusion, or preference to a particular beneficiary or limited group of beneficiaries under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with eligibility criteria that are not uniform in application. It also includes modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States in a manner that benefits ten or fewer entities. If the Chair is unable to determine the validity of a provision, a Senator can raise a point of order. Senator raises a point of order under subsection (a) to determine if a provision constitutes an earmark, which will be decided by a two-thirds vote of the Senate without debate. This section does not apply to authorizations of appropriations that are not specifically targeted to a State, locality, or congressional district."
