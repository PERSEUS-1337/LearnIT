    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the section's title and its purpose. The \"Humanitarian Relief to Cuba Act\" is cited as a response to the devastating impact of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike on Cuba in 2008. The hurricanes displaced hundreds of thousands of Cubans, damaged homes and infrastructure, and caused significant economic losses. The United States eased restrictions to allow humanitarian aid to be directly transported to Cuba after Hurricanes Gustav and Ike caused serious damage to the island's agricultural industry. This assistance is crucial for the Cuban people to reclaim their lives and livelihoods following the natural disasters. Easing of travel restrictions to Cuba for 180 days. During a 180-day period, the President is prohibited from regulating travel to or from Cuba for US citizens and individuals with family in Cuba, along with related transactions. The section allows for travel to and from Cuba, including importation of personal baggage, payment of living expenses, acquisition of goods and services for personal use, and arrangement of travel within Cuba. It supersedes other laws related to travel to Cuba. The section 102(h) of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 applies to actions taken by the President before or after the enactment of the Act within a 180-day period. During a 180-day period, the Secretary of the Treasury cannot limit remittances to Cuba by individuals under U.S. jurisdiction. Regulations restricting remittance amounts will be rescinded for this period, with exceptions for money laundering offenses. Easing restrictions on gift or relief packages for 180 days. During a 180-day period, the President is prohibited from restricting the size, quantity, or frequency of personal gift items and relief supplies sent to Cuba. These items can include goods like clothing, medication, food, and personal hygiene items intended to improve the daily life of the Cuban people. Regulations limiting these items will be rescinded for the specified period. Relief supplies for hurricane victims in Cuba include items for comfort, shelter, and repairs to damaged dwellings. The section does not prevent prosecution for money laundering offenses."
