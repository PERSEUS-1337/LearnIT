    "content": "The Act is known as the \"STURDY Act\" and aims to establish a safety standard for free-standing clothing storage units to prevent tip-overs. The \"STURDY Act\" aims to establish a safety standard for free-standing clothing storage units to prevent tip-overs, defining such units as furniture intended for clothing storage and requiring a safety standard to protect children within 540 days of enactment. The \"STURDY Act\" aims to establish a safety standard for free-standing clothing storage units to prevent tip-overs, with a provision for a voluntary ASTM standard if it adequately protects children within 180 days. The \"STURDY Act\" establishes a safety standard for clothing storage units to prevent tip-overs. Subcommittee F15.42 on Furniture Safety of ASTM International developed the standard, which furniture manufacturers are expected to comply with. The Commission will publish determinations in the Federal Register, and if a voluntary ASTM standard meets requirements, it will be treated as a consumer product safety rule. If ASTM International revises a standard after the Commission's determination, they must notify the Commission within 60 days. The revised standard will become enforceable under the Consumer Product Safety Act instead of the prior version. If ASTM International revises a standard, the Commission must be notified within 180 days. If the Commission determines within 90 days that the revised standard does not improve consumer product safety, it will not be enforced. The Commission may enforce the prior version of a consumer product safety standard if the current version does not meet the specified condition. Subsequent rulemaking allows the Commission to modify or add provisions to the standard as needed. The Commission can enforce the previous version of a consumer product safety standard if the current version does not meet the specified condition. Any additional provisions deemed necessary for public health or safety can be included in the standard. Rules promulgated under this provision are treated as consumer product safety rules under the Consumer Product Safety Act."
