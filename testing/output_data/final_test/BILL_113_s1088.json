    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2013\". Congress finds that LGBT students in public schools face pervasive discrimination, including harassment, bullying, and violence, leading to unequal educational opportunities. Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity is a severe problem not adequately addressed by current Federal law, as supported by social science studies. Discrimination in schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity leads to absenteeism, academic underachievement, dropping out, and adverse health consequences among LGBT youth. It can also result in life-threatening violence and suicide. Federal statutory law prohibits discrimination based on various factors, but current laws do not adequately address discrimination against LGBT students. The Department of Education and the Department of Justice, along with courts, have interpreted sex discrimination laws to include gender identity and stereotypes. The lack of explicit federal laws on sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination creates uncertainty and limits legal remedies for LGBT students and parents. The purpose of this Act is to ensure all students have a safe, discrimination-free environment in public education. The purpose of this Act is to prohibit discrimination in public schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity, provide comprehensive federal protections, meaningful remedies, and invoke congressional powers to enforce the 14th Amendment and ensure a safe environment for all students. The Act aims to prevent discrimination in public schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity, allowing the Department of Education and the Department of Justice to combat such discrimination effectively through regulation and enforcement. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS AND RULE. Definitions for the Act include terms like \"educational agency,\" \"gender identity,\" and \"harassment,\" with specific meanings outlined for each term. The Act defines terms such as \"educational agency,\" \"gender identity,\" and \"harassment,\" with specific meanings provided. It also addresses acts of aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sexual orientation or gender identity in public schools. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 defines terms like \"sexual orientation\" as homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality, and \"student\" as an individual within the age limits for free public education. The Act also clarifies that \"includes\" means \"includes but is not limited to\" in this context. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION. No student shall be excluded from participation, denied benefits, or discriminated against based on sexual orientation or gender identity in any program receiving Federal financial assistance. Harassment includes discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Retaliation, discrimination, or reprisal based on sexual orientation or gender identity is prohibited in programs receiving Federal financial assistance. For programs receiving Federal financial assistance, opposition to conduct made unlawful by this Act includes reporting any unlawful conduct or conduct believed to be unlawful. The curr_chunk discusses actions that could be considered unlawful under the Act, such as participation in investigations or providing assistance to others in exercising their rights. It emphasizes the importance of not purposefully providing false information to public schools or governmental entities. The curr_chunk addresses conduct that may be deemed unlawful under the Act or could potentially become unlawful if allowed to continue. The curr_chunk discusses federal administrative enforcement and reporting to congressional committees. Federal departments and agencies providing financial assistance for education programs must comply with section 4 by issuing approved rules. Non-compliance may result in termination of assistance to recipients. The termination or refusal of assistance due to noncompliance with requirements must be based on a finding after a hearing, limited to the specific recipient and program where noncompliance occurred. Other means authorized by law can also be used, but only after notifying the recipient and determining that voluntary compliance is not possible. If assistance is denied due to noncompliance, a full written report must be filed with the relevant congressional committees before the action takes effect. SEC. 6. PRIVATE CAUSE OF ACTION. Private Cause of Action allows aggrieved individuals to bring a court action for violations of the Act, similar to other civil rights laws. Remedies include equitable relief, compensatory damages, and costs. The section does not limit other legal remedies or require exhausting administrative processes. Statute of limitations for actions under this section will be determined accordingly. The statute of limitations period for actions under the Private Cause of Action section will be determined in accordance with section 1658(a) of title 28, United States Code. Tolling of limitations period will be based on the law governing actions under section 1979 of the Revised Statutes in the State where the action is filed. The Attorney General can file a civil action in federal court for violations of the Act, seeking appropriate relief including damages. State immunity is not affected, and individuals can still sue for violations. State immunity under the 11th Amendment does not apply to suits in Federal court for violations of the Act. States waive immunity by receiving Federal financial assistance. Remedies for violations are available in suits against States to the same extent as against other entities. Attorney's fees are addressed in Section 9. SEC. 9. ATTORNEY'S FEES amended to include the Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2013. SEC. 10. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS. Federal and State Nondiscrimination Laws are not preempted by this Act, ensuring that victims of discrimination or retaliation still have legal protections under other Federal or State laws such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Education Amendments of 1972, Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and Revised Statutes. These obligations are additional to existing laws. The Act does not affect legal standards for free speech and expression, including protections for religious student groups under the First Amendment and the Equal Access Act. SEC. 11. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. SEC. 12. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Act will take effect 60 days after enactment and does not apply retroactively."
