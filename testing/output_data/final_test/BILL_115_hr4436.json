    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section title and findings. The \"Caguana Indigenous Ceremonial Park and Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center Study Act\" recognizes the significance of the Caguana Indigenous Ceremonial Park in Puerto Rico, which covers 13.5 acres and attracts 60,000 visitors annually. Protection efforts date back to 1915 when research was initiated by archeologists, leading to a final report in 1941. The Caguana Indigenous Ceremonial Park in Puerto Rico, with significant archeological sites, was excavated and restored by Ricardo E. Alegria in 1949. It was included in the National Register of Historic Places in 1992 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993. The park features 22 petroglyphs, monoliths, and the Cemi Mountain. The park museum displays over 80 archeological pieces from the Taino ancestors, with additional pieces found in various other collections. The Caguana Indigenous Ceremonial Park holds unique precolonial cultural artifacts from Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, suggesting its inclusion in the National Park Service for protection. The Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center is also mentioned. The Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center, located in Ponce, is a significant indigenous site in the Caribbean. Discovered in 1975 after a hurricane, excavations and restoration were led by the Guaynia Society of Archeology and History with the assistance of archeologist Ricardo Alegria. The center attracts around 80,000 visitors annually. The Guaynia Society, led by archeologist Ricardo Alegria, discovered the oldest Antillean indigenous ceremonial site in Puerto Rico with a large cemetery containing 186 human remains. They also found nine plazas used for various ceremonies and activities by the indigenous people. The Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center includes various courts and plazas, with the ninth court remaining unnamed. It is crucial for educating Puerto Ricans about their indigenous roots and could be preserved by being included as a unit of the National Park Service. The ninth court at the Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center could be preserved by being included as a unit of the National Park Service. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a study on designating Caguana Indigenous Ceremonial Park and Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center as National Park System units, including management alternatives. The study process and completion will follow specified regulations, with results to be submitted to relevant congressional committees within a year of funding availability. The report on the study results will be submitted to congressional committees."
