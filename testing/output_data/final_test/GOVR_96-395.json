    "content": "Supporters of the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act are concerned about the lack of congressional oversight in designating and implementing sites, which they believe undermines Congress's role in governing U.S. land. They worry that federal agency managers may use international designations to influence land use decisions without consulting Congress. The World Heritage Convention does not give the United Nations authority over U.S. sites, and management and sovereignty over the sites remain with the country where the site is located. Member countries nominate sites voluntarily and agree to develop laws to protect them using their own procedures. Most U.S. sites named already have legal protection as national monuments or parks. The designation does not give the United Nations authority to affect land management decisions within the United States. The World Heritage Convention does not give the United Nations authority over U.S. sites. Supporters believe it promotes cooperation between federal agencies and local authorities, increases tourism, and brings international attention to protect endangered sites. In 1993, the Convention supported the U.S. in protecting Glacier Bay National Park from a Canadian open pit mine. In 1996, international concern led to changes in plans near Auschwitz Concentration Camp and in Mexico to protect World Heritage Sites. Legislation restricting U.S. participation in World Heritage sites raises concerns about private property impact and compliance with international conventions. The Interior Department testified that the nomination procedure for public land management includes open meetings and congressional notification. In 1995, Yellowstone was deemed in danger by the World Heritage Committee due to threats from a nearby gold mine and other factors. The World Heritage Committee expressed concerns about threats to Yellowstone National Park, including a nearby gold mine, non-native fish in Yellowstone Lake, and efforts to eliminate brucellosis from bison herds. The U.S. government was asked to keep the committee informed and take necessary actions to remove Yellowstone from the endangered list. The gold mine issue has been resolved with compensation, efforts are ongoing to reduce non-native fish in the lake, and annual reports will be provided to the committee. The World Heritage Committee will continue to list Yellowstone and Everglades National Parks on the World Heritage in Danger List until they are removed. The United States will report annually on actions taken to eliminate the danger to the parks. The next opportunity for the US to report will be at the December meeting of the World Heritage Committee. It is uncertain what the Bush Administration's stance will be on this issue."
