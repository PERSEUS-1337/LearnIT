The \"Check Cashing Act of 1993\" requires non-depository institutions to be licensed by the Commission to engage in issuing, redeeming, or cashing checks, travellers' checks, money orders, or transmitting money. The Commission may issue licenses based on business record, capital adequacy, and individual competence, experience, integrity, and financial ability. The Commission may deny a license based on criminal activity, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, or suspension from participation in federally regulated activities. The Commission may revoke a license if the holder engages in prohibited activities, charges excessive fees, or violates regulations. Violators may face a civil penalty of up to $500,000. The Commission is required to issue implementing regulations within 9 months of the Act's enactment. The Commission must establish requirements for license applications and other activities under this section. The effective date for this section, except subsection (d), is 9 months after the Act's enactment. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON FEE CHARGED FOR CHECK CASHING.
