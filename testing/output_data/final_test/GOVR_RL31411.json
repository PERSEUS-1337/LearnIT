    "content": "In 2002, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers redefined key terms related to activities regulated under the Clean Water Act. The final rule clarified the definition of fill material under Section 404, generating support from the mining industry and opposition from environmental groups. The rule aimed to replace inconsistent definitions with a single, common definition. Over 17,000 comments were received on the proposed rule. The 2002 EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rule redefined key terms under the Clean Water Act, expanding discharge activities subject to Section 404 permit requirements. It removed language excluding \"waste\" discharges from jurisdiction, allowing 404 permits for potentially harmful discharges. This aligns with the Clinton and Bush Administrations' stance on regulating coal mining practices. The 2002 EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rule redefined terms under the Clean Water Act, expanding Section 404 permit requirements for discharge activities. Environmental groups opposed the rule change, arguing for stricter regulation of coal mining waste under other provisions of the Act. The debate centered on whether the change was procedural or allowed weaker regulatory practices for coal mining. The Clean Water Act prohibits pollutant discharge into U.S. waters without a permit, with two permitting regimes: NPDES permits for most pollutants and Section 404 permits for dredged or fill material in navigable waters. The NPDES permit program, administered by EPA, requires landowners to obtain a permit from the Corps to discharge dredged or fill material into navigable waters. EPA provides environmental guidance and can veto a Corps permit based on environmental impacts. The NPDES program focuses on the effects of discharges on water quality and imposes effluent limitations to control pollutant discharges. The NPDES permit program, overseen by EPA, regulates discharges of dredged or fill material into navigable waters. EPA can veto Corps permits based on environmental impacts. The program focuses on water quality effects and sets effluent limitations to control pollutant discharges. EPA issues NPDES permits, delegated to 45 states, with EPA as the permitting authority in the remaining states. The Section 404 program addresses dredged and fill material discharges, with fill material posing unique environmental concerns related to water body loss. The Section 404 program focuses on the effects of discharge on the aquatic ecosystem as a whole, including wetlands. It requires evaluation of alternatives and measures to minimize adverse effects. Discharges with significant impacts on aquatic ecosystems are not allowed, and permits are issued by considering the full public interest. The Corps and EPA have complementary roles in regulating the Section 404 program. The Corps and EPA have complementary roles in regulating the Section 404 program. The Corps' regulations describe permit procedures and program definitions, while EPA's regulations provide environmental guidelines for disposal sites. Key terms like \"fill material\" and \"discharge of fill material\" are defined by these agencies. Both the 404 and NPDES programs regulate the discharge of pollutants into water. The EPA and Corps define \"fill material\" as materials like rock, sand, and dirt discharged into water. This is important for determining permit requirements. Both agencies have consistent definitions for \"discharge of fill material\" as the addition of fill material into waters of the United States. The Corps had a different regulatory definition for \"fill material\" before 2002. The Corps and EPA have different definitions of \"fill material.\" The Corps' definition focuses on the primary purpose of replacing aquatic areas with dry land, while EPA's definition emphasizes the effect of the material on water bodies. EPA's definition has remained unchanged since 1988. The Corps and EPA revised their rules to align the definition of \"fill material\" to reduce confusion and litigation. The change aimed to harmonize the purpose-based definition of the Corps with the effects-based definition of EPA, which was widely supported in public comments. The previous primary purpose test led to subjective determinations and allowed project proponents to choose the regulatory regime by asserting a purported purpose. The agencies adopted a new definition of \"fill material\" consistent with EPA's previous rule, stating that it means material placed in waters of the United States that replaces water with dry land or changes the bottom elevation. The 2002 revised definition removed language excluding waste disposal from Section 404 authorization, reflecting a shift in views towards not categorically excluding waste materials. The agencies revised the definition of \"fill material\" to include waste disposal, stating that some waste materials can be considered fill if they are similar to traditional fill material. Trash or garbage discharges are generally excluded from Section 404, but may be permissible in certain cases, such as using recycled porcelain fixtures to create artificial reefs. EPA and the Corps believe this can be environmentally beneficial when done in a manner consistent with traditional uses of fill material. The final rule clarified the term \"discharge of fill material\" under Section 404 by adding examples of regulated activities, such as placement of fill material for construction of solid waste landfills and mine overburden. The final rule amended the definition of \"placement of coal mining overburden\" to include other mining-related materials like overburden, slurry, or tailings. It specified certain types of discharges as outside of Section 404 requirements and included examples of materials considered fill material subject to Section 404. The final rule amended the definition of \"fill material\" to include various materials such as rock, sand, soil, clay, and construction debris. EPA and the Corps did not remove any construction-related activities from Section 404 coverage but narrowed it to exclude trash or garbage. They added examples of specific materials considered fill material subject to Section 404 permitting. The final rule amended the definition of \"fill material\" to include various materials like rock, sand, soil, clay, and construction debris. The most controversial aspect was the elimination of the waste exclusion previously in the Corps' definition of fill material, specifically including mining overburden under Section 404 regulation. In some regions, waste material from coal surface mining is discharged into US waters as part of mining activities. The Corps believes regulating this as fill is the most effective way to manage coal mining activities involving pollutant discharge, while some argue it is a polluting activity. Some argue that the placement of certain materials in waterbodies can be more polluting than filling, altering their integrity. This argument has been raised in lawsuits, such as one in West Virginia in 1998 challenging mountaintop removal coal mining practices. The U.S. District Court stated that the primary purpose of mountaintop mining refuse discharge is waste disposal, subject to regulation under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act. Industry groups and labor unions appealed a court ruling that threatened the economy in West Virginia by making mountaintop mining infeasible. Environmental and citizen groups supported the decision. The Clinton Administration disagreed with regulating mountaintop mining as waste under CWA Section 402 but agreed that it violated stream buffer zone requirements. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the ruling on jurisdiction and state grounds. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a ruling on jurisdiction and state sovereignty, stating that the regulation in question was a matter of state law, not federal law. Environmental groups challenged mountaintop removal permits, leading to a federal district court rescinding the permits in 2007. The court found significant adverse impacts and inadequate evaluation of cumulative impacts by the Corps. However, in 2009, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed the decision. In 2009, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Corps had acted properly in determining the necessary scope of analysis for permits and assessing the cumulative impacts of proposed valley fills. The court reversed the district court's ruling, allowing the Corps to issue permits for mountain removal mining without requiring more extensive environmental review. Environmental groups have continued to challenge mountaintop mining operations in Appalachia through lawsuits. In 2010, the Corps suspended the use of NWP 21 in Appalachia to strengthen regulatory controls over surface mining activities. In 2012, all existing nationwide permits were reissued with modifications, including NWP 21, which previously had no acreage or linear foot limits. The reissued permit for NWP 21 added a \u00bd-acre and 300-linear foot limit for the loss of stream beds and strictly prohibited the use of NWP 21 for constructing valley fills associated with surface coal mining. Projects no longer eligible under NWP 21 could seek authorization under a Section 404 individual permit, which can be issued for longer periods of time. The reissued NWPs became effective on March 19, 2012, and will expire on March 18, 2017. In June 2016, the Corps proposed to reissue the existing nationwide permits. The Corps proposed to reissue existing nationwide permits in 2017, including NWP 21 with a \u00bd-acre and 300-linear foot limit for stream bed loss. The Clinton Administration supported coal mining refuse as fill material under Section 404, leading to a proposal in April 2000 to amend regulations. EPA and the Corps justified the rule changes as necessary for conformity. The Corps revised the rule to align with long-standing practice of regulating mining overburden as fill under Section 404. The coal mining industry supports this approach, arguing that requiring Section 402 permits would restrict mining activities. Materials from surface mining are considered pollutants under the Clean Water Act when discharged into U.S. waters. Environmental groups strongly criticized the agencies' regulatory action to define coal mining overburden and other waste material as fill material, opposing any proposal to allow additional waste discharges into U.S. waters. They argued that the prior waste exclusion language correctly barred the Corps from issuing permits for waste disposal activities under Section 404. The Corps' 404 permit for waste disposal activities is criticized for blurring the distinction between EPA and Corps authority under the Clean Water Act. The 2002 rule changes allow broad interpretation of \"fill\" to authorize various waste discharges, impacting water quality and waterbodies. The 2002 rule revisions expanded the Section 404 permitting program, changing the baseline of regulation compared to the NPDES program. Congressional interest and criticism were evident, with some members requesting a delay in the final rule for review. In 2002, the Senate held an oversight hearing on revised regulations by the Corps and EPA. Legislation was introduced in Congress to reverse the regulations, proposing a definition of \"fill material\" in the Clean Water Act. This definition would allow pollutant discharges that replace portions of water with dry land to be considered fill material. The 2002 rule allowed pollutant discharges to be considered fill material by replacing portions of water with dry land. However, the Appalachia Restoration Act proposed a narrower definition, excluding the disposal of excess spoil material from coal surface mining activities as fill material. The Clean Water Protection Act and the Appalachia Restoration Act aimed to regulate discharges from mining activities. The Clean Water Protection Act allowed certain mining practices to be considered fill material for a 404 permit, while excluding surface coal mining activities. The Senate Committee held a hearing on the impacts of mountaintop removal mining on water quality. The Clean Water Protection Act was reintroduced in subsequent Congresses. In the 112th and 113th Congresses, the Clean Water Protection Act was reintroduced as H.R. 1375 and H.R. 1837, respectively. In the 114th Congress, it was reintroduced as H.R. 6411. Other legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to codify the regulatory definition of fill material in the CWA. The Consolidated and Further Appropriations Act, 2015 included a provision barring the Corps from revising regulations on fill material. A similar provision was included in FY2016 appropriations legislation. The 2009 Supreme Court decision in Coeur Alaska Inc. v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council ruled that gold mining waste discharges are regulated under CWA Section 404, not Section 402. Environmental advocates criticized the ruling and called for changes to the definition of \"fill material\" to prevent similar decisions in the future."
