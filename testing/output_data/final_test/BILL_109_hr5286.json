    "content": "The \"Secure Traveler Improvement Act of 2006\" may be cited as improving the \"NEXUS\" and \"FAST\" registered traveler programs. The Congress mandated the implementation of a registered traveler program to expedite processing for travelers entering and exiting the United States. The program aims to minimize enrollment costs, provide convenient access, and establish clear eligibility requirements. Additionally, 400,000 individuals accounted for 48 percent of cross-border activities according to the Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs. In 2004, 400,000 frequent travelers accounted for 48 percent of cross-border trips between the United States and Canada. Barriers to enrolling in expedited traveler programs like FAST and NEXUS include limited enrollment centers, a complex application process, and high fees. The Department of Homeland Security should expand these programs to enhance security measures. The Secretary of Homeland Security will merge procedures for expedited traveler programs like NEXUS and FAST into a single procedure with common eligibility and security screening requirements. This includes integrating NEXUS Highway, Marine, and Air programs, ensuring identical processes for eligibility and security screening as the FAST program. Additionally, the Secretary will integrate NEXUS and FAST information systems. The Secretary of Homeland Security will integrate all databases and information systems for NEXUS and FAST programs to allow participant identification cards to work in all program locations. NEXUS technology will be expanded to major northern border crossings, and remote enrollment centers will be established. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Canadian government, will establish 6 remote enrollment centers at border crossings and 4 mobile enrollment centers in underserved areas for programs described in subsection (l). An online application process will be designed for these programs. The Secretary of Homeland Security will create an online application process for programs in subsection (l) to allow individuals to apply securely and schedule a security interview. To promote enrollment, incentives will be provided with a plan to admit participants at a rate not exceeding $20 per card issued, and the first renewal fee will be waived. Additionally, a customer service phone number will be established for timely information on the programs. The Secretary will create a customer service telephone number for programs in subsection (l) and carry out a publicity campaign to educate the public. An identification card issued to participants in these programs will be considered sufficient for travel into the United States. Additionally, a consolidated background check process will be implemented. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, will establish a single process for security screening and background checks for individuals in specified programs, including the Transportation Worker Identification Credential and security risk determination under section 5103a of title 49. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, will establish a single process for security screening and background checks for individuals in specified programs, including Transportation Hazardous Materials Endorsement, SENTRI program, and Registered Traveler program. The process will involve a single submission of security screening information, including personal data and biometric information as necessary for all applicable departmental programs. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, will establish a single process for security screening and background checks for individuals in specified programs. This process includes submitting security screening information at any approved location, accepting security clearances from other federal agencies, and implementing standards for protecting privacy and information security. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a process for security screening and background checks for specified programs, including submitting information and implementing standards for privacy and information security. Deadlines for submitting the process description and implementing it are set within 6 and 12 months after the enactment of the Act. Other Department of Homeland Security programs with security screening or background checks will also be reviewed. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a process for security screening and background checks for specified programs, including submitting information and implementing standards for privacy and information security. Recommendations for additional programs will be reported to congressional committees. This subsection does not affect existing statutory or regulatory requirements. A report on implementation must be submitted within one year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Homeland Security must submit a report on the implementation of certain programs within six months of the Act's enactment. This includes coordinating programs like the SENTRI program. The FAST program and NEXUS program are authorized under specific acts. Appropriations are authorized for the Secretary of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2007."
