    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Project Delivery Improvement Act of 2011\". Congress finds that the United States needs $20 billion to maintain transportation infrastructure, with an additional $80 billion per year for projects with economic returns. A total of $255 billion per year is needed for 50 years to upkeep and upgrade the transportation system, which currently falls short by 60 percent. The Act falls 60 percent short of required funding due to declining revenues in the Highway Trust Fund. As a result, transportation project costs need to be reduced, and regulatory requirements streamlined. The Act aims to streamline the environmental review process for transportation projects. The Act allows states to use proprietary, patented, or experimental products for highway projects without competitive bidding or approval by the Secretary. It also repeals the preservation of parklands requirement and amends the participation of agencies in transportation projects. In subsection (c)(5), \"may be\" is changed to \"shall be\"; in subsection (d), paragraph (1) is replaced with the lead agency's responsibilities; and in subsection (f), changes are made to provide for public comment on project definitions. After public comment period, the lead agency may use the purpose and need from the long-range transportation plan without further collaboration. Following participation, the lead agency must consider a range of alternatives. The lead agency determines alternatives for project documents and may exclude those not meeting project purpose. Limitations on claims are amended in title 23, United States Code. In title 23, United States Code, limitations on claims are amended to reduce the time limit to 90 days. The burden of proof is on the individual or entity bringing the claim. Additionally, categorical exclusions for highway projects within the right-of-way of a Federal-aid highway are addressed. The highway funded under section 118(e) can be classified as a categorical exclusion under section 771.117(a) of title 23, Code of Federal Regulations. States have the authority to designate highway projects as categorical exclusions. The Secretary can combine the final environmental impact statement and record of decision for a project to expedite the review process if a preferred alternative is identified. The amendment to Section 303 of title 49, United States Code, focuses on the policy regarding lands, wildlife, waterfowl refuges, and historic sites. It includes changes to the section heading and subsections to clarify the Secretary's authority and responsibilities in protecting these areas. The amendment to Section 303 of title 49, United States Code, focuses on the policy regarding lands, wildlife, waterfowl refuges, and historic sites. It includes changes to clarify the Secretary's authority and responsibilities in protecting these areas by requiring no prudent and feasible alternative to using the land and minimizing harm to the park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge resulting from the use. The Governor of the State and the mayor or chief executive officer of the city, county, or borough must agree that the transportation project is the preferred alternative."
