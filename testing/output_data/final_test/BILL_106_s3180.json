The \"Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act of 2000\" requires computer software that collects user information to provide a clear notice and choice to the user. This includes disclosing the information collected and the recipients of that information. The \"Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act of 2000\" mandates that computer software must obtain user consent before enabling capabilities that transmit user information. This includes providing clear notice of the information collected and recipients, as well as instructions on how to disable the capability without affecting software performance. The \"Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act of 2000\" requires user consent for computer software capabilities that transmit user information. Exceptions include determining user licensing, providing technical support, and enabling employer monitoring within legal limits. Information collected through these exceptions can only be used for the specified purposes. Access to information collected through excepted capability must be provided to the user upon request, allowing for correction, deletion, or supplementation of such information. Any changes made should be included in the user's information for future use. Any person collecting information through a described capability must protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the information. Computer software installed by someone other than the user must provide notice and instructions in electronic form before first use. Violations will be treated as unfair or deceptive practices. Computer software providers can disclose user information to law enforcement agencies with a warrant or court order. Law enforcement agencies can request user information from computer software providers through a court order, with safeguards in place to protect against unauthorized disclosure. The user must be given notice and an opportunity to contest the order or limit its scope. Law enforcement agencies can request user information from computer software providers through a court order based on probable cause of criminal activity. The provider can challenge the order if it is unreasonably burdensome. A person can bring legal action in accordance with state laws. A person can bring legal action in a Federal court if state laws permit, to enjoin a violation or recover monetary loss for violations of specific subsections. The court may award up to $2,500 for each violation, not exceeding $500,000, and may provide additional remedies for willful, knowing, or repeated violations. The court may increase the award to three times the original amount for repeated violations. Litigation costs and attorney fees can be assessed against the defendant. Venue for the action will be where the software was used or where the violation occurred. Trade secrets can be protected upon request. The court may issue protective orders to protect trade secrets and the secrecy of computer-related information in legal actions. The term \"collect\" is defined as gathering information about a computer or user. The term \"computer\" refers to a programmable electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data. \"Computer software\" is any program designed to make a computer perform specific functions, excluding text files or cookies placed on a computer by certain entities.
