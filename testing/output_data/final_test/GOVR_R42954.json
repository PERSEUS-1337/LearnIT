    "content": "Animal agriculture is a significant sector in the U.S. economy, valued at $169 billion in 2012, accounting for 44% of total agricultural production. There were over 1.1 million farms classified as animal production operations in the 2007 Census of Agriculture, including cattle farms, feedlots, dairy operations, hog operations, poultry producers, sheep or goat production, and other livestock activities. Livestock and poultry products, except for dairy, are generally not eligible for price support. Livestock and poultry products, except for dairy, are generally not eligible for price and income support programs in farm bills. The industries seek federal government support in food safety, animal disease monitoring, and fair trade practices. They rely on the government for international market access and trade dispute resolution. Animal welfare and environmental protection are also key concerns for the livestock and poultry industries. The 113th Congress is interested in restructuring U.S. dairy policy and overseeing regulatory issues in animal agriculture. Key issues include animal welfare, trade's role in the sector, and environmental regulations. Current federal dairy policy includes programs like the Dairy Product Price Support Program and Milk Income Loss Contract Program. Congressional Research Service reports on animal agriculture issues are available on CRS.gov. The 112th Congress reviewed existing dairy programs to address concerns about price-based systems not reflecting increased production costs. Both the Senate and House proposed new legislation to replace current U.S. dairy programs. The 112th Congress reviewed existing dairy programs and proposed new legislation to replace them with the Dairy Production Margin Protection Program (DPMPP) and the Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP). The DMSP proposal has sparked debate between dairy producer groups and processors over its impact on margin volatility and export competitiveness. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended the 2008 farm bill for one year, including provisions like the Milk Income Loss Contract program. The Dairy Product Price Support Program was also extended. The 113th Congress may write a new farm bill in 2013 using existing bills as starting points. The 2008 farm bill authorized new livestock disaster assistance programs. The Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) compensates ranchers for livestock mortality at 75% of market value due to disasters. The Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) provides compensation for disaster losses not covered by other programs. USDA has distributed over $753 million in payments to farmers and ranchers through these programs from 2008 to early 2013. The programs expired in 2011 but were reauthorized in the 112th Congress with mandatory funds for FY2012-FY2017. The Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), and Livestock Forage Program (LFP) were reauthorized with mandatory funds for FY2012-FY2017. Senator Baucus introduced S. 141 to reactivate livestock disaster assistance programs for losses in FY2012 and FY2013. Feed costs are a significant expense for livestock and poultry producers. Livestock, poultry, and dairy producers faced record-high feed costs in 2012 due to drought conditions, leading to increased corn and soybean prices. Hay production was lower in 2012, resulting in decreased hay stocks. Drought conditions persist in various regions, impacting livestock producers. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) seasonal outlook predicts persistent drought in certain areas through April 2013, causing uncertainty for 2013 crop prospects and impacting livestock producers. Concerns arise over agricultural policies that may raise feed prices, such as conservation programs and ethanol incentives. Livestock and poultry industries are focused on the effects of these policies on feed costs and the portion of the U.S. corn crop processed into ethanol. Livestock and poultry industries are concerned about the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) driving up feed costs. Bills have been introduced to eliminate or waive the RFS, with ongoing advocacy in the 113th Congress. Some advocate for cellulosic biofuel mandates based on actual production levels. Market consolidation is also a concern in the industry. Market consolidation in the meat and poultry industry has led to increased market power for processors, with the top four firms holding significant market shares. The 2008 farm bill amended the Packers and Stockyards Act to include provisions for contract growers, giving them more rights and protections. The 2008 farm bill amended the Packers and Stockyards Act to provide more rights and protections for contract growers. The Secretary of Agriculture was required to establish criteria for violations of the Act, leading to a controversial proposed rule in June 2010. After receiving feedback, the final rule was issued in December 2011, which differed significantly from the initial proposal. The final rule, effective February 7, 2012, included criteria for violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act, such as suspension of bird delivery and breach of contract conditions. The FY2013 House Agriculture appropriations bill aimed to prohibit USDA from implementing GIPSA rule provisions and repeal finalized provisions from December 2011. The continuing resolution for FY2013 prohibits USDA fund use, with the 113th Congress likely to address the issue further. The 113th Congress may address prohibiting funding for certain GIPSA rule provisions and repealing finalized provisions in FY2013 appropriations. The safety of the U.S. meat and poultry supply is overseen by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which conducts inspections and testing in slaughter and processing plants. FSIS oversees the safety of meat and poultry supply, conducts inspections, testing, and certifies foreign plants. Congress monitors FSIS efforts to address foodborne illness outbreaks and proposed legislation for pathogen reduction standards and increased testing for E. coli in ground beef. FSIS is in the rulemaking process for various issues of interest to Congress, such as catfish inspection, labeling mechanically tenderized meat, setting pathogen reduction standards for processed meat, and requiring recordkeeping for ground beef in retail stores. USDA has proposed modernizing its poultry inspection system. The USDA has proposed modernizing its poultry inspection system by expanding the HIMP project, reducing online FSIS carcass inspectors, relying on plant personnel for sorting, and allowing faster line speeds. FSIS inspectors would focus on pathogen reduction and offline food safety activities. Some advocates question the system, with Congress members expressing concern and asking USDA to withdraw the proposal. In 2009, FSIS began a risk-based approach to foreign audits of meat plants, conducting fewer audits based on plant performance. This policy change was not publicly announced until January 2013, raising concerns among public health experts and Representative DeLauro. Public health experts are concerned about the growing resistance of infectious diseases to antibiotics, which can make infections difficult or impossible to treat. Antibiotic resistance is linked to overuse in medical professionals and non-medical use in food animals. Some argue for limiting non-medical antibiotic use in animals to drugs not useful in human medicine, while others believe it is necessary for commercial viability. The 112th Congress addressed the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act. In the 112th Congress, the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2011 (PAMTA) aimed to restrict non-medical antibiotic use in animal feeds. U.S. exports of animal products reached $29 billion in 2012, with red meat, poultry, dairy products, and hides and skins accounting for the majority. Imports totaled nearly $14 billion, with meat, dairy products, and live animals making up 90% of the value. Foreign demand supports domestic livestock and poultry prices, while imports meet U.S. consumer demand for various products. In the 113th Congress, trade issues such as WTO disputes over country-of-origin labeling (COOL), non-tariff barriers, and free trade agreements were addressed. In response to COOL implementation, Canada and Mexico raised concerns about its impact on their livestock sectors, leading to a WTO dispute resolution panel being requested in November 2011. In November 2011, the WTO ruled that COOL violates trade standards by discriminating against imported cattle and hogs. The United States appealed but the ruling was upheld. The US was given until May 23, 2013, to comply with COOL or face trade retaliation from Canada and Mexico. The Canadian pork industry claims $500 million in harm annually from COOL. The US has not announced how it will comply with WTO obligations. The U.S. Trade Representative has not announced how the United States will comply with COOL regulations. Some argue that a legislative solution is necessary due to the specific labeling requirements of the COOL law. A group of Senators has requested a regulatory solution to bring COOL into compliance and provide accurate information to consumers about the origin of meat purchases. Ractopamine, a veterinary drug used as a feed additive, is banned in major markets for U.S. meat exports such as China, Taiwan, the EU, and Russia. The Codex Alimentarius Commission established minimal risk levels for ractopamine in beef in July 2012. Russia announced a zero-tolerance level for ractopamine in beef and pork imports, leading to a ban on non-certified products starting February 11, 2013. The U.S. expressed concerns over Russia's actions, citing potential violations of WTO commitments. The U.S. livestock industry, which shipped over $500 million worth of beef and pork to Russia in 2012, fears unscientific trade barriers. The Administration and Congress called on Russia to suspend the new measures and restore market access for U.S. beef and pork. Senator Grassley called on Russia to suspend new trade measures and restore market access for U.S. beef and pork products, citing unjustified trade barriers that violate WTO obligations. Free trade agreements are crucial for the livestock, poultry, and dairy sectors, providing additional market access through tariff reductions and quota increases. The ongoing TPP negotiations could offer expanded market access for the animal agriculture sector, but concerns remain, especially in the U.S. dairy industry regarding potential competition from New Zealand and restrictive tariff rates in Canada. The U.S. dairy industry faces challenges in Canadian markets due to tariff-rate quotas and high tariff rates. Livestock groups support the idea of a U.S.-European Union FTA but have concerns about sanitary issues and trade barriers. Issues include the EU's ban on U.S. beef with hormones and chlorine washes for poultry. The dairy industry is worried about geographical indications in FTA negotiations. In early February 2013, the EU lifted bans on U.S. hog imports and the use of lactic acid in the beef industry. Farm animals are not covered under the Animal Welfare Act, but are regulated by other federal laws. Congressional action has prevented horse slaughter in the U.S. since 2006. Legislation on table-egg-laying-hen cages was contentious in the 112th Congress. Since 2006, congressional action has prevented horse slaughter in the United States through appropriations bills. The prohibition on horse slaughter inspection was expanded in 2008 and lifted in 2012, allowing for the possibility of horse slaughter operations to resume. In 2013, the House Agriculture appropriations bill contained language prohibiting funds for horse slaughter plant inspections, but this language was not included in the Continuing Resolution Act of 2013. Horse slaughter could be part of the appropriations discussion for FY2013 beyond March 27, 2013, when P.L. 112-175 expires. The American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act of 2011 aimed to prohibit the slaughtering of horses for human consumption. The Egg Products Inspection Act Amendments of 2012 aimed to establish national cage size requirements for table-egg-laying hens but did not progress in Congress. The bills aimed to establish national standards for laying-hen housing, labeling requirements, and set air quality, molting, and euthanasia standards. Egg producers supported the legislation to avoid state-by-state battles over caged eggs. HSUS compromised on accepting enriched cages to potentially achieve federal farm animal welfare legislation. Farm groups opposed the bills for mandating management practices for farm animals.

Farm groups opposed the bills for mandating management practices for farm animals. The application of federal environmental laws to livestock and poultry operations has been controversial for many farmers and ranchers due to concerns about environmental impacts. The Clean Water Act is a primary regulatory focus for animal agriculture, as it aims to prevent the release of sediment, nutrients, pathogens, and pesticides that can degrade water quality. Other federal laws, such as the Clean Air Act, regulate issues like soil erosion, air emissions, and livestock odor. Federal environmental laws often delegate regulatory responsibilities to states, with the 112th Congress overseeing the EPA and considering bills to limit its authority. The livestock industry is particularly concerned about potential revisions to the Clean Air Act and National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The EPA decided not to revise the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for particulate matter, a key issue for the livestock industry. Conservation programs like EQIP and CSP, funded through farm bills, support environmental quality improvement. These programs are likely to be addressed during the appropriations process and farm bill debates in the 113th Congress. Conservation programs like EQIP and CSP, funded through farm bills, are likely to be addressed during the appropriations process and farm bill debates in the 113th Congress, especially due to recent funding cuts for these programs."
