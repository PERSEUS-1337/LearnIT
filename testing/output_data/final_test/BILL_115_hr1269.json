The Sites Reservoir in the CALFED Record of Decision is the preferred location for North of Delta Offstream Storage, providing increased surface water storage for water management flexibility in the Sacramento Valley. The project aims to improve ecosystem and water quality conditions in the Bay-Delta, enhance conditions for fish and wildlife in the Sacramento Valley, including anadromous fish in the Sacramento River. The Sites Project in the Sacramento Valley aims to increase water storage, improve ecosystem and water quality in the Bay-Delta, benefit fish and wildlife, create jobs, and provide recreational benefits. It can enhance operational efficiency for water supply reliability and the environment by providing 500,000 acre-feet of additional annualized yield. Healthy wetlands and wildlife refuges are also crucial. The Sites Project in California aims to improve water storage and ecosystem quality, benefit wildlife, and create jobs. Additional surface water storage can help meet water supply goals, and the Federal Government should collaborate with the Sites Project Authority to advance the project efficiently. SEC. 3.
