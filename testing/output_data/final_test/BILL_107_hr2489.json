    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Homemaker Employment Assistance and Lifeskills Act\" and its purpose and findings are outlined in Section 2. The \"Homemaker Employment Assistance and Lifeskills Act\" aims to provide assistance for displaced homemakers, single parents, and individuals pursuing nontraditional occupations to create workforce pathways and meet the needs of a high-skilled economy. Congress recognizes the importance of a diverse workforce and the education and training needs of these individuals. Displaced homemakers, single parents, and individuals in nontraditional occupations are underserved by current systems. They can fill positions in the information technology sector, offering economic independence through wages and advancement opportunities. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" and does not provide any additional information beyond that. The curr_chunk defines terms such as \"community-based organization\" as a nonprofit group providing services to a community, and \"displaced homemaker\" as an individual previously dependent on family income but now unemployed or underemployed. The curr_chunk defines terms related to vocational and technical education, including \"eligible State agency\" and \"eligible recipient\" as entities responsible for providing education and training to displaced homemakers and single parents. It also defines \"local educational agency\" and \"nontraditional employment.\" The curr_chunk defines \"nontraditional employment\" as occupations where one gender comprises less than 25% of the workforce, and \"preparatory services\" as programs to assist individuals in selecting or preparing for education or training programs. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms such as postsecondary vocational institution, secondary school, Secretary, and single parent. Supportive services include transportation, child care, dependent care, and needs-based payment to help individuals participate in education and training activities. The Secretary of Education is authorized to provide grants to States for programs described in section 6. Funds will be allocated based on the population ratio of each State. The funds are meant to supplement, not replace, other public funds for displaced homemakers, single parents, and students in nontraditional occupations. Eligibility criteria are outlined in section 6. Each eligible State agency must submit a five-year plan to the Secretary, with annual revisions as needed. The agency is also required to review activities after the second year, submit any necessary plan revisions, and provide an annual report of compiled data. The State plan can be developed in consultation with experts and students. The State plan must include preparatory services and vocational activities for single parents, displaced homemakers, and students in nontraditional training programs. It should outline the process for awarding funds, provide professional development, and evaluate effectiveness annually. The State plan must include evaluating program effectiveness annually, coordinating programs to avoid duplication, ensuring compliance with the Act and State plan, and prohibiting the use of funds for equipment that directly benefits specific entities. The eligible State agency must measure and report student progress under the Act, including participation in vocational programs, completion of nontraditional training, attainment of diplomas, and placement in postsecondary education. The eligible State agency must provide technical assistance to recipients and coordinate programs with other federal programs. The agency may submit a plan under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 to fulfill requirements. The Secretary will approve a plan unless determined otherwise within 120 days of submission. The State plan, or revision, must meet requirements within 120 days of submission. SEC. 7. PROGRAMS FOR SINGLE PARENTS, DISPLACED HOMEMAKERS, AND NONTRADITIONAL EMPLOYMENT. Each State may use funds provided under section 9 to provide preparatory services, educational materials, career guidance, support services, and special services to displaced homemakers, single parents, and students interested in nontraditional occupations. Additionally, programs and activities are to be offered to prepare these individuals for employment with marketable skills leading to economic self-sufficiency. The programs funded under section 9 aim to support displaced homemakers, single parents, and students in pursuing nontraditional careers in information technology and other high-skill fields. They also focus on creating a fair and respectful learning environment for vocational students and developing model programs to increase participation in nontraditional employment. SEC. 8. WITHIN STATE ALLOCATION AND ADMINISTRATION. State agencies receiving funds under section 5 must reserve 5% for administration. States must match funds received under section 9. Each state participating in the program must assign an individual to administer vocational education programs and gather data on program effectiveness. The administrator assigned under subsection (c) is responsible for developing the State plan, providing technical assistance, managing fund distribution, monitoring fund use, evaluating program effectiveness, and providing competitive grants for effective programs. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and necessary sums for the following four years."
