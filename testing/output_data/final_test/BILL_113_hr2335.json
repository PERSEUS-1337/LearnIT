Congress acknowledges the importance of meeting all obligations and maintaining a AAA credit rating for the economic standing of the United States. The statutory debt limit has been increased multiple times in the past, as outlined in the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. The United States has a public debt limit that can be increased by Congress to pay financial obligations. Moody's has called for the elimination of the debt limit, while Standard and Poor's downgraded the US credit rating. The annual budget resolution specifies the public debt level for each fiscal year. The United States credit rating was downgraded for the first time in history on August 5, 2011, due to political brinksmanship. The 2011 debt limit standoff cost taxpayers $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011, with a 10-year estimated cost of $18.9 billion according to the Bipartisan Policy Center in January 2013. SEC. 3.
