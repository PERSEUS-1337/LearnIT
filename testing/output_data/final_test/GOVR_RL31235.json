The deficit for FY2010 is projected to be $1,349 billion. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in FY2009 led to additional outlays of $112 billion and a drop in revenues of $88 billion, increasing the deficit by $200 billion. The $1.4 trillion deficit in FY2009 was unprecedented, equivalent to 9.9% of GDP. The budget deficit was entirely eliminated by a combination of budget policy and a booming economy, but deficits have been present since 2002. Deficit reduction is not a priority during economic downturns, and deficits are expected to remain high even as the economy recovers in 2010. Continued deficits at current levels could ultimately reduce the long-run rate of economic growth. Policymakers are guided by past experience, and economists are not changing their views on the economic effects of budget deficits. The report examines the economics of budget deficits and the impact on national saving rates. Most economists believe public policy has limited influence on private saving behavior. The national saving rate rose in the 1990s due to increases in public saving offsetting falling private saving. Budget surpluses have been rare in recent history. In recent history, budget surpluses have been rare. Between FY1969 and FY1998, the federal budget was in deficit every year. The budget was in surplus for a total of nine years from 1929 to 1969, never exceeding three consecutive years. The budget deficit grew to 6.0% of GDP in 1983 during an economic downturn, but turned into a surplus by 2000. The U.S. budget surplus increased steadily until 2000, but then fell to 1.3% of GDP in 2001. Subsequently, there were deficits in 2002 (1.5% of GDP) and 2004 (3.5% of GDP). The deficit grew to 3.2% of GDP in 2008 and reached 9.9% of GDP in 2009. The federal budget and the economy are closely linked, with fiscal policy impacting economic growth and resource allocation. The multiplier effect of government spending can stimulate economic growth by increasing income and subsequent spending, leading to a larger economy than without the initial spending boost. This effect can also occur with spending cuts, impacting the overall economy. The government can influence economic growth through tax cuts or increases, which can have a multiplier effect on income and spending. Tax cuts increase disposable income and stimulate spending, while tax increases reduce disposable income and slow down private sector spending. Given current economic conditions, a stimulative fiscal policy is more likely to support growth than raise interest rates or inflation. A sufficient fiscal policy boost can help a slack economy move towards full employment. However, economists believe that the government cannot permanently increase the economy by continuously increasing spending or cutting taxes. Increased spending or tax cuts lead to a higher deficit and increased demand for credit in the public sector. Increased credit demand due to higher deficits raises interest rates, discouraging borrowing for credit-dependent activities like housing and consumer goods. This also attracts overseas investors to dollar-denominated assets, leading to a stronger dollar and impacting imports and exports, ultimately raising the trade deficit. Fiscal policy can also influence prices. Fiscal policy can affect prices by increasing aggregate demand through government spending or tax cuts. In a fully employed economy, this may lead to higher prices rather than increased production. The impact of government spending on economic growth diminishes as the economy nears full employment. In a fully employed economy, an increase in government spending may change the composition of output more than raise its level. Estimates of the multiplier effect of fiscal policy vary, with most suggesting a peak value of one to one-and-a-half times the original stimulus. This peak effect is typically realized within one or two years. For every dollar increase in federal spending, the economy may grow by a dollar to a dollar-and-a-half within a year or two. Economic growth can impact the budget by raising revenues and reducing outlays. Faster economic growth leads to higher taxable incomes, increasing tax receipts and reducing outlays, especially for unemployment insurance and income support programs. It can be challenging to determine if budget changes are due to economic fluctuations or deliberate policy changes. Economists use the structural budget to estimate what the budget would be at full employment, separating changes in budget totals from overall economic changes. The standardized-employment surplus separates changes in budget totals due to policy changes from economic conditions. It is tracked as a percentage of potential GDP to assess fiscal policy's impact. Comparing the budget to GDP filters out changes from the economy's size. The standardized-employment surplus is used to assess fiscal policy's impact by comparing it to potential GDP. Changes in the standardized budget deficit relative to potential GDP indicate the type of fiscal policy being implemented. The CBO regularly publishes estimates of the standardized budget surplus. Comparing the standardized budget surplus with the actual surplus as a percentage of potential GDP shows their behavior over time. Between 1992 and 2000, the actual budget surplus increased from -4.5% to 2.5% of potential GDP, while the standardized measure rose from -3.3% to 1.1% of GDP. This suggests that policy changes accounted for over half of the shift, with economic conditions contributing to the rest. Between 1992 and 2000, fiscal policy was contractionary with the standardized surplus growing relative to GDP by an average of 0.5% per year. Despite this, other factors contributed to economic growth. From 2000 to 2003, fiscal policy became expansionary as the standardized surplus fell. In 2008 and 2009, deficits increased substantially, indicating an expansionary fiscal policy. Constant deficits or surpluses have little effect on short-term economic growth, it is changes in the surplus that matter. In the long run, economic growth is primarily determined by growth in the labor force, technological advance, and capital availability. Policymakers can influence growth through the size of the domestic capital stock and the amount of capital per worker. Fiscal policy may have a larger impact on growth through its influence on capital rather than technological progress. The total value of national output can be measured in two ways: by adding up the value of goods and services produced or by counting the incomes resulting from production. This total output is calculated as the sum of consumption spending, investment, government spending, and the difference between exports and imports. On the other side of economic accounting, national output is expressed as the sum of consumption and private sector saving. The value of national output is expressed as the sum of consumption, private sector saving, and tax payments. Total investment spending is equal to private saving, the government budget surplus, and the difference between imports and exports. A reduction in public sector saving leads to less investment and slower growth in the capital stock. Financial capital flows back and forth between countries based on international flows of goods and services. Capital inflows exceed outflows when exports are higher than imports, affecting foreign financial capital flow into the US. Increased domestic saving can lower interest rates, making foreign assets more attractive. Private and public sector saving impact net foreign investment. Figure 3 illustrates investment funds sources over the past eight years as a percentage of GDP. The public sector's contribution to national saving rose to 4.4% of GDP in 2000 but fell in 2008. Private sector saving decreased from 15.2% to 13.7% of GDP between 1998 and 2008. Net inflows of foreign capital increased from 2.6% to nearly 5% of GDP during the same period. Total funds available for investment in the US rose from 20.4% to 22.1% of GDP in 2000 before dropping below 17% in 2008. Domestic saving fell from 18.3% to below 11% of GDP between 1999 and 2009. Foreign investors' claims to income from the domestic capital stock are rising due to increased inflows of foreign capital. Foreign investors' claims to income from the domestic capital stock are increasing, driven by large inflows of foreign capital. Factors such as domestic credit demands and interest rate increases play a role, but other reasons for the influx of foreign capital include profitable investment opportunities and the perception of increased risk in other countries. The United States is seen as a 'safe haven' for foreign capital, with the economy expected to be more productive in the future. The increase in investment spending in the 1990s was fueled by an increase in national saving and foreign capital inflows. However, after 2000, there was a decline in domestic saving, leading to a decrease in total funds available for investment. The federal government budget surpluses in the 1990s resulted in a reduction in federal debt, but the key measure is the debt relative to total output. The federal debt relative to total output, or GDP, began to fall in 1993. Even with large increases in debt expected in the next few years, as long as they are perceived as temporary, significant economic instability is not likely. However, if the federal debt grows faster than GDP, interest payments on the debt will increase as a share of federal spending and GDP. Investors may become concerned if the debt continues to outpace GDP growth indefinitely. If the federal debt grows faster than GDP indefinitely, investors may become unwilling to buy new federal debt issues, leading to the Federal Reserve being the only buyer and potentially causing accelerating inflation. Perpetual debt growth exceeding economic growth is unstable, with doubts arising about the government's revenue-raising ability. The debt-to-GDP ratio's explosive path depends on interest rates and GDP growth rates. The federal debt can grow faster than GDP if the interest rate on the debt is higher than the economic growth rate. This would cause the debt to increase relative to national output. Conversely, if the interest rate is lower than the GDP growth rate, the debt-to-income ratio can decrease. In 1993, the federal debt peaked at 49.3% of GDP, despite a budget deficit of $255 billion. In 1994, the debt decreased even with a deficit over $200 billion. In 2001, federal debt fell to 32.5% of GDP, but by 2009, it had risen to 53.0%. The ratio of debt to GDP fluctuated over the years, showing that economic stability depends on preventing a perpetual rise in the ratio. The public's preference for present versus future consumption is reflected in saving rates. The public sector's budget surplus or deficit has significant effects on savings. In the short run, changes in the budget surplus or deficit impact economic growth. A shift from a budget surplus to a deficit reduces national saving, leading to more present consumption and less investment. Consuming more now means less investment and lower future output of goods and services, leading to less to consume in the future. A rising debt-to-GDP ratio poses the risk of accelerating inflation."
