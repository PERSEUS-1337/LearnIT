The Departments of Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, the District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act for FY2006, P.L. 109-115 (TTHUD), signed into law on November 30, 2005, included $603 million in special federal payments, funding new initiatives like marriage development accounts for low-income individuals and transferring federal land at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium to the District for lease to public charter schools. The TTUD Act for FY2006 includes $40 million in special federal payments for education, with $13 million for public school improvements, $13 million for public charter schools, and $14 million for vouchers. The act restricts the use of funds for a needle exchange program, abortion services, and medical marijuana. The District's total federal payment is reduced to $597 million from $603 million due to a 1% rescission. The Administration's FY2006 budget request included $573.397 million in federal payments to the District of Columbia, with a major portion allocated to the District's courts and criminal justice system. This funding covered court operations, Defender Services, Court Services, Offender Supervision Agency, and the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, totaling 82% of the total federal payment. The President's budget request for FY2006 included $74.8 million for education and $22.2 million for security planning in the District of Columbia. The city council approved an $8.8 billion operating budget, with a request for $635.197 million in special federal payments, including $41.616 million for public schools. The District of Columbia requested $41.616 million in special federal payments for public schools, charter schools, and school vouchers. The proposed budget also included increased funding for economic development, regulation, and human support services. Additionally, requests were made for college tuition assistance, a downtown transit circulator system, and funding for security and emergency preparedness activities. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the House and Senate to pass a budget resolution setting spending limits for each fiscal year. Appropriations committees then allocate these funds to various subcommittees. For FY2006, the House allocated $85.922 billion to the TTHUD Subcommittee, while the Senate allocated $593 million to the District of Columbia Subcommittee. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved budget allocations for various subcommittees in FY2006. The Senate allocated $603 million for the District of Columbia Subcommittee, while the House allocated $84.887 billion for the TTHUD Subcommittee. Congress oversees the District's budget, including federal payments and local funds expenditure. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees must approve and may modify the District's budget. The House and Senate versions of the budget are reconciled in a joint conference committee and must be agreed upon. The final budget is then sent to the President for approval or veto. In June 2005, the House Appropriations Committee recommended $603 million in special federal payments for the District of Columbia, including funding for the city's college tuition assistance program. The bill included $41.616 million in federal payments for public schools and education choices, $22.2 million for security planning and bioterrorism preparedness. It did not include $10 million for fire and emergency medical facilities but continued support for a nature trail. The House version of H.R. 3058 had provisions on medical marijuana, abortion, needle exchange, and gun control that District officials wanted to change. City officials in the District of Columbia have requested Congress to remove restrictions on medical marijuana, abortion services, and needle exchange programs. However, H.R. 3058, as approved by the House, maintained these restrictions. The Supreme Court upheld Congress's authority to ban medical marijuana in a 2005 decision. The Senate Subcommittee on the District of Columbia completed its markup of the District Appropriations Act for FY2006, which included provisions prohibiting the possession and cultivation of marijuana in states that have decriminalized it for medical use. The bill also included a provision regarding District gun control provisions. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2006, which would have appropriated $593 million in federal payments for the District and approved its operating budget. The Senate version of H.R. 3058 recommended $33.2 million for the city's college tuition assistance program, an increase of $7.8 million from FY2005. It also included $40 million for public schools and education choices, $17.2 million for security planning and bioterrorism preparedness, and continued support for a nature trail along the Anacostia. The Senate bill proposed funding reductions totaling $8.6 million, offsetting three new initiatives not included in the House bill. It included a provision to transfer federal land to the District and allowed local funds for lobbying and a needle exchange program. The Senate bill, similar to the House bill, prohibited the use of funds for District medical marijuana and abortion services except in specific cases. The Senate approved its version of H.R. 3058 on October 20, 2005, and appointed members to reconcile differences with the House. The conference committee filed a report on November 18, 2005, which was approved by the House and Senate. The President signed the bill on November 30, 2005. The President signed P.L. 109-115 into law, appropriating $603 million for the District of Columbia, including $73 million for education. This includes $13 million for public schools, $13 million for charter schools, $14 million for private school vouchers, and $33 million for college tuition assistance. An additional $5 million in education earmarks are included for various groups, monitored by the CFO. The bill includes $465.6 million in special federal payments for court operations, defender-related services, offender supervision, and criminal justice coordination in the District of Columbia. It also provides $3 million for Marriage Development Accounts. The act prohibits funding for a needle exchange program, voter-approved medical marijuana initiative, and most abortion services. It does not include language to liberalize District gun control laws but transfers 15 acres of federal land for public use. The act approves the District's budget of $9 billion, including $535 million for baseball stadium construction. One month later, the President signed a law requiring a 1% rescission in discretionary programs to offset costs for disaster relief. The Office of Management and Budget was tasked with implementing this reduction. The FY2006 conference bill funding levels have not been adjusted to reflect the 1% reduction. The District's budget for FY2006 totals $9.2 billion, including $535 million for a new baseball stadium. Congress must approve the budget, which includes $7.8 billion in operating funds and $1.4 billion in enterprise funds. The budget also allocates $3 billion for capital outlays. One key policy issue is whether to continue funding a needle exchange program. The controversy over funding a needle exchange program in the District for FY2006 touches on issues of home rule, public health policy, and government sanctioning of illegal drugs. Proponents argue that such programs reduce HIV spread among drug users by providing clean needles, while opponents believe it sanctions drug use and advocate for drug treatment programs instead. The debate also includes the city's ability to use local funds for such programs without congressional interference. The prohibition on federal and District funds for needle exchange programs was approved by Congress in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1999. Private funding was allowed for needle exchange programs. The FY2001 Act continued the funding prohibition and restricted the location of privately funded needle exchange activities. The distribution of needles near schools was made unlawful in the FY2001 Act but was deleted in the FY2002 Act. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act of FY2002, P.L. 107-96, allows private funds for needle exchange programs but prohibits the use of District and federal funds. Prevention Works operates a privately funded program, required to track public and private funds. District officials tried to lift the prohibition on District funds for needle exchange programs in the FY2004 Act, but it was unsuccessful. The FY2004 bill allowed private funds for needle exchange programs, while the President's budget proposal for FY2006 aimed to prohibit the use of District and federal funds for such programs. H.R. 3058 included provisions to retain the prohibition on federal and District funds for needle exchange programs, with the final version of the act signed by the President maintaining this restriction. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1999, P.L. 105-277, prohibited the city from counting ballots of a 1998 voter-approved initiative for medical marijuana use. Congress's power to do so was challenged in a lawsuit by the ACLU, with a ruling that Congress did not have the authority to stifle the initiative. The ruling under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution allowed the city to tally votes from the 1998 medical marijuana ballot initiative. Congress had 30 days to pass a resolution of disapproval to prevent its implementation. Language in the District of Columbia Appropriations Acts for FY2000 and FY2002 prohibited the initiative's implementation, sparking debate over congressional interference with home rule. On December 18, 2001, two groups challenged Congress's power to block a medical marijuana initiative. The District's Board of Elections and Ethics was prohibited from using public funds to put the initiative on the ballot. A U.S. district court judge later ruled the congressional ban unconstitutional, citing a violation of First Amendment rights. The Justice Department appealed the decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed a ruling allowing a medical marijuana initiative to be on the ballot, citing Congress's authority to regulate drug marketing. This decision upheld the prohibition of implementing the medical marijuana ballot initiative. The District of Columbia faces ongoing debates over public funding for abortion services, with Congress imposing restrictions on the use of federal or District funds for abortions since 1995. This issue is often raised during annual deliberations on District appropriations, with District officials criticizing congressional interference in local matters. Since 1979, Congress has limited public funds for abortion services in the District of Columbia. Restrictions have evolved over the years, with the most recent limitation in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1989, P.L. 100-462, only allowing funds for cases where the mother's life is endangered. President Reagan supported this change, removing rape or incest as qualifying conditions for public funding of abortion services. President Reagan endorsed limiting public funding for abortion services in the District of Columbia. President Bush vetoed the District's FY1990 appropriations act twice over the abortion issue. The District successfully removed the provision limiting funding for abortion services in the FY1994 appropriations act, reinstating rape and incest as qualifying circumstances. However, the restrictions were reinstated in the FY1996 appropriations act. The TTHUD Appropriations Act for FY2006 continued to limit the use of District and federal funds for abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is endangered. P.L. 107-96 lifted the congressional prohibition on the use of District funds for implementing the Health Care Benefits Expansion Act, allowing unmarried heterosexual and homosexual couples to register as domestic partners. In 1992, unmarried domestic partners of District employees hired after 1987 could be added to the employee's health care policy for an extra fee. The Health Care Benefits Expansion Act, implemented in 2002, allows cohabiting individuals to register as domestic partners for health and family benefits. District government employees can purchase family health insurance coverage for their domestic partners. Opponents argue that the act undermines marriage. Opponents of the act argue that it devalues marriage by granting unmarried couples the same rights. A bill, H.R. 72, aims to define marriage in D.C. as between a man and a woman. Proponents of lifting the ban on District funds believe it's a matter of local autonomy. Supporters of health benefits for domestic partners point out that many states and companies already offer such benefits. The TTHUD Appropriations Act for FY2006 allows the use of District funds for health benefits for domestic partners. In the 108th Congress, the House passed H.R. 3193 to repeal the District of Columbia handgun ban. The ban required firearm registration and licensing, with a prohibition on handgun registration after September 24, 1976. Congress reserved the authority to review and disapprove District legislation under the Home Rule Act. H.R. 3193 aimed to limit the Council's regulation of firearms and remove the term \"semiautomatic weapon\" from the definition of \"machine.\" In the 108th Congress, H.R. 3193 aimed to repeal the District of Columbia handgun ban, which required firearm registration and licensing. The bill sought to limit the Council's regulation of firearms and remove the term \"semiautomatic weapon\" from the definition of \"machine.\" In the 109th Congress, similar measures were introduced in both the House and Senate to restore Second Amendment rights in DC, including repealing firearm registration requirements and certain criminal penalties for possessing unregistered firearms or carrying unlicensed handguns.

In the current legislative session, an amendment was passed to prohibit the use of funding to enforce certain firearms control regulations in DC, which was opposed by District officials. Funding for school improvement in DC includes support for public education, charter schools, and opportunity scholarships. The aim is to enhance traditional public and charter schools while evaluating the effectiveness of voucher programs for private school attendance. The District of Columbia School Choice Incentive Act funds a scholarship program for low-income families to attend private schools in DC. Eligible students can receive scholarships up to $7,500 for tuition, fees, and transportation expenses. Recipients are selected through a lottery and can continue in the program if their family income stays below 200% of the poverty level. The District of Columbia School Choice Incentive Act funds a scholarship program for low-income families to attend private schools in DC. Students meeting program eligibility criteria can receive scholarships up to $7,500 for tuition, fees, and transportation expenses. Priority is given to students in schools identified for improvement under Title I-A, but all eligible students can receive scholarships regardless of previous school enrollment. The program includes a rigorous evaluation component to assess academic achievement, school choice options, and impact on students and public schools in DC. In the school year 2004-2005, 58 private schools in DC participated in the scholarship program, offering slots for 1,264 students. Over 40,000 students may be eligible for the program, with 1,848 applying in 2004-2005. The program's implementation was controversial, with criticism including low student and school participation, a significant number of scholarship recipients already attending private schools, and a mismatch between applicants and available slots. The House version of H.R. 3058 proposes $14.566 million for the opportunity scholarship program, with $1 million for administrative expenses. This is part of efforts to improve elementary and secondary education in DC, including funding for public schools and charter schools. Concerns about the program include an oversupply of slots at the elementary level and a shortage at the secondary level, with the $7,500 scholarship amount not covering full attendance costs for most secondary schools. Proposals to amend program terms may be considered, but it is suggested to continue the demonstration program in its current form for now. The Senate and conference versions of the TTHUD Appropriations Act for FY2006 included $14 million for private school vouchers, $13 million for public school improvements, and $13 million for public charter schools in the District. Additionally, there is a provision for leasing 15 acres of District land for a pre-collegiate public charter boarding school. Senator Brownback highlighted the importance of marriage in the poverty status of children in the District. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2006 included provisions for Marriage Development Accounts (MDAs) to encourage marriage among low-income residents through financial incentives and life skills training. The Act allocated $3 million for this purpose, with $1.5 million for a Marriage Development Account Fund administered by the Capital Area Asset Building Corporation and $850,000 for the National Center for Fathering. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2006 allocated $3 million for Marriage Development Accounts (MDAs) to encourage marriage among low-income residents. The funds include $1.5 million for a Marriage Development Account Fund administered by the Capital Area Asset Building Corporation, $850,000 for the National Center for Fathering, and $650,000 for the East Capitol Center for Change to support mentoring and counseling programs. MDAs would provide financial incentives for married couples with adjusted gross incomes below $50,000 and net assets below $10,000, offering a 3:1 match on savings up to $9,000 for purposes like home purchase, education, or starting a business. Engaged couples and individuals with adjusted gross incomes below $25,000 could also benefit from the program. The Marriage Development Accounts (MDAs) program in the District of Columbia offers financial incentives for low-income married couples with adjusted gross incomes below $25,000, providing a maximum match of $4,500. Life skills training is also included through local non-profit organizations. Critics argue that there are more important reasons for marriage than financial incentives. The program is similar to Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) designed to assist low-income individuals in increasing savings and improving financial futures. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) provide a 2:1 match for monthly savings to help individuals buy their first home, pay for college, or start a small business. Eligibility is not based on marriage, with income limits for couples and individuals in the District. The House bill does not have a similar provision."
