    "content": "In the first session of the 113th Congress, immigration reform was a key issue. The Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill (S. 744) addressing border security, employment verification, legalization of unauthorized aliens, and visas. The House took a different approach with separate bills on border security, interior enforcement, employment verification, and visas. Both chambers also considered other immigration-related legislation. In response to the surge in arrivals of unaccompanied minors from Central America, the House passed a supplemental appropriations bill in 2014 (H.R. 5230) with provisions related to unaccompanied alien children (UAC). This bill includes changes to screening and processing procedures for UACs arriving at the U.S. border from certain countries. Additionally, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-4) addresses noncitizen victims of domestic abuse, human trafficking, and care for unaccompanied alien children. Multiple other UAC-related bills were introduced in the 113th Congress but have not advanced legislatively. The 113th Congress enacted multiple immigration-related bills, including provisions on temporary nonagricultural workers, refugees, special immigrants, and international adoption. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for border security to protect the country from various threats. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for border security, controlling official ports of entry and patrolling land and maritime borders to prevent illegal entries. U.S. Customs and Border Protection protects international land borders and coastal shorelines, conducting immigration and customs inspections at ports of entry. The U.S. Border Patrol enforces immigration law and federal laws along the border, with apprehensions of unauthorized migrants declining since FY2005. Border security has been a significant issue for Congress, with some members proposing strengthening it as part of comprehensive immigration reform. Debate in the 113th Congress focused on strategy, personnel, equipment, infrastructure, entry-exit system improvements, and DHS's access to federal lands and waiver authority. The Senate passed S. 744, which requires DHS to develop a Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy and a Southern Border Fencing Strategy. It includes plans for deploying surveillance equipment and 700 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southern border. The Senate passed S. 744, requiring DHS to develop a Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy and a Southern Border Fencing Strategy. The goal is to achieve \"effective control\" of all Border Patrol sectors along the southern border with persistent surveillance and a 90% effectiveness rate. DHS must report biannually on implementation, including sector-level effectiveness rates and alien recidivism. The Senate passed S. 744, requiring DHS to develop a Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy and a Southern Border Fencing Strategy. If effective control is not achieved within five years, additional border security recommendations will be issued by a Southern Border Security Commission. H.R. 1417 also requires DHS to develop a Strategy to Secure the Border, but does not specify assets or miles of fencing. The House bill H.R. 1417 requires DHS to design a strategy for gaining and maintaining operational control of the border with specific deadlines. It includes metrics for illegal migration, recidivism, drug seizures, and collaboration with outside partners for review. The Senate-passed S. 744 bill aims to increase border enforcement resources, including doubling the number of Border Patrol agents to 38,405 and deploying more surveillance equipment, fencing, and infrastructure assets. DHS and GAO would submit regular reports to Congress on achieving and maintaining operational control of the southern border. The Senate-passed S. 744 bill aims to increase border enforcement resources, including doubling the number of Border Patrol agents to 38,405 and deploying more surveillance equipment, fencing, and infrastructure assets. It would also support recent CBP efforts to increase criminal prosecutions for border crossers and allocate funding to triple the number of prosecutions in the Border Patrol's Tucson sector. The bill includes about $45 billion in direct spending on border enforcement over a 5-10 year period. The Senate bill S. 1691 aims to provide funds for National Guard deployment to the southern border to support border operations, especially in high-traffic areas with unaccompanied alien children crossings. It also proposes a new overtime compensation system for Border Patrol agents to reflect their work hours. Additionally, the bill updates the Border Patrol pay system and aligns with the requirements of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 for maintaining an automated entry-exit system. The Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM), formerly known as US-VISIT, collects entry-exit data for DHS and other federal agencies. Legislation in the 113th Congress focuses on improving the exit tracking system. The legislation in the 113th Congress aims to implement a biometric exit system at U.S. ports of entry within 180 days or alternative plans within two years for security. The Strengthen and Fortify Enforcement (SAFE) Act requires DHS to establish a biometric entry-exit system within two years. Senate-passed S. 744 mandates air and sea carriers to collect passport data from departing passengers for DHS within two years. The legislation in the 113th Congress aims to establish a biometric exit system at U.S. airports with the highest international travel volume. DHS must expand biometric data collection to 30 airports and develop a plan for land and sea ports. The bill also requires DHS to locate and remove visa overstays, with a focus on those overstaying by more than 180 days. Additionally, the southern border, including federal and tribal lands, is identified as high-risk for marijuana smuggling and illegal migration. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is not the lead law enforcement agency on USDA and DOI lands, but they have signed MOUs for information sharing on border security. Some Members of Congress argue for increased DHS access to public lands for law enforcement, while Border Patrol officials state existing MOUs allow them to carry out their mission. Legislation in the 113th Congress would broaden DHS authority on federal lands, requiring immediate access for certain security activities in Arizona. The DHS Secretary can access USDA and DOI lands within 100 miles of international borders for security activities. Legislation may waive environmental review requirements to expedite border infrastructure construction. The Senate-passed S. 744 grants the DHS Secretary authority to waive laws for expedited construction of barriers and infrastructure along the southern border. The waiver authority would end once border security strategies are substantially implemented. House-passed bills also exempt specific laws for CBP border construction projects on federal lands. The Immigration and Nationality Act establishes rules for foreign nationals' admission, presence, and departure. Violations can result in civil penalties, criminal fines, imprisonment, and immigration consequences. Legislative proposals aim to modify enforcement provisions in the INA. The House Judiciary Committee and Senate-passed S. 744 would modify enforcement provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act, heightening penalties for immigration violations and establishing new grounds for inadmissibility and deportability. H.R. 2278 imposes more significant penalties and stricter requirements for detention and removal of aliens compared to S. 744. Both bills also make changes to existing immigration-related criminal offenses, including passport and document fraud. The proposed modifications in H.R. 2278 and S. 744 aim to address passport and immigration-related document fraud, smuggling, and harboring of unauthorized aliens. The bills would widen the scope of proscribed conduct and increase criminal penalties, particularly in aggravating circumstances. They also revise statutes on unlawful entry and reentry by aliens, with H.R. 2278 explicitly covering illegal border crossings regardless of surveillance. S. 744 introduces a new offense for hindering apprehension of unlawfully entering aliens. S. 744 and H.R. 2278 propose changes to address illegal entry and presence of aliens in the United States. S. 744 would eliminate criminal penalties for unlawful entry and provide defenses for certain cases, while H.R. 2278 would make unlawful presence a criminal offense, including violations of admission terms or parole. The INA prohibits certain activities for aliens, such as criminal conduct and threats to U.S. security. Aliens convicted of aggravated felonies face significant immigration consequences. Both S. 744 and H.R. 2278 introduce new grounds for alien inadmissibility and deportability, including fraud-related offenses and involvement in criminal street gangs. Domestic violence and child crimes are also covered under the modified grounds of inadmissibility. Both S. 744 and H.R. 2278 introduce new grounds for alien inadmissibility and deportability, including crimes of domestic violence, child abuse, stalking, violation of protection orders, multiple DUI offenses, withholding information for biometric screening, severe human rights violations, aggravated felony convictions, and firearms offenses. Immigration authorities can consider extrinsic evidence when determining removability under specified grounds. Both bills make changes to the INA's definition. Both H.R. 2278 and S. 744 propose changes to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including new grounds for alien inadmissibility and deportability. H.R. 2278 focuses on designating criminal convictions for unlawful entry, presence, or reentry as aggravated felonies, while S. 744 increases immigration authorities' discretion to waive certain grounds of inadmissibility. Both bills aim to give immigration judges more discretion in removal proceedings, considering factors like public interest, hardship to immediate relatives, and eligibility for naturalization. H.R. 2278 proposes waivers for certain criminal and national security grounds for inadmissibility and deportability. It also modifies immigration consequences for criminal activity, making some aliens ineligible for relief from removal. Additionally, it expands streamlined removal proceedings for criminal aliens. The House-passed defense authorization bill for 2015 (H.R. 4435) and the Senate version (S. 2410) contain provisions to limit the application of terrorism-related provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to specific Kurdish political parties. S. 744 aims to reduce the number of aliens held in DHS custody during removal proceedings by requiring detention only if the Secretary of DHS proves that no alternatives would ensure the alien's appearance at immigration proceedings and the safety of others. The bill would generally require immigration judges to determine if an alien's continued detention is necessary. It also includes provisions for a secure alternatives program for aliens not eligible for bail. H.R. 2278 aims to enhance immigration authorities' ability to detain aliens identified for removal, particularly those involved in criminal activity or deemed a threat to the community. Some provisions focus on ensuring certain categories of aliens remain detained until removal, including unlawfully present aliens convicted of DUI offenses. The bill aims to enhance immigration authorities' ability to detain aliens involved in criminal activity or deemed a threat to the community. It includes provisions for mandatory detention of unlawfully present aliens convicted of DUI offenses and those involved with criminal street gangs. The Obama Administration has issued guidance on prosecutorial discretion in immigration enforcement, emphasizing focusing resources on enforcement priorities and promoting humanitarian interests. The bill H.R. 2278 responds to the Obama Administration's immigration initiatives by restricting prosecutorial discretion and enforcing federal immigration law more vigorously. It requires annual reports on prosecutorial discretion and prohibits DHS from implementing DACA. Similar restrictions are found in other related bills. House-passed H.R. 5272 would bar federal funds from considering new or previously adjudicated DACA applications, authorizing deferred action for certain unlawfully present aliens, and providing work authorization for aliens not lawfully admitted or in lawful immigration status. States and localities have shown interest in enforcing federal immigration law independently due to perceived inadequate federal enforcement. States and localities have debated independently enforcing federal immigration law and penalizing activities that could assist in federal immigration enforcement. The Supreme Court's decision in Arizona v. United States clarified the limited ability of states and local officers to enforce federal immigration law separately from federal sanctions. The Supreme Court ruled that states have a limited role in immigration enforcement and cannot arrest aliens without federal authorization. H.R. 2278 aims to override this ruling by allowing states to engage in immigration enforcement activities. The bill H.R. 2278 aims to allow states and localities to impose their own criminal penalties for violations of federal immigration law, increase information sharing between federal, state, and local authorities, and condition federal funding on cooperation with immigration enforcement. It also includes provisions for employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement to reduce unauthorized immigration. Employers must comply with Section 274A of the INA, which prohibits hiring unauthorized aliens. They must verify new hires' identity and work eligibility through the I-9 system. Violations may result in civil or criminal penalties enforced by ICE. Employers can also use E-Verify for electronic verification. E-Verify, administered by USCIS, allows electronic verification of new hires' employment authorization through SSA and DHS databases. It is a temporary program authorized through September 30, 2015. Bills in the 113th Congress propose a new electronic verification system modeled on E-Verify. The House Judiciary Committee has ordered the Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 1772) to be reported, while S. 744 includes provisions on employment eligibility verification. Both bills aim to amend the INA for permanent authorization of the new system. The new electronic verification system proposed in H.R. 1772 would be mandatory for all employers in cases of hiring, recruitment, and referral. Verification requirements would be phased in by employer size, with the largest employers required to participate six months after enactment and the smallest employers required to participate two years after enactment. Mandatory reverification of workers with temporary work authorization would also be phased in on the same schedule. H.R. 1772 proposes a new electronic verification system that would be mandatory for all employers, phased in by employer size. Special provisions apply to agriculture, with hiring, recruitment, and reverification not applying to agricultural workers initially. Employers could conduct electronic verification after offering employment and could condition job offers on final verification. Verification of previously hired individuals would be mandatory in certain cases, and DHS could authorize critical infrastructure employers to use the system for protection. H.R. 1772 proposes a new electronic verification system for all employers, with increased penalties for violations. It includes provisions for blocking social security numbers in case of misuse and allows individuals to limit their information for verification. The bill also preempts any state or local laws related to hiring, employment, or verification. H.R. 1772 proposes a new electronic verification system for all employers, with increased penalties for violations. It preempts any state or local laws related to hiring, employment, or verification of unauthorized aliens. The bill also includes provisions for blocking social security numbers in case of misuse and allows individuals to limit their information for verification. Additionally, the bill directs DHS to establish an office for receiving complaints from state and local agencies about potential violations and establishes an Identity Authentication Employment Eligibility Pilot Program. Senate-passed S. 744, like H.R. 1772, proposes a new Electronic Verification System (EVS) for all employers to confirm employee-provided information and verify identity using a photo tool. The EVS would be mandatory for hiring, recruitment, and referral for a fee, with verification requirements phased in on a different timetable. All federal agencies would be required to participate. The EVS would be mandatory for all federal agencies and federal contractors, with phased-in verification requirements. DHS could direct critical infrastructure employers to participate in the EVS one year after implementing regulations are published. Other employers would phase in participation for newly hired employees and those with expiring employment authorization documents. The bill S. 744 establishes processes for individuals to seek review of final nonconfirmations in the EVS, allows individuals to limit the use of their social security numbers for verification, and provides for privacy and accuracy audits. S. 744 would establish procedures for filing and investigating unlawful employment-related complaints, increase penalties for unauthorized employment violations, and create new penalties for non-compliance with the electronic verification system. S. 744 includes language preempting state or local laws related to employment eligibility of unauthorized aliens, with exceptions for business licensing laws. Unlike H.R. 1772, it does not allow for state enforcement of unauthorized employment provisions. DOS and DHS oversee alien admissions to the U.S., with visa applicants undergoing admissibility reviews by consular officers. Consular officers conduct admissibility reviews for visa applicants to the United States, checking for grounds of inadmissibility such as health, criminal history, security concerns, public charge, and previous immigration offenses. The Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) is used to screen applicants, storing records dating back to the mid-1990s, including photos and fingerprints since 2001 and 2007 respectively. The system links to security databases to flag any issues that may affect visa issuance. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established that DHS would issue regulations regarding visa issuances, while DOS would continue to issue visas. There is ongoing debate about which agency should lead in visa issuances. Title IV of H.R. 2278 proposes giving the Secretary of Homeland Security exclusive authority over visa regulations and policies. The bill H.R. 2278 aims to broaden exceptions to confidentiality requirements for sharing visa information with foreign governments. It would limit the waiver of personal interviews for visa applicants, add national security as a reason for interviews, and grant DHS authority to refuse or revoke visas for certain aliens. The Visa Security Program (VSP) allows DHS to refuse or revoke visas for security reasons. ICE special agents assist in screening visa applicants at high-risk consular posts. GAO identified shortcomings in the VSP, including tensions between consular officials and VSP agents. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified several shortcomings in the Visa Security Program (VSP), including tensions between consular officials and VSP agents. GAO expressed concern about the lack of standard operating procedures for VSP agents and ICE's failure to expand the program to key high-risk posts as planned. H.R. 2278 aims to expand the VSP by requiring on-site reviews of visa applications at top high-risk posts and expedited placement of DHS personnel at overseas embassies and consular posts. Nonimmigrants are admitted to the US for a specific purpose and temporary period. Nonimmigrants are admitted to the United States for a specific purpose and temporary period of time. They are required to leave when their visas expire, but some may seek to adjust to lawful permanent resident status. There are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories and over 70 specific types, such as H-2A agricultural workers and F-1 foreign students. The 113th Congress considered legislation to revise nonimmigrant categories for skilled temporary workers. The H-1B visa program allows professional specialty workers to work in the United States for three years, renewable once, with the opportunity to seek LPR status. Current law limits annual H-1B admissions to 65,000, but many are exempt from the cap. Employers must pay H-1B workers the prevailing wage. The H-1B visa program allows professional specialty workers to work in the United States for three years, renewable once, with the opportunity to seek LPR status. Employers must pay H-1B workers the prevailing wage. The employer must provide a copy of the labor attestation to representatives of the bargaining unit where applicable, or must post the labor attestation in conspicuous locations at the work site. Prospective H-1B nonimmigrants must demonstrate to USCIS that they have the requisite education and work experience for the posted positions. S. 744 and H.R. 2131 aim to address perceived H-1B shortages by increasing the annual numerical limits, with a flexible cap ranging from 115,000 to 180,000 annually. Both S. 744 and H.R. 2131 aim to address H-1B shortages by increasing annual numerical limits. S. 744 would exempt up to 25,000 visas for STEM graduates, while H.R. 2131 would raise the cap to 155,000 and add 40,000 visas for STEM graduates with advanced degrees. Both bills would allow spouses of H-1B workers to work and implement measures to protect U.S. workers, such as modifying application requirements and investigating complaints. The proposed bills, S. 744 and H.R. 2131, aim to address H-1B shortages by increasing annual numerical limits and revising prevailing wage schedules. H.R. 2131 would give DOL subpoena powers to ensure employer compliance with H-1B rules. Concerns have been raised about displacement of U.S. workers by L visa holders, who are often comparable in skills and occupations to H-1B workers. The L visa is similar to the H-1B visa but does not have the same labor market attestation requirements. Concerns have been raised about outsourcing and information technology firms using L workers as subcontractors in the U.S. S. 744 would add prohibitions on outsourcing and outplacement of L employees, with special application requirements for opening a new office. DHS would verify multinational companies petitioning for L workers, investigate employer violations for up to 24 months, and DOL would conduct annual compliance audits under H.R. 2131. H.R. 2131 would add new labor market conditions to the INA for L petitions, requiring employers to pay either the actual wage or prevailing wage for L workers. Employers must provide working conditions that do not adversely affect other workers. Current law includes NAFTA TN visas for Canadian and Mexican workers, and E-3 visas for Australians. S. 744 would create a new category for specialty workers from certain countries. S. 744 and H.R. 2131 propose changes to employment-based nonimmigrant visas, including creating a new category for specialty workers from certain countries and extending fraud detection fees to employers of various visa holders. The O visa for individuals with outstanding ability would see amendments for visa portability and flexibility in requirements. Additionally, changes to E-1 and E-2 visa categories for treaty traders and investors are also included in the proposed legislation. The proposed legislation includes changes to E visas for treaty traders and investors, creating a new nonimmigrant X visa for qualified entrepreneurs, and a pathway for E-2 visa holders to become LPRs. The United States no longer enters into treaties of commerce and navigation, but S. 744 would allow E visas for citizens of countries with bilateral investment treaties or free trade agreements. Employers can bring in H-2A and H-2B workers to the United States for temporary or seasonal work, following a multi-step process that includes applying for labor certification from the Department of Labor. This certification ensures there are not enough qualified U.S. workers available and that hiring foreign workers will not negatively impact American workers' wages and conditions. Additionally, prospective employers must attempt to recruit U.S. workers before applying for certification. Various Senate and House bills in the 113th Congress address provisions for lower-skilled temporary workers. Various Senate and House bills in the 113th Congress propose new temporary agricultural worker visas, such as the W-3 and W-4 visas in S. 744 and the H-2C visa in H.R. 1773. These visas would replace the existing H-2A visa program, allowing for nonimmigrant agricultural workers to work beyond temporary or seasonal jobs without requiring DOL labor certification. The Senate and House bills in the 113th Congress propose new temporary agricultural worker visas, such as the W-3 and W-4 visas in S. 744 and the H-2C visa in H.R. 1773. These visas would allow nonimmigrant agricultural workers to work beyond temporary or seasonal jobs without DOL labor certification. S. 744 also includes changes to the H-2B visa program, allowing for additional H-2B workers outside the annual cap with additional requirements for employers. S. 744 proposes new temporary worker visas, including the W-1 visa for nonagricultural temporary workers and the W-2 visa for their spouses and children. The W-1 visa would not be limited to seasonal work and would have different requirements than the H-2B visa. W-1 nonimmigrants would work in lower-skilled occupations in metropolitan areas with low unemployment rates, with the number of positions ranging from 20,000 to 200,000 per year. The W-1 visa proposed in S. 744 would allow nonimmigrants to work in lower-skilled occupations in metropolitan areas with low unemployment rates, with the number of positions ranging from 20,000 to 200,000 per year. An H-2B provision was enacted to allow employers in the seafood industry to bring in H-2B workers without filing another petition. The 113th Congress also considered changes to temporary visa categories for foreign visitors to the United States. S. 744 proposes changes to temporary visa categories for foreign visitors to the United States, including extending the maximum admission time on B tourist visas to 240 days for Canadians over 55 who own property in the US. It also introduces a new nonimmigrant visa category (Y) for those over 55 who own US property. Additionally, the Visa Waiver Program allows nationals from certain countries to enter the US as temporary visitors without a visa. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows aliens to enter the US without a visa if they meet certain criteria, including approval from ESTA and having a nonimmigrant refusal rate of less than 3%. Senate-passed S. 744 proposes changes to the VWP, such as authorizing the Secretary of DHS to make adjustments. S. 744 proposes changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), including allowing the Secretary of DHS to designate a country as a VWP country if their nonimmigrant refusal rate and/or overstay rate is less than 3%. The bill also allows for waivers under certain conditions and revises procedures for terminating a country's participation in the VWP. Additionally, the Corporation for Travel Promotion (Brand USA) funded by a travel promotion fee may expire at the end of the year. H.R. 4450 and H.R. 938/S. 2673 aim to extend the travel promotion fee and admit Israel to the Visa Waiver Program. Changes to the F visa category for foreign students are proposed in S. 744 and H.R. 2131. S. 744 and H.R. 2131 propose changes to the F visa category for foreign students, including allowing dual intent for those seeking bachelor's or graduate degrees. S. 744 also increases accreditation requirements for schools accepting F students and removes the 12-month time limit for foreign students attending public secondary schools. H.R. 5401 aims to terminate the nonimmigrant status of Libyan nationals or foreign nationals acting on behalf of Libyan entities in certain fields. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was mandated by Congress in 1996 and expanded after 9/11. It is administered by ICE's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). SEVP certifies schools for foreign students and is developing SEVIS II to address limitations. S. 744 and H.R. 2278 contain provisions related to SEVP and SEVIS. Both S. 744 and H.R. 2278 would change accreditation requirements for academic institutions and flight schools accepting foreign students, require background checks for SEVIS access, accelerate school certification withdrawal, increase penalties for visa fraud, and prohibit convicted individuals from holding authority at schools accepting foreign students. S. 744 also mandates real-time data transmission from SEVIS to CBP databases within 120 days of enactment. S. 744 would impose fees on program sponsors for summer work/travel exchanges and expand J visa eligibility for specialized work. Immigrants are legal permanent residents subject to numerical limits and preference categories based on family relationships, employment, and geographic diversity. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) sets annual worldwide cap of 675,000 immigrants with per-country limits. Millions of prospective LPRs with approved petitions face backlog for numerically limited visas. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens are admitted outside of numerical limits. S. 744 and H.R. 2131 aim to revise immigration laws. H.R. 2131 would revise numerical limits on legal permanent immigration, eliminate per-country ceiling for employment-based preferences, increase per-country ceiling for family-based preferences, and make substantial changes to visa allocation for family-based and employment-based LPRs. To qualify as a family-based LPR, a foreign national must be related to a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. At least 226,000 family preference LPRs are admitted each year within different categories. The bill S. 744 introduces two \"Merit-Based\" systems for allocating visas, with the second system aiming to reduce or eliminate the current family-based visa queue of 4.3 million individuals with approved immigration petitions. This system would allocate LPR visas to family-preference petitioners who filed before the enactment of the bill. S. 744 introduces a merit-based system to allocate LPR visas to family-preference petitioners who filed before the enactment of the bill. It also reclassifies spouses and minor unmarried children of LPRs as immediate relatives, exempting them from family-preference numerical limits and reallocating family-preference visas. S. 744 introduces a merit-based system to allocate LPR visas to family-preference petitioners. It reclassifies spouses and minor unmarried children of LPRs as immediate relatives, exempting them from numerical limits and reallocating family-preference visas. Adult unmarried children of U.S. citizens, LPRs, and married children would be capped at different percentages of the worldwide limit, with siblings of U.S. citizens capped at 40%. After 18 months, the bill would eliminate the fourth preference category for adult siblings of U.S. citizens and change the third preference category for adult married children. The bill S. 744 introduces a merit-based system for allocating LPR visas to family-preference petitioners. It caps adult unmarried children of U.S. citizens, LPRs, and married children at different percentages of the worldwide limit. Nonimmigrant V visas would be available for those with approved petitions pending in family preference categories, allowing them to reside in the U.S. until their visas become available and granting work authorization. The current employment-based LPR visa system consists of five numerically limited preference categories based on exceptional ability or employment by a U.S. employer. The INA allocates 140,000 admissions annually for employment-preference immigrants. S. 744 would exempt certain individuals from numerical limits on employment-based LPRs, including derivatives of LPRs, persons of extraordinary ability, outstanding professors, researchers, and certain multinational executives. The Senate bill S. 744 proposes exemptions from numerical limits on employment-based LPRs for individuals with doctorate degrees or STEM graduate degrees from the US within the last five years and a job offer, as well as foreign national physicians who have completed foreign residence requirements. It also includes amendments to existing employment-based preference categories and procedures for admitting employment-based immigrants. The U.S. Senate bill S. 744 proposes changes to employment-based visa categories, including exemptions for individuals with advanced degrees and foreign national physicians. It would allocate 40% of visas to advanced degree holders and increase the allocation for skilled workers. Additionally, H.R. 2131 would eliminate the family-based fourth preference category and the diversity visa lottery. H.R. 2131 proposes reallocating visas to increase employment-based LPR visas to 235,000 per year. It would provide up to 55,000 visas for foreign STEM graduates of U.S. universities, including those with medical, dental, or veterinary degrees. STEM graduates must have completed 85% of their education in the U.S. Any unused visas would be available for master's degree holders in STEM fields. The bill also increases visas for immigrants with advanced degrees and skilled workers with bachelor's degrees. The EB-5 visa program benefits the U.S. economy by creating jobs and bringing in foreign capital. Investors must invest $1 million into a new commercial enterprise to qualify for the visa. After two years, if requirements are met, conditional status is removed. The Regional Center Pilot Program was authorized in 1992 under the EB-5 visa category to focus foreign investment on specific regions. S. 744 and H.R. 2131 would adjust capital requirements by CPI-U, extend conditional LPR status, make the pilot program permanent, and disqualify individuals with certain civil or criminal offenses. Both H.R. 2131 and S. 744 aim to adjust capital requirements for the Regional Center Pilot Program under the EB-5 visa category. They also include provisions to disqualify individuals with certain civil or criminal offenses from owning or managing a regional center. Additionally, the bills create new employment-based preference categories for investors, allowing for about 10,000 new visas per year. The requirements for investment amounts, job creation, and conditional status removal are outlined in both bills. H.R. 2131 and S. 744 propose adjustments to capital requirements for the EB-5 visa program and create new employment-based preference categories for investors. The diversity visa lottery aims to encourage legal immigration from countries with low immigrant admissions in the past five years, but critics argue it is vulnerable to fraud and should be eliminated. Supporters of the diversity visa argue it provides new immigrants for a system weighted toward family-based immigrants. Both S. 744 and H.R. 2131 would repeal the diversity visa lottery, with S. 744 allowing FY2013 and FY2014 diversity visa recipients to obtain LPR status. S. 744 would introduce two new pathways for immigration not dependent on sponsors. The proposed Merit-Based Track One visa in Senate-passed S. 744 would admit 120,000 to 250,000 LPRs annually based on employment skills and expedite the admission of certain people in the existing visa backlog. Unused visas from past years would be recaptured. In FY2018 and subsequent years, visas for employment-based third preference categories would be allocated based on two tiers. Tier 1 factors include education, employment experience, high-demand occupation, entrepreneurship, English language ability, and more. Tier 2 factors include employment experience, high-demand occupations with little to medium preparation, English language ability, and familial relationships to a U.S. citizen. S. 744 proposes a second Merit System with 4 components for employment. The second Merit System (Track Two) proposed in S. 744 includes 4 components for employment preference petitioners and family-preference petitioners with pending petitions for at least five years before enactment. It also includes individuals filing third or fourth preference family petitions within 18 months after enactment and those in a legally present status allowing for employment authorization for 10 years. The Merit-Based Track Two system under S. 744 would issue visas to certain petitioners in backlog reduction categories from FY2015 through FY2021. In FY2022-FY2023, visas would be issued to family petitioners filing after enactment, accommodating those in a legally present status for 10 years. The Merit-Based Track Two system in S. 744 would provide visas to certain family petitioners affected by reforms to the family preference system. It allows individuals with temporary registered provisional immigrant status to adjust to LPR status starting in FY2024. Aliens must have been lawfully present in an employment authorized status for 20 years before applying for LPR status under Track Two, with waivers for unlawful presence. Addressing the unauthorized alien population is a key issue in immigration reform. The Senate's S. 744 proposes legalization programs for unauthorized aliens in the US, with enforcement provisions as pre-conditions.

Blue Card status would be granted to eligible agricultural workers, who could also apply for LPR status. The House has not acted on legislation for a general legalization program for unauthorized aliens. However, a bill (H.R. 1773) would allow certain unauthorized aliens to obtain legal temporary status as H-2C agricultural workers. This bill does not provide a special pathway to LPR status for H-2C workers. Several bills in the 113th Congress address naturalization, with S. 744 streamlining and waiving requirements for certain categories of LPRs, including elderly or disabled applicants, employees of national security facilities, and widows of U.S. citizen spouses.

The Lautenberg amendment, enacted in 1989, facilitated relief for certain refugee groups by requiring less evidence to prove refugee status for former Soviet and Indochinese nationals. The Specter amendment, added in P.L. 108-199, extended this provision to Iranian religious minorities. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) further extended the Lautenberg amendment.

Foreign national spouses of U.S. citizens and LPRs can acquire legal status through family-based immigration provisions. Provisions also exist to assist foreign national victims of domestic abuse in obtaining LPR status independently.

ICE created the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to address concerns about its operations and policies, but some criticize its effectiveness. Some argue that ICE's Public Advocate program is not productive and a misuse of resources. Legislation has attempted to defund the Public Advocate position, which has been renamed as Deputy Assistant Director of Custody Programs and Community Outreach. A proposed bill aims to prohibit federal funds for positions with similar functions within ICE."
