    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act\" and sets minimum standards for residential mortgage loans. Section 129C(b) of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to include a safe harbor provision for qualified mortgage loans originated and retained by covered institutions, complying with prepayment penalty limitations, points and fees requirements, and without negative amortization. The safe harbor provision for qualified mortgage loans under Section 129C(b) of the Truth in Lending Act requires that the loan does not have negative amortization or interest-only terms, and the covered institution must assess the consumer's debt, income, and financial resources. This provision does not apply if the legal title to the loan is transferred to another person. The safe harbor provision for qualified mortgage loans under Section 129C(b) of the Truth in Lending Act allows for the transfer of loans under certain conditions, including bankruptcy, sale to smaller institutions, or merger/acquisition. The safe harbor provision for qualified mortgage loans allows for the transfer of loans under specific conditions, including sale to smaller institutions or a wholly owned subsidiary of the originating institution for regulatory accounting purposes. The safe harbor provision for qualified mortgage loans does not require compliance with certain regulations and defines a \"covered institution\" as one with less than $10,000,000,000 in total assets. The terms 'insured credit union' and 'insured depository institution' are defined in specific sections of federal acts. Additionally, 'interest-only term' and 'negative amortization term' are terms related to residential mortgage loans. The term 'negative amortization term' refers to a residential mortgage loan where periodic payments increase the loan principal. The House of Representatives passed the document on March 6, 2018, with Karen L. Haas as the Clerk."
