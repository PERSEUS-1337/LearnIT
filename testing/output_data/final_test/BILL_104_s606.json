    "content": "The \"Pipeline Safety Enhancement Act of 1995\" is aimed at improving pipeline safety. The Pipeline Safety Enhancement Act of 1995 mandates the Secretary of Transportation to establish toughness standards for new pipes in gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities within 180 days of enactment. The Pipeline Safety Enhancement Act of 1995 requires the Secretary of Transportation to set toughness standards for new pipes in gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities, with a focus on high-density population areas. Additionally, minimum standards for pipeline markings in class 3 and class 4 locations must be established within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Pipeline Safety Enhancement Act of 1995 mandates the identification of hazardous liquid pipeline facilities and high-pressure pipelines in class 3 and class 4 locations. High-pressure pipelines are defined as gas pipelines with pressures higher than those provided to customers. Additionally, testing requirements must be established within one year of the Act's enactment. The Pipeline Safety Enhancement Act of 1995 mandates periodic inspections for gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities to identify damage and ensure safe operation at maximum allowable pressure. The Act also defines maximum allowable operating pressure as the limit set by regulations. The Pipeline Safety Enhancement Act of 1995 requires regular assessments of public education programs for leak detection in pipeline facilities to ensure safety and compliance with regulations. The Secretary of Transportation must conduct these assessments every two years to determine the effectiveness of the programs. The Pipeline Safety Enhancement Act of 1995 mandates regular assessments of public education programs for leak detection in pipeline facilities. The Secretary of Transportation must evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the information and educational techniques used in these programs, compared to similar programs. Upon completion of the assessment, the Secretary will collaborate with officials to establish regulations for program improvement. The Secretary of Transportation is required to expedite a study on reducing public safety risks in pipeline facilities, including building standards. The results of the study must be widely available to state governments and political subdivisions."
