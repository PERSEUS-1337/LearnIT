    "content": "Real property disposal is the process by which federal agencies transfer, donate, or sell real property they no longer need to reduce costs and free up financial resources. In FY2010, the government spent $1.67 billion operating and maintaining 77,700 underutilized buildings. Disposal efforts are hindered by legal and budgetary constraints, as well as competing stakeholder interests. The government faces challenges in efficiently disposing of unneeded properties due to limited oversight and lack of reliable data. This has been a high-risk area since 2003, with a large inventory of underutilized properties incurring costs. Efforts to dispose of these properties are hindered by statutory constraints. Efforts to dispose of unneeded and underutilized properties are hindered by statutory disposal requirements, preparation costs, conflicts with stakeholders, and lack of accurate data. The real property disposal process involves offering excess properties to federal agencies at market value, then offering surplus properties to state and local governments and nonprofits for public purposes specified in statute. Surplus properties can be conveyed at less than fair market value or even at no cost for public benefit. Efforts to dispose of unneeded and underutilized properties are hindered by statutory disposal requirements, preparation costs, conflicts with stakeholders, and lack of accurate data. Agencies face challenges in the disposal process due to statutory requirements that slow down the disposition process, leading to increased operating costs. The McKinney-Vento Act adds up to two years to the disposal process by mandating screening of all surplus properties for homeless use, even if they cannot be conveyed. The disposal of unneeded properties by agencies is hindered by statutory requirements, environmental considerations, and historic preservation laws, leading to increased costs and delays in the process. Agencies must assess potential environmental consequences, develop abatement plans, and consult with historic preservation groups before disposing of properties. This often involves older buildings in their portfolio. Federal agencies often face challenges when disposing of older properties in their portfolio due to the need for expensive repairs and renovations to meet health, safety, and historic preservation standards. For example, the VA may need to spend $3 billion to repair buildings in poor condition, with 56% being vacant or underutilized. Demolishing vacant buildings can also be costly, sometimes exceeding the cost of maintenance, leading property managers to retain them. Compliance with environmental regulations is frequently cited as a significant cost factor. Federal agencies often struggle with disposing of older properties due to costly repairs and renovations needed to meet standards. Compliance with environmental regulations adds to the expenses, with agencies required to assess and pay for cleanup before disposal. Stakeholder involvement and competing agendas further complicate disposal efforts, with the Department of the Interior and VA facing challenges from local governments, historic preservation offices, and community opposition. The Department of State faces challenges in disposing of surplus real property overseas due to disputes with host governments. This can lead to delays or cancellations of disposals, hindering agencies from reducing their inventories. Data on agency real property portfolios are inaccurate, and government-wide data is only accessible to the General Services Administration. Agencies often opt for leasing rather than new construction when acquiring space. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) managed by GSA collects data on real property from 24 major agencies annually. The FRPP data is used for congressional oversight and includes information on excess and surplus properties held by agencies. GSA manages the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) to collect data on real property from major agencies for congressional oversight. However, GSA restricts public access to the data, providing limited information through annual summary reports that hinder individual agency performance monitoring by Congress. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) managed by GSA collects data on real property from major agencies for congressional oversight. However, limited access to data through annual summary reports hinders Congress from monitoring individual agency performance effectively. GAO audits have raised concerns about incomplete and incomparable real property data, limiting their usefulness for analysis. Key data elements such as building utilization, condition, and value are not consistently captured in the database. The GAO report found that the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) database lacks reliable data on property utilization, condition, and value, impacting decision-making. Annual summary reports may misclassify disposal methods, with a significant portion labeled as \"other.\" The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) database lacks reliable data on property utilization, condition, and value, impacting decision-making. Annual summary reports may misclassify disposal methods, with a significant portion labeled as \"other,\" raising concerns about data accuracy and potential misreporting by agencies. The summary report on federal real property only provides the number and costs of disposed assets, omitting ongoing operating costs and repair estimates. GAO has highlighted the government's reliance on costly leased space as a key issue in managing federal real property. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified the high cost of leasing federal real property as a major issue. GSA leases more square footage than it owns, leading to higher expenses compared to owning. For example, a long-term lease cost $40.3 million more than purchasing the same building. Agencies often choose to lease due to operational needs or budget constraints. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 requires agencies to have upfront budget authority for acquiring space, leading them to lease rather than purchase space. Some agencies have independent leasing authority, like USPS and VA, with in-house real property expertise. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a costly leasing decision for excessive space, criticized by its inspector general. H.R. 1734 aims to reduce government inventory of unneeded buildings through an independent commission. H.R. 1734 proposes reducing government inventory of unneeded buildings through an independent commission, excluding certain properties like those held by the Department of Defense and the USPS. H.R. 1734 proposes realigning federal properties to reduce operating costs. Agencies would develop recommendations for realignment and submit data to GSA and OMB. Criteria would be developed to determine which properties should be realigned. The bill proposes realigning federal properties to reduce operating costs by recommending sale or consolidation. Nine principles must be considered, including alignment with agency mission, cost savings, economic impact, and utilization rate. Supporting data may already be collected by agencies for asset management plans or reporting requirements. The bill proposes realigning federal properties to reduce operating costs through consolidation and reconfiguration of space, with a focus on reducing energy consumption. Recommendations from agencies will be reviewed by the OMB Director and GSA Administrator before being submitted to a Civilian Property Realignment Commission for further evaluation and decision-making. The bill proposes the appointment of a Commission to assess agency real property inventories and make recommendations to the President on realigning properties to decrease the federal real property portfolio, reduce costs, and ensure properties are used efficiently. The Commission would include members with expertise in various fields and would terminate after six years. Public hearings would be held, and an accounting system developed to evaluate costs and returns. The bill proposes the appointment of a Commission to assess agency real property inventories, hold public hearings, and develop an accounting system to evaluate costs and returns. The Commission would submit a report to the President with findings, conclusions, and recommendations, including a list of high-value federal properties for potential sale. The sale of these assets could yield significant savings, subject to approval by the President and Congress. The Commission in H.R. 1734 aims to develop consensus in its recommendations, with the report potentially including recommendations supported by a majority of members. The bill also mandates the establishment of a website for posting findings, conclusions, and recommendations. GAO would be required to publish a report on the recommendations and how properties were chosen for realignment. The President must review the recommendations, approve or disapprove within 30 days, and submit a report to Congress. If all recommendations are approved, the President must certify his approval and submit them to Congress. If not, a report must be submitted with reasons for disapproval. The President in H.R. 1734 must approve or disapprove recommendations within 30 days. If approved, a report is submitted to Congress. If not, a revised list can be submitted. The President cannot amend recommendations before approval. Congress then has 45 days to review and vote on the approved recommendations. Congress would have 45 days to review and vote on the approved recommendations. If a joint resolution of approval is not passed within the 45-day limit, agencies would not be required to implement the recommendations. If approved, agencies must begin implementation within two years and complete it within six years, unless extenuating circumstances cause a delay. The GSA Administrator would have the authority to take necessary actions for implementation. The GSA Administrator would have authority to implement Commission recommendations, including sale or exchange of property. Other agencies must use existing authorities or work with GSA. Administrator can convey property for less than fair market value. H.R. 1734 requires evaluation of certain properties for homeless use. H.R. 1734 would require evaluation of properties for homeless use and expand reporting requirements for real property actions exceeding the prospectus threshold. It establishes two accounts for funding and emphasizes the use of life-cycle cost analysis in determining long-term costs. H.R. 1734 establishes two accounts for funding: a salaries and expense account for administrative costs and an asset proceeds and space management fund (APSMF) for implementing recommended actions. The bill authorizes appropriations of $20 million for salaries and expenses and $62 million for APSMF. Sales proceeds from properties recommended by the Commission would also fund APSMF. Executive agencies must acquire leased space through GSA, except for VA properties or those excluded for national security reasons by the President. The requirement in S. 2232 may consolidate leasing decisions with a single agency, potentially limiting GSA's ability to delegate leasing authority. This could cause delays in acquiring space for agency missions. S. 2232 is based on the BRAC model and differs from H.R. 1734 in the size of the independent Commission and Congress's role in approving recommendations. Federal buildings, leased space, and grounds controlled by federal agencies would be subject to S. 2232, with exceptions for properties excluded for national security reasons. Under S. 2232, federal agencies would need to develop recommendations for realigning their property portfolios to reduce costs and submit them to GSA and OMB. The goal is to decrease the federal inventory, cut operating costs, and maximize taxpayer value. Properties excluded from S. 2232 include military installations subject to BRAC, those for national security reasons, USPS properties, and certain Indian and native Eskimo properties. S. 2232 aims to reduce federal property inventory, cut operating costs, and maximize taxpayer value by implementing enhanced use leases and realigning properties based on specific criteria. The bill requires collaboration between the GSA Administrator and OMB Director to develop recommendations for property realignment, considering nine key principles. Additionally, the OMB Director must review agency recommendations, conduct independent analysis, and submit revised recommendations along with criteria for Civilian Property Realignment. The revised recommendations, along with criteria, will be submitted to a new Civilian Property Realignment Commission under S. 2232. The seven-member Commission would be appointed by the President, Senate, and House leaders, with expertise in real estate, government management, community development, or historic preservation. Each member would serve a six-year term and independently analyze agency property portfolios to provide recommendations. The Civilian Property Realignment Commission under S. 2232 would independently analyze agency real property portfolios, receive data from various sources, hold public hearings, and identify high-value federal properties for potential sale. Under S. 2232, a Civilian Property Realignment Commission would recommend high-value federal properties for sale to the President, who must approve and sell them within 120 days at fair market value. The Commission would also identify overseas assets managed by the Department of State for potential sale. The President's review process and reporting requirements are similar to those in H.R. 1734. The President must approve or reject the Commission's recommendations on high-value federal properties within 120 days. If approved, the recommendations are submitted to Congress. If rejected, the President must provide reasons, and the Commission can revise the recommendations. If the revised recommendations are approved, they are submitted to Congress. Failure to act within 30 days results in termination of the disposal process for the year. Under S. 2232, Congress would only be able to approve or reject a complete list of recommended realignment actions within 45 days. If no action is taken, agencies must implement the recommendations. Certain committees and legislative branch agencies would have access to the FRPP data to evaluate the recommendations. Under S. 2232, access to FRPP data would be provided to the Congressional Research Service, Government Accountability Office, and Congressional Budget Office. Agencies must implement recommendations within three years, with exemptions for properties recommended for disposal or realignment actions. S. 2232 aims to establish a streamlined disposal process for properties recommended for public benefit conveyance, including homeless use. The Secretary of HUD would have 30 days to determine suitability for homeless use, with interested parties given 30 days to submit proposals. Reporting requirements for real property actions exceeding the prospectus threshold would also be changed. S. 2232 would establish a dollar amount threshold for agency approval, require prospectuses to include life-cycle cost analysis, exempt smaller buildings from certain requirements, and mandate the inclusion of net present value for proposed leases. S. 2232 would establish two accounts for agencies to obtain leases through GSA, with exemptions for USPS and VA. It includes a one-time appropriation of $20 million for salaries and expenses and $62 million for the Asset Proceeds and Space Management Fund (APSMF), which would also receive proceeds from property sales. S. 2178, introduced on March 8, 2012, focuses on real property management, emphasizing performance measures, agency consolidation, and federal leasing process examination. It applies to federal buildings except for DOD properties under BRAC legislation and those excluded for national security reasons. S. 2178 focuses on real property management for federal buildings, excluding DOD properties under BRAC legislation and those excluded for national security reasons. It defines \"underutilized\" properties and requires landholding agencies to develop a system for managing their real property holdings, including identifying and reducing underutilized properties. S. 2178 aims to improve real property management for federal buildings by reassigning underutilized properties, transferring them to other agencies, and adopting efficient workplace practices. It also establishes the Federal Real Property Council to oversee these efforts. S. 2178 aims to improve real property management for federal buildings by reassigning underutilized properties, transferring them to other agencies, and adopting efficient workplace practices. The Federal Real Property Council, established by Executive Order 13327 under President George W. Bush, would not change its structure under S. 2178. However, the bill would expand the council's duties to include publishing an annual asset management plan with performance measures for tracking government-wide progress and comparing agency performance. The bill would require agencies to submit an annual report on federal real property to specific Senate and House committees. The report must include data on property inventory, age, condition, operating costs, and relevance to agency missions. It would also cover leasing information not regularly reported, such as co-located field offices and inefficiencies in the leasing process. The bill requires agencies to submit an annual report on federal real property to Senate and House committees, including data on property inventory, condition, and operating costs. It also addresses inefficiencies in the leasing process and underutilized properties, with a focus on reducing leased space for long-term needs when more cost-effective. The report must include an analysis of underutilized property by agency and a disposal strategy for properties that can be sold, transferred, or demolished. Additionally, an asset disposal plan with annual goals, disposal methods, savings, and evaluation criteria is required. The FRPC would review leases, renegotiate for savings, and prepare annual scorecards for agencies. S. 2178 requires identifying field offices for co-location with other federal assets, with a 90-day process involving OMB and USPS. The Postal Reorganization Act (PRA) of 1970 gave USPS independent authority over its real estate, allowing it to acquire and dispose of properties as needed. This autonomy was granted by Congress to ensure USPS's financial self-sufficiency and operational efficiency. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 granted USPS independent authority over its real estate to maintain an efficient mail collection and delivery system nationwide. This authority allows USPS to adjust its operational footprint based on population shifts and technological advancements. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 granted USPS independent authority over its real estate to maintain an efficient mail collection and delivery system nationwide. The co-location provisions in Section 2 of S. 2178 may not significantly change USPS's authority over its properties, as it excludes properties under USPS control. However, there is ambiguity in the definition of \"postal property\" and \"agency field office,\" which could impact USPS-owned properties. S. 2178 would reduce USPS's property authority by directing co-location of federal agencies in USPS-owned facilities, with proceeds deposited in the Postal Service Fund. Agencies with leasing authority must consult GSA for leases exceeding set thresholds, acquire space at comparable rates, and submit reports on independent leasing within 180 days of enactment. S. 2178 requires agencies to submit a report within 180 days describing independent leasing authority. The bill also mandates the creation of a comprehensive database of federal real property accessible to the public. Additionally, it streamlines the disposal process for underutilized properties, allowing for transfer, sale, conveyance, or demolition. The bill streamlines the disposal process for underutilized properties, allowing for transfer, sale, conveyance, or demolition. GSA would be repaid through proceeds of any sale, with 80% going to debt reduction and the rest as authorized. Properties selected for disposal would be exempt from certain provisions, such as offering them for public benefit conveyance. The bill streamlines the disposal process for underutilized properties, allowing for transfer, sale, conveyance, or demolition. Proceeds from sales would go towards debt reduction, with a portion allocated for homeless assistance grants. Agencies must use the funds within one year for real property asset management and disposal. Underutilized properties not sold within two years may be transferred to state/local governments or nonprofits, except for certain criteria. The FRPC would report on agencies not meeting disposal goals and issue an annual scorecard to measure success. S. 2178 allows HUD to provide grants to nonprofits for property acquisition or rehabilitation. Nonprofits receiving grant funds must use them to acquire or rehabilitate property for homeless services for at least 15 years. Section 202 requires the FRPC to consider life-cycle costs for properties with construction costs over $1 million or leased space over 25,000 square feet. The life-cycle costs include investment, capital, installation, energy, operating, maintenance, and repair expenses over 50 years. H.R. 665, passed by the House, is related to this legislation. H.R. 665, passed by the House on March 20, 2012, aims to reform real property disposal by expediting the process for high-value properties, establishing a public property database, and reducing unneeded properties in federal portfolios. The bill proposes a disposal program where the 15 federal properties with the highest value and selling potential would be auctioned off immediately. The expedited disposal program under H.R. 665 aims to sell high-value properties through public auction, maintaining a pool of 15 properties for sale at all times. Certain properties are excluded from the program, and sales must meet fair market value criteria. Properties selected for the program are exempt from various statutory provisions. H.R. 665 aims to sell high-value properties for homeless use and public benefit conveyance. Proceeds from property disposal would go to the Treasury's General Fund, with 2% allocated for homeless assistance grants. HUD can use the proceeds for grants to nonprofit organizations aiding the homeless. GSA would issue guidance on real property plans, including identifying excess properties and prioritizing disposal decisions based on agency missions. Executive agencies must maintain inventory controls and identify underutilized properties. H.R. 665 requires agencies to develop real property plans, categorize all owned properties, set goals to reduce excess inventory, and reassign or dispose of underutilized properties promptly. Agencies must prioritize transferring underutilized properties within the agency or to other federal agencies before acquiring nonfederal property. GSA will issue a report within three years detailing agencies' efforts to reduce excess properties. H.R. 665 requires agencies to categorize and dispose of excess properties promptly. Proceeds from disposals would be used for real property activities, with any remaining funds going towards deficit reduction. GSA would establish a database of federal real properties for transparency. The database required under S. 2178 must include property location, size, utilization level, operating costs, and replacement value. It must be accessible to the public for free, in a machine-readable format. H.R. 665 mandates agencies to divert 50% of construction and demolition materials by 2015, without defining \"divert\" but typically meaning recycling or reusing materials. H.R. 665 would not require reporting properties for homeless assistance in areas with restricted public access for national security reasons. It also mandates diverting 50% of construction and demolition materials by 2015. The bill would change the publication of surplus properties approved for homeless assistance from the Federal Register to HUD or GSA websites. Comparisons of key provisions in H.R. 1734, S. 2232, S. 2178, and H.R. 665 are shown in Table 1. The Civilian Property Realignment Commission (CPRC) would be responsible for final recommendations to Congress. Both bills require Senate consent and consultation with leaders to influence the commission. S. 2178 utilizes the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) for asset management plans and disposal recommendations. Membership on the FRPC does not require congressional approval. The proposed legislation, subject to congressional approval, aims to involve real property officials in improving management by developing asset management principles and policies. Agency heads would recommend properties for disposal, with final selections made by the OMB Director and GSA Administrator. The bills would require a 45-day timeframe for congressional action, potentially reducing oversight of major real property actions. Consolidation efforts, such as the Department of Homeland Security at St. Elizabeth's in D.C., can cost billions and require congressional approval. Similar concerns exist for the consolidation of the Food and Drug Administration headquarters. Congress may face time constraints in approving these projects. Under proposed time constraints, Congress may not have enough time to approve or disapprove recommendations. S. 2178 and H.R. 665 would not require Congress to approve a list of recommendations, as they are managed by executive agencies. This could reduce conflict among stakeholders involved in property disposal efforts. In 2002, the USPS identified facilities to close to reduce costs, facing complications from state and local governments, nonprofits, businesses, and community leaders with competing agendas. The USPS identified facilities to close in order to reduce operating costs, but faced political pressure from stakeholders which led to abandoning some closure plans. Moving decision-making to an independent commission could reduce stakeholder pressure. Failure by Congress to approve the Commission's recommendations under H.R. 1734 would mean agencies are not required to implement any closures. If Congress fails to pass a joint resolution of disapproval of the Commission's recommendations, as proposed under S. 2232, the recommendations would become law and agencies must implement them. The joint resolution of disapproval could make it harder to stop recommendations from becoming law, especially if the President vetoes it. Agencies argue that public benefits conveyance requirements, like screening for homeless use, create delays and increase maintenance costs. Bypassing screening requirements could generate savings in property disposal. Under H.R. 1734, agencies would not be allowed to exceed their current authorities when disposing of properties as recommended, but GSA could take necessary actions to implement the Commission's recommendations. Specific properties identified for disposal may bypass certain statutory requirements, such as public benefit conveyance. In contrast, S. 2232, H.R. 665, and S. 2178 exempt properties from public benefit conveyance requirements, with H.R. 665 applying only to 15 \"high-value\" properties at a time, while S. 2232 and S. 2178 exemptions apply to all properties. H.R. 1734 would require a report with \"relevant information\" about the Commission's recommendations to be posted on a federal website. It also mandates GAO to analyze the recommendation and selection process, with the Commission having access to detailed property data. The Commission would have access to detailed data on each property's age, condition, operating costs, size, and number of employees. S. 2232 would make the central database of government-wide real property information available to committees and legislative agencies for evaluating recommendations and developing legislation. Agency recommendations would be published in the Federal Register. S. 2178 would require the FRPC to submit a report to committees with FRPP access containing descriptive data and recommendations for reducing leased space, disposing of properties, and renegotiating leases to reduce costs. GSA would establish a descriptive database available to the public at no cost. The bill H.R. 665 would require GSA to establish a database of federal real properties accessible to the public at no cost, with detailed information and search capabilities similar to the FRPP. The data quality and scope could impact its usefulness for decision-making and analysis. The bills analyzed in this report establish procedures for selecting federal properties to sell and distributing sales proceeds towards further real property disposals and reducing the federal deficit or debt. However, the lack of basic data needed for analysis makes it unclear how much revenue might be generated under each bill. The FRPP data show that sales of federal properties have not generated significant net proceeds in recent years due to high costs of preparing properties for market. Proposed bills like S. 2232 and H.R. 1734 aim to increase revenue by selling properties in more desirable locations or with lower preparation costs. Proposed bills like S. 2232 and H.R. 1734 aim to recommend valuable properties for sale, even if they are not declared excess or surplus, potentially increasing revenue by bringing these properties to the market. The pilot program aims to increase sales revenue and net proceeds by auctioning 15 valuable properties most likely to sell at a high market value. Investing real property funds in bringing these properties to market sooner can reduce operating and maintenance costs, yielding greater annual savings than net proceeds from sales. In FY2010, the government reduced annual operating costs by $274 million through disposal methods, four times the amount of net proceeds from sales in FY2009. In FY2010, the government reduced annual operating costs by $274 million through disposal methods, four times the amount of net proceeds from sales in FY2009. The government could generate more value by quickly disposing of some properties rather than attempting to sell them, depending on factors like likelihood of sale, market costs, and potential net proceeds exceeding operating costs."
