American Airlines will be the first to offer direct flights from Miami to Havana in late November. Congressional concerns about political and economic developments in Cuba have shaped U.S. policy towards the island nation for years, with key legislation like the Cuban Democracy Act and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act imposing economic sanctions while providing a path for normalization of relations. Congress modified its sanctions-based policy towards Cuba a decade ago with the Trade Sanctions. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 partially modified U.S. sanctions towards Cuba, allowing for agricultural exports. Congressional actions in 2009 and 2011 eased restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba. The Obama Administration further eased restrictions on family travel, cash remittances, educational and religious travel, and non-family remittances.

For more on Cuba from CRS, see CRS In Focus IF10045, Cuba: U.S. Policy Overview, and CRS Insight IN10616, Fidel Castro's Death: Implications for Cuba and U.S. Policy. The text chunk discusses various CRS reports and insights related to Cuba, including Fidel Castro's death, President Obama's visit to Cuba, U.S. sanctions, restrictions on travel and remittances, agricultural trade, and Guantanamo Bay. Cuba gained independence in 1902 after being a Spanish colony for centuries. The drive for independence grew stronger in the 19th century, culminating in the Spanish-American War. The United States ruled Cuba for four years following the war. After gaining independence in 1902, Cuba still allowed the United States to intervene to maintain stability under the Platt Amendment. The US intervened militarily three times between 1906 and 1921. Cuba's political system was often dominated by authoritarian figures, including Gerardo Machado and Fulgencio Batista. Batista was elected president in 1940 but was voted out in 1944. Fulgencio Batista was elected president in 1940 but was voted out in 1944. He seized power in a coup in 1952, leading to a brutal dictatorship. Fidel Castro's unsuccessful attack in 1953 led to his exile in Mexico, where he formed the 26th of July Movement. Castro returned to Cuba in 1956 to overthrow Batista, who fled the country on January 1, 1959, leading to Castro's 47-year rule. Fidel Castro ruled Cuba for 47 years until stepping down in 2006 due to poor health. He consolidated his power, repressed dissent, and aligned with the Soviet Union while expropriating U.S. properties. Cuba became a close ally of the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. Castro declared the Cuban revolution socialist in 1961 and proclaimed himself a Marxist-Leninist later that year. After ruling by decree from 1959 to 1976, Fidel Castro established the Cuban Communist Party as the leading force in state and society. The Constitution outlined governmental structures with power centralized in a Political Bureau. The National Assembly of People's Power holds legislative authority, with the president of the Council of State serving as head of state and government. Executive power is vested in a Council of Ministers headed by the president of the Council of State. Fidel Castro served as head of state and government as president of the Council of State from 1976 until February 2008. Despite temporarily stepping down in 2006 due to poor health, he retained his position. In January 2008, he was reelected to the National Assembly, but speculation arose that he might not be reelected as president of the Council of State due to his health. Castro hinted at his potential departure in December 2007. After Fidel Castro hinted at retirement in December 2007, he officially announced on February 19, 2008, that he would not accept the position as president of the Council of State, confirming his departure as head of the Cuban government. Ra\u00fal Castro succeeded him as president in February 2008, maintaining stability in Cuba's political succession. Ra\u00fal Castro implemented economic reforms but retained tight control over the political system, backed by a strong security apparatus. The Cuban Communist Party held its sixth congress in April. The Cuban Communist Party (PCC) held its sixth congress in April 2011, focusing on economic changes and political reforms. Ra\u00fal Castro replaced Fidel as first secretary of the PCC and proposed term limits for top positions. In 2012, the PCC approved systematic rejuvenation and the replacement of 20% of its Central Committee members. In 2013, elections were held for the National Assembly and provincial government representatives under Cuba's one-party system. In 2013, the new National Assembly in Cuba selected Ra\u00fal Castro for a second five-year term as president of the Council of State. Castro indicated that this would be his last term, and a younger official, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez, was chosen as the first vice president. Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, an engineer by training, was appointed as the official successor to Castro in Cuba's political system. He has held various positions within the Politburo and the Council of State, showing his experience as a manager with good relations with the military. Despite being seen as still in Ra\u00fal's shadow, D\u00edaz-Canel is considered a key figure in the Cuban government's generational change. The Cuban military has taken on a prominent role in the transition to a post-Castro government, with several military officers serving as ministers. President Castro mentioned a generational transfer of power, but historical leadership was maintained when a new Minister of the Interior was appointed in 2015. In 2015, General Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Gond\u00edn replaced Colom\u00e9 as MININT First Vice Minister. The PCC's seventh party congress in April 2016 lacked details and consultation compared to the 2011 congress. Ra\u00fal Castro highlighted the need to reestablish a single currency to address economic distortions. Only 21% of the 300 economic guidelines from the 2011 congress had been implemented, with 268 new guidelines proposed for updating the economic model. During the congress, 268 guidelines were proposed to update Cuba's economic model, with 193 modified, 31 unchanged, and 44 new guidelines. Castro emphasized a cautious approach to economic reform. He suggested age limits of 60 for joining the Central Committee and 70 for leadership positions, to be implemented through constitutional reforms with a five-year transition period. At the congress, Castro and Machado Ventura were reelected as first and second secretaries of the PCC. The Central Committee membership increased to 142, with 55 new members under 60 years old. Castro plans to step down as President in 2018 but may remain as first secretary of the PCC. Fidel Castro passed away in 2016. After stepping down in 2006, Fidel Castro continued to influence Cuban politics through essays that criticized his brother Ra\u00fal's rule. His death marks a generational change in the Cuban government, with hopes for accelerated reforms. President Obama extended condolences and offered friendship to the Cuban people, recognizing Fidel's significant impact on history. The President acknowledged the efforts to improve relations between the US and Cuba despite political disagreements. The Cuban government has a poor human rights record, restricting freedoms and harassing dissident organizations like the Ladies in White and the Patriotic Union of Cuba. The Patriotic Union of Cuba, led by Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer Garc\u00eda, was established in 2011 by dissident groups to peacefully fight for civil liberties and human rights. Two Cuban political prisoners died in recent years after conducting hunger strikes to protest inhumane conditions in prisons. Despite poor human rights conditions, Cuba has made some advancements, such as lifting a ban on Cubans staying in hotels in 2008. In recent years, Cuba has made significant changes, including lifting a ban on Cubans staying in hotels previously restricted to foreign tourists and eliminating the requirement for exit permits and letters of invitation for travel abroad. The government has also released political prisoners, with the help of the Cuban Catholic Church, including members of the \"group of 75.\" These actions have allowed dissidents and human rights activists to travel abroad and return to Cuba. In the aftermath of the December 2014 shift in U.S. policy toward Cuba, the Cuban government released 53 political prisoners, including five dissidents named as prisoners of conscience by Amnesty International. Two prisoners had been imprisoned since 2012 and 2013 for \"dangerousness,\" while three brothers were members of UNPACU and detained in 2012, convicted in 2014 for \"public disorder.\" In December 2014, three dissidents charged with \"public disorder\" were released from prison, including Sonia Garro Alfonso, Ram\u00f3n Alejandro Mu\u00f1oz Gonz\u00e1lez, and Eugenio Hern\u00e1ndez. In 2015, two more political prisoners were released by the Cuban government, one of whom was rearrested in late 2016. Ciro Alexis Casonova P\u00e9rez was convicted of public disorder in December 2014, declared a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International in April 2015, and released in June 2015. Danilo Maldonado Machado (El Sexto), a graffiti artist, was unconditionally released from prison in October 2015 after nearly 10 months. Danilo Maldonado, also known as El Sexto, was released from prison in October 2015 after being accused of \"aggravated contempt\" for painting the names Fidel and Ra\u00fal on pigs intended for an art show in Havana. He was rearrested in November 2016 for celebrating Fidel Castro's death in a video. Amnesty International declared him a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release. In October 2015, Danilo Maldonado began a hunger strike lasting over 80 days to protest municipal elections. The Cuban government held 82 political prisoners in April 2016, with some released but still on parole. The prisoners included opposition activists and individuals convicted of crimes like hijacking and terrorism. The State Department's 2015 human rights report on Cuba highlighted the difficulty in determining the exact number of political prisoners due to the government's lack of transparency and violations of due process rights. Short-term detentions for political reasons have been increasing, with over 8,600 reported in 2015 by the CCDHRN. In 2016, there were 9,940 short-term arbitrary detentions for political reasons in Cuba, higher than previous years. Independent Cuban blogs critical of the government have gained international attention, with blogger Yoani S\u00e1nchez being prominent since 2007. The Catholic Church in Cuba has been active in broadening social and economic debates through publications like Palabra Nueva and Espacio Laical. They also provide social services such as soup kitchens, job training, and college coursework. Additionally, independent forums like Cuba Posible and Estado de SATS encourage open debate on various issues but have faced government harassment. In November 2012, Rodiles, a human rights activist, was arrested for \"resisting authority\" but released after an urgent appeal by Amnesty International. In July 2015, he was beaten for trying to join a protest march. Cuba was placed on the Tier 2 Watchlist in the 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report for not fully complying with anti-trafficking standards. Cuba was upgraded to Tier 2 Watchlist status in 2015 for progress in addressing sex trafficking but remained on the watchlist in 2016 due to lack of overall increasing anti-trafficking efforts. The government continued efforts to address sex trafficking, including providing services to victims and combating sex tourism. In 2016, the Cuban government made efforts to address sex trafficking through prosecution, conviction, and victim services. Multiple ministries were involved in anti-trafficking efforts, and the government funded child protection and guidance centers for crime victims. However, forced labor was not prohibited, and efforts to prevent it were not reported. Cuba's economy is state-controlled, with key sectors generating foreign exchange through professional services exports. Cuba's economy relies on various sectors for foreign exchange, including professional services exports, tourism, nickel mining, and biotechnology. Remittances from abroad, particularly from the United States, also contribute significantly. The sugar industry has declined, and Cuba depends on Venezuela for oil. Cuba's economy relies on various sectors for foreign exchange, including professional services exports, tourism, nickel mining, and biotechnology. Remittances from abroad, particularly from the United States, also contribute significantly. The sugar industry has declined, and Cuba is dependent on Venezuela for its oil needs. However, concerns have been raised about the security of this support, leading Cuba to focus on diversifying its trading partners and seeking alternative energy suppliers. Cuba's economy, ranked 67th in the 2015 Human Development Report, has high human development with a life expectancy of 79.4 years and nearly 100% adult literacy. The country experienced severe economic decline from 1989 to 1993 but has since improved. Economic growth averaged 3.7% annually from 1994 to 2000, with strong growth in tourism, nickel, and oil sectors. Support from Venezuela and China has also contributed to Cuba's economic development. Cuba's economy faced challenges due to hurricanes, global financial crisis, and austerity measures, leading to slowed growth. Despite modest improvement from 2010-2014, growth was just 1% in 2014. Stronger growth of 4.4% in 2015 was followed by a drop to an estimated 0.5% in 2016 due to austerity measures, lower export earnings, and reduced support from Venezuela. The economic crisis in Venezuela has affected Venezuela's oil exports to Cuba. The EIU forecasts economic growth of 1% in 2017 and 2.4% in 2018, lower than the 5% needed for development. The government of Ra\u00fal Castro has made some economic policy changes, allowing more private sector activities. Self-employment has increased from 156,000 in 2010 to 507,000 in 2016, but analysts believe more reforms are necessary. The Cuban government needs to do more to support the private sector, including expanding authorized activities and providing state support for credit to small businesses. A major challenge is the lack of money in circulation, with low wages hindering the development of small businesses. Most people are paid in Cuban pesos (CUPs), while convertible pesos (CUCs) are used for consumer goods. In October 2013, the Cuban government announced plans to end its dual-currency system and move towards monetary unification, aiming to improve productivity and the business climate. However, the process has been delayed for several years. Those with access to convertible pesos are better off than those without. No specific date has been set for the removal of the CUC from circulation, referred to as \"day zero.\" Currency reform is expected to create winners and losers. Ra\u00fal Castro called for moving towards a single currency to resolve economic distortions at the PCC's April 2016 Congress. A significant reform effort under Castro has focused on the agricultural sector to boost food production. Despite efforts to increase food production, Cuba still imports 70%-80% of its food needs. In March 2014, a new foreign investment law was approved to attract foreign capital, cutting taxes on profits and exempting companies from taxes for the first eight years of operation. The Cuban government approved a new foreign investment law in March 2014 to attract foreign capital, offering tax cuts on profits and exemption from taxes for the first eight years of operation. Companies must still hire labor through state-run companies with agreed-upon wages. A fast-track procedure for small projects will streamline the approval process, and transparency and time for larger investments will be improved. Investors are cautious and want evidence that the government is willing to allow them to make a profit in Cuba. In October 2014, the government listed 246 projects seeking $8.7 billion in investment in sectors like energy, tourism, agriculture, and industry. In November 2015, Cuban Minister of Foreign Trade and Investment Rodrigo Malmierca announced 326 projects seeking $8.2 billion in foreign investment across various sectors. Cuba also reached a Paris Club arrangement in December 2015 to forgive $8.5 billion of debt owed to 14 creditor countries. The creditor countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, reached an agreement with Cuba to resolve an economic challenge. This could help Cuba access credit and attract investment. After the PCC's seventh party congress in 2016, concerns arose about the Cuban government's commitment to economic reforms, with leading advocate Omar Everleny P\u00e9rez being dismissed. Cuba's economists are urging for more extensive reforms and competition in key sectors. Cuba's economists are pushing for the government to enact more far-reaching reforms and embrace competition in key sectors of the economy. They criticize the government's reliance on central planning and its monopoly on foreign trade. Cuba's economic potential is hindered by factors such as political will, dilapidated infrastructure, and an inefficient construction sector. During the Cold War, Cuba received substantial support from the Soviet Union, which funded an activist foreign policy. After the Cold War and the loss of Soviet support, Cuba had to cease its revolutionary activities abroad and open up its economy. In 2014, its top trading partners were Venezuela, Canada, the Netherlands, and China. Relations with Russia have improved in recent years, with high-level visits between leaders of both countries. In 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Cuba and signed an agreement to write off most of Cuba's Soviet-era debt. Despite reports of reopening a signals intelligence facility, Putin denied the claims. Trade relations between Russia and Cuba are limited, but Russian energy companies have been involved in oil exploration in Cuba. Russian energy companies, including Rosneft and Zarubezhneft, partnered with Cuba's state oil company for offshore exploration in 2014. Despite previous unsuccessful drilling attempts, the agreement also included cooperation on optimizing production at existing fields. In January 2015, a Russian intelligence ship docked in Havana during U.S.-Cuba normalization talks. In Havana, a Russian intelligence ship docked, with U.S. officials downplaying its arrival as legal. Russian officials welcomed the improvement in U.S.-Cuban relations, but Russia's potential military presence in Cuba was uncertain. Relations with China have also strengthened, with increased trade and investment in Cuba. Chinese leaders have visited Cuba in recent years. During recent years, Chinese leaders have visited Cuba, with Hu Jintao visiting in 2004 and 2008, and Xi Jinping in 2011 and 2014 as China's president. Ra\u00fal Castro also visited China in 2012, signing cooperation agreements on trade and investment. During Xi Jinping's 2014 visit, 29 trade, debt, credit, and other agreements were signed, emphasizing the close unity between the two socialist countries. Additionally, the European Union and Cuba reached a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement after seven rounds of talks covering political, trade, and development issues. An agreement was reached and initialed by Cuba and the EU in Havana on March 11, 2016, replacing the 1996 Common Position. The new cooperation agreement includes political dialogue and deepening relations in various areas, including trade. Venezuela has been a significant source of support for Cuba for over 15 years, providing subsidized oil and investment since 2000 under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Cuba has been concerned about the future of Venezuelan financial support due to Venezuela's economic challenges and the defeat of the ruling party in the 2015 elections. Cuba's economic growth has slowed to 0.5% in 2016, largely due to the decrease in Venezuelan support. All Latin American nations now have official diplomatic relations with Cuba, which has become more engaged in the region beyond its close ties with Venezuela. Cuba is a member of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA), a Venezuelan-led integration and cooperation scheme. Cuba's involvement in regional cooperation includes being a member of ALBA, hosting peace talks in Colombia, and participating in CELAC. Cuba has also strengthened economic ties with Brazil and Mexico. Cuba's involvement in regional cooperation includes hosting the second summit of the Americas in Havana in January 2014, where human rights issues were raised by the United Nations Secretary General. Cuba had expressed interest in attending the sixth Summit of the Americas in 2012 but was not invited due to opposition from the United States and Canada. The Organization of American States (OAS) has been involved in summit implementation and follow-up activities. Several Latin American nations insisted on Cuba's participation in the seventh Summit of the Americas in Panama in 2015. Cuba ultimately participated in the summit, including a historic meeting between President Obama and President Ra\u00fal Castro. Cuba was excluded from the OAS in 1962. In 2009, the OAS overturned the 1962 resolution excluding Cuba due to its Marxism-Leninism identification. Cuba welcomed the decision but stated it would not rejoin the OAS. Cuba actively participates in international organizations like the UN, receiving support from UNDP and UNESCO. The UN has aided Cuba in relief efforts post-Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In 2015 and 2016, the U.N. General Assembly voted to lift the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, with the U.S. and Israel abstaining for the first time. Ambassador Samantha Power criticized the U.S. policy of isolation towards Cuba, stating it had isolated the United States at the United Nations. The United States abstained from a resolution at the United Nations regarding Cuba, expressing concerns about human rights violations by the Cuban government. Cuba is a founding member of the World Trade Organization but not part of the IMF, World Bank, or Inter-American Development Bank. The Development Bank of Latin America is considering Cuba's membership. In September 2016, Cuba signed a memorandum of understanding with the CAF to support technical cooperation programs for social and economic development. A weapons shipment aboard a North Korean ship leaving Cuba raised concerns about Cuban-North Korean relations and compliance with U.N. sanctions. The U.N. Security Council's Panel of Experts visited Panama in August 2013 and issued a report in March 2014. The Panel of Experts concluded that a weapons shipment from Cuba to North Korea violated U.N. sanctions. Sanctions were imposed on the North Korean ship operator, leading to an international asset freeze. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power criticized the incident as an illegal attempt to bypass sanctions. U.S.-Cuban relations have been strained since the 1960s due to Castro's communist regime and ties with the Soviet Union. The text discusses various significant events in U.S.-Cuban relations, including covert operations, the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban missile crisis, Cuban support for insurgencies, the Mariel boatlift, Cuban exoduses in 1994, and the shootdown of U.S. civilian planes in 1996. U.S. policy towards Cuba involved isolating the nation through economic sanctions and trade embargoes. President Kennedy imposed a comprehensive economic embargo on trade and financial transactions with Cuba in 1962 under the Foreign Assistance Act and Trading with the Enemy Act. The embargo was later expanded in 1963 with the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, prohibiting most transactions with Cuba. The Cuban embargo regulations, including the CACR and various acts passed by Congress, prohibit financial and trade transactions with Cuba. These regulations are administered by OFAC and require licenses for exports to Cuba under the EAR. The Cuban embargo regulations, including the CACR and various acts passed by Congress, prohibit financial and trade transactions with Cuba. The CDA (P.L. 102-484) and the LIBERTAD Act (P.L. 104-114) impose restrictions on U.S. foreign subsidiaries trading with Cuba and vessels loading or unloading freight with Cuba. The LIBERTAD Act also includes measures to increase pressure on Cuba and provides for assistance during a transition to democracy. The Cuban embargo regulations, including the CACR, codified the embargo and imposed restrictions on U.S. policy options towards Cuba. Title III of the law holds those trafficking in confiscated U.S. property liable for damages. Presidents have suspended Title III implementation. TSRA allows U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba but includes financing prohibitions. The U.S. embargo on Cuba includes prohibitions on assistance, financing, and tourist travel. Congress has enacted various sanctions on Cuba over the years, including trade restrictions and designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. U.S. policy also includes support measures for the Cuban people. The U.S. policy towards Cuba includes support measures for the Cuban people such as humanitarian donations, medical exports, democracy-building efforts, and radio broadcasting. The enactment of TSRA led to the U.S. becoming a major supplier of agricultural products to Cuba. Despite strained relations, there have been instances of bilateral cooperation in areas like migrant interdiction and counternarcotics efforts. The Obama Administration continued the dual-track policy approach towards Cuba, maintaining economic sanctions while also initiating a significant shift in policy in 2009. This included lifting restrictions on family travel and remittances, and seeking a new beginning with Cuba. The Obama Administration sought a new beginning with Cuba, engaging in talks on various issues and introducing measures to improve relations, including increased purposeful travel and easing restrictions on remittances. In mid-2013, there was renewed engagement with Cuba on various fronts, including direct mail service talks, resumed migration talks, and air and maritime search and rescue. President Obama emphasized the need for updated policies towards Cuba, citing the ineffectiveness of outdated measures from 1961 in the modern age. Human rights violations in Cuba remained a significant concern throughout the Obama Administration's first six years. In December 2014, President Obama announced a new policy approach towards Cuba, including the release of Alan Gross and a Cuban intelligence asset in exchange for three Cuban intelligence agents imprisoned in the US. President Obama announced a major shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba, moving towards engagement instead of sanctions. This came after the release of Alan Gross and a Cuban intelligence asset in exchange for three Cuban intelligence agents imprisoned in the US. President Obama announced a new approach towards Cuba, emphasizing the need for engagement over isolation. He outlined steps to normalize relations, including reestablishing diplomatic ties, reviewing Cuba's terrorism designation, and increasing travel and commerce. The President also mentioned Cuba's participation in the Summit of the Americas. The White House emphasized human rights and democracy as key themes for the Summit of the Americas in Panama. Cuba's participation in the summit was a policy challenge for the Administration, but ultimately, President Obama and Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro held a historic bilateral meeting. Despite deep differences, both countries agreed to disagree with respect and civility. The U.S. and Cuba have agreed to disagree with respect and civility, aiming to develop a new relationship. Cuban dissidents faced challenges at a forum, and U.S.-Cuban relations were severed in the 1960s but later reestablished in 1977. Talks were held in 2015 to improve relations. Four rounds of talks were held in 2015 to reestablish relations between the U.S. and Cuba, with discussions on opening embassies, staffing numbers, travel restrictions, and access to diplomatic posts. A U.S. government delegation also visited Havana in March 2015. In March 2015, a U.S. government delegation visited Havana to focus on telecommunications and Internet connections between the United States and Cuba. On July 1, 2015, President Obama announced the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba, with embassies reopening on July 20. On July 20, 2015, the U.S. and Cuban Interests Sections in Washington, DC, and Havana were redesignated as embassies. Cuba held a flag-raising ceremony at its embassy attended by Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Havana on August 14, 2015, for a flag-raising ceremony at the U.S. Embassy, marking the first visit of a U.S. Secretary of State to Cuba since 1945. President Obama directed Secretary of State Kerry to review Cuba's designation on December 17, 2014. On April 14, 2015, President Obama transmitted a report to Congress justifying the rescission of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. The rescission took place on May 29, 2015, 45 days after the report was submitted. The White House announced policy changes to implement the rescission of Cuba's state sponsor of terrorism designation. These changes build upon previous steps taken by President Obama in 2009 and 2011 to ease restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba. The new initiative required amendments to U.S. embargo regulations. The Treasury Department's OFAC and the Department of Commerce's BIS implemented policy changes to increase travel and commerce to Cuba through five rounds of amendments to the embargo regulations. The changes included authorizing a general license for 12 categories of authorized travel in the CACR, eliminating the need for travelers to seek permission from the Department of the Treasury. Authorized travelers to Cuba can use U.S. credit and debit cards, make donative remittances without limit, and engage in certain activities like humanitarian projects and private businesses. In 2016, individuals were allowed to travel to Cuba for people-to-people education trips without organizational sponsorship. Authorized travelers to Cuba can bring back Cuban products to the United States for personal use, including alcohol and tobacco. Commerce regulations allow for expanded commercial exports to Cuba, including goods for private residential construction, items for private-sector Cuban entrepreneurs, and agricultural equipment for small farmers. This includes a license exception for \"support to the Cuban people\" and items for telecommunications, such as Internet access. The Treasury and Commerce regulations allow for the export of telecommunications items to Cuba, including Internet access, infrastructure upgrades, and services. Certain goods and services from independent Cuban entrepreneurs can be imported into the United States. OFAC amended regulations to allow transactions for FDA approval of Cuban-origin pharmaceuticals and importation of FDA-approved Cuban drugs. Commerce regulations permit the commercial export of consumer communication devices and related software to Cuba. The updated regulations now allow for the export of telecommunications items to Cuba, including Internet access, infrastructure upgrades, and services. U.S. companies can establish joint ventures with Cuban entities to provide telecommunication and Internet-based services, make payments to Cuban telecommunications operators, and market these services. In January 2015 and 2016, BIS revised the EAR to approve license applications for exporting items to Cuba related to environmental protection, renewable energy, civil aviation, telecommunications, news bureaus, human rights organizations, and agricultural commodities. Licenses for certain exports will be considered on a case-by-case basis. The U.S. has added a new category for exports to Cuba, including items for state-owned enterprises and organizations benefiting the Cuban people. OFAC also issued general licenses for contingent contracts and foreign vessels entering U.S. ports after trading with Cuba. BIS authorized the export of consumer goods to eligible individuals in Cuba. U.S. financial institutions are allowed to open accounts in Cuba. In January 2016, U.S. financial institutions were permitted to open correspondent accounts at Cuban financial institutions for authorized transactions, including U-turn payments. Companies in certain categories are authorized to have a physical presence in Cuba. Authorized entities in Cuba include news bureaus, exporters of goods, mail or parcel services, telecommunication providers, educational organizations, religious groups, and travel service providers. The President cannot lift the embargo due to the LIBERTAD Act, but hopes to discuss it with Congress. The Act links embargo lifting to conditions in Cuba, such as a democratically elected government. Changing or repealing the Act would be necessary to lift the economic embargo. The economic embargo on Cuba would require amending or repealing the LIBERTAD Act and other statutes that impede normal economic relations. President Obama visited Cuba in 2016 to advance commercial and people-to-people ties and express support for human rights. During his visit to Cuba in 2016, President Obama announced initiatives to support collaboration in agriculture, increase student exchanges, and establish partnerships in health, science, and the environment.

He stated that citizens should have the freedom to speak their mind, organize, criticize their government, and protest peacefully without fear of arbitrary detentions. President Obama's strong stance on advancing human rights was highlighted during his televised speech to the Cuban nation. President Obama emphasized the importance of democracy and human rights during his visit to Cuba in 2016. He spoke out against arbitrary detentions of those who exercise their rights, advocated for freedom of faith and peaceful assembly, and expressed confidence in the Cuban people's ability to choose their leaders in free elections. President Obama also met with prominent human rights activists during his visit. During President Obama's visit to Cuba in 2016, he met with prominent human rights activists, including Miriam Leiva, Antonio Rodiles, and others. The meeting highlighted the lack of recognition given to dissidents by visiting heads of state. The pace of normalization between the U.S. and Cuba will depend on progress in human rights issues and Cuba's utilization of recent regulatory changes. President Obama emphasized the need for change in Cuba beyond just lifting the U.S. embargo. During President Obama's visit to Cuba in 2016, he emphasized the need for change in Cuba beyond just lifting the U.S. embargo. This includes making it easier to open a business, allowing workers to get jobs directly with companies that invest in Cuba, eliminating the use of two currencies, and expanding Internet access. U.S. and Cuban officials have held Bilateral Commission meetings to coordinate efforts on shared priorities such as regulatory issues, telecommunications, human rights, and agriculture. The next meeting is scheduled to take place in Havana in December 2016. The next Bilateral Commission meeting is set for December 2016 in Havana. U.S. and Cuban officials have engaged in regulatory dialogues and law enforcement cooperation, including discussions on counterterrorism, cybercrime, and online fraud. In February 2016, fraud occurred in Havana, followed by a Law Enforcement Dialogue in May 2016. U.S. and Cuban officials had technical exchanges on human smuggling, fraud prevention, and legal cooperation in 2016. A memorandum of understanding was signed in January 2017 to enhance law enforcement cooperation. In June 2016, a counterterrorism technical exchange took place in Cuba involving various U.S. agencies. Additionally, an environmental memorandum was signed in November 2015 for fish and coral protection. Cuba and the United States signed environmental memorandums in 2015 and 2016 to protect fish, coral resources, and improve maritime navigation safety. They also cooperated on issues like coastal protection, biodiversity, climate change, disaster risk reduction, and marine pollution. Meetings were held to discuss delimiting maritime boundaries in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. In the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, U.S. and Cuban officials have engaged in counternarcotics dialogues and signed agreements for cooperation against illicit narcotics trafficking. Discussions have also taken place regarding outstanding U.S. claims against Cuba. On December 11, 2005, Cuban and U.S. officials finalized plans for direct mail service after more than 50 years. A civil aviation arrangement was reached in December 2015, allowing U.S. commercial airlines to operate flights to Cuba. Health cooperation was facilitated through a memorandum of understanding signed in June 2016 for diseases like cancer and Zika virus. The first U.S.-Cuban human rights dialogue took place in October 2016, followed by an economic dialogue in September 2016 covering trade, investment, and renewable energy. In September 2016, U.S. and Cuban officials discussed various topics including trade, investment, renewable energy, small business, and intellectual property rights. An oil spill preparedness agreement was signed on January 9, 2017. President Obama issued a directive on the normalization of relations with Cuba on October 14, 2016, outlining six medium-term objectives. President Obama issued a directive on the normalization of relations with Cuba on October 14, 2016, outlining six medium-term objectives, including building support in Congress to lift the embargo and other statutory provisions constraining efforts to normalize economic relations with Cuba. The directive aims to maintain momentum towards normalizing relations in the next Administration and protect the changes made in policy towards Cuba. Some advocate for maintaining pressure on Cuba until reforms are made, while others support lifting certain U.S. sanctions to engage in dialogue. There are also calls for swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. Legislative efforts have reflected these differing approaches, with some easing of sanctions on Cuba in Congress since 2000. The Obama Administration's December 2014 change of U.S. policy towards Cuba from isolation to engagement has sparked divisions in Congress over Cuba policy. Some advocate for maintaining pressure on Cuba, while others support lifting certain U.S. sanctions to engage in dialogue. Legislative efforts have reflected these differing approaches, with some easing of sanctions on Cuba in Congress since 2000. The normalization of relations with Cuba has caused divisions in Congress. Some members support the Administration's actions as beneficial for the U.S. and a way to promote change in Cuba. Others criticize the President for not securing concessions on human rights. There are differing views on lifting the embargo and easing sanctions on Cuba to encourage peaceful change. Supporters of changing policy argue for a more pragmatic approach in bringing about change in Cuba, emphasizing the negative impact of the embargo on the Cuban people. They highlight international support for lifting the embargo and the need for consistency in dealing with communist governments. Opponents of lifting sanctions maintain a two-track policy of isolating Cuba while reaching out to the Cuban people. Supporters of maintaining the two-track policy argue that softening U.S. policy without concrete Cuban reforms would benefit the Castro government and facilitate the survival of the communist regime. Opponents believe the U.S. should stay committed to democracy and human rights in Cuba, with sustained sanctions as a means of promoting change. Public opinion polls show majority support for normalizing relations with Cuba. Opinion polls indicate majority American support for normalizing relations with Cuba, including Cuban Americans in South Florida. President-elect Trump may reverse some of Obama's Cuba policy changes, calling Castro a \"brutal dictator.\" Uncertainty remains on future actions. Trump previously stated he would cancel Obama's policy unless Cuba improved political and religious freedom. President-elect Trump could reverse many of President Obama's Cuba policy changes, including reestablishing diplomatic relations and easing travel and commerce restrictions. The Administration may also make changes to bilateral cooperation agreements and dialogues on various issues. The policy of engagement with Cuba has been popular, making it difficult for the incoming Administration to completely reverse it. Congress has been actively involved in U.S. policy towards Cuba through legislative initiatives and oversight on various issues. The economic embargo on Cuba remains largely in place, and any additional easing of restrictions may be pending economic or political changes in Cuba. Congress has been actively involved in U.S. policy towards Cuba through legislative initiatives and oversight on various issues, including economic sanctions, terrorism, human rights, migration, antidrug cooperation, and property claims. Some Members attempted to restrict operations of the U.S. Embassy in Havana and U.S. military engagement with the Cuban military in response to the Administration's Cuba policy changes. The absence of a U.S. ambassador at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba is not uncommon, with the charg\u00e9 d'affaires ad interim assuming responsibilities. Jeffrey DeLaurentis, chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, became charg\u00e9 d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy. President Obama nominated DeLaurentis as U.S. ambassador to Cuba, but the Senate did not act on the nomination. The State Department requested over $6 million for the Western Hemisphere Affairs Bureau in its FY2016 budget. The House Appropriations Committee's FY2016 State Department and Foreign Operations appropriations bill allocated over $6 million for the Western Hemisphere Affairs Bureau (WHA) to support expanded operations in Havana, including increased engagement with Cuban civil society. The bill had a provision that would have prohibited funds for the establishment or operation of a U.S. diplomatic presence in Cuba beyond pre-2014 levels, but this provision was not included in the final FY2016 omnibus appropriations bill. The Administration opposed this provision. In FY2017, the State Department requested $3.8 million for WHA to fill nine additional positions and update infrastructure at the U.S. Embassy in Havana. The House Appropriations Committee's version of the FY2017 appropriations measure had a provision that would have prohibited funding for a U.S. diplomatic presence in Cuba beyond pre-2014 levels. The Senate Appropriations Committee's version of the FY2017 appropriations measure would have funded the operation, infrastructure, and security improvements of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Cuba, as well as costs for additional diplomatic personnel. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also requested $1.5 million for the Foreign Agricultural Service to establish an overseas post in Cuba. The 114th Congress did not complete action on FY2017 foreign operations appropriations but approved a continuing resolution in December 2016. The 114th Congress did not complete action on FY2017 foreign operations appropriations but approved a continuing resolution (P.L. 114-254) funding most programs at the FY2016 level through April 28, 2017. Both the House and Senate versions of the NDAA for FY2017 had provisions restricting U.S. military interaction with the Cuban military, curbing the Administration's changed policy toward Cuba. The Senate version of the NDAA for FY2017 included provisions prohibiting the use of funds for U.S. military interaction with Cuba until certain conditions are met, such as addressing human rights abuses by Cuban military and security forces. The White House and Secretary of Defense objected to restrictions on U.S.-Cuban military interactions, citing benefits such as counternarcotics exercises and security conferences. This includes Cuban military involvement in human rights abuses, support to Venezuela, and demands for Guantanamo control. Cuban military officials indicted in the U.S. for a 1996 incident are also mentioned. The FY2017 NDAA prohibits U.S. military engagement with Cuba in joint exercises or security conferences, despite objections from the White House and Secretary of Defense citing shared challenges and benefits of collaboration. The FY2017 NDAA prohibits U.S. military engagement with Cuba in joint exercises or security conferences until certain conditions are met, including assurances on human rights, support for Venezuela's security forces, and justice for Cuban military officials indicted in the U.S. for the 1996 shoot down of civilian planes. Exceptions are provided for lease payments, democracy-building assistance, and routine financial transactions for the U.S. mission in Cuba. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a key component of U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba's communist government for over 50 years. Changes to these restrictions have occurred over time, with a period of no restrictions from 1977 to 1982. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) include restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba. The FY2017 NDAA prohibits U.S. military engagement with Cuba in joint exercises or security conferences, with exceptions for certain transactions related to the U.S. mission in Havana and humanitarian assistance operations. Under the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR), travel restrictions to Cuba have been enforced by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Changes to these restrictions have occurred over time, with the Obama Administration easing restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba. The Obama Administration eased travel restrictions and remittances to Cuba, allowing purposeful travel for religious, educational, and journalistic activities, increased remittance amounts, and eligibility for U.S. international airports to provide services for charter flights to and from Cuba. These measures were similar to policies from the Clinton Administration in 1999 but were later curtailed by the Bush Administration. President Obama announced major changes in U.S. policy towards Cuba on December 17, 2014, including general licenses for 12 categories of travel to Cuba. The Obama Administration eased travel restrictions to Cuba, allowing purposeful travel for various activities, but tourist activities remain prohibited. General licenses were provided for 12 categories of travel to Cuba, including family visits, official business, journalistic activity, educational activities, and humanitarian projects. Travel to Cuba for tourist activities is prohibited under Section 910(b) of TSRA. Travel agents and airlines can now provide services without a specific license. U.S. credit and debit cards can be used by authorized travelers, but they should check with their financial institution first. Per diem limits for expenditures no longer apply to authorized travelers. Travelers no longer have per diem limits for expenditures and can bring back goods from Cuba as accompanied baggage for personal use, including alcohol and tobacco. The Treasury Department made changes to travel regulations in January 2016, allowing for professional media or artistic productions in Cuba. In March 2016, individual travel to Cuba for people-to-people education was permitted, as long as the traveler engages in a full-time schedule of educational exchange activities. The Treasury Department made changes to travel regulations in January 2016, allowing for professional media or artistic productions in Cuba. In March 2016, individual travel to Cuba for people-to-people education was permitted, as long as the traveler engages in a full-time schedule of educational exchange activities. This change was intended to make authorized educational travel to Cuba more accessible and less expensive for U.S. citizens, increasing opportunities for direct engagement between Cubans and Americans. Regular air service was also established between the two countries in December 2015, replacing charter flights that had been operating for many years. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx signed an arrangement in February 2016 allowing U.S. carriers to operate up to 110 daily roundtrip flights between the United States and Cuba, including 20 daily roundtrip flights to Havana. Six U.S. airlines were authorized in June 2016 to provide air service for up to 90 daily flights between five U.S. cities and nine Cuban cities other than Havana. JetBlue was the first U.S. airline to start regularly scheduled flights in August 2016. In July 2016, a tentative decision was made for eight U.S. airlines to offer up to 20 regularly scheduled roundtrip flights between Havana and 10 U.S. cities. American Airlines started direct flights to Havana from Miami in late November 2016. In May 2016, the House Committee on Homeland Security held a hearing on security risks from flights to Cuba. Some Members of Congress are concerned about Cuba's airport security, while others see it as a way to slow down efforts to normalize relations with Cuba. Department of Homeland Security officials testified about their work to ensure security. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) worked to ensure security for increased commercial air travelers from Cuba. An aviation security agreement was reached between the US and Cuba for the deployment of Federal Air Marshals on certain flights. The Cuban government initially signed the agreement for charter flights only, but later amended it to include regularly scheduled flights. OFAC granted a license to Bangor International Airport in Maine for refueling. In July 2016, OFAC granted a license to Bangor International Airport in Maine to provide refueling and services for foreign air carriers flying to and from Cuba. Ferry and cruise ship services between the US and Cuba were also being developed, with Carnival starting direct cruises to Cuba in May 2016 after receiving a Treasury Department license in July 2015. Carnival started direct cruises to Cuba in May 2016 under its brand Fathom, targeting educational travel. Controversy arose when Cuban government regulations prohibited Cuban-born individuals from sailing to Cuba on Carnival cruises, leading to protests and a class action lawsuit. Secretary of State Kerry urged Cuba to change its policy for a normal relationship with the United States. Carnival reversed its policy to accept bookings from all travelers for cruises to Cuba. The Cuban government changed its policy to allow Cuban citizens to travel by cruise ship, enabling Carnival to proceed with its cruises. Other cruise ship companies also announced plans to offer cruises to Cuba from the United States in 2017. The Obama Administration's policy change lifted the cap on remittances to Cuba, allowing unlimited amounts for authorized travelers. Remittances are authorized without limit for humanitarian projects, human rights organizations, promoting democracy, strengthening civil society, and developing private businesses. Major arguments for lifting the Cuba travel ban include abridging the rights of Americans to travel, influencing conditions in Cuba, and supporting civil society and the private sector. Arguments against lifting the ban cite concerns about supporting the Cuban government financially, existing legal provisions for humanitarian travel, and the President's authority to restrict travel for foreign policy reasons. Several legislative initiatives introduced in the 114th Congress aimed to lift restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba. Bills such as H.R. 274, H.R. 403, and H.R. 735 sought to lift the overall embargo, including travel and remittance restrictions. Other bills focused on specific aspects, such as facilitating the export of U.S. agricultural and medical goods to Cuba. Additionally, a Senate amendment to the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act aimed to address travel restrictions to Cuba. S.Amdt. 3557 (Flake) to H.R. 636 aimed to prohibit restrictions on travel to Cuba. Other bills required the President to submit a plan for resolving property claims before easing restrictions. Bills like H.R. 5728 and S. 3289 sought to restrict passenger air transportation to Cuba until security agreements were in place. Efforts to ease and tighten travel restrictions in Cuba were discussed during the FY2016 and FY2017 appropriations processes, but no provisions were ultimately included in the omnibus appropriations measure. The House-passed bill in the 114th Congress would have prohibited funding for people-to-people travel to Cuba, potentially impacting the recent expansion of U.S. travel to the country. The House bill aimed to restrict financial transactions with entities controlled by the Cuban military, potentially affecting U.S. travel to Cuba. A proposed amendment sought to prevent funds from enforcing the Cuba embargo or tourist travel ban. The House bill aimed to restrict financial transactions with entities controlled by the Cuban military, potentially affecting U.S. travel to Cuba. In the Senate version, provisions were introduced to lift all restrictions on travel to Cuba and allow technical services for foreign carriers en route to or from Cuba. U.S. commercial medical and agricultural exports to Cuba have been authorized since the early 1990s with various restrictions and licensing requirements. The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 requires on-site verification for medical exports, while the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act allows for one-year export licenses for agricultural commodities to Cuba. No U.S. government assistance or credit guarantees are available for these exports. Cuba purchased over $5.2 billion in U.S. products from 2001 to 2015, mainly agricultural products. U.S. exports to Cuba peaked at $712 million in 2008 due to higher food prices and increased food needs after natural disasters. However, exports declined after 2012, reaching just $180 million. No U.S. government assistance or credit guarantees are available for these exports. Exports to Cuba peaked in 2008 at $712 million, but have since declined significantly, reaching just $180 million in 2015. Poultry, soybean oilcake, soybeans, and corn were the leading products exported to Cuba from 2012 to 2015. Poultry accounted for over 40% of exports, but its value dropped by almost 48% in 2015. Despite a temporary suspension in 2015 due to bird flu concerns, poultry exports to Cuba increased by 31% in the first nine months of 2016, totaling $176 million. In 2016, U.S. exports to Cuba totaled $180 million, with poultry exports increasing by 31% compared to 2015, accounting for nearly half of the total exports. Various factors contribute to the decline in U.S. exports to Cuba, including Cuba's shortage of hard currency, financial support from Venezuela, and preferences for products from government-controlled entities. Agricultural experts are skeptical about the impact of recent policy changes by the Obama Administration on increasing U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. President Obama's policy changes aimed to facilitate commercial exports to Cuba by allowing U.S. financial institutions to open correspondent accounts at Cuban banks and permitting private export financing for authorized trade. The definition of \"cash in advance\" for U.S. exports to Cuba was revised to specify payment before transfer of title. In 2005, the Department of the Treasury clarified that \"payment of cash in advance\" for U.S. exports to Cuba meant receiving payment before shipment from the U.S. port. Congress temporarily overturned this clarification for FY2010 and FY2011, allowing payment before export shipment offloading in Cuba. This change authorized commercial exports of certain goods and services to empower Cuba's private sector. The US allows exports to Cuba for private sector entrepreneurs and small farmers, with certain categories approved under a general policy. Licenses for specific exports are considered on a case-by-case basis, including items for state-owned enterprises benefiting the Cuban people. Exports to Cuba are authorized for various purposes including agricultural production, education, disaster relief, public health, residential construction, public transportation, and infrastructure benefiting the Cuban people. Additionally, commercial export of communication devices and items for telecommunications, including Internet access, is allowed. Authorized exports to Cuba include services, infrastructure creation, and upgrades. Companies exporting goods to Cuba can have a physical presence there. OFAC amended the CACR to allow certain contingent contracts, and BIS authorized consumer goods for personal use in Cuba. A USDA report noted a decline in the U.S. market share in Cuba from 42% in FY2009 to 16% in FY2014. The United States has lost market share in Cuba due to favorable credit terms offered by competitors. Reports suggest that lifting restrictions on travel and capital flow, along with USDA market development programs, could help the U.S. regain its market share. Increased exports could include commodities like milk, wheat, and rice. The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) issued a report in 2016 on the effects of U.S. restrictions on trade with Cuba. The report examined the impact on the export of goods and services, including commodities like milk, wheat, rice, and dried beans. The Senate Finance Committee requested the report in 2014, leading to a public hearing in 2015. The study was expanded to analyze Cuban non-tariff measures and barriers affecting exports to Cuba. The USITC report in 2016 analyzed the impact of U.S. restrictions on trade with Cuba, focusing on barriers affecting exports and investments. Key findings include U.S. restrictions shutting out competitive suppliers, such as credit limitations and travel bans. Cuban non-tariff measures and government control also hinder U.S. exports and investments in Cuba. The USITC report in 2016 analyzed the impact of U.S. restrictions on trade with Cuba, focusing on barriers affecting exports and investments. U.S. exports could increase if Cuban import barriers were lowered, potentially reaching $2.2 billion annually if both U.S. restrictions and Cuban barriers were removed. Legislative initiatives in the 114th Congress aimed to lift or ease restrictions on exports to Cuba. The legislative initiatives in the 114th Congress aimed to facilitate U.S. agricultural and medical exports to Cuba by redefining payment terms, authorizing direct transfers between Cuban and U.S. financial institutions, establishing export promotion programs, and removing trade restrictions. Various bills proposed removing restrictions on trade and financing agricultural commodities to Cuba. The bills in the 114th Congress aimed to repeal restrictions on trade and financing for agricultural commodities to Cuba. This included allowing private financing for Cuba but still prohibiting U.S. government assistance, with waivers for national security or humanitarian reasons. The federal government would be prohibited from using funds to promote trade with Cuba, except for certain commodity promotion programs. Additionally, there were bills authorizing the export of energy resources and related services to Cuba. H.R. 3687 would have allowed U.S. government assistance for agricultural exports to Cuba under certain conditions. In contrast, S. 1388 and H.R. 2466 required a plan for resolving property claims before easing restrictions on trade with Cuba. No provisions on U.S. exports to Cuba were included in the FY2016 appropriations. In FY2016, provisions easing Cuba sanctions were proposed in the Financial Services appropriations bill, but not included in the omnibus appropriations measure. The FY2016 Commerce, Justice, and Science appropriations bill aimed to prevent additional exports to Cuba. In FY2017, House and Senate bills had provisions tightening and easing economic sanctions on Cuba, but no action was completed. The bills H.R. 5393 and H.R. 5485 aimed to impose new sanctions on U.S. exports to Cuba, targeting transactions with the Cuban military or intelligence service. These provisions could have hindered the expansion of U.S. exports to Cuba. The House Rules Committee considered an amendment to H.R. 5485 that would have restricted funds from being used for private financing of agricultural sales to Cuba. The Senate version of the FY2017 Senate Financial Services appropriations bill included provisions to lift restrictions on financing for agricultural exports to Cuba and on vessel entry into the U.S. if involved in trade with Cuba. President Obama called for a review of Cuba's situation in December 2014. In December 2014, President Obama requested a review of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. The President can remove a country from the list by certifying a change in leadership and policies, or by justifying it to Congress at least 45 days in advance. President Obama utilized the second option by submitting a report to Congress on April 14, 2015, justifying the rescission of Cuba from the terrorist-list. The AECA allows Congress to block the removal of a country from the list through a joint resolution, which must be approved within 45 days and can be subject to presidential veto. On May 29, 2015, Secretary of State Kerry rescinded Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. Cuba was also dropped from the annual determination of countries not fully cooperating with US antiterrorism efforts. Cuba had been on the list since 1982. Despite Cuba's removal from the terrorism list in 2015, it still faces economic sanctions including an embargo on trade and financial transactions. Cuba has a history of supporting revolutionary movements in Latin America and Africa. In 1992, Fidel Castro announced Cuba's end of support for insurgents abroad due to the Soviet Union's breakup, leading to economic decline. President Obama certified in 2015 that Cuba has not supported terrorism and has strengthened its counterterrorism laws. Cuba has committed to countering terrorism by ratifying international instruments and working with the Financial Action Task Force to address anti-money laundering/counterterrorism finance deficiencies. They adopted legislation in 2014 to freeze assets linked to money laundering or terrorist financing. In October 2014, the FATF acknowledged Cuba's progress in enhancing its regulatory regime against money laundering and terrorist financing. Cuba is no longer under FATF monitoring but will collaborate with GAFILAT to further strengthen its regulations. Cuba has condemned various terrorist attacks globally and has shared information with the US on planned attacks, reaffirming its commitment to counterterrorism and nonproliferation. Cuba has shared information with the United States on planned terrorist attacks and provided assurances that its territory will not be used for terrorism. Cuba reiterated its commitment to cooperate in combating terrorism and condemned all forms of terrorist acts. The government also committed to never support international terrorism or allow its territory to be used for terrorist activities against any country, including the United States. The State Department has discussed Cuba's provision of safe haven for members of foreign terrorist organizations like ETA and FARC. Cuba has been supporting peace negotiations between FARC and the Colombian government since 2012. The Colombian government believes Cuba has played a constructive role in peace talks with FARC, with no evidence of Cuban support for terrorist activities. Cuba allows around two dozen ETA members to stay, with extradition requests from Spain for two members. The Spanish government is satisfied with the process of extraditing two ETA members from Cuba. Cuba has assured the US that it will not allow FARC, ELN, and ETA to use its territory for activities against any country. Cuba has been criticized for harboring US fugitives, providing them with housing, food, and medical care. Several U.S. fugitives from justice, including convicted murderers and hijackers, have found refuge in Cuba since the 1970s and 1980s. Joanne Chesimard, also known as Assata Shakur, was added to the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist list in 2013 for the murder of a New Jersey State Police officer in 1973. Another fugitive, William \"Guillermo\" Morales, a member of the Puerto Rican militant group FALN, has been in Cuba since 1988 after being imprisoned in Mexico. In 1978, a man in Mexico had his hands maimed by a bomb he was making. He was convicted in New York on weapons charges in 1979, sentenced to 10 years in prison, and 5 years' probation, but escaped the same year. Despite a U.S.-Cuba extradition treaty dating back to 1905, Cuba has not utilized it. Instead, Cuba has returned wanted fugitives to the U.S. on a case-by-case basis, such as a couple wanted for murder in New Jersey in 2011 and a Florida couple accused of kidnapping their children in 2013. Cuba has refused to extradite fugitives to the U.S., citing political reasons and demanding the return of wanted Cuban criminals. The U.S. removed Cuba from the terrorism list in 2015, hoping to resolve outstanding fugitive cases through a law enforcement dialogue. The U.S. removed Cuba from the terrorism list in 2015 to facilitate the resolution of outstanding fugitive cases through a law enforcement dialogue. Supporters argue that Cuba's presence on the list was outdated and hindered efforts against serious terrorist threats, and believe that engaging with Cuba could lead to increased cooperation on counterterrorism issues and extradition of U.S. fugitives. The U.S. removed Cuba from the terrorism list in 2015 to improve cooperation on counterterrorism issues. Opponents argue that Cuba still supports terrorism by hosting members of terrorist organizations and U.S. fugitives. They also cite Cuba's involvement in an attempted weapons transfer to North Korea as evidence. Some believe the decision to remove Cuba from the list was rushed and without consulting Congress. In the 114th Congress, legislative activity included bills addressing Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism and extradition of U.S. fugitives from Cuba. H.R. 274 aimed to rescind any determination of Cuba supporting terrorism, while H.Res. 181 called for the extradition of fugitives like William Morales. H.R. 4772 sought to halt funding for commercial flights to Cuba until fugitives are extradited. The United States has imposed a trademark sanction on Cuba related to confiscated assets, preventing payment for trademark registrations from Cuban nationals without consent of the original owner. This measure was enacted due to a dispute between Pernod Ricard and Bacardi Limited. The French spirits company Pernod Ricard and Bermuda-based Bacardi Limited are in a dispute over the Havana Club rum trademark. Pernod Ricard partnered with Cubaexport in 1993 to produce Havana Club, while Bacardi claims rights to the name through an agreement with the original producers. The European Union filed a WTO dispute against the US for violating intellectual property agreements. In 2002, the WTO ruled that the trademark sanction on Havana Club violated WTO provisions. The US agreed to comply by January 3, 2003, but no legislative action was taken. In 2005, the EU and US reached an understanding, with the EU reserving the right to retaliate in the future. The USPTO did not process Cubaexport's trademark renewal in 2006 due to licensing issues. Assets Control denied the company a specific license needed for trademark registration renewal, citing U.S. policy on confiscated property. Almost a decade later, OFAC issued a license to Cubaexport, allowing fee payment for Havana Club trademark renewal. State Department considered U.S. policy shift towards Cuba in evaluating the case. The U.S. policy shift towards Cuba led to the renewal of Cubaexport's Havana Club trademark registration by USPTO, despite an ongoing trademark dispute with Bacardi. Legislative activity in Congress also focused on the issue. In Congress, there are two approaches to bring Section 211 into compliance with the WTO ruling: a narrow fix to apply to all persons claiming rights in trademarks confiscated by Cuba, or repealing Section 211 altogether. Bills in the 114th Congress proposed both options. In the 114th Congress, bills were proposed to address the trademark issue related to confiscated property, but no action was completed. The House Commerce appropriations bill, H.R. 5393, included a provision to prohibit the registration of marks similar to those connected with confiscated assets without the original owner's consent. The House Financial Services appropriations bill, H.R. 5485, included a provision to prohibit funds from being used to authorize trademark registrations related to confiscated assets without the original owner's consent. Despite this provision, OFAC issued a specific license in January 2016 for the renewal of the Havana Club trademark, which was subsequently renewed by the USPTO until 2026. The USPTO renewed the Havana Club trademark until 2026, despite objections from the Administration regarding Cuba provisions. The US has provided assistance to increase information flow on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise to Cuba since 1996, with Congress appropriating $284 million for Cuba democracy efforts from FY1996 to FY2015. The Administration requested $20 million for FY2016 in ESF funding for Cuba democracy efforts. The FY2016 omnibus appropriations measure, P.L. 114-113, provided $20 million in ESF for Cuba democracy programs. The House Appropriations Committee's bill, H.R. 2772, proposed $30 million for democracy and civil society in Cuba, with restrictions on fund usage. The Senate Appropriations Committee's bill, S. 1725, suggested $15 million for Cuba democracy programs. For FY2016, $20 million in ESF was allocated for Cuba democracy programs. The FY2017 Administration requested $15 million for democracy and human rights programs in Cuba, a 25% reduction from the previous year. The assistance aims to support civil society initiatives promoting democracy, human rights, and freedoms of expression and association, while providing humanitarian aid to victims of political repression and their families. The House version of the FY2017 State Department and Foreign Operations appropriations bill would have provided $30 million for democracy promotion in Cuba, double the Administration's request. The bill would also have prohibited funding for non-democracy building activities. In contrast, the Senate version recommended fully funding the Administration's request of $15 million, with $3 million for free enterprise and cultural activities. The 114th Congress did not complete action on FY2017 appropriations but approved a continuing resolution (P.L. 114-254) in December 2016 funding most foreign aid at the FY2016 level. The State Department has been allocated more funding than USAID in recent years, with a portion of Cuba assistance transferred to NED. For FY2014, no new programs or activities in Cuba were allowed, but for FY2015, USAID is administering $6.25 million for Cuban democracy. For FY2015, USAID is administering $6.25 million of Cuban democracy assistance, while the State Department is administering $13.75 million, with $6.25 million transferred to NED. The Cuba program aims to promote a peaceful transition to democracy, develop civil society, and support human rights activists. NED, an independent organization funded by the U.S. government, also provides democratization assistance for Cuba. The U.S. government provides funding for democracy programs in Cuba through various agencies. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) received funding of $1.65 million in FY2011, $2.6 million in FY2012, $3.4 million in FY2013, $3 million in FY2014, and $3.68 million in FY2015. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about the management and oversight of these programs, citing issues with internal controls and compliance with regulations. Investigative news reports highlighted high shipping costs and lax oversight affecting the effectiveness of USAID's Cuba democracy program. A 2008 GAO report praised USAID's efforts to address program issues since 2006, including competitive grant awards, increased staff, and enhanced financial oversight. However, the report also noted that USAID lacked sufficient staff for effective grant oversight. The GAO recommended that USAID ensure proper staffing for effective grant oversight in the Cuba program. They also suggested periodic assessments to reduce grantee risks, focusing on internal controls, procurement practices, expenditures, and compliance with laws. In a 2013 report, GAO found improvements in USAID's financial monitoring but gaps in the State Department's monitoring. Both agencies were working to enhance financial oversight. GAO recommended actions for the Secretary of State to strengthen monitoring of Cuba democracy program funds. In April 2014, an Associated Press report alleged that USAID had established a \"Cuban Twitter\" called ZunZuneo as part of its democracy promotion efforts for Cuba. The project aimed to undermine Cuba's communist government and lasted over two years. USAID denied the program was covert, stating it was similar to efforts in other unwelcoming places. In August 2014, the Associated Press reported on a U.S.-funded democracy program for Cuba where a USAID contractor sent youth from Latin American countries to Cuba for civic programs, allegedly to recruit young Cubans for anti-government activism. USAID maintained a discreet profile on the project to minimize risk and work safely. Some Members of Congress criticized USAID for lack of transparency, while others defended the agency and the program. USAID responded to claims of supporting civil society programs in Cuba, stating that the AP report made sensational claims. A review report by USAID's Office of Inspector General highlighted management control issues in the Cuban Civil Society Support Program. Recommendations included implementing a screening policy to address intelligence threats. Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, U.S.-government-sponsored broadcasting to Cuba, began in 1985 and 1990 respectively. The Board of Governors (BBG) FY2017 Congressional Budget Request focuses on Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, aiming to inform and engage the people of Cuba with reliable news. An estimated 2.2 million Cubans listen to Radio Mart\u00ed weekly, with expanded distribution through the Internet, mobile phones, and social media. This effort has significantly increased audience reach in Cuba since October 1999. The United States Information Agency (USIA) was abolished and its functions merged into the Department of State in FY2000, leading to the creation of the independent agency, the BBG. This agency includes entities like Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) based in Miami, FL. Legislation in the 104th Congress required OCB to relocate from Washington, DC to South Florida, which was completed in 1998. OCB utilizes various web domains and anti-censorship tools to reach Internet users in Cuba, including SMS messaging since 2011. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) has utilized SMS messaging to reach audiences in Cuba, providing information that is difficult to filter. They also stream Radio and TV Mart\u00ed programming 24/7 on their website martinoticias.com. OCB maintains an interactive social media strategy using platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Congress has allocated significant funding for broadcasting to Cuba, with recent years seeing amounts around $26-28 million. In FY2015, $27 million was appropriated, and for FY2016, the BBG requested $30.3 million for Cuba broadcasting. In FY2015, funds were allocated for the OCB and VOA Latin America Division to establish a new Spanish language international media operation. The plan aimed to merge the two entities by early FY2017, with full operation by mid FY2017 receiving a BBG Grant. However, the FY2016 omnibus appropriations measure provided $27.14 million for Cuba broadcasting, $3.2 million less than requested, excluding funds for the merger. The House Appropriations Committee's FY2016 bill recommended $28.130 million for Cuba broadcasting. The House bill, H.R. 2772, recommended $28.130 million for Cuba broadcasting, slightly less than the request. It also proposed prohibiting the restructuring and merger of OCB and VOA's Latin America Division without Congress authorization. The Senate bill, S. 1725, recommended $27.130 million for OCB and did not support the merger. The Administration requested $27.1 million for OCB in FY2017, with plans for a new Spanish-language media organization. The House version of the FY2017 State Department and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, H.R. 5912, included a provision to block the Administration's request to establish an independent grantee organization for broadcasting in Latin America and the Caribbean without Congress authorization. The Senate version, S. 3117, allocated $27.4 million for the OCB, slightly more than the Administration's request, and did not support a proposed contractor reduction. The 114th Congress did not complete action on FY2017 funding. The 114th Congress did not complete action on FY2017 appropriations, but approved a continuing resolution providing funding at the FY2016 level for most programs through April 28, 2017. Radio and TV Mart\u00ed have faced controversies and funding cuts over the years, with various government studies and audits conducted on the OCB. In 2009, GAO reported low audience numbers for Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, with less than 2% of respondents tuning in. Concerns were raised about adherence to laws and standards, including inappropriate advertisements and interference with Cuban broadcasts. In 2010, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff report criticized Radio and TV Mart\u00ed for failing to influence Cuban society, politics, and policy. The report recommended moving the Office of Cuba Broadcasting back to Washington, DC, and integrating it fully into the Voice of America. In 2011, GAO found that the BBG's strategic plan lacked key information and only partially addressed issues raised by Congress. The BBG's strategic plan lacked key information and only partially addressed issues raised by Congress, including audience size estimates and alternative news dissemination options to Cuba. The Obama Administration ended the \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy for Cuban migrants entering the US, with those not qualifying for humanitarian relief now subject to removal. The Cuban government agreed to accept the return of ordered removed migrants. The Obama Administration ended the special Cuban Medical Professional Parole program and began accepting the return of Cuban migrants ordered removed, as part of efforts to stem mass exodus from Cuba to the United States. In September 1994, the United States and Cuba reached an agreement to stem the flow of Cubans fleeing to the United States by boat. The agreement ensured safe, legal, and orderly Cuban migration to the U.S., with a minimum of 20,000 legal migrants each year. In May 1995, another accord was reached for the parole of over 30,000 Cubans housed at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. In January 1996, the last of 32,000 Cubans housed at Guant\u00e1namo were paroled into the United States under a migration accord with Cuba. The U.S. Coast Guard has since interdicted thousands of Cubans at sea and returned them to Cuba, while those who reach shore can apply for permanent resident status. The Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 allowed Cubans who reached U.S. shores to stay, leading to a \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy. The number of Cubans interdicted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard peaked in FY2007 but declined significantly by FY2010 due to various factors like the U.S. economic downturn and more efficient coastal patrolling. The number of Cubans interdicted by the Coast Guard increased each year from FY2011 to FY2016, with a significant rise in FY2016. In FY2017, the Coast Guard had interdicted 1,265 Cuban migrants at sea. The increase in maritime migrants in 2015 and 2016 was due to rumors of a change in immigration policy. The U.S. Coast Guard and Border Patrol responded by increasing patrols and implementing a media campaign to dispel rumors. The number of undocumented Cuban migrants entering the United States has been increasing, with a majority entering through the southwest border. Between FY2010 and FY2016, the number rose from almost 8,170 to 56,178. In FY2017, 16,531 Cuban migrants entered, with most using the southwest border. The number of Cuban migrants entering the United States has been increasing, with 16,531 entering in FY2017, mostly through the southwest border. Many Cubans previously flew to Ecuador without a visa, then traveled overland and by boat through Central America and Mexico to reach the US. This route became popular due to concerns about changes in US immigration policy for Cubans. Ecuador changed its visa policy for Cubans in late November 2015 to reduce the flow of migrants. Ecuador changed its visa policy for Cubans to stem the flow of migrants heading to the United States. This led to tensions between Costa Rica and Nicaragua over Cuban migrants transiting the region. Costa Rica initially denied entry to Cubans without visas but later provided temporary visas for transit through Nicaragua. However, Nicaragua closed its border to Cubans, leaving many stranded in Costa Rica. The United States faced a surge of Cuban migrants stranded in Costa Rica, leading to tensions between Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Nicaragua accused Costa Rica of facilitating illegal migration, while Cuba criticized U.S. immigration policies for encouraging irregular emigration. The U.S. pledged $1 million to assist Costa Rica with almost 8,000 stranded Cuban migrants. Central American representatives later agreed to fly the Cubans out of Costa Rica. Central American representatives in Guatemala agreed to fly Cuban migrants from Costa Rica to El Salvador, then by bus to Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States. Flights to Mexico were added for 1,300 Cubans in Panama. Most migrants had left by March 2016, but a new wave arrived in April. Costa Rica reinforced its border with Panama, criticizing U.S. policy. Panama reached an agreement with Mexico to transfer 4,000 Cuban migrants by air in May 2016. Migration talks between the U.S. and Cuba in July 2016 discussed migration trends, cooperation between health agencies, and the return of Cuban nationals with criminal convictions. The U.S. delegation urged Cuba to accept the return of these individuals, while Cuba maintained that it would not consider repatriation until a previous list of Cuban excludable aliens is exhausted. The Cuban delegation reiterated opposition to the \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy and the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program, while the U.S. considered ending the program in 2016. The Obama Administration ended the \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy and the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program in 2017. Cuba changed its travel policy in 2013, allowing Cubans to travel abroad with just a passport and visa. Under the change in policy in 2013, Cubans can travel abroad for up to two years without needing an exit permit. Some individuals like high-level government officials still require permission to travel. Dissidents on parole or facing court action may not be allowed to travel abroad, but some have been granted permission for one-time travel. Nonimmigrant B-2 visas for family visits, tourism, and medical treatment were issued to Cubans. The policy change in 2013 allowed Cubans to travel abroad for up to two years without an exit permit. Nonimmigrant B-2 visas for family visits, tourism, and medical treatment were extended to five years with multiple entries to improve people-to-people ties and reduce burdens on Cuban travelers. Some analysts questioned the need for a special immigration policy for Cubans in light of efforts to normalize relations with Cuba. Critics argued that the current policy was being abused. In the 114th Congress, there were proposed bills to repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act and restrict funding for the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program. Another initiative aimed to make certain Cuban entrants ineligible for refugee/parolee assistance. H.R. 4847 (Farenthold) proposed repealing the Cuban Adjustment Act and making Cuban entrants ineligible for refugee/parolee assistance due to concerns over drug smuggling in Cuba. Cuban officials have taken measures to combat drug trafficking, including stricter penalties for traffickers. Cuba has implemented measures to combat drug trafficking, including legislation to stiffen penalties for traffickers, increased training for counternarcotics personnel, and cooperation with other countries on antidrug efforts. Operation Hatchet focuses on maritime and air interdiction, while an internal enforcement program targets the incipient drug market. Cuba has numerous antidrug-related agreements with other countries and reported seizing 962 kilograms of drugs in 2015. In 2015, Cuba detected 33 suspected \"go-fast\" boats on its southeastern coast, showing varying levels of cooperation with the U.S. on antidrug efforts. Since 1999, there has been an increase in cooperation, including upgrading communication links and stationing a U.S. Coast Guard Drug Interdiction Specialist in Havana. Since 1999, Cuba has increased cooperation with the U.S. on antidrug efforts, including sharing tactical information on vessels suspected of trafficking in Cuban waters. This collaboration has led to multiple interdictions, such as the arrest of three Bahamians involved in drug trafficking in August 2015. Cuba has also shown willingness to apprehend and turnover U.S. fugitives and assist in U.S. judicial proceedings. Cuba has been cooperating with the United States on antidrug efforts since 1999, including sharing information on drug trafficking. Cuba has expressed interest in a bilateral antidrug cooperation agreement with the U.S., presenting a draft accord for review. The State Department has acknowledged the potential benefits of such an agreement in advancing counternarcotics efforts. Technical discussions on counternarcotics were held in 2014, with information sharing on trends and enforcement procedures. In 2016, the United States and Cuba discussed law enforcement and counternarcotics cooperation, focusing on stopping the illegal flow of narcotics. Enhanced communication and cooperation between the two countries, along with real-time information-sharing, could lead to increased interdictions and disruptions of illegal drug trafficking. Cuban security officials visited the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South in April 2016. Task Force South (JIATF-South) in Key West, FL is responsible for detecting and monitoring illicit drug trafficking in the region. U.S. and Cuban officials signed a Counternarcotics Arrangement to enhance cooperation on antidrug efforts. Cuba's compensation for expropriated U.S. properties remains an issue in normalizing relations. The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (FCSC) has certified 5,913 claims for expropriated U.S. properties in Cuba valued at $1.9 billion in two different claim programs. The total value of the properties with accrued interest would be around $8 billion. The FCSC certified 5,911 claims of U.S. citizens and companies whose property was confiscated by the Cuban government through April 1967. In 2006, two additional claims were certified in a second program covering property confiscated after April 1967. Resolving the outstanding claims would require negotiation and cooperation between the two governments, as Cuba has expressed willingness to negotiate compensation but does not recognize the FCSC. Cuba is willing to negotiate compensation for U.S. claims but does not recognize the FCSC valuation. They propose using declared taxable value for expropriated U.S. properties, estimating it at almost $1 billion instead of $1.9 billion. Cuba also emphasizes considering losses from U.S. economic sanctions, estimating damages at $121 billion. U.S. laws address compensation for expropriated properties by the Cuban government, with specific provisions like Section 620(a)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The LIBERTAD Act (P.L. 104-114) requires the Cuban government to return expropriated properties to U.S. citizens or provide compensation. The President can waive restrictions in the interest of the United States. The Act links property claims to determining when a transition government or democratically elected government is in power in Cuba, affecting the economic embargo. The LIBERTAD Act requires the Cuban government to return expropriated properties to U.S. citizens or provide compensation. It prohibits U.S. persons or entities from financing transactions involving confiscated property in Cuba owned by U.S. nationals. Sanctions may be suspended or terminated based on the President's determination of a transition government in power. The transition government will end when a democratically elected government is in power. Two House hearings in the 114th Congress focused on property claims issues. U.S. and Cuban officials have had three meetings on claims, discussing FCSC-certified claims, U.S. court judgments against Cuba, and some U.S. government claims. The Cuban delegation raised the issue of claims against the United States related to the U.S. embargo. Talks on historical claims settlement practices were held between the U.S. and Cuba. Ra\u00fal Castro is set to step down from power in February 2018, signaling a move towards a post-Castro era in Cuba. The Cuban government is undergoing generational change, with Ra\u00fal Castro set to step down in February 2018. Economic reforms are gradually taking place, moving towards a mixed economy with a stronger private sector. The Obama Administration's policy shift towards Cuba has increased engagement, but the extent of economic linkages remains uncertain due to the ongoing embargo and sanctions. The direction of U.S. policy towards Cuba under the incoming Trump Administration is also uncertain. The incoming Trump Administration's uncertain policy towards Cuba may reverse some of the Obama Administration's changes. The human rights situation in Cuba remains a key concern for Congress. Debate over Cuba policy, especially regarding economic sanctions, is expected to continue in the 115th Congress. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, signed into law in November 2015, included a provision regarding the U.S. Naval Station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, prohibiting funding for its closure or abandonment. The provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 prohibits closure or modification of the U.S. Naval Station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. It also mandates a report on the military implications of the station within 180 days. The House approved a provision to prohibit the closure or transfer of the U.S. Naval Station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba in the FY2016 omnibus appropriations bill. The Senate version did not have a similar provision. The bill was signed into law without controversial Cuba policy riders. The omnibus appropriations bill did not include controversial Cuba policy riders found in individual House and Senate bills. It did contain provisions related to Guant\u00e1namo detainees and restrictions on funding for Cuba. The omnibus appropriations bill provided $27.140 million for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, excluding funds for merging with Voice of America. It also allocated $20 million for democracy programs in Cuba. Additionally, key supervisory positions at U.S. diplomatic facilities in Cuba must be held by U.S. citizens, as per Section 512 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2016. The Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction Act, 2017, mandates that diplomatic facilities in Cuba must include a sensitive compartmented information facility. The bill also prohibits the closure or realignment of the United States Naval Station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, signed into law on December 23, 2016, includes a provision that prohibits the Secretary of Defense from using FY2017 funds to invite, assist, or assure the Department of Defense in any way. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 prohibits the Department of Defense from involving Cuba in joint exercises or security conferences until certain conditions are met, including human rights fulfillment and justice for Cuban military officials indicted in the US. Exceptions are made for lease payments and maintenance transactions at the U.S. Naval Station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 prohibits the Department of Defense from involving Cuba in joint exercises or security conferences until certain conditions are met, including human rights fulfillment and justice for Cuban military officials indicted in the US. Exceptions are made for lease payments and maintenance transactions at the U.S. Naval Station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, including periodic contact between U.S. and Cuban officials for security and management discussions. The FY2017 NDAA prohibits U.S.-Cuban military interactions, maintains the U.S. Naval Station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and excludes a provision on U.S. jurisdiction and control without congressional action. The final version of the law, S.Res. 418 (Collins), recognizes women leaders worldwide, including Yoani S\u00e1nchez of Cuba, for their dedication to their causes. H.R. 636 (Tiberi) is the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2016, originally introduced as the Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015. The Relief Act of 2015 was passed by the House on February 13, 2015, and Senate floor consideration began on April 7, 2016. Senate passed the act on April 19, 2016, with several potential amendments related to U.S. policy toward Cuba. Amendments included restrictions on travel to Cuba, eligibility for refugee/parolee assistance, transit stops in the United States by foreign air carriers traveling to or from Cuba, and authorization for air carriers to provide service between the United States and Cuba for citizens of other countries. The House passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 on May 15, 2015, and the Senate passed it on June 18, 2015. The bill included limitations related to extradition of criminals from Cuba and compensation for U.S. property confiscated by the Cuban government. President vetoed the measure on October 22, 2015, with a provision prohibiting funding to close the U.S. Naval Station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. Section 1036 of H.R. 2577 requires a report on the military implications of closing the U.S. Naval Station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. The bill also addresses the relinquishment of control of Guant\u00e1namo Bay to Cuba and modifications to the 1934 treaty. Section 193 of H.R. 2577 aimed to restrict funds from being used for scheduled flights to Cuba if they pass through confiscated Cuban government property. Section 414 aimed to prevent funds from being used for licensing commercial vessels within 7 miles of confiscated Cuban property. The House rejected an amendment related to this issue during floor consideration. During House floor consideration on June 4, 2015, H.Amdt. 404 (Lee) was rejected by a vote of 176-247, which would have prohibited the implementation of Cuba provisions. The Administration strongly objected to restrictions on flights and cruise ships to Cuba and limitations on permitted travel options. The Senate version of the bill did not include Cuba sanctions provisions. The FY2016 omnibus bill, P.L. 114-113 (H.R. 2029), did not have Cuba provisions. H.R. 2578 (Culberson) was introduced for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016. The House rejected a provision in the Commerce Department funds bill that would have restricted exports to Cuba's Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and Ministry of the Interior. The provision did not affect exports of agricultural commodities, medicines, or medical goods permitted under TSRA. The Administration objected to the bill, citing highly objectionable provisions. The bill included objectionable provisions related to Cuba sanctions, which were not present in the Senate version. The House Committee on Appropriations introduced H.R. 2772, while the Senate Appropriations Committee introduced S. 1725 for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2016. The Administration expressed concerns about the legislation before it was considered by the full House Appropriations Committee. The Administration raised serious concerns about the legislation, particularly regarding provisions related to Cuba sanctions. Sections in both House and Senate versions would restrict funding for the government of Cuba and impose limitations on foreign aid. The House bill also included restrictions against waivers for these provisions. Section 7031(c) of the House bill prohibits waivers for Cuban government officials and their immediate family involved in corruption or human rights violations. The Secretary of State must consider the impact of corrupt Cuban officials confiscating American properties on U.S. businesses and national interests. The Senate bill does not have a similar provision. The House bill includes a provision to provide $30 million for promoting democracy and civil society in Cuba, with $8 million designated for the National Endowment for Democracy. The remaining funds would be administered by various State Department bureaus and USAID, with grants over $1 million awarded to organizations with experience in promoting democracy in Cuba. The Senate bill, in contrast, would provide $15 million in ESF. The Senate bill allocates $15 million for Cuba democracy programs and $5 million for private Cuban entrepreneurs, with a portion of $50.5 million designated for promoting Internet freedom in Cuba. The House bill prohibits funding for independent grantee organizations for broadcasting in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Cuba, and recommends $28.130 million for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. The House bill recommends $28.130 million for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, $2.2 million less than the Administration's request. An amendment to shift $5 million from Cuba broadcasting to counter Russian media was rejected. The Senate bill recommends $27.130 million for OCB and does not support merging OCB with VOA's Latin American Division. The Administration requested $6 million for converting the U.S. Interests Section in Havana to an embassy. The House bill had provisions blocking part of the Administration's Cuba policy shift, while the Senate bill had provisions related to financial transactions with Cuba. The House bill had provisions blocking part of the Administration's Cuba policy shift, while the Senate bill had provisions related to financial transactions with Cuba. The House Appropriations Committee approved the draft bill on June 17, 2015, despite opposition from the Administration regarding funding prohibitions on nonacademic educational exchanges with Cuba. The letter expressed concerns about provisions in H.R. 2995 that would restrict people-to-people educational travel to Cuba and the import of confiscated property. The Obama Administration had previously amended embargo regulations to allow such travel. The Obama Administration amended embargo regulations in January 2015 to allow the importation of tobacco and alcohol products from Cuba as part of a $400 limit for personal use. In October 2016, value restrictions were lifted, and only normal duty and tax exemptions apply for merchandise imported as personal baggage. Section 132 of H.R. 2995 would have prohibited financial transactions with Cuba's Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and Ministry of the Interior, but not for exports permitted under TSRA. Section 638 of the bill aimed to repeal the prohibition on financing agricultural sales to Cuba under TSRA, allowing for payment in cash or financing by third-country financial institutions. Section 641 would have lifted restrictions on U.S. sanctions for financing agricultural exports, travel, and shipping to Cuba. Section 641 of the bill aimed to lift restrictions on travel to Cuba for U.S. citizens and legal residents, allowing for transactions incident to travel. The provision added by a Moran amendment stated that any laws or regulations restricting travel to Cuba would cease to have effect upon enactment, except for restrictions important to national security or human health. The bill aimed to restrict vessels entering Cuban ports from engaging in trade with the United States within 180 days, unless licensed by the Treasury Department. This provision was added by a Tester amendment. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees introduced bills to prohibit funds from being used to approve the importation of property confiscated by the Cuban government. The bill aimed to restrict vessels entering Cuban ports from engaging in trade with the United States within 180 days, unless licensed by the Treasury Department. The provision appeared to prohibit the importation of alcohol and tobacco products by authorized U.S. travelers as accompanied baggage. The Administration expressed concern about \"highly problematic ideological riders,\" including a provision that prohibits funds to be used to allow property confiscated by the Cuban government to enter the United States. The Senate bill did not have Cuba sanctions provisions. H.R. 4678 (Royce) aimed to preserve U.S. jurisdiction and control of the U.S. naval station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Introduced on March 3, 2016, the bill was reported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on March 15, 2016. The Committee on Foreign Affairs reported H.R. 4974, S. 2806, and H.R. 2577 for the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017. H.R. 4974 and S. 2806 were introduced and reported by their respective committees in April 2016, with H.R. 4974 passing the House in May 2016. H.R. 2577 was used by the Senate for FY2017 transportation and military construction appropriations, along with Zika funding, and was approved in May 2016. The House agreed to the Senate amendment on H.R. 2577, including military construction appropriations and Zika funding, but not transportation appropriations. A conference report was filed in the House on June 22, 2016, and was agreed upon on June 23. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on September 6, 2016. Section 130 of the conference report would have prevented the closure or realignment of the United States Naval Station in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. For final action, see P.L. 114-223 (H.R. 5325). The House Committee on Appropriations introduced H.Rept. 114-531 on April 26, 2016, while S. 2956 was introduced and reported by the Senate on May 19, 2016. The Senate bill recommended $1.5 million for the Foreign Agricultural Service to establish an overseas post in Cuba. H.R. 5393 and S. 2837, known as the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017, were introduced with provisions related to Cuba. Section 537 of the House bill aimed to restrict funds from being used for exports to the Cuban military or intelligence service. The provision in H.R. 2578 aimed to restrict exports to Cuba involving the Cuban military or intelligence service, potentially impacting U.S. export expansion to Cuba. The Administration objected to this provision, citing non-germane foreign policy restrictions. Section 538 of H.R. 5485/S. 3067 aimed to prevent funds from being used to approve trademarks similar to confiscated ones without owner consent. Despite this provision, the USPTO renewed the Havana Club trademark in 2016 until 2026. The Administration strongly objected to four Cuba-related provisions in a bill passed on July 7, 2016, stating that they would undermine the President's policy on Cuba. One provision aimed to restrict people-to-people educational travel to Cuba, which the Administration argued would reduce interactions and go against their goal of increasing overall travel and information flow to Cuba. The Administration objected to provisions in a bill that would restrict travel to Cuba and financial transactions with Cuban entities linked to the military or intelligence services. They argued that these restrictions would hinder the flow of information and resources to private Cubans and chill authorized U.S.-Cuba commerce. The Administration opposed restrictions on travel to Cuba and financial transactions with Cuban entities tied to the military or intelligence services. They argued that these restrictions could impede authorized U.S.-Cuba commerce and hinder support for the Cuban people. The provision in question would have prohibited certain financial transactions related to confiscated assets unless the original owner consented.
