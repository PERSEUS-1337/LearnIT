    "content": "The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 required paraprofessionals in Title I schools to meet minimum qualifications by January 8, 2006. The deadline was extended to the end of the 2005-2006 school year to align with the deadline for highly qualified teachers. The use of instructional aides in U.S. classrooms has been increasing annually. Instructional aides accounted for 2.5% of total full-time equivalent instructional staff in 1970, increasing to 17.2% in 2009. Paraprofessionals in Title I-A funded schools make up about one-third of instructional staff and are taking on more classroom responsibilities unsupervised. The quality of paraprofessional staff is increasingly important for instruction quality in U.S. schools, leading to support for federal instructional aide standards. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) enacted higher standards for Title I paraprofessionals, requiring them to have completed two years of higher education, obtained an associate's degree, or passed a state academic assessment. This was a change from the previous requirement of just a high school diploma. Title I paraprofessionals hired before January 8, 2002, must meet NCLB qualification requirements by the end of the 2005-2006 school year. These requirements apply to paraprofessionals with instructional duties, such as tutoring, classroom assistance, parental involvement, library support, translation, or direct student instruction. Non-instructional roles like food services or playground supervision are exempt. Under NCLB, paraprofessionals with instructional duties must meet qualification requirements by the end of the 2005-2006 school year. Non-instructional roles like food services or playground supervision are exempt. ESEA Section 1119(e) specifies that paraprofessionals serving as translators or in parental involvement activities need a secondary school diploma but no additional requirements. LEAs must make progress towards state objectives for teacher quality and student achievement. If an LEA fails to meet objectives for three years, they cannot use Title I-A funds on new paraprofessionals. Recent guidance from ED clarifies NCLB implementation questions. The 2004 guidance clarifies requirements for paraprofessionals under NCLB, specifying rules for Schoolwide and Targeted Assistance Title I programs. Paraprofessionals in Schoolwide programs must meet NCLB rules regardless of funding source, while in Targeted Assistance programs, only those paid with Title I funds must meet requirements. Special education paraprofessionals in Targeted Assistance programs must meet requirements even if only part of their pay comes from Title I funds. Private school paraprofessionals funded by Title I must also meet NCLB requirements. The 2004 guidance clarifies requirements for paraprofessionals under NCLB, specifying rules for Schoolwide and Targeted Assistance Title I programs. LEAs have discretion in determining who qualifies as an \"existing\" paraprofessional and if qualifications are transferable. \"Two years of study\" means the equivalent of two years of full-time study as determined by an institution of higher education. Continuing education credits may count towards the two-year requirement. Continuing education credits can count towards the two-year requirement for paraprofessionals under NCLB. Guidance discusses assessing paraprofessionals' knowledge and abilities through various methods to determine content knowledge and instructional competence. Results should identify areas for additional training. Most states use multiple types of assessments for paraprofessionals, including ParaPro and locally developed tests. Some states have qualifications exceeding federal standards and require professional certification for paraprofessionals. Professional development programs are available in some states. Programmatic requirements for supervising paraprofessionals are outlined in the guidance. The guidance stipulates that paraprofessionals must work under direct supervision of a highly qualified teacher, including lesson preparation, instruction support, and student evaluation. Programs staffed solely by paraprofessionals are not allowed, and the rules apply to contracted paraprofessionals in Title I programs. The ED guidance discusses funding sources for professional development and assessment of paraprofessionals. LEAs must allocate at least 5% of their Title I, Part A funds for this purpose, with additional funds required for schools identified as needing improvement. Various Title programs can be used for professional development of paraprofessionals. The guidance outlines conditions where LEAs cannot use Title I funds to hire new paraprofessionals, such as failing to meet state objectives for qualified teachers. Exceptions include filling vacancies or addressing increased student enrollment. Data from 42 states and DC showed that 10 states had less than half of their paraprofessionals meeting NCLB requirements in the 2003-2004 school year. In 10 states, fewer than half of paraprofessionals met NCLB requirements, while in four states, at least 9 out of 10 met the standards. Most paraprofessionals met the qualifications by the June 30, 2006 deadline. ESEA programs were authorized through FY2007, with an extension through FY2008. Paraprofessional quality requirements remain in place, even for LEAs with ESEA flexibility waivers. The 114th Congress is considering reauthorizing the ESEA, with a focus on paraprofessional quality requirements. Questions arise about the rigor of assessments for paraprofessionals and their alignment with academic standards. Some suggest that current tests may not accurately measure instructional aides' ability to enhance classroom instruction. There is a debate on whether the reauthorized ESEA should clarify the nature of these assessments and if the Department of Education should have more authority to enforce higher standards. Additionally, there is a discussion on expanding the qualification requirements to a broader group of instructional aides.

Additionally, there is a discussion on expanding the qualification requirements to a broader group of instructional aides. Should requirements be applied to all paraprofessionals with instructional responsibilities, not just those paid with Title I-A funds? Should exceptions for certain roles be curtailed? Is the language regarding \"direct supervision\" too vague? Are there other ways to encourage paraprofessional development beyond minimum qualifications? Have the qualification requirements significantly affected the use of Title I-A funds for hiring paraprofessionals? The 114th Congress is considering reauthorizing the ESEA with a focus on paraprofessional quality requirements. Questions arise about the impact of qualification requirements on the use of Title I-A funds for hiring paraprofessionals. There is a debate on the clarity and enforcement of assessment standards for instructional aides, as well as the roles of states versus LEAs in setting policies. The lack of guidance from the Department of Education on paraprofessional qualification requirements has led to ambiguity."
