    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protecting America's Wolves Act\". The Congress acknowledges the historical persecution of wolves and their near extermination in the lower 48 States. The Eastern Timber Wolf, once widespread in the Eastern United States, including the Catskill Mountains of New York, is now endangered. Reintroducing this subspecies into New York would serve the public interest. Reintroducing the Eastern Timber Wolf in New York would benefit the public interest by ensuring the survival of the subspecies, enhancing ecosystem biodiversity, correcting past mistakes, and increasing understanding of wolves and the environment. The public debate on wolf reintroduction in the Northeast would also promote a deeper understanding of species interactions in natural environments. Reintroducing the Eastern Timber Wolf in New York is beneficial for ensuring subspecies survival, enhancing ecosystem biodiversity, correcting past mistakes, and promoting a deeper understanding of species interactions in natural environments. The Secretary of the Interior will prepare a recovery plan for the Eastern Timber Wolf in the Northeastern United States, including releasing wolves in the Catskill Mountain area of New York. The plan will outline goals for wolf population recovery and a process for obtaining wolves from Canada for release. The recovery plan for the Eastern Timber Wolf in the Northeastern United States includes releasing wolves in the Catskill Mountain area of New York. The plan outlines goals for wolf population recovery and proposes cooperative agreements with State and local government agencies for releases. It also determines the number of wolves to be released for a self-sustaining population and includes a process for compensating New York residents for livestock depredation by wolves. The plan for the Eastern Timber Wolf in the Northeastern United States includes releasing wolves in the Catskill Mountain area of New York. It involves compensating residents for livestock depredation, establishing a fund for donations, estimating the needed amount for compensation, studying the feasibility of releasing wolves in other parts of New York, and reducing road densities for wolf dispersal. The plan for the Eastern Timber Wolf in the Northeastern United States includes releasing wolves in certain areas of New York to provide for wolf dispersal corridors. The Secretary may accept and use donations of funds for compensating New York residents for depredation of livestock by Eastern Timber Wolves under the Plan, depositing them into the PET Wolf Fund for compensation. The Secretary will release Eastern Timber Wolves in the Catskill Mountain area of New York as per the Plan, acquiring wolves and land for release by a specified date. The released wolf population will not be subject to certain provisions of the Endangered Species Act. Land acquisition for this purpose is also outlined. The Secretary may acquire land in the Catskill Mountain area of New York for releasing Eastern Timber Wolves. The acquired lands will be managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Critical habitat areas for the wolves will be designated within 6 months of the first release. The Act defines key terms such as \"Eastern Timber Wolf,\" \"Secretary,\" \"Plan,\" and \"PET Wolf Fund.\" The Secretary may acquire land in New York for releasing wolves, which will be managed by the Bureau of Land Management.
