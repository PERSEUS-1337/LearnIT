    "content": "GENERALLY AVAILABLE SOFTWARE. Section 17 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to give the Secretary exclusive authority over exports of computer hardware, software, and technology for information security, with exceptions for military use. No validated license is required for certain exports, except under specific Acts. The Secretary has the authority to authorize the export of software with encryption capabilities without the need for a validated license. The Secretary can authorize the export of software with encryption capabilities for nonmilitary end-uses in countries where similar software is allowed for use by financial institutions not controlled by US persons, unless there is evidence of diversion to military or terrorist use, modification for such use, or reexport without US authorization. The term 'as is' refers to software programs, including those with encryption capabilities, that are not customized for specific purchasers but may require certain installation parameters to function properly with the purchaser's system. The term 'is designed for installation by the purchaser' for software (including encryption capabilities) means the software company intends for the purchaser to install the program on a computing device with provided instructions and may offer help services. The term 'computing device' refers to a device with microprocessor-based central processing units for data processing. 'Computer hardware' in information security includes computer systems, equipment, and integrated circuits."
