    "content": "The \"Promoting Efficiency and Savings in Government Act\" requires auditing of energy performance in government-owned buildings, setting efficiency standards for leased buildings, promoting energy efficiency and pollution reduction, and reporting to Congress on energy use and cost-savings. The \"Promoting Efficiency and Savings in Government Act\" mandates energy audits for public buildings. The \"Promoting Efficiency and Savings in Government Act\" requires energy managers of General Services Administration-owned buildings to conduct energy audits within one year of enactment. The audits must identify energy efficiency modifications that will result in cost savings equal to the investment within 10 years. The Administrator of General Services must report the findings to specific Senate and House committees within one year of the Act's enactment. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will review efficiency improvements, cost-savings estimates, and implementation status identified in energy audits conducted under the \"Promoting Efficiency and Savings in Government Act\". SEC. 4. IMPROVING EFFICIENCY OF LEASED BUILDINGS. Section 435 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to include efficiency improvements in federal building leases, such as energy intensity standards, lighting efficiency requirements, and incentive structures. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to include efficiency improvements in federal building leases, with standards issued by the Administrator of General Services to improve efficiency in a cost-effective manner. The Secretary will periodically review and recommend revisions to these standards. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to include efficiency improvements in federal building leases. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in coordination with the Administrator of General Services, will submit reports to Congress every 2 years on the implementation and compliance of federal departments and agencies with the new standards. SEC. 5. LEASED BUILDING EFFICIENCY REPORTING. Section 3307(b) of title 40, United States Code, is amended to include an assessment of future energy performance and water efficiency in any prospectus for building construction, alteration, or acquisition to be leased. This includes descriptions of energy efficient and renewable energy systems, as well as water saving technologies to be used. The prospectus for building construction, alteration, or acquisition to be leased must include details such as expected energy and water use intensity, alternative workplace strategies, lifecycle cost analysis, and financing methods like energy service contracts. SEC. 6. REPORTING ON BUILDING ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENCY. Section 436(f) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to include a requirement for reporting on the energy and water use of Federal buildings, detailing data by various categories such as Department climate zone, building type, and cost savings from energy efficiency measures. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to include reporting requirements on energy and water use in Federal buildings, including cost savings from energy efficiency measures and descriptions of design features contributing to energy and water reductions."
