The \"Independent Contractor Determination Act of 2001\" provides a safe harbor for determining that certain individuals are not employees under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If specific requirements are met for a service performed by an individual, the service provider, recipient, and payor will not be treated as employers, and compensation for the service will not be considered employment income. The \"Independent Contractor Determination Act of 2001\" allows service providers to apply other laws in determining if an individual is not an employee. Service providers must have the ability to realize a profit or loss, agree to perform services for a specific time or task, and meet other requirements. The \"Independent Contractor Determination Act of 2001\" outlines requirements for service providers to be considered independent contractors, including having a significant investment in assets or incurring unreimbursed expenses, having a principal place of business, and not primarily providing services at a single recipient's facilities. The \"Independent Contractor Determination Act of 2001\" requires service providers to pay fair market rent for facilities or operate primarily from equipment provided by the service provider. Written contracts must state the service provider is not an employee for tax purposes and is responsible for their own taxes. Additionally, service providers must meet business structure and benefits requirements. The \"Independent Contractor Determination Act of 2001\" requires service providers to operate as a corporation or limited liability company under state laws and not receive employee benefits from the service recipient. Special rules apply if reporting requirements are not met, affecting the determination of employee status. The \"Independent Contractor Determination Act of 2001\" mandates that service providers must operate as a corporation or limited liability company and not receive employee benefits from the service recipient. Special rules apply if reporting requirements are not met, impacting the determination of employee status. The service provider must operate as a properly constituted corporation or limited liability company, provide incorporation or formation details, a mailing address, and employer identification number. All payments for services must be made to the corporation or LLC to satisfy the requirements. A safe harbor provision is available. The safe harbor provision limits the number of covered workers not treated as employees to the threshold number, which is the greater of 10 covered workers or 3 percent of covered workers for any calendar year. The term 'covered worker' refers to an individual for whom employment taxes were paid in all 4 quarters of the previous year. If a service provider can show it was reasonable not to treat them as an employee and cooperated with the IRS, the burden of proof shifts to the IRS. The burden of proof regarding treatment of a service provider as an employee shifts to the Secretary. If the service provider is operating through an entity owned by them, references to the service provider include the entity. Determinations by the Secretary regarding the treatment of a service provider as an employee are effective from the notice date. The service recipient or payor must have a written contract meeting specific requirements, comply with reporting rules, and show a valid reason for not treating the service provider as an employee. The Secretary can determine if a service provider should have been classified as an employee. The service provider must meet contract requirements, comply with reporting rules, and show a valid reason for not being classified as an employee. The reasonable cause exception allows for meeting reporting requirements if failure is not willful neglect. This subsection does not limit opportunities for review by the Secretary. The notice date is 30 days after the proposed deficiency letter for administrative review. The administrative review process in the IRS Office of Appeals is initiated when a deficiency notice is sent. Definitions for service provider, service recipient, and payor are provided in this section. The terms 'service recipient' and 'payor' do not include entities where the service provider owns over 5% of voting power or profits. 'In connection with performing the service' refers to activities related to the provider's business. 'Principal place of business' has the same meaning as defined in another section. 'Fair market rent' is defined as well. The term 'fair market rent' is defined as a fixed rental fee based on the fair value of facilities, established in a contract similar to those offered to unrelated persons. Section 530(d) of the Revenue Act of 1978 is repealed, and a clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this section regarding determining certain individuals as not employees apply to services performed after the enactment of this Act. The determinations by the secretary under Section 3511(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 apply after the enactment of this Act, and the amendment to Section 530(d) applies to periods ending after the enactment of this Act."
