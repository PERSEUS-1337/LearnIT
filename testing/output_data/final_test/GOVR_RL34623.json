    "content": "The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, P.L. 110 - 289, includes provisions to strengthen oversight of government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It allows the Treasury to provide financial support during emergencies, addresses mortgage licensing, revises FHA operations, protects service members from foreclosures, promotes redevelopment of abandoned homes, assists disabled veterans with housing needs, and contains housing-related tax provisions. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, P.L. 110 - 289, establishes the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to regulate government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. FHFA has broad authority to oversee the GSEs, review new mortgages, and reorganize insolvent entities. The FHFA was granted authority to take over and reorganize insolvent Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, placing them under conservatorship. It can set capital requirements, dispose of assets, and limit portfolio sizes. The FHFA also has regulatory powers over the FHLBs, recognizing differences between Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHLBs. The Secretary of the Treasury can lend or invest money in regulated entities during emergencies. The authority granted to the Treasury to lend or invest money in regulated entities expires on December 31, 2009. The Congressional Budget Office estimates potential costs at $25 billion, with a possibility of exceeding $50 billion. The act allows consultation between the Federal Reserve, Treasury, and FHFA on safety and soundness issues. Concerns over mortgage market conditions led to the creation of a voluntary program to assist homeowners at risk of foreclosure. The act creates a $300 billion program to help homeowners facing foreclosure by offering FHA-insured mortgage refinancing. It aims to address issues with mortgage originator oversight and background checks. The act aims to create uniformity in mortgage originator licensing and registration, resulting in a national database of mortgage originators. It encourages states to develop a licensing system for anyone originating a home mortgage. The FHA seeks congressional approval to modernize lending practices to better serve homeowners and increase FHA loan limits. The new FHA loan limit in high-cost areas is the lesser of 115% of the local area median home price or 150% of the GSE conforming loan limit. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 created a temporary new high-cost exception to the conforming loan limit and increased the maximum size loan that the FHA can insure. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 increases the maximum mortgage that the VA can guarantee to the FHA's maximum until December 31, 2008. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 created a temporary new high-cost exception to the conforming loan limit and increased the maximum size loan that the FHA can insure. P.L. 110 - 289 appropriates $4 billion in community development block grants (CDBG) to state and local governments for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes. HUD was given 60 days from enactment to develop an allocation formula that considers the percentage of foreclosed homes, the percentage of homes with subprime mortgages, and the percentage of loans in default or delinquent. The Housing for Disabled Veterans program provides grants to injured veterans for housing modifications. Eligibility criteria include various disabilities such as loss of extremities or blindness. The program now includes active duty members and veterans, as well as individuals with severe burn injuries. Assistance amounts have been increased to $60,000 and $12,000 depending on the disability type. The Housing for Disabled Veterans program offers grants for housing modifications, with increased assistance amounts of $60,000 and $12,000 based on disability type. The act also includes a tax credit for first-time homebuyers and allows deductions for property taxes for non-itemizers. Restrictions are placed on the homeowner capital gains exclusion for second homes. The Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008 created the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to oversee Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank system. The FHFA director is appointed by the President for a five-year term to ensure safe and sound operations of regulated entities and promote a stable housing finance market. The FHFA oversees Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank system, ensuring safe operations and promoting a stable housing finance market. It can issue regulations, review acquisitions, administer conservatorship, and establish standards for internal controls and audits. It also enhances the prohibition against excessive executive compensation by considering wrongdoing and holding pay in escrow. The FHFA has the authority to stabilize the housing finance system during emergencies by purchasing obligations and securities of housing GSEs. It must establish capital requirements for enterprises to ensure safe operations and maintain sufficient reserves. The FHFA also consults with the Federal Reserve about risks posed by housing GSEs and must confer with the Chairman before placing Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac in receivership or conservatorship. FHFA regulations govern portfolio holdings of enterprises, ensuring sufficient capital and alignment with mission. FHFA can order asset disposal or acquisition. If a regulated entity fails prudential standards, a corrective plan must be submitted within 30 days. FHFA may restrict asset growth or require increased capital until deficiencies are corrected. The Federal Housing Finance Oversight Board advises the Director on strategies and policies. FHFA is funded by assessments from enterprises and Federal Home Loan Banks. Regulated entities must create an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion for diversity and inclusion in business activities.

Regulated entities must create an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion for diversity and inclusion in business activities. HUD's authority for new product approval and housing goals is transferred to the FHFA. New products must align with the enterprise's charter, public interest, safety, and soundness of the mortgage finance system. Requests for new product approval are published in the Federal Register with a 30-day public comment period. Temporary approval may be granted under exigent circumstances. The conforming loan limit will increase annually based on a housing price index maintained by FHFA. The legislation increases the conforming loan limit in high-cost housing areas to the lesser of 115% of the area median or 150% of the national limit. Loans above the national limit should be securitized. FHFA now monitors housing goals for enterprises, including goals for minorities. Annual goals are set for each enterprise's purchase of conventional loans. The FHFA sets annual goals for enterprises to purchase mortgages for low-income families, very low-income families, families in low-income areas, and low-income families for refinance mortgages. Low-income areas are defined as census tracts with median incomes not exceeding 80% of the area median income. Very low-income is defined as incomes not exceeding 50% of the area median income for owner-occupied and rental units. Extremely low-income is defined as incomes not exceeding 30% of the area median income for owner-occupied units. The FHFA sets annual goals for enterprises to purchase mortgages for low-income families, very low-income families, families in low-income areas, and low-income families for refinance mortgages. There is an annual multifamily special affordable housing goal for mortgages on multifamily housing that is affordable to low-income families, with a subgoal for units affordable to very low-income families. Units financed with state housing finance agency bonds will count towards the goal. FHFA may establish additional requirements for smaller multifamily housing projects within the goal. A regulated entity may petition the Director to reduce the level of any goal if needed. If an enterprise is not meeting a housing goal and it is feasible, FHFA has tools to address the issue such as requiring a corrective plan, issuing a cease and desist order, or imposing civil fines. The FHFA can take enforcement actions such as issuing a cease and desist order, imposing fines, or prohibiting new products if enterprises do not comply with serving underserved markets. Enterprises are required to improve liquidity and capital distribution for mortgage financing in underserved markets, including manufactured housing, affordable housing preservation, and rural housing for low-income families. The Housing Trust Fund is established to increase housing opportunities for very low-income families. A Housing Trust Fund is created to increase housing opportunities for very low-income families and those in low-income areas. Grants can be used for rental housing production, preservation, and rehabilitation for extremely and very low-income families, as well as for homeownership assistance for first-time home buyers. Grants cannot be used for political activities, advocacy, lobbying, counseling services, or travel expenses. FHFA regulations prohibit grant amounts from being used for administrative or outreach costs, except for carrying out the program required under this section. The Housing Trust Fund requires each enterprise to contribute 0.042% of unpaid principal balances of new business purchases. Contributions can be suspended in case of financial difficulties. 25% of the fund supports a reserve fund for HOPE for Homeowners bonds, with the remaining portion allocated to affordable housing programs. The HUD competitively awards grants to support affordable housing for low-income families. States and Indian tribes receive funds based on a formula and must create plans for grant distribution. The minimum allocation for states is $3 million. FHFA sets capital standards for FHLB, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. FHFA can downgrade a regulated entity's capital classification if their conduct poses a risk to core or total capital. An undercapitalized entity, whether an enterprise or GSE, may face restrictions on asset growth and increased supervision if deemed unsafe or engaging in unsound practices. FHFA can take actions such as electing new directors or dismissing executives for significantly undercapitalized regulated entities. Executives of significantly undercapitalized entities require prior approval for compensation. FHFA can appoint a receiver or conservator for undercapitalized regulated entities facing financial difficulty or violations of law. They may issue subpoenas, cease-and-desist orders, and impose fines for safety and soundness reasons. In extreme cases, FHFA can suspend or remove executives and impose fines up to $2 million per day. The FHFA has the authority to suspend or remove regulated entity-affiliated parties, issue industry-wide suspensions, and impose criminal penalties for involvement in the affairs of a suspended entity. The act eliminates presidentially appointed members from the boards of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHLBs, reducing board sizes. FHFA has regulatory oversight over all housing GSEs, considering differences between enterprises and FHLBs in enforcement actions. Each FHLB will be managed by a board of 13 members. The FHFA has regulatory oversight over all housing GSEs and FHLBs, with the authority to suspend or remove regulated entity-affiliated parties. FHLBs are managed by a board of 13 directors, with the majority being officers of member banks and at least two-fifths being independent directors. FHLBs may merge with approval from FHFA, and are exempt from certain SEC reporting regulations.

FHLBs may merge with approval from FHFA, and are exempt from certain SEC reporting regulations. Additionally, the \"HOPE for Homeowners Act of 2008\" creates a program to help financially distressed homeowners refinance into more affordable FHA-insured mortgages. The HOPE program allows lenders to write down loan balances to 90% of property value with an FHA guarantee. Borrowers must meet debt-to-income ratio requirements and provide tax returns. Lenders must pay a 3% insurance fee, write down mortgages if needed, and waive prepayment penalties. The HOPE program allows lenders to write down loan balances to 90% of property value with an FHA guarantee. Borrowers must meet debt-to-income ratio requirements and provide tax returns.

The HOPE program allows lenders to write down loan balances to 90% of property value with an FHA guarantee. Borrowers must meet debt-to-income ratio requirements and provide tax returns. Lenders must pay a 3% insurance fee, write down mortgages if needed, and waive prepayment penalties. When a property is sold, HOPE program and borrower share appreciation in value. Treasury may issue up to $300 billion in bonds for financing mortgages, and Ginnie Mae can package them into mortgage-backed securities. Mortgages in the program can be issued from October 1, 2008, to September 20, 2011. Loan servicers have a duty to maximize total funds to the loan pool. HUD is responsible for making rules for implementation. HUD reported that due to strict guidelines and specialized requirements, few lenders and borrowers have participated in the program. Changes were made to allow lenders to write down loans to 96.5% of appraised value, pay subordinate lienholders, and extend loan maturity to 40 years. Amendments to TILA provide legal protections to mortgage servicers offering loan modifications. The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 provides legal protections and enhanced disclosure requirements for mortgage servicers offering loan modifications under the Hope for Homeowners program. It also expands the definition of mortgages subject to Truth in Lending disclosures, focusing on adjustable interest rates and penalties for TILA violations. States are tasked with establishing a nationwide mortgage licensing and registry system for residential mortgage loan originators.
