    "content": "U.S. relations with Zimbabwe have been strained since the late 1990s due to human rights violations, undemocratic governance, economic decline, and land seizures. Efforts have been made by the U.S. through policy, diplomatic, and targeted assistance to push for reforms and alleviate hardships in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe has been dominated by the ZANU-PF political party and President Robert Mugabe since gaining independence. Opposition parties have called for reforms, including during a period of power sharing between ZANU-PF and the opposition from 2009 to 2013. The legitimacy of the 2013 elections was disputed, giving ZANU-PF a strong majority in parliament and extending Mugabe's presidency. Since gaining independence, Zimbabwe has been dominated by the ZANU-PF political party and President Robert Mugabe. The 2013 elections extended Mugabe's presidential tenure and ended power-sharing under the GNU. Economic conditions have worsened, leading to public dissatisfaction and large demonstrations against the government. The succession question has caused internal factionalization within ZANU-PF. The ZANU-PF government in Zimbabwe has faced criticism and protests, leading to restrictions on public gatherings and harsh responses to critics. Human rights abuses have raised concerns among advocacy groups and policymakers, prompting the imposition of targeted economic and travel sanctions by successive U.S. administrations. Executive branch officials have considered changes to the sanctions regime. The U.S. sanctions regime on Zimbabwe has not seen major changes despite some willingness to consider adjustments based on governance improvements. Other Western governments, including the EU, have relaxed their sanctions, while the U.S. sanctions were originally called for by Congress in response to negative governance trends in Zimbabwe. The U.S. sanctions regime on Zimbabwe remains unchanged, with restrictions on international financial institution loans or grants to the government until governance reform conditions are met. Congress has reiterated the ban on U.S. support for IFI credit assistance in annual appropriations legislation. Zimbabwe is also ineligible for IFI loans under U.S. laws due to debt non-payment. Policymakers are considering the possibility of Zimbabwe becoming eligible for IFI loans if it repays its arrears. The government must repay IFI arrears to apply for new credit. Congress may reconsider conditions under ZDERA. Succession after Mugabe is a key challenge. It will impact policy and economic future. Succession after Mugabe in Zimbabwe is a key challenge that could lead to political and economic instability in southern Africa. The process is influenced by various domestic factors and may not be easily influenced by foreign interventions. Mugabe's enduring support in the region, including in South Africa, could limit the impact of external actions. Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980 after a struggle against white minority rule, leading to the Lancaster House Agreement negotiated between the British government, the Patriotic Front movement, and the Zimbabwe-Rhodesia government. After gaining independence in 1980, Zimbabwe faced challenges with succession after Mugabe's leadership. The Lancaster House accord led to elections where ZANU won a majority, while ZAPU and a party representing the former white-dominated government also gained seats. ZANU suppressed anti-government activity by ZAPU members, leading to mass detentions and killings. In 1987, ZAPU merged into ZANU, forming ZANU-PF. The effects of the armed struggle and post-independence land allocations continued to impact the country. The post-independence land allocations in Zimbabwe, which favored whites until the 2000s, have greatly influenced politics and ZANU-PF's radical policies. This history has led to anti-Western rhetoric and friction with donor governments. Zimbabwe has had contentious elections since 2000, when ZANU-PF almost lost to the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. Despite public rejection of constitutional amendments, ZANU-PF used its parliamentary majority to allow compulsory land acquisition. The government in Zimbabwe used its parliamentary majority to amend the constitution for compulsory land acquisition from white settlers without compensation, leading to a decline in agricultural production and economic turmoil. This policy, known as the Fast Track Land Reform Program, was followed by the passage of ZDERA in 2001 due to election irregularities and human rights abuses. In the 2008 elections in Zimbabwe, ZANU-PF lost its majority amid reports of irregularities. Mugabe received fewer votes than his opponent Tsvangirai, leading to a violent run-off election boycotted by Tsvangirai. Mugabe won with over 90% of votes, but the international community deemed the result illegitimate. This led to regionally mediated talks and the formation of a Government of National Unity in 2009. The Government of National Unity (GNU) was formed in early 2009 under the terms of the GPA, with Mugabe as president and Tsvangirai as prime minister. The GPA facilitated power-sharing between ZANU-PF, the MDC-T, and a smaller MDC faction, leading to a decrease in political violence and economic reforms that spurred robust recovery in Zimbabwe. The GNU in Zimbabwe faced challenges such as collapsed social services and a lack of hard currency. To address this, they adopted the U.S. dollar as the national currency, ended price controls, and implemented liberalization policies leading to economic growth until 2013. However, governance reforms were slow, with reports of rights violations and political harassment. SADC mediation was needed, and an election roadmap was established in 2011 to address unfulfilled goals of the GPA. The GNU in Zimbabwe faced challenges such as collapsed social services and a lack of hard currency. To address this, they adopted the U.S. dollar as the national currency, ended price controls, and implemented liberalization policies leading to economic growth until 2013. The roadmap's effects were ultimately limited, but one of its main goals, the completion of a new draft constitution, was achieved in early 2013. Voters adopted the new charter by an overwhelming margin in a referendum in March 2013. President Mugabe has led Zimbabwe since independence, initially as prime minister, and has long presided over ZANU-PF. President Mugabe has controlled state power through nationalistic economic policies, social regulation, and periodic repression of opponents. His exit could lead to political transformation, but ZANU-PF's control may hinder this. Despite his age and health issues, Mugabe plans to run for president in 2018 at the age of 94. In late 2015, Mugabe chaired both SADC and the African Union, showing his influence among African leaders. He has no designated successor, leading to succession rivalries. Mugabe stated in July 2016 that he will remain in office as long as the party supports him. The ruling party has fluid divisions and alliances, with Mugabe actively shaping leadership through promotions and dismissals. Debate over his succession and leadership alternatives has been ongoing, but public information on these dynamics is limited. Those challenging Mugabe historically faced penalties. In recent years, the succession issue within ZANU-PF has been openly discussed, with Emmerson Mnangagwa and Joice Mujuru being seen as potential successors to Mugabe. Mnangagwa, a former intelligence chief, was known for being a hardliner, while Mujuru, a former Vice President, was seen as a party loyalist open to reforms. Mugabe purged top ZANU-PF members linked to Mujuru in late 2014. In late 2014, Mugabe led a purge of ZANU-PF members linked to Mujuru, dismissing her as Vice President and elevating Mnangagwa and Mphoko. This move was seen as a way to pave the entry of Grace Mugabe into politics. Mujuru was accused of plotting against Mugabe and was later expelled from ZANU-PF in early 2015. Grace Mugabe has been positioning herself as a potential successor to her husband, President Mugabe. If Mugabe steps down or passes away, Mnangagwa is likely to temporarily succeed him, but the final decision rests with the party. Grace Mugabe's efforts to build her national profile and secure her family's assets could be hindered by her lack of war credentials and youth in Zimbabwe's political landscape. The emergence of the Generation 40 (G40) faction in ZANU-PF signals a shift towards generational change in Zimbabwe's political landscape. This group, made up of a younger cohort, supports Grace Mugabe as a potential successor to President Mugabe. The G40-Mnangagwa rivalry, along with clan alliances and rivalries, are influencing party dynamics and the succession process. Veterans, traditionally a key ZANU-PF support base, may be breaking with Mugabe due to these developments. Intra-party divisions within the opposition party MDC-T led to expulsions of rival members, prompting by-elections in June 2015. ZANU-PF won all 16 seats as MDC factions boycotted the vote. Tsvangirai's health issues have also played a role in the political landscape. In July 2016, Tsvangirai, who has colon cancer, caused internal party dissension by appointing two new party vice presidents. The MDC-T lacks sufficient parliamentary seats to advance legislation and primarily criticizes the government. The government is threatening the party's limited electoral power by replacing MDC-T mayors and proposing a bill to control municipal officers. The opposition party has also faced government attempts to regulate its public gatherings. In April 2016, Zimbabwean courts overturned restrictions on public demonstrations, showing judicial independence. The MDC-T successfully challenged a denial of a protest permit and held a large anti-Mugabe rally. Other opposition parties and stakeholders have also held rallies permitted by courts. The future of opposition parties hinges on the 2018 national elections and coalition-building efforts. The Coalition of Democrats (CODE) was formed by five small parties to support common positions and candidates. Opposition parties in Zimbabwe are collaborating for electoral reform under the National Election Reform Agenda (NERA) coalition. The coalition includes 18 political parties pushing for changes in the electoral system and Zimbabwe Electoral Commission neutrality ahead of the 2018 elections. In addition, a nonpartisan citizen-based campaign called #ThisFlag is demanding accountable governance through social media activism. The #ThisFlag movement, sparked by a video from pastor Evan Mawarire addressing economic issues and corruption, gained widespread support and led to calls for citizen activism against poverty and injustice. Opposition parties and the ruling party, ZANU-PF, responded with their own social media campaigns. In July 2016, #ThisFlag activists, along with the Tajamuka-Sesijikile Campaign, organized a \"Zimbabwe Shutdown\" to protest government dissatisfaction. The #ThisFlag movement in Zimbabwe led to a widespread boycott, strikes by doctors and teachers, and civil unrest in poor urban areas. The protests were in response to economic issues, unpaid civil servant wages, and state corruption. Evan Mawarire, a key figure in the movement, was arrested but later released. President Mugabe and ZANU-PF militants threatened Mawarire, leading him to seek refuge in South Africa. Multiple protests and arrests occurred, prompting authorities to temporarily shut down social media forums used to organize the protests. Relations between ZANU-PF leaders and independence war veterans in Zimbabwe are deteriorating. Grace Mugabe and G40 politicians have belittled the veterans' political roles, leading to tensions. President Mugabe has taken actions against veterans opposing the G40 faction, showing a possible shift in loyalty. Relations between Mugabe and veteran leaders worsened after ZNLWVA criticized ZANU-PF and suggested Mugabe should step down. The government strongly condemned the veterans' statement, leading to arrests of some leaders. The government may be trying to create a pro-G40 faction within ZNLWVA to counter anti-regime actions by current leaders. The Mugabe-ZNLWVA split could deepen internal ZANU-PF divisions, with top officials seeing veterans as crucial. Mugabe's rift with veterans is seen as favoring the G40 over Mnangagwa's faction. Concerns have been raised about government violations of human rights and the rule of law, especially during elections and towards political opponents. In recent years, political violence in Zimbabwe has been perpetrated by state security forces, ZANU-PF youth militants, ZNLWVA members, and MDC militants. Amnesty International reported threats and abuses against human rights defenders and activists. ZANU-PF supporters engaged in harassment and intimidation during by-elections, while opposition activists were involved in violent skirmishes. There were also reports of coercion and manipulation to secure political support for ZANU-PF. The abduction of journalist Itai Dzamara in March 2015 by state security officials has sparked local and international attention. Calls for a full investigation into his case have been made by U.S. officials. Allegations of state involvement in abduction cases have been reported since the early 2000s. Human Rights Watch reported in 2016 that critics of Mugabe's government were harassed, threatened, or arrested by police and state security agents in 2015. Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) and other advocacy groups have criticized the government for misinterpreting laws and not implementing necessary legal reforms. Some judges have defied the government by granting bail to detainees, reducing protest-related charges, and allowing protests. These groups call for reforms to protect freedoms of expression, association, and movement, as well as impartial state media and non-political security services. ZLHR and other human rights groups criticize the government for misusing laws to target activists. They call for legal reforms to align with the constitution. The government aims to pass the Computer Crime and Cyber Crime Bill, granting authorities more power over electronic communications. ZLHR also advocates for adequate resources for constitutionally required commissions and devolution of authority to provinces. ZLHR and HRW advocate for legal reforms to empower provinces and criticize the lack of resources in the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission. Police target journalists and social media writers for defamation, but the Supreme Constitutional Court deemed criminal defamation laws unconstitutional in 2016. Law enforcement crackdowns on street vendors in the informal sector are common, and the state sponsors various operations. The Zimbabwean state sponsors various \"operations\" targeting ZANU-PF opponents and supporting party policies, including campaigns of political violence and forced displacements for political reasons. In 2014, HRW documented abuses against 20,000 flood-displaced persons who were evicted without adequate compensation. The government in Zimbabwe has acknowledged fault in cases of abuses against flood-displaced persons and has pledged to address the victims' situation. Land seizures, often orchestrated by top ZANU-PF or security service figures, continue targeting white commercial farmers and others not favored by the government. ZANU-PF-linked beneficiaries of land grabs are seeking legal ownership of properties. \"Indigenization,\" the partial nationalization of foreign firms, is another form of state property expropriation. Trafficking in persons is a key human rights challenge, with Zimbabwe classified as a Tier 3 country since 2009 for not fully complying with minimum U.S. TVPA standards. In 2009, Zimbabwe was classified as a Tier 3 country for not fully complying with U.S. TVPA standards. The government has not made significant efforts to improve, leading to restrictions on non-trade related assistance. Despite this, the Obama Administration has issued partial waivers for certain assistance deemed to be in the national interest. A positive development in early 2016 was the outlawing of marriage for anyone under 18 by Zimbabwe's Constitutional Court, seen as a step to reduce child marriage rates. Public corruption remains a persistent issue in the country. Public corruption in Zimbabwe remains a significant issue, with 80% of Zimbabweans rating the government's efforts to fight corruption as poor. Elite appropriation of public resources, highlighted by the \"Salarygate\" scandal in 2013 and 2014, drew public outrage. While some steps have been taken to address the issue, self-enrichment by top ZANU-PF leaders continues to be a problem. Public corruption in Zimbabwe persists, with ZANU-PF officials engaging in self-enrichment using public resources. Illicit financial flows worth millions annually pose an economic challenge, contributing to a shortage of U.S. dollar currency. The government's response to counter these flows remains unclear, despite reports of significant revenue diversion by ZANU-PF and military-linked firms. Since 2013, the ZANU-PF government in Zimbabwe has faced economic challenges, with slow growth and worsening prospects for many citizens. Despite reports of revenue diversion by ZANU-PF and military-linked firms, little action has been taken. GDP growth has declined from 4.5% in 2013 to 1.4% in 2015, with weak economic growth attributed to various factors. Weak economic growth in Zimbabwe has been attributed to a drop in exports, lack of credit for the private sector, low demand due to poverty, poor financial sector performance, and low foreign investment levels. Other factors include problematic economic policy decisions, a severe drought in 2015-2016 affecting the agricultural economy, and low world prices for key minerals. Currency and trade controls have also impacted the economy, leading to shortages of hard currency for foreign transactions. Zimbabwe's weak economic growth is due to shortages of hard currency for foreign transactions, low import demand, and low formal sector domestic production. This has led to a 2.5% deflation rate, high unemployment, and widespread poverty. The reliance on the U.S. dollar as the main local currency since 2009 has also hindered growth. The shortage of hard currency in Zimbabwe, exacerbated by high import demand and a preference for the U.S. dollar, has hindered economic growth. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is implementing measures to address the shortage, such as limiting hard currency withdrawals and distributing export earnings in multiple foreign currencies. Additionally, the bank is prioritizing certain imports to manage demand and supply for goods. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is implementing measures to address the shortage of hard currency, such as limiting withdrawals and prioritizing certain imports. They have also announced controversial plans to issue $200 million worth of local bond notes, sparking fears of hyperinflation and protests. The severe El Ni\u00f1o-related drought in late 2015-2016 has led to a sharp decrease in maize production in Zimbabwe, causing hunger in rural areas and a rising need for food aid. The government is expecting to import 700,000 metric tons of maize in 2016, but has not budgeted for this cost and faces revenue shortfalls. The World Food Program has launched a $220 million food aid appeal for Zimbabwe. In early May 2016, U.S. FY2016 food security contributions for Zimbabwe totaled $34.7 million, with an additional $42.6 million provided in FY2015 and $34.8 million in FY2014. USAID reports that in 2016-2017, the lean season will start earlier in September and end later in April due to El Ni\u00f1o impacts, with an estimated 4 million Zimbabweans expected to be food insecure from January to March 2017. The drought is also projected to affect tobacco production in 2016. The tobacco sector in Zimbabwe saw growth after a production low in 2008, with strong export earnings in 2014 and 2015, particularly to China. However, production and projected exports are now declining. Gold has performed well despite challenges in the mining sector, with steady foreign direct investment. Indigenization laws require foreign-owned businesses to share ownership with Zimbabwean citizens, impacting large firms. The indigenization law in Zimbabwe, despite reforms in early 2015, is seen as politicized and subjective, raising concerns for investors. The government has made periodic amendments to clarify the law and achieve policy goals, but frequent changes have created uncertainty. Mugabe issued a clarification in April 2016, allowing investors to use \"empowerment credits or quotas\" to meet requirements. Despite efforts to address concerns, the perception remains that indigenization is influenced by political whims and unpredictable shifts. Zimbabwe has made efforts to comply with indigenization requirements, including conducting audits of foreign-owned firms. The government has also required Chinese state-owned firms to relinquish mining rights. Strong relations with China have been established to diversify trading partners and attract foreign investment. China has become a key source of investment and credit for Zimbabwe. Chinese state-backed loans from the China Development Bank and Export and Import Bank have funded investments in Zimbabwe, mainly involving large Chinese state-owned corporations and their Zimbabwean counterparts. Transactions include exports of aircraft, buses, rail vehicles, engineering services, and agricultural and construction equipment, as well as purchases of Zimbabwean minerals, tobacco, and cotton. Chinese firms have also invested in mining, infrastructure construction, agriculture, telecommunications, mineral processing, and power generation projects in Zimbabwe, often through joint ventures. Some deals have involved exchanges of services for mineral rights or commodities, drawing criticism from transparency advocates. During a 2015 state visit to Zimbabwe, Chinese President Xi Jinping signed 12 agreements with the country, including a $1.2 billion China Exim loan for adding 600 megawatts of capacity to the national utility's largest thermal power plant. China also cancelled $40 million in loan interest and provided a $65 million grant for a new parliament building and pharmaceutical warehouse. Additionally, China donated $2.3 million worth of vehicles and equipment for wildlife protection. Zimbabwe agreed to increase the use of the Chinese yuan and hold it as a reserve currency. Zimbabwe received a $2.3 million donation of vehicles and equipment for wildlife protection. The country's economy has shown improvement since 2009, but its full potential remains untapped. Challenges include political instability, lack of investment capital, and issues with water supply and electricity systems. State and donor-funded upgrades are in progress, but revenue constraints persist. Zimbabwe's state revenue is constrained by low growth and a large informal business sector with few tax payments. The government spends about 70% of revenues on salaries, leading to challenges in paying external debts and accessing foreign credit. Revenue shortfalls have resulted in late salary payments, posing a major political challenge. The government of Zimbabwe faces challenges with long-term external public debt, high interest rates, and credit scarcity. The World Bank supports the country through the Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund (ZIMREF) to address these issues. Zimbabwe completed an IMF staff-monitored program in 2016, although it is not eligible for IFI loans. Zimbabwe implemented a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) with the IMF to improve the economy and relations with international financial institutions (IFIs) for potential repayment of $1.8 billion in arrears. Finance Minister presented an arrears clearance plan in 2015, facing opposition internally. Congressional requirements like ZDERA could hinder future IFI deals and loans. The United States opposes new IFI loans to Zimbabwe's government without economic and governance reforms. U.S. officials support arrears clearance efforts but must vote against most new IFI credit due to U.S. law. Zimbabwe's plan for arrears clearance was reported to be progressing in May 2016. In late May 2016, reports indicated progress in Zimbabwe's arrears clearance plan, but U.S. Treasury officials expressed concerns over the bond note controversy. The IMF stated no financing program was being discussed with Zimbabwe in July 2016. Future discussions on Zimbabwe's arrears efforts are expected in fall 2016, with a focus on governance and human rights reforms for debt clearance deals. There are doubts about the government's commitment to economic reform and transparency, with potential requirements for policy changes. The Zimbabwean government's pursuit of credit and liquidity is questioned, with little evidence of a shift towards economic priorities over political agendas. Policy confusion persists as different factions within the ruling party vie for influence, hindering progress on economic policy formulation. Land expropriations from white commercial farmers have been a key policy, marked by violence and chaos, reflecting demands for land redistribution and resentment over unequal land distribution. The Fast Track Land Reform Program in Zimbabwe facilitated the expropriation and redistribution of land, leading to the exit of white farmers and a shift in ownership to politically connected individuals. The Fast Track Land Reform Program in Zimbabwe resulted in the expropriation of land from white farmers, causing a decline in farm output and job losses for black farm workers. Despite some positive effects for poor resettled farmers, many redistributed large farms remain idle, and the agricultural sector faces numerous challenges. The government initiated a national land audit in 2015 to address these issues, but faced resistance from politically connected individuals. Security of land tenure for new occupants remains uncertain, hindering their access to credit. The redistribution of land in Zimbabwe has led to uncertainty in land tenure, making it difficult for recipients to access credit. Offer letters require active land use, but the government sometimes revokes them for political reasons. A2 offer letter holders can apply for 99-year leases, but all land is state property and cannot be freely bought or sold. Compensating white farmers whose land was seized remains an unresolved issue with implications for reengagement with international financial institutions. The government in Zimbabwe has established a Lands Compensation Fund to compensate nationals for seized land, funded by state revenues and possible foreign aid. However, funding is inadequate, estimated to cost $11.4 billion, leading to protests from some recipients. Legal disputes over asset valuation have slowed the compensation process. Diamonds in Zimbabwe have been a source of controversy since a 2006 mining rush in Marange. Artisanal miners were removed through a brutal campaign before the area was given to commercial concessionaires. This led to human rights probes and calls for regulation under the Kimberly Process. The diamond trade in Zimbabwe has faced scrutiny for human rights violations, opaque financial flows, and limited oversight. During the GNU, diamond earnings were allegedly funneled to politically connected individuals and firms, including Chinese state-backed companies. Limited tax and royalty payments were made despite exporting hundreds of millions of dollars worth of diamonds. President Mugabe criticized the diamond sector for swindling and smuggling, claiming that only $2 billion of $15 billion in earnings were realized. The government formed the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Corporation (ZCDC) in a partnership with state-owned firms to exert control over the sector. The Zimbabwe government formed the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Corporation (ZCDC) in a partnership with state-owned firms to boost transparency, curb illicit exports, and increase state control over the diamond sector. Some firms have sued to stop the mandatory merger, leading President Mugabe to declare that the state would take control of all diamond operations. Centralization and indigenization within the diamond processing sector are also in progress. In 2014, hunting generated $45 million in conservation income in Zimbabwe, but it is controversial. The killing of a protected black-maned lion named Cecil by a U.S. trophy hunter in 2015 sparked global condemnation and calls to end lion hunting in Africa. The incident led to criminal charges in Zimbabwe and prompted airlines to stop transporting animal trophies. The ivory tusks of Zimbabwe's elephants have also drawn global attention, along with cyanide-based poaching incidents. The spate of poaching-related cyanide poisonings targeting elephants and rhinoceros has drawn global attention. Approximately 400 elephants have been killed in this manner since 2008, with about 70 in 2015 in Hwange and other parks in Zimbabwe. Several hundred rhinos have also been killed in recent years for their valuable horns. Authorities have made arrests in connection to the poisonings, and the government announced plans to deploy the national army to combat poaching activities in game parks. In July 2015, Zimbabwe faced criticism for exporting juvenile elephants to China as part of a cull to reduce an unsustainable elephant population. Critics argue that such captures disrupt herd life and lead to mistreatment of the animals. The government also drew criticism in June 2016 for requesting sale offers from private game reserves to buy wildlife from public reserves in an effort to reduce populations. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a ban on importing sport-hunted elephant trophies from Zimbabwe to support elephant conservation efforts. The ban was extended indefinitely in 2015 pending the establishment of a robust conservation system. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service banned importing sport-hunted elephant trophies from Zimbabwe due to inadequate conservation plans and data. They also listed a subspecies of lion as threatened and created a permitting process for imports. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service banned importing sport-hunted elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and listed a subspecies of lion as threatened. Zimbabwean officials are concerned about the impact on the hunting industry. Critics argue that hunting is often not well-regulated and could lead to increased poaching. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service banned importing sport-hunted elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and listed a subspecies of lion as threatened. Critics argue that hunting is often not well-regulated and could lead to increased poaching. Sanctions have been imposed on individuals in Zimbabwe for undermining democratic institutions and human rights violations since 2000, with U.S. visa restrictions in place. Congress called for these sanctions under ZDERA in 2001, which also imposed restrictions on U.S. representatives on IFI boards to vote against loans benefiting the Zimbabwean government until certain conditions are met. ZDERA imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe for undermining democratic institutions and human rights violations. It prohibited U.S. support for international financial institution loans to the Zimbabwean government until certain conditions are met. Zimbabwe was already ineligible for most multilateral loans due to arrears on past loans. Congress supported conditions for new lending to Zimbabwe's government. \"New lending to Zimbabwe's government, including for clearing IFI arrears, should be preceded by progress towards benchmarks for restoring rule of law, accountability for missing diamond revenues, acknowledgment of human rights abuses, and efforts to remedy them. Zimbabwe's default on U.S. loans triggers restrictions on bilateral aid, with exceptions for certain sectors.\" Zimbabwe is generally ineligible for U.S. aid and trade benefits due to poor rankings in various areas. There is also a ban on the export of defense articles and services to Zimbabwe, with some exceptions. The Treasury Department administers targeted financial sanctions affecting around 200 Zimbabwean individuals and entities. In February 2016, Barclays Bank Plc. paid a $2.49 million settlement to OFAC for prohibited transactions by its Zimbabwean subsidiary. The Treasury Department licensed transactions with two sanctioned entities in advance of the 2013 elections to show intent for normalizing relations. The EU and other governments imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe, gradually easing them starting in 2012. President Robert Mugabe and his wife are currently under sanctions. President Robert Mugabe, his wife, and Zimbabwe's defense industries are still under EU sanctions, including an asset freeze and travel ban. The EU arms embargo also remains in place. Despite some positive steps towards democratic reforms during the GNU, the flawed 2013 elections and ZANU-PF's lack of cooperation with the opposition have hindered progress. U.S officials have hinted at the possibility of easing aid restrictions and sanctions if significant reforms are implemented. The United States supports a robust aid program in Zimbabwe to promote democratic, legal, and economic reforms necessary for the country's transition to a democracy. The Obama Administration plans to continue supporting efforts for transparent governance, political participation, and civil society development. The United States aids Zimbabwe in promoting democratic, legal, and economic reforms for its transition to democracy. The aid program focuses on civil society development, human rights, economic growth, and essential social services. Bilateral aid totaled $172 million in FY2015 and $152 million in FY2016, with a request for $160 million in FY2017. Programs align with the USAID 2013-2015 Transition Country Development Cooperation Strategy, focusing on governance, food security, agriculture, and health goals. The new CDCS has been approved but not yet published. FY2017 governance programs aim to support citizen-government engagement, civil society policy analysis, monitoring, advocacy of constitution implementation, legislative reforms, fiscal management, transparency, debt management, and human rights protection. USAID provides technical assistance to parliamentary committees to enhance lawmaking skills, promote fiscal transparency oversight, and engage with civic constituencies. Ongoing support for electoral reform advocacy and voter engagement is also provided. The new CDCS has been approved but not yet published. FY2017 governance programs aim to support citizen-government engagement, civil society policy analysis, monitoring, advocacy of constitution implementation, legislative reforms, fiscal management, transparency, debt management, and human rights protection. USAID provides technical assistance to parliamentary committees to enhance lawmaking skills, promote fiscal transparency oversight, and engage with civic constituencies. Aid focuses on health programs for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria prevention. Food security, agricultural, and resilience-building activities aim to help smallholder farmers improve agricultural practices, increase productivity, access credit, and develop trade capacity. Nutritional aid and hygiene behavior change are also key focus areas. The United States supports various programs in Zimbabwe, including food security, economic resilience, and landmine removal. Congressional concerns include Zimbabwe's effort to pay its IFI arrears, which could impact U.S. policy options regarding IFI credit assistance. The United States could potentially influence IFI support for Zimbabwe by pushing for strong conditionality, financial reform goals, improved governance, and human rights protections. Some U.S. policymakers may view aid restrictions and sanctions as a way to deprive the ZANU-PF-led government of resources if compliance with U.S. conditions is not met. Some U.S. policymakers may support extending current U.S. policy on Zimbabwe, broadening sanctions against non-compliant individuals, or setting new criteria for U.S. assistance eligibility. However, the success of these measures in changing ZANU-PF behavior has been limited, as evidenced by the unchanged sanctions regime due to lack of improvement in Zimbabwean behavior. Despite ZANU-PF's opposition to sanctions, there have been few significant shifts in their policies or governance practices. It is unclear if U.S. policy has influenced this lack of change, but the stringent conditions for U.S. aid restrictions could be a factor. The relatively restrictive nature of U.S. aid policy and the difficulty of making changes to the sanctions regime may have reduced the ability of U.S. policy implementers to use aid or sanctions changes to incentivize incremental change in policy areas. Some U.S. decision-makers may consider balancing aid restrictions and sanctions with positive incentives for desired actions. The potential effectiveness of using a combination of aid restrictions and positive incentives to encourage desired actions in Zimbabwe is being considered. Implementing an \"action for action\" model could allow for selective relaxation of restrictions or targeted support to specific Zimbabwean agencies that align with U.S. objectives. This approach would require close congressional oversight to ensure accountability and adaptability to changing circumstances. The potential effectiveness of aid restrictions and positive incentives to encourage desired actions in Zimbabwe is being considered by U.S. policymakers. Changes in restrictions governing U.S. aid could enable technical assistance to support Zimbabwean government efforts in implementing economic policy agendas aligned with IMF goals. This may include property rights reforms, strengthening human and civil rights guarantees, and providing leadership training for civil society groups. To enhance U.S.-Zimbabwe relations, Congress could expand leadership training for civil society groups involved in advocacy and monitoring, consider cultural and citizen exchanges like YALI, and engage with opposition actors and pragmatic elements of the Zimbabwean government to address congressional concerns on rule of law and civil freedoms. The United States could engage with Zimbabwean interlocutors and regional governments to promote inclusive political dialogue and reform, particularly for a free and fair electoral process in 2018. There are differing views on engaging with elements of ZANU-PF or the security sector, with some advocating for pragmatic engagement and others preferring to restrict diplomacy and engagement with the government. Some suggest placing additional conditions on aid or strengthening U.S. sanctions as a way to isolate the government. Some observers believe that imposing additional conditions on aid or strengthening U.S. sanctions towards Zimbabwe may not lead to reform-oriented change but rather maintain the status quo. Members of Congress could review U.S. strategy towards Zimbabwe, focusing on fostering a peaceful transition, promoting government accountability, and strengthening democratic processes. The outlook for Zimbabwe is uncertain with political actors focused on the upcoming elections and succession of Mugabe. Economic reform efforts are being made, but there is uncertainty about government support for these reforms. Popular resentment and protest are increasing due to weak economic performance. The succession of Mugabe in Zimbabwe could lead to a transition towards a new governing regime with potential political and economic changes. This could also result in political acrimony, instability, and violence, with implications for U.S. policy towards Zimbabwe. The United States may have limited influence on outcomes in Zimbabwe due to domestic factors and conflicting policy goals among neighboring states like South Africa and Angola. U.S. policy implementers face constraints from static sanctions and aid restriction policies, with some policymakers advocating for potential policy changes to engage with reformers while not rewarding problematic actors within the government."
