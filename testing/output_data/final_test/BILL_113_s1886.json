    "content": "The \"Coverage Protection Act\" allows for timely coverage for individuals unable to enroll in a qualified health plan. The \"Coverage Protection Act\" ensures that individuals enrolling in a qualified health plan through an Exchange before February 1, 2014, are treated as enrolled from December 23, 2013, if they attest to attempting enrollment before January 31, 2014. The individual must be eligible for Medicaid under title XIX of the Social Security Act but was incorrectly deemed ineligible, preventing enrollment in a qualified health plan before December 23, 2013. Premiums must be paid to the health insurance issuer for the qualified health plan, taking into account any premium assistance available under section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Coverage provided under a qualified health plan for January and February of 2014 will count towards premium assistance, cost-sharing reductions, and individual responsibility requirements. SEC. 3. RETROACTIVE COVERAGE AND PREMIUM ASSISTANCE. Section 1311(c) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is amended to allow states the option to provide retroactive coverage under a qualified health plan to individuals enrolling through the State Exchange or Federal Exchange. Coverage can be retroactive to January 1, 2014, with healthcare services provided in January 2014 covered under the plan. The plan allows retroactive coverage for enrollees back to January 1, 2014, with a deadline set by the State no later than January 31, 2014. Eligibility for tax credits and cost-sharing assistance must be verified. The plan offers retroactive coverage to January 1, 2014, with a deadline of January 31, 2014. Tax credits and assistance will be applied retroactively to January 1, 2014, upon enrollment in the qualified health plan. TRANSITIONAL USE OF RECEIPT OF INSURANCE PAYMENT AS ALTERNATIVE TO HEALTH INSURANCE CARD FOR EXCHANGE PLANS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services requires health insurance issuers to allow in-network providers to treat a receipt of premium payment as a health insurance card for coverage purposes in January or February 2014. Providers must be notified of this policy. Health care providers can verify an individual's enrollment in a qualified health plan by contacting the Exchange or the plan issuer."
