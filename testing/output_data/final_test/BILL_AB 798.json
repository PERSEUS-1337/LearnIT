    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The College Textbook Affordability Act of 2015, established to reduce costs for college students, encourages faculty to adopt lower cost, high-quality open educational resources. Faculty development is a key component of this initiative, utilizing resources from the California Open Education Resources Council and the California Digital Open Source Library. The Open Educational Resources Adoption Incentive Program is established to support community college and California State University campuses in faculty and staff professional development for open educational resources. This program is funded by moneys appropriated for this purpose. The Open Educational Resources Adoption Incentive Program supports faculty and staff in developing new open educational resources, adding them to the California Open Online Library for Education. It also includes curriculum modification, release time for faculty, and technology support for those working towards program goals. Moneys appropriated for the program cannot be used for faculty compensation for adopting open educational resources, except for professional development or purchasing new equipment on community college campuses with a local academic senate. Open educational resources are high-quality teaching, learning, and research resources available for free use. To participate in the program, the local academic senate of a California State University or Community College campus must meet certain requirements. The local campus resolution aims to increase student access to open educational resources, reducing textbook costs. A plan, developed with students and administration, will support faculty in effectively using grant funds for open educational resources adoption. This includes technological and staff support and learning about available resources like the California Open Online Library for Education. The plan for open educational resources adoption includes details on academic departments involved, course sections using OER, cost savings for students, faculty development enhancements, and resource distribution to students. Faculty can choose resources for selected lower division courses or use other OER. The plan for open educational resources adoption includes providing access to materials for students, making hard copies available, identifying grant amount requested, and committing to achieving cost savings in course sections. The plan also includes calculating cost savings for each course section. The California Open Education Resources Council may offer expertise on available resources and best practices for adopting open educational resources. Local academic senates can submit a resolution and plan for initial grants by June 30, 2016. The California Open Education Resources Council may award up to 100 initial grants to campuses that meet the requirements. Grants will be given based on the strength of evidence of faculty commitment to adopting open educational resources, with a maximum total amount of two million dollars. The California Open Education Resources Council approves applications and submits them to the Chancellor of the California State University for grant awards. Administrative support may be provided by the California Open Online Library for Education. Campuses can apply for a bonus grant by June 30, 2018, based on cost savings achieved in the 2017-18 academic year. Campuses can compute total cost savings for each course section to include in their application for a bonus grant. The savings are calculated by multiplying the number of students in a section by the decrease in costs of books and supplies due to open educational resources. Bonus grants aim to support the adoption of open educational resources for double the number of course sections with at least 30% cost savings each. The California Open Educational Resources Council awards bonus grants competitively based on percentage savings achieved by initial plans. Grants aim to increase adoption of open educational resources and reduce textbook costs for college students. The California Open Online Library for Education reports annually on the impact of grants on adoption rates and cost savings. Section 67425 of the Education Code will be inoperative after September 1, 2020, and repealed after January 1, 2021, unless a later statute extends these dates. Section 69999.6 is amended to provide authority for administering accounts and making awards to qualified individuals under the Governor's Scholarship Programs. This includes managing and disbursing funds previously allocated for these programs. The board may manage and disburse funds for the Governor's Scholarship Programs. Individuals can claim awards earned before January 1, 2003, by a specified deadline. Negotiations for a new management and funding agreement must be completed before January 1, 2013. Terms include returning unneeded funds to the General Fund by January 1, 2013, authorizing early withdrawal penalties, and extending withdrawal deadlines for scholarship recipients. If funds in the Scholarshare Trust are insufficient after January 1, 2013, the Legislature intends to appropriate additional funds for individual beneficiary accounts. The board must notify the Department of Finance and the Legislature within 10 working days of predicting a funding shortfall. The Chancellor of the California State University is appropriated $5 million for the California Open Education Resources Council and the California Digital Open Source Library. Additionally, $3 million is reappropriated effective January 1, 2016. Moneys appropriated under paragraph (1) must be matched by private funds or revert to the Golden State Scholarshare Trust for Governor\u2019s Scholarship Programs. Unencumbered funds as of June 30, 2015, have specific provisions. The unencumbered amount appropriated under paragraph (1) as of June 30, 2015 has specific provisions: \n- Up to $200,000 for administration of the California Open Online Library for Education, including developing and updating services for open educational resources.\n- Up to $27,000 for stipends to members of the California Open Education Resources Council for their duties in the Open Educational Resources Adoption Incentive Program. Three million dollars ($3,000,000) from the General Fund is reappropriated to the Chancellor of the California State University for the Open Educational Resources Adoption Incentive Program. The board may establish rules and regulations for the implementation of this program."
