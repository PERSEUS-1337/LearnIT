    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Beneficiary Access to Home Care Act of 1998\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings related to the Act. Congress finds that the interim payment system for home health services under Medicare, enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, is causing unintended consequences such as limiting access to necessary services for the sickest Medicare beneficiaries, hindering participation of high-quality agencies due to low per beneficiary limits, and creating unfair competition for agencies with inaccurate per beneficiary limits. Residents in certain States have limited access to home health services under Medicare compared to residents in other States with the same medical conditions. High-quality home health agencies with a good history in the Medicare program are being excluded due to surety bond requirements. SEC. 3. PAYMENTS TO HOME HEALTH AGENCIES UNDER MEDICARE. The text chunk discusses the retroactive restoration of per visit cost limits and the revision of the interim payment system for home health services under Medicare. Amendments are made to the Social Security Act, with effective dates specified. The text chunk discusses the retroactive repeal of per beneficiary limits under the Social Security Act and the establishment of new limits for home health services. Effective dates for the changes are specified. The interim system of limits for home health services under the Social Security Act shall not exceed costs determined under previous provisions or an agency-specific annual per beneficiary limitation. These limitations will be prorated among agencies for beneficiaries receiving services from multiple agencies. The Secretary will establish these limitations before the beginning of each fiscal year. The interim system of limits for home health services under the Social Security Act shall not exceed costs determined under previous provisions or an agency-specific annual per beneficiary limitation. These limitations will be prorated among agencies for beneficiaries receiving services from multiple agencies. The Secretary will establish these limitations before the beginning of each fiscal year. The reporting period involves calculating the reasonable costs per patient for the first 120 days after home health services start, multiplied by the agency's base patient count entitled to benefits. The outlier amount is determined by the reasonable costs of services, including nonroutine medical supplies. The standardized average cost per patient for more than 120 days after home health services start is determined based on an appropriate percentage of a standardized average cost. For fiscal year 1998, the percentages are set at 82% and 110% respectively. The standardized average cost per patient for more than 120 days after home health services start is determined based on a standardized average cost. For fiscal year 1998, the percentages are set at 82% and 110% respectively. The cost includes nonroutine medical supplies and is necessary for efficient delivery of services covered by insurance programs. The cost is determined based on national and regional averages for home health agencies. The patient count for cost reporting includes base patients and outlier patients, with specific calculations for each. An individual cannot be counted twice in the base patient count during the same home health spell of illness. The cost per patient is determined based on standardized averages for home health agencies. The outlier patient count for home health agencies is based on patients who receive services beyond 120 days in a spell of illness. A precertification process is established to ensure timely determinations for continuous coverage. Review of determinations not meeting conditions is allowed under section 1869(b). The amendment applies to cost reporting periods starting on or after October 1, 1998. A transitional rule is in place for counting outlier patients who receive home health services for more than 120 days during a spell of illness. The amendment to the Wage Index based on location of agency applies to cost reporting periods starting on or after October 1, 1998. It includes a transitional rule for counting outlier patients receiving home health services for more than 120 days during a spell of illness. The amendment made to the Wage Index based on agency location applies to cost reporting periods starting on or after October 1, 1998. There are adjustments made to achieve original spending targets for home health services. The amendment ensures that total expenditures for home health services in fiscal years 1999 through 2002 do not exceed the estimated amounts by the Congressional Budget Office before the enactment of the Act. This includes adjustments to the prospective payment system to maintain spending targets. The amendment made to the Social Security Act in 1999 restored periodic interim payments for home health agencies, effective from October 1, 1999. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will extend the home health per episode prospective payment demonstration project until the prospective payment system is established. A final report for the project must be submitted within 6 months of its completion. Additionally, there will be a revision of the surety bond requirement for home health agencies. The surety bond requirement for home health agencies under the Medicare and Medicaid programs is amended to require a bond of $25,000 for 1 year to guard against fraudulent or abusive activities. The surety bond requirement for home health agencies is amended to $25,000 or a comparable bond as permitted by the Secretary. These amendments apply to services provided after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 6 amends the Social Security Act to require home health agencies participating in Medicare to have a fraud and abuse compliance program. The effective date will be specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in regulations."
