    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, interest in deploying ballistic missile defense systems to protect the United States has grown due to events like the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Persian Gulf War, and the proliferation of missile technologies from countries like China, Russia, and North Korea to nations like Iran, Syria, and Pakistan. Concerns have also risen about adversaries like North Korea and Iran developing longer-range missiles that could threaten the U.S. Efforts to counter ballistic missiles have been ongoing since the end of World War II. The United States has spent over $120 billion on missile defense since 1985, deploying a national-level system in 2004. This report provides a brief history of BMD efforts to defend the U.S. against threats from countries like Iran and North Korea. The history of U.S. BMD efforts began with the 1972 ABM Treaty negotiations with the Soviet Union, where the U.S. proposed deployment limits around Moscow and ICBM fields. The Soviets insisted on equal limits for both nations, leading to eventual agreement by the Nixon Administration. The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty allowed each nation to deploy limited ABM systems at two locations, one at the capital and one at an ICBM field. A 1974 Protocol further limited each nation to only one ABM site, with a maximum of 100 launchers and interceptor missiles. The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty restricted the deployment of ABM systems to two locations per nation, with limitations on launchers and interceptor missiles. It also prohibited the development of sea-based, air-based, space-based, or mobile land-based ABM systems and components. Despite the US withdrawal in 2002, the treaty significantly influenced US BMD efforts. In 1967, Defense Secretary McNamara announced the deployment of the Sentinel ABM system, later renamed Safeguard by the Nixon Administration in 1969. It was based on the Nike-X system and focused on defending strategic offensive missile fields against an anticipated Chinese ICBM threat. The Safeguard ABM system was deployed in 1969 to protect missile fields from a potential Chinese ICBM threat. Despite objections from Congress due to costs and technical issues, the program continued. The ABM site near Grand Forks, North Dakota operated briefly from 1975 to 1976 before being shut down for being deemed not cost-effective and having technical problems. The ABM Treaty required dismantling of facilities, but Russia still operates its ABM site near Moscow. US research on ABM systems continued, with increased funding under Carter and Reagan administrations. Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative in 1983 for non-nuclear BMD against Soviet attacks. The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was a research effort proposed by President Reagan to create a global defensive system using various sensors and interceptors. The system aimed to replace deterrence with defense against Soviet attacks but faced cost and technical challenges, leading to scaled-back objectives with a \"Phase I\" deployment of sensors and interceptors. The Reagan Administration proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to enhance deterrence against Soviet attacks by disrupting their effectiveness. Congress supported BMD research but opposed significant deployments. The Administration sought to reinterpret the ABM Treaty to allow testing of space-based defense technologies, facing objections from Congress, including Senator Sam Nunn. During the period following the ABM Treaty, Senator Sam Nunn defended the traditional interpretation of the Treaty, while Congress showed strong support for it. The Reagan Administration engaged in Defense and Space talks with Russia to discuss modifications or a replacement for the Treaty. The first Bush Administration scaled back the goals of SDI to focus on Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) due to cost and technical challenges, acknowledging the reduced likelihood of a large-scale attack after the demise of the Soviet Union. The Bush Administration planned a Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) system with land-based and space-based interceptors to defend against small accidental or unauthorized attacks and attacks from nations with limited ballistic missiles. Negotiations with Russia in 1992 aimed to replace the ABM Treaty, but were suspended by the Clinton Administration in 1993. The Clinton Administration restructured BMD programs to focus on short-range missile threats and technology development, scaling back U.S. objectives for a national missile defense program. Senator Nunn advocated for a limited NMD system compliant with the ABM Treaty to protect against accidental attacks. Secretary of Defense Aspin noted the existing regional ballistic missile threat, raising questions about the need for an NMD system in the near to mid-term. The Missile Defense Act of 1995 declared the policy of the United States to develop affordable and effective theater missile defenses and a national missile defense system. This was in response to the existing regional ballistic missile threat and the need for a layered defense against limited ballistic missile attacks. The Clinton Administration adopted a new NMD strategy in 1996, known as the 3+3 strategy, to develop a national missile defense system against long-range ballistic missile threats. The strategy involved three years of technology development followed by a deployment decision in 2000 if deemed necessary. President Clinton decided not to authorize deployment of an NMD system in September 2000 due to concerns about technology confidence and operational effectiveness. President George W. Bush later increased funding for BMD programs and aimed for long-range BMD deployment as a key national security objective. In 2002, the Bush Administration increased funding for BMD programs, withdrew from the 1972 ABM Treaty, and deployed ground-based interceptors in Alaska to counter the threat of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction from rogue states and terrorists. The decision was supported by the Russian government and received muted criticism from allies in Europe. Testing of the deployed system has shown its capabilities, with over 20 interceptors now deployed in Alaska. The Bush Administration has deployed over 20 interceptors in Alaska and California to defend against ballistic missile threats. Efforts to expand this capability to Europe are on hold pending further testing and agreement with Poland and the Czech Republic. U.S. has been developing defenses against shorter range ballistic missile threats since 1949, leading to the development of the Patriot air defense system. The Patriot air defense system, initially met with resistance, was developed to defend against shorter range ballistic missile threats. Despite controversy over its success in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Congress and the Department of Defense continued to support and upgrade the Patriot system for future conflicts. The Patriot air defense system, developed to defend against shorter range ballistic missile threats, was more successful on the battlefield during the recent war against Iraq. Congress and the Pentagon are supporting the development of other highly effective TMD systems, particularly a maritime capability using existing naval systems. The U.S. has been more successful in developing and deploying effective BMD against short-range missiles compared to long-range or strategic ballistic missiles."
