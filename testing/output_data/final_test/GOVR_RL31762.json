    "content": "The President's National Strategy for Homeland Security proposed the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to protect America's infrastructure. The new Department would evaluate vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure sectors and work with various stakeholders to protect high-risk targets through information sharing. The President's proposal for the Homeland Security Act of 2002 focused on protecting high-risk targets by promoting information sharing between public and private entities regarding threats and vulnerabilities to critical infrastructures. Section 204 of the Act exempted infrastructure vulnerabilities information from the Freedom of Information Act, sparking a debate on balancing public goods and the need for security. The debate over a new FOIA exemption for critical infrastructure information involves concerns about jeopardizing access to government practices and casting secrecy over Homeland Security functions. Proponents argue that private industry may be hesitant to share critical infrastructure details voluntarily. Private industry is hesitant to share critical infrastructure information with the federal government due to concerns about confidentiality, FOIA requests, ambiguity in disclosure decisions, antitrust issues, and civil liability. Industry representatives worry about potential embarrassment and costs associated with information sharing. Private industry is hesitant to share critical infrastructure information with the federal government due to concerns about confidentiality, FOIA requests, ambiguity in disclosure decisions, antitrust issues, and civil liability. H.R. 5005 was modified to include new limitations on the use and disclosure of critical infrastructure information. The Select Committee on Homeland Security expanded upon the President's proposal for an exemption from FOIA for information on infrastructure vulnerabilities. Section 204 of H.R. 5005 expanded protections for critical infrastructure information submitted to DHS, including exemption from FOIA disclosure, limitations on use in civil actions, and restrictions on federal employee disclosure. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides infrastructure information to State or local governments, which is exempt from disclosure under State or local laws. Communications of critical infrastructure information are also exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee added a FOIA exemption to bill S. 2452, protecting records related to the vulnerability of critical infrastructure submitted voluntarily to DHS from FOIA disclosure. The FOIA exemption in bill S. 2452 protects records related to critical infrastructure vulnerability submitted voluntarily to the Department of Homeland Security from disclosure. Agencies sharing protected records are bound by the exemption, and FOIA requests for this information are referred back to DHS. The Senate bill S. 2452 allowed agencies to disclose records under FOIA if received independently, without preempting state or local laws. President Bush signed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, including the Critical Infrastructure Information Act, which addresses DHS's use and disclosure of critical infrastructure information. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) establishes limitations on the disclosure of critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to DHS. It was enacted to promote information sharing between the private and public sectors to protect critical assets. The controversial enactment of the CIIA in 2002 was in response to the need for sharing information on vulnerabilities and threats. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) was not fully considered by Congress when the Homeland Security Act was enacted. The CIIA includes key definitions like covered federal agency, critical infrastructure information, voluntary, and express statement. The most important definition is \"critical infrastructure information\" as the CIIA protections apply only to such information. Critical infrastructures are defined in the Homeland Security Act. Section 1016(e) of the USA PATRIOT Act defines critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets crucial to national security, economic security, public health, or safety. Critical infrastructure information is non-public data related to the security of these systems, including threats or attacks. The definition of critical infrastructure under the USA PATRIOT Act includes any attack or conduct that violates laws, harms interstate commerce, or threatens public health and safety. It also encompasses the ability of critical infrastructure to resist interference, compromise, or incapacitation, as well as any operational problems or solutions related to such incidents. The CIIA defines critical infrastructure and designates the Department of Homeland Security as the covered federal agency. An unsuccessful amendment aimed to broaden this definition to include other agencies sharing critical infrastructure information. Section 214 of the CIIA protects voluntarily submitted critical infrastructure information to DHS with an expectation of non-disclosure. The CIIA defines \"Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations\" as entities gathering, analyzing, and disseminating critical infrastructure information. Voluntary submissions to DHS exclude filings made with other agencies or for securities purposes. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) provides protections for information submitted to Federal banking regulators, for securities sales, or for licensing determinations. To qualify for protection, submissions must include an express statement indicating voluntary submission for protection under the CIIA. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) establishes protections for critical infrastructure information voluntarily shared with the Department of Homeland Security. Section 214 ensures against disclosure of this information when accompanied by an express statement of voluntary submission for protection. Section 214(a)(1) of the Critical Infrastructure Information Act exempts voluntarily submitted critical infrastructure information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. This provision establishes new protections for critical infrastructure data obtained by the Department of Homeland Security. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act exempts voluntarily submitted critical infrastructure information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, providing new protections for this data obtained by the Department of Homeland Security. This section eliminates the presumptive right of access to unpublished DHS records on critical infrastructure information, requiring that such information not be disclosed under FOIA. In 1992, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals established a new test for determining confidentiality of voluntarily submitted information to an agency. The court ruled that such information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA if the submitter does not customarily release it to the public. The Department of Justice issued policy guidance on this distinction, and Executive Order 12,600 provides further guidance on the treatment of confidential business information. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act also protects critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to DHS from disclosure. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act protects private, security-related information voluntarily shared with the government to increase homeland security. It does not cover information required by health, safety, or environmental laws. Covered information is not subject to agency rules or judicial doctrine on ex-parte communications. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) establishes rules for agencies regarding ex parte communications in agency proceedings. An \"ex parte communication\" is defined as a communication not on the public record without prior notice to all parties. The principle of deciding agency adjudications solely on record evidence is emphasized in Section 556(e) of the APA. The \"exclusiveness of record\" principle aims to ensure fairness and meaningful participation by parties. Challenges to this principle arise from ex parte contacts. Ex parte contacts are communications outside the hearing and off the record, prohibited in agency adjudications by the APA. Interested parties are restricted from making ex parte communications relevant to the proceeding to decision-making officials. This rule applies to agency decision makers as well. The APA prohibits ex parte contacts in agency adjudications, requiring any improper contact to be placed on the public record. Violations may result in dismissal or adverse effects on a party's claim. The CIIA exempts critical infrastructure information from these prohibitions and creates evidentiary exclusions for protected information. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) exempts critical infrastructure information from ex parte contact prohibitions in agency adjudications, allowing for the protection of information submitted in good faith to federal agencies like DHS. This protection does not apply to regulatory or enforcement actions, and courts may limit the exclusion in cases of bad faith. Public interest groups are concerned about the broad scope of this provision. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) shields owners and operators from liability under various laws. Federal entities can access critical infrastructure information for protection programs. The Act allows independent parties to obtain and use this information for limited purposes. U.S. officers can only disclose such information for authorized purposes like criminal investigations. The President's signing statement on the Homeland Security Act of 2002 addresses the provision allowing disclosure of personal information for investigations or prosecution. It clarifies that the executive branch is not required to share information with Congress or the General Accounting Office, citing constitutional authorities to withhold information that could impact foreign relations, national security, or the Executive's duties. This provision mirrors language from the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974 and FOIA allow disclosure of personal information to Congress and the General Accounting Office. Various federal statutes permit disclosure for criminal investigations. Laws protecting different types of information have exceptions for law enforcement access through warrants, subpoenas, and court orders. Section 214(a)(1)(E) of the CIIA exempts critical infrastructure information from FOIA. The CIIA exempts critical infrastructure information from FOIA, preempts state freedom of information laws, and prohibits disclosure without written consent. It also safeguards trade secret protection under federal law. The CIIA safeguards trade secret protection under federal law, defining a trade secret as any formula, pattern, device, or compilation of information used in business to gain a competitive advantage. Additionally, the Act exempts critical infrastructure information from FOIA and preempts state freedom of information laws. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) defines advisory committees and specifies categories of information that can be used to close committee deliberations. Prior to the critical infrastructure information provisions, meetings of Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAO) had potential implications. The CIIA authorizes ISAOs to voluntarily submit information to DHS for protection under the Act, defining ISAOs as entities gathering, analyzing, and disseminating critical infrastructure information. The Homeland Security Act requires the Secretary of DHS to establish procedures for critical infrastructure information within 90 days of enactment, consulting with the National Security Council and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. These procedures are not subject to agency rulemaking requirements under the APA. The CIIA requires agency procedures, not regulations, under the Homeland Security Act. Judicial review of agencies' interpretations of statutes involves deference, as outlined in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v NRDC. The Court established two inquiries for reviewing agency constructions of statutes. The Chevron doctrine creates a presumption that Congress has delegated to agencies the task of filling in gaps in regulatory schemes in a reasonable way. Section 214(f) of the CIIA makes it a criminal offense for federal employees to disclose critical infrastructure information without proper authorization. The CIIA imposes criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure of critical infrastructure information by federal employees, similar to the Privacy Act and Trade Secrets Act. There may be concerns about potential conflicts with protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act. The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) protects covered employees who disclose information showing violations of laws or regulations, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health or safety. Disclosures can be made to the Special Counsel, Inspector General, or designated agency employee. The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) safeguards federal employees who report violations of laws, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health or safety. It allows disclosures to the Inspector General or Special Counsel. Violating the Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) by disclosing protected information without authorization can result in fines, imprisonment, and removal from office. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) imposes criminal sanctions on federal employees who disclose protected information without authorization. The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) protects employees who report violations of laws or mismanagement, allowing disclosures to the Inspector General or Special Counsel. The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) safeguards employees who report misconduct or violations, protecting them from retaliation. Section 883 of the Homeland Security Act also ensures whistleblower protections for Department of Homeland Security employees. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the criminal penalties under the Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) for unauthorized disclosure by federal employees. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) prohibits unauthorized disclosure of protected information by US government employees, with penalties including fines, imprisonment, and removal from employment. Concerns have been raised about whether Members of Congress and their staff could be held criminally liable for releasing such information. The CIIA aims to promote voluntary information sharing on threats and vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure while protecting against unauthorized disclosures. There is debate on whether Congress is subject to criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure, with arguments that disclosure to Congress may not constitute a violation and that penalties like \"removal from employment\" suggest Congress may be exempt. The penalty provision in question includes \"removal from employment,\" which raises doubts about its applicability to Congress due to the constitutional process required for their removal. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that certain statutes, like 18 U.S.C. 1001, do not automatically apply to Congress without explicit inclusion. Therefore, it is unlikely that the term \"officer or employee of the United States\" would be interpreted to include Congress without further clarification. The Speech or Debate clause of the U.S. Constitution provides immunity for Members of Congress for their legislative acts, protecting them from criminal prosecution for what they say on the floor or during committee proceedings. Even with legal immunity, Senators and Representatives are still accountable to their respective House of Congress and the electorate. The clause covers activities such as speaking on the House or Senate floor, introducing bills, voting on resolutions, and participating in committee meetings and hearings. The Speech or Debate Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides immunity for Members of Congress for their legislative acts, protecting them from criminal prosecution for what they say on the floor or during committee proceedings. This privilege covers activities such as speaking on the House or Senate floor, introducing bills, voting on resolutions, and participating in committee meetings and hearings. Additionally, the clause extends to aides of Members as long as their conduct would be considered a protected legislative act if performed by the Member themselves. The CIIA authorizes the federal government to issue advisories, alerts, and warnings to relevant companies and sectors about potential threats to critical infrastructure. It also protects the source of critical infrastructure information and states that there is no private right of action for enforcement of the Act."
