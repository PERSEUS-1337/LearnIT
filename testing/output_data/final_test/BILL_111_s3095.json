On the specified date, if OMB estimates sequestration is needed, the President must issue an order implementing all required sequestrations. Sequestered budgetary resources are permanently cancelled, with exceptions. Sequestration percentages apply uniformly to all programs, projects, and activities within a budget account. Regulations for sequestration must be implemented within 120 days. Sequestration results in lower total appropriation, with remaining funds allocated according to program formulas. Sequestration percentages apply uniformly to all programs, projects, and activities within a budget account.

Budgetary resources sequestered in special fund accounts are not available for obligation in the year of sequestration but can be used in subsequent years as allowed by law. Reports required by this section must be submitted to specific entities on the day of submission. The report must be submitted to the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the President on the day it is issued, with a notice printed in the Federal Register the following day. Subtitle B--Non-security Discretionary Spending Limits: SEC. 221. DISCRETIONARY SEQUESTRATION REPORTS. Discretionary Sequestration Preview Reports require OMB and CBO to report estimates of discretionary spending limits and budget authority exceeding limits. OMB reports must explain differences with CBO estimates. Discretionary Sequestration Reports are issued by OMB and CBO, including Preview Reports and Final Reports with updated information on discretionary spending limits. The OMB report includes information on new budget authority, breach, sequestration percentages, enacted budget authority, estimated outlays, and explanations for differences in estimates between OMB and CBO. The OMB report must include information on new budget authority, breach, sequestration percentages, enacted budget authority, estimated outlays, and explanations for differences in estimates between OMB and CBO. Additionally, resources for any budget account can be reduced if the difference exceeds $5,000,000, using the same economic and technical assumptions as the most recent budget submitted by the President. SEC. 222. LIMITS. SEC. 222. LIMITS. (a) Discretionary Spending Limits.--The term \"non-security discretionary spending limit\" is defined as in section 316 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. (b) Enforcement.--Sequestration will occur to eliminate a budget-year breach, reducing each non-security discretionary account by a calculated dollar amount to meet the spending limit. The text discusses the process of sequestration in the event of a breach in discretionary spending limits. If appropriations cause a breach, the discretionary spending limit for the next fiscal year will be reduced by the amount of the breach. If an appropriation causes a breach in discretionary spending limits, reports must be issued by CBO and OMB within 10 and 15 days, respectively. The President must then issue an order implementing all required sequestrations without change, effective immediately. When Congress completes action on legislation with discretionary appropriations, CBO provides an estimate to OMB. OMB must then transmit a report to Congress within 7 days, including CBO and OMB estimates with explanations for any differences found. If there are discrepancies, OMB consults with CBO. OMB consults with the House and Senate Committees on the Budget regarding differences between OMB and CBO estimates, including written communication for committee feedback before report issuance. Estimates must adhere to scorekeeping guidelines determined after consultation among relevant committees, CBO, and OMB."
