    "content": "Mexico's prominence in the U.S. migration system has significant implications for U.S. immigration policy. The largest group of U.S. migrants are Mexicans, with about 1 in 10 Mexicans living in the United States. This bilateral migration flow between Mexico and the U.S. is the largest in the world, shaping current immigration debates and policies. The report discusses Mexico's role in the U.S. immigration system and its impact on immigration policies. It covers Mexico-U.S. migration flows, history of migration policies, demographics of Mexico-born persons in the U.S., and major issues in the immigration debate. Topics include migration control, border security, LPR visa system, temporary worker programs, and potential legalization programs for unauthorized aliens. The report examines the impact of proposed reforms on Mexicans and questions Mexico's influence on U.S. immigration policy. It also looks at efforts to reduce emigration pressures within Mexico. Migration to the U.S. includes LPRs, temporary nonimmigrants, and unauthorized aliens, with Mexicans being the largest group. Lawful permanent residents can apply for U.S. citizenship after five years. The INA sets limits and preference categories for permanent residency. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) establishes numerical limits and preference categories for permanent immigration, prioritizing family-based immigration. Mexicans are more likely to benefit from the family-friendly rules, with a high percentage admitted under family categories. In FY2010, 122,686 Mexicans became Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) as immediate relatives or family-sponsored immigrants. Mexicans are family-based compared to 65% of all LPRs. Nonimmigrants are foreign nationals admitted to the US for a temporary period with specific reasons. There are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories, including B-2 tourists, E-2 treaty investors, and F-1 foreign students. Visa categories for employment include H-2A for agricultural workers, H-2B for lower-skilled workers, H-1B for professional workers, J-1 cultural exchange, E visa for traders and investors, and L visa for intra-company transferees. Temporary professional workers from Canada and Mexico can enter under NAFTA on TN visas. In FY2010, Mexico was the top sending country of temporary nonimmigrants, with a large majority entering as H-2A or H-2B low-skilled workers. Mexicans accounted for 82.9% of H-2A and H-2B visas issued in 2010. About 11.4 million unauthorized aliens were estimated to be in the US in 2010, with many entering without inspection or using fraudulent documents. In 2010, about 11.4 million unauthorized aliens were estimated to be in the US, with many entering illegally or overstaying their visas. The majority of unauthorized Mexicans made up 59% of this population. Efforts for comprehensive immigration reform have been ongoing, but no legislation has been passed in the last decade. The last decade has seen a focus on new enforcement measures at the U.S.-Mexican border and within the United States, resulting in a record number of unauthorized aliens being removed each year since 2003. Mexicans make up almost three-quarters of all removals. The regional migration system has evolved through four phases, from limited seasonal flows before World War II to increased family-based immigration since the 1990s. Large-scale permanent immigration from Mexico to the United States is a recent phenomenon, with Mexican LPR immigrants exceeding 1 million in the 1980s. Mexicans accounted for more than 15% of total LPR inflows in the 1990s. The total Mexican-born population living in the United States has increased significantly since the 1970s. The Mexico-born population in the United States saw a significant increase starting in the 1970s, with legal immigration and total population doubling each decade. By 2009, there were 11.5 million Mexico-born individuals in the US. Mexican migrants today are evenly split by gender, mostly live permanently in the US, work in non-agricultural jobs, and are spread throughout the country. This shift from low immigration levels to rapid growth since 1970 is attributed to various factors. The rapid growth of Mexican migration since 1970 is primarily driven by structural demographic, economic, and social forces. Push factors like high birth rates and limited economic opportunities in Mexico, along with pull factors like employment opportunities and family connections in the US, have influenced migration patterns. Migration outcomes also depend on policies in both countries that either encourage or discourage international migration. In the early 20th century, push and pull factors for Mexico-US migration were limited due to underdeveloped transportation and social networks. During the early 20th century, Mexican migration to the United States was influenced by limited push-pull factors. The Mexican Revolution led to additional migration, but also created opportunities within Mexico. The Great Depression caused a decline in U.S. demand for migrant workers, leading to the creation of the first U.S. guest worker program for Mexicans. Migration policy shifted in 1929 with tighter screening criteria. In 1929, tighter screening criteria for Mexican visa applicants led to a 75% reduction in LPR admissions. Many Mexicans and their U.S.-born children returned to Mexico during the Great Depression, with some being deported. Mexico discouraged emigration with laws and campaigns, resulting in net migration flowing north to south in the 1930s. Agricultural employers in the U.S. struggled to recruit Mexican workers during World War II due to limited inflows and Mexican officials opposing new emigration. During World War II, U.S. officials initiated negotiations with Mexico for the Bracero program, a bilateral guest worker program to address labor shortages. Mexican workers were guaranteed a minimum wage, health benefits, and housing. The program was suspended in 1948 but resumed in 1951 due to fears of labor shortages during the Korean War. After the war, the U.S. demanded changes that weakened the program's labor protections. The Bracero program had a lasting impact on Mexico-U.S. migration, with strong support from both governments. By the mid-1960s, it transitioned to longer-term resettlement and greater diversity in labor markets. The program issued 4.6 million visas by 1964, fostering a new generation of Mexican workers and U.S. employers. The end of the Bracero program in the mid-1960s led to increased migration pulls and pushes for Mexican workers entering the United States. Factors such as low wages, expanded low-skilled job opportunities, high fertility rates, and agricultural dislocation in Mexico contributed to this trend. Despite eligibility for H-2 temporary worker visas, the Department of Labor rejected many petitions, limiting legal pathways for Mexican workers. The 1965 amendments to the INA further impacted migration patterns. The 1965 amendments to the INA imposed numeric limits on Western Hemisphere immigration, affecting migrants from Mexico. This led to an increase in illegal migration from Mexico, with the number of unauthorized aliens apprehended growing three-fold between 1965 and 1970. The backlog of Mexican visa applicants reached roughly 300,000 by 1976, resulting in a two-and-a-half year wait for visas. By 1979, an estimated 1.7 million unauthorized aliens resided in the United States, including 1.4 million from Mexico. Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) after examining the issue for 15 years, legalizing about 2.6 million people, including 2.1 million Mexican migrants. Mexican migrants continued to be a significant presence in the U.S. labor market, driven by factors such as globalization and economic disparities. Migration became a core feature of the regional labor market, with U.S. employers and Mexican workers structurally dependent on it. Congress responded to these trends by passing legislation to address the issue. After the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), Congress passed additional laws focusing on illegal migration, investing in border security, restricting access to welfare, and streamlining removal procedures. Spending on migration control increased significantly, reaching $17.4 billion in FY2012. Immigration reforms aimed to reduce low-skilled employment-based inflows, with laws like the Immigration Act of 1990 and the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act decreasing low-skilled LPR visas. The 1990 Immigration Act reduced low-skilled LPR visas from 29,000 to 5,000 per year and increased family-sponsored immigration limits to at least 226,000 immigrants annually, benefiting Mexicans the most. Mexico was the only country approaching the 7% limit for second preference immigrants, with a special allotment of 55,000 visas for spouses and children of LPRs who legalized through IRCA. Mexicans made up a significant portion of second preference spouses and children admitted during FY2000-FY2009. Mexico lacked a cohesive migration policy post-Bracero period, but increasing migrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border led to some concern in the late 1990s. In the 1990s, increasing migrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border and human rights abuses of Central Americans in Mexico prompted the Mexican government to reform its migration policy. The Administration of Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n and the Mexican Congress made significant changes to Mexico's immigration law in 2008, decriminalizing simple migration offenses and replacing imprisonment with fines and deportation for unauthorized migrants. Mexico's migration policy reforms in 2008 under President Felipe Calder\u00f3n replaced imprisonment with fines and deportation for unauthorized migrants. In 2010, Mexico increased penalties for alien smuggling, focusing on abuses by public officials. Recent efforts include a new version of the GPA law to protect migrants' rights, simplify immigration laws, and promote family reunification. Mexico's migration policy reforms in 2008 under President Felipe Calder\u00f3n aimed to establish family reunification and humanitarian protection as key elements of immigration policy. The law concentrates immigration enforcement authority within the federal Interior Ministry to improve migration management and reduce abuses of migrants. It guarantees access to education, justice, and healthcare services for all migrants, limits detention of unauthorized migrants to 15 working days, and gives legal status to special government \"Beta Groups\" assisting migrants in distress. Special procedures are established for the treatment of children and vulnerable groups. Despite U.S. enforcement efforts, Mexico-U.S. migration increased steadily in the 25 years after the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986. The Mexico-born population grew from 2.8 million in 1979 to 11.5 million in 2009, with unauthorized migrants contributing to 60% of the increase. However, Mexican migration has declined since 2006, with evidence showing more Mexicans leaving the U.S. than arriving. Factors include the U.S. recession, increased border security, and job opportunities in Mexico. Some unauthorized migrants are staying longer in the U.S. due to high border crossing costs. The decline in Mexican emigration rates to the United States is influenced by short-term factors and long-term demographic trends, such as a decrease in Mexico's fertility rate. While total emigration flows have decreased, there is an increase in emigration by middle and upper class Mexicans, particularly from northern Mexico, due to drug trafficking-related violence. A study estimated that 230,000 Mexicans were displaced by violence in December 2010, with about half moving to the United States. Some Mexicans displaced by violence have sought asylum in the United States, with ambiguous results in data reflecting increased flows. While U.S. asylum and visa data do not show a rise in Mexican inflows between FY2005 and FY2010, there is evidence of a growing number of \"credible fear\" claims and higher approval rates, mainly in FY2010. Additionally, some middle and upper class Mexicans may be entering through legal channels not captured in the data. A severe drought since May 2011 could also contribute to an uptick in Mexico-U.S. migration. A severe drought in Mexico since May 2011 has affected more than half of the country, leading to 200,000 people fleeing their homes. Mexico has allocated $2.5 billion for drought relief, but it is uncertain if this aid will prevent further displacement and potential international migration. The Mexico-born population in the United States made up 29% of the total foreign-born population in 2010, contributing to about 32% of total U.S. population growth since 2000. The Mexico-born population in the United States accounted for roughly 32% of total U.S. population growth since 2000. They are disproportionately likely to be in the labor force, with 25.5 million foreign-born workers representing 16.3% of the civilian labor force in 2010. Mexican migration to the United States has attracted attention due to its scale and the unique socioeconomic profile of the Mexico-born population. Mexicans in the United States have lower education levels, work in lower-skilled occupations, and have lower economic well-being. The majority of Mexican-born individuals are unauthorized aliens, comprising 58% of the total unauthorized alien population in the US in 2010. Mexicans in the United States in 2010 comprised 58% of unauthorized aliens. They have a unique age distribution, with a higher proportion in the prime working-age cohort compared to other foreign-born and U.S. born individuals. This demographic trend is influenced by high fertility among first-generation immigrants and the youth of second-generation immigrants. Mexican immigrants in the United States have lower levels of education compared to other migrants and the native-born population. 60% of Mexican immigrants lack a high school diploma, while only 6% have a four-year college degree. Higher education levels are linked to better labor market participation and higher incomes. Mexican immigrants in the United States have lower education levels compared to other migrants and native-born individuals. English proficiency, legal status, age, educational attainment, and occupational attainment all play a role in economic outcomes for Mexicans in the labor force. Mexican immigrants in the United States have lower education levels compared to other migrants and native-born individuals. They are concentrated in low-skilled industries such as construction, cleaning, food preparation, and agriculture. Mexican-born individuals have lower median incomes, higher poverty rates, less health insurance coverage, and fewer homeowners compared to other foreign-born and native-born individuals. They are also more likely to lack legal status. Mexican immigrants in the United States have a unique demographic profile compared to other foreign-born individuals. They are more likely to lack legal status, be of prime working age, lack a high school diploma, and have lower English proficiency. This profile explains why they are concentrated in lower-skilled, lower-paid occupations and have lower economic well-being indicators. Mexican migration has also expanded to new U.S. regions beyond traditional settlement areas, attracting attention to the size and character of immigration flows. States in the Southwest have the highest proportion of Mexican-born residents, while states in the South and Midwest have seen the greatest increases in their Mexico-born populations. Immigration policies have been a long-standing concern for Congress, with various measures considered to address border security, visa systems, and legalization of unauthorized aliens. The U.S.-Mexico perspective on immigration raises questions about the impact of policies on Mexicans. The U.S.-Mexico perspective on immigration raises questions about Mexico's role in shaping migration flows, steps to reduce unauthorized migration, and common interests in a secure border for safe and orderly migration and commerce. Both countries benefit economically from demographic complementarities and migrant remittances. Mexico's post-1960 baby boom has helped sustain U.S. population growth, leading to bilateral approaches to migration such as the Bracero program and a framework agreement between President George W. Bush and Mexican President Vicente Fox for migration reform. This included a new guest worker program, legalization for unauthorized Mexican migrants, enhanced border enforcement, and increased U.S. investment in Mexican communities to reduce emigration. The U.S.-Mexico migration talks were prominent post-9/11, with concerns about low-skilled immigration and illegal migration. Mexico respects U.S. immigration laws but also advocates for the rights of its nationals abroad, leading to occasional disagreements over policy enforcement and border security. The U.S. border enforcement strategy focuses on prevention through deterrence, using enhanced personnel, fencing, and surveillance technology along heavily trafficked border areas. This approach aims to discourage illegal entry at traditional crossing points and directs crossers to ports of entry or remote areas for inspection and apprehension by border patrol agents. The U.S. border enforcement strategy includes increased personnel, fencing, and surveillance technology at the Southwest border. Border patrol agents have been augmented, fencing installed along 651 miles, and over $1 billion spent on a border surveillance system. National Guard troops were deployed, unmanned aircraft systems operate, and a consequence delivery system was implemented since 2005. The U.S. border enforcement strategy includes increased personnel, fencing, and surveillance technology at the Southwest border. Border patrol agents have been augmented, fencing installed along 651 miles, and over $1 billion spent on a border surveillance system. National Guard troops were deployed, unmanned aircraft systems operate, and a consequence delivery system was implemented since 2005. While most aliens apprehended at the U.S.-Mexican border were previously returned to Mexico with minimal processing, now more are facing formal removal, immigration-related criminal charges, or repatriation at remote locations. The goal is to increase the costs and difficulty for aliens reconnecting with smugglers in Mexico after failed entry attempts. Interior immigration enforcement is also conducted by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) to identify, detain, and remove unauthorized migrants within the United States. The Obama Administration has filed suit to block state immigration enforcement laws, with Mexico supporting some cases. Mexicans make up the majority of deportable aliens apprehended since 1991, accounting for 83% in FY2010 and 93% overall. They also represent 73% of aliens formally removed in FY2012 and 72% overall. The U.S. has invested resources in border personnel, fencing, and surveillance technology. The United States has invested resources in border enforcement tools over the last two decades, leading to a decrease in unauthorized migrant apprehensions and below-average crime rates in border cities. The Obama Administration considers the border more secure than ever and has proposed no major increases in border spending. However, concerns remain about border security, especially due to drug trafficking-related violence on the Mexican side. The recent drop in unauthorized migrant apprehensions at the border may be due to changing factors like the U.S. economic downturn and Mexico's economic growth. Some Members of Congress are calling for increased border investments, including more fencing and personnel. Border enforcement methods, such as prevention through deterrence, have raised concerns in Mexico due to the rising death toll among unauthorized border crossers. The rising death toll among unauthorized border crossers is linked to the negative symbolism of a \"border wall\" and the impact of fencing and surveillance infrastructure on the border ecosystem. Enhanced enforcement may have led to higher fees charged by Mexican smugglers and stronger connections between human trafficking and other types of smuggling. The complex relationship between migration, crime, and violence remains unclear, with unknown effects of migration enforcement on these factors. Some believe Mexico should take more responsibility for illegal flows and play a greater role in migration control, currently supporting U.S. migration enforcement through the National Migration Institute. The estimated number of illegal Central American transmigrants crossing Mexico to the United States increased from 236,000 in 2000 to 433,000 in 2005, then dropped to 140,000 in 2010. Mexican and U.S. law enforcement agencies collaborate to combat alien smuggling and human trafficking, with regular information sharing and coordination efforts. U.S. and Mexican law enforcement agencies collaborate through various programs to combat drug and human smuggling, including the ICE Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) program and the Operation Against Smuggling Initiative on Safety and Security (OASISS). Mexico reformed its federal criminal procedure code in late 2007 to criminalize trafficking, leading to intensified investigations and prosecutions against human trafficking. Mexico reformed its federal criminal procedure code in late 2007 to criminalize human trafficking. Since then, all states in Mexico have enacted reforms to address human trafficking, leading to the country being ranked as a \"Tier 2\" country in the State Department's Trafficking in Persons reports. President Calder\u00f3n proposed constitutional reforms in 2011 to strengthen measures against trafficking, including holding accused individuals in prison during trials and protecting the anonymity of victims. Despite passing a new law with harsher penalties for sexual exploitation, funding cuts for anti-trafficking efforts in the 2012 budget may weaken Mexico's progress in combating human trafficking. Efforts to strengthen Mexico's ability to prosecute human trafficking cases may be hindered by funding cuts in the 2012 budget. U.S. financial support plays a significant role in Mexican law enforcement activities related to illegal migration and transnational crime. Congress could consider increasing investments in programs to enhance Mexico's role in migration enforcement. However, concerns about corruption in Mexico and reluctance from some Members of Congress to invest more resources in anti-trafficking programs may pose challenges. U.S. law enforcement agencies may prefer to conduct their own investigations due to ongoing corruption concerns in Mexico. Hundreds of thousands of aliens are repatriated to Mexico each year. ICE and CBP administer repatriations to Mexico under a 2009 agreement with the Mexican Foreign Ministry. Special treatment is given to four groups of Mexicans during the repatriation process. Four groups of Mexicans receive special treatment during the repatriation process, including unaccompanied minors repatriated during daylight hours and the Mexican Interior Repatriation Program (MIRP) established in 2003. The MIRP allows certain unauthorized aliens in Arizona to fly to Mexico City and take a bus to their communities of origin to prevent migrant deaths in the desert and reduce recidivism. Over 125,000 individuals participated in the program between 2004 and 2011, with the United States covering most expenses. Plans were announced in 2012 to expand the program. The Alien Transfer Exit Program (ATEP) is part of CBP's Consequence Delivery System, aiming to disrupt migrant smuggling networks by relocating certain Mexicans apprehended in Arizona to POEs in Texas or California. However, the program is controversial in Mexico as repatriated individuals may be stranded in border communities without resources. ICE also responds to requests from Mexico to remove serious criminal aliens apprehended near El Paso, TX, to locations other than Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to avoid escalating violence levels. ICE responds to Mexico's requests to remove serious criminal aliens apprehended near El Paso, TX, to locations other than Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to avoid escalating violence levels. However, finding alternative locations has become challenging due to deteriorating security conditions in other border cities. DHS shares criminal histories with Mexico for Mexicans convicted of serious felonies in the US under a 2010 agreement, and a pilot program at the Calexico POE provides the Mexican Federal Police with information about serious criminal aliens prior to their removal. The success of these programs in reducing recidivism among illegal migrants is unknown. The success of programs like MIRP and ATEP in reducing recidivism among illegal migrants is uncertain. Congress could consider funding these programs further, but there are concerns about privacy and cost. President Felipe Calder\u00f3n initiated a program called PRH to assist deportees in Mexico. The PRH program in Mexico assists migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border, providing various services like information on deportations, food, medical attention, and shelter. Special focus is given to vulnerable groups like unaccompanied minors. Additional services such as job training and employment referrals are now available in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez through a partnership with the International Organization for Migration. The U.S. supports programs for successful reintegration of returning migrants, funded by countries like the United States. The US-VISIT system records entry and exit of aliens, but many are exempt, including most Mexicans with border crossing cards. CBP collects biographic data. Some Members of Congress have urged DHS to implement a full entry-exit tracking system, but limited infrastructure and staffing are primary obstacles. Mexicans with multiple-use BCCs are exempt from US-VISIT system to avoid longer wait times. Challenges exist for exit tracking due to existing POEs not designed for exit processing. CBP would need to reconfigure ports to collect exit data. The United States and Canada propose an integrated entry-exit system to address exit infrastructure issues on the northern border, which could serve as a model for the U.S.-Mexican border. Pilot projects are expected to begin in 2012 to test this system. An integrated entry-exit system may offer a solution to tracking land entry and exit. An integrated entry-exit system could address tracking land exits, but Mexico's screening of land entries is not at 100%. Establishing this system in Mexico may require additional inspection lanes. Concerns exist about the reliability of Mexican border officials and identification technology. The U.S. immigration policy faces tensions regarding family reunification versus employment-based flows. From 2000 to 2009, 93% of Mexican immigrants to the United States were admitted based on family connections. There is a backlog of approved visa applications, with 1.4 million Mexican applicants waiting for visas. The majority of approved petitions are for family-based LPRs. The majority of approved petitions for family-based LPRs are for Mexican immigrants, accounting for over 40% of spouses and children of LPRs. Legislative proposals have been introduced to reallocate family-based visas into employment-based categories or eliminate certain preference categories. Reclassifying certain second preference family-based immigrants as immediate relatives could ease family backlogs but may lead to a higher proportion of LPR visas going to family members. Proposals to eliminate per-country ceilings on LPR admissions could benefit Mexicans, who make up a significant portion of the family-based visa queue. Shifts from family- to employment-based visa categories could reduce visas available to Mexicans. The proposal to reclassify family members of LPRs as immediate relatives could benefit Mexicans in the family-based visa queue. Increasing the per-country ceiling on family-based immigration may lead to more Mexican inflows and potentially reduce unauthorized migration. Providing more Mexican LPR visas could address long waiting lists and divide families. There is historical precedent for providing Mexicans with special treatment under U.S. immigration law, including exemptions from certain grounds for inadmissibility and privileged status under various programs. Generating more LPR visas for Mexico would require an increase in total immigration levels or a reduction in visas for other countries. Raising the LPR visa ceiling for Mexico may face opposition due to the norm of universality in immigration reforms. Some may also oppose increasing low-skilled immigrants, common among Mexican immigrants. Mexicans received a high percentage of temporary work visas in recent years. The number of Mexicans receiving temporary work visas increased significantly between 1997 and 2010, with a focus on low-skilled categories. Congress has considered proposals to facilitate high-skilled worker admission to the US, including opportunities for additional temporary migration from Mexico. As more Mexicans obtain higher education degrees, they may qualify for professional visas, making Mexico a potential source of high-skilled labor for the US, particularly in STEM fields. The 2011 survey showed that 69% of Mexican students planned to pursue STEM education, the highest globally. However, Mexico is not among the top 10 countries sending graduate students to the US for STEM degrees. Increasing Mexican STEM graduates in the US could lead to more job opportunities with TN or H-1B visas, benefiting both economies. Emigration of skilled Mexicans may hinder Mexico's development if many stay in the US. Some suggest a temporary worker program as an alternative to permanent migration. A potential solution to address the emigration of skilled Mexicans to the US is to consider a bilateral temporary worker program, possibly setting aside visas for Mexican workers. This idea has historical and present-day precedents, such as the Bracero program and the TN visa. Such a program could target sectors where legal workers are difficult to recruit, especially those where Mexicans are concentrated. A potential solution to address the emigration of skilled Mexicans to the US is through a bilateral temporary worker program targeting sectors where legal workers are difficult to recruit, particularly those with high concentrations of Mexicans. This model could mirror the historical \"circular migration\" system, allowing Mexicans to gain job skills and money before returning to Mexico, rather than settling in the US. Other countries have successfully implemented similar guest worker programs, with government-to-government agreements like Canada's temporary agricultural visa for Mexican workers seen as a best-practice model. Mexico could be involved in various aspects of a bilateral temporary worker program, including managing workers' health care expenses and retirement savings. However, concerns remain about how visas for low-skilled or unskilled workers could impact domestic wages and working conditions. Enforcing worker protections without discouraging employer participation is a key challenge, as more low-skilled visas may lead to increased overall migration rather than shifting workers from unauthorized to legal channels. Increased migration overall, rather than shifting workers from unauthorized to legal channels, has been a concern. Various proposals have been made to enable unauthorized resident aliens to qualify for LPR status, with Mexicans being a significant beneficiary. The experience of IRCA has influenced these debates, with some viewing it as a partial success while others oppose legalization. IRCA ultimately failed to stop the flow of illegal migration. Mexico's involvement in discussions about a possible legalization program for unauthorized aliens in the United States could impact its demography and economy. Cooperation with Mexico could facilitate an orderly \"touch back\" process for foreign nationals. The United States would ultimately determine who is eligible for legalization. Mexico's involvement in a potential legalization program for unauthorized aliens in the United States could impact its demography and economy. While the United States would determine eligibility for legalization, some argue that a bilateral program may not be in the national interest. Poverty and lack of economic opportunities drive Mexico-U.S. migration, with scholars suggesting that development in Mexico could reduce unauthorized migration. The IRCA established a Commission to study international migration and economic development, consulting with Mexico and other sending countries to address conditions contributing to unauthorized migration. The commission found that economic development is key to reducing migratory pressures over time. Mexico supports cash remittances from migrants in the US to help alleviate poverty, exceeding $20 billion annually. The government also promotes formal remittance channels to provide more reliable and cost-effective transfer options. Additionally, Mexico has implemented the \"3 X 1 Citizen's Initiative\" to support remittance recipients in Mexican hometowns. The \"3 X 1 Citizen's Initiative\" matches remittances from Mexican home town associations in the US with funds from the Mexican government and Western Union. Despite its limited scope with a federal budget of $38 million in 2010, compared to total remittance flows of $22.6 billion, some suggest focusing foreign assistance on creating alternatives to emigration in Mexico. The suggestion to discourage unauthorized emigration from Mexico includes supporting farmer-to-farmer exchange programs and expanding the North American Development Bank's mandate. However, Mexico, as an upper middle-income country, does not receive significant U.S. development aid. Using economic assistance to reduce emigration may be challenging due to short-term migration increases from rising expectations. The United States also supports Mexican counter-narcotics efforts through the M\u00e9rida Initiative. The United States supports Mexican counter-narcotics efforts through the M\u00e9rida Initiative, focusing on strengthening weak law enforcement institutions and societal problems to reduce drug trafficking-related violence and unauthorized emigration. Building strong and resilient communities under the \"Beyond M\u00e9rida\" framework aims to mitigate citizens' need to emigrate for safety, addressing migration dynamics in program design. Some may object to targeting U.S. funding to Mexican emigration as a matter of principle. Some may object to targeting U.S. funding to Mexican emigration communities. There have been proposals to link foreign aid to Mexico with illegal migration by reducing aid in proportion to the number of illegal border crossers. Mexico is the top source of U.S. immigrants, both legal and unauthorized, due to historical and geographical factors. The Mexican population in the U.S., its demographics, and migration patterns make Mexico central to the U.S. immigration debate. Migration issues are key to the bilateral relationship, influenced by economic factors and past policy decisions. The U.S. immigration debate is influenced by economic factors, past policy decisions, and efforts to strengthen migration control. Policy choices today have implications for both the United States and Mexico, including reforms to visa systems and proposals to legalize unauthorized migrants. Both countries share common interests in combating smuggling, promoting temporary worker circularity, and reducing unauthorized migration. Previous Mexico-U.S. migration policies may lead some to view Mexico as a \"special case\" in certain immigration questions. The 2001 framework agreement between George W. Bush and Vicente Fox aimed to establish a Mexico-specific temporary worker program, collaborative border enforcement, legalization for certain unauthorized Mexicans in the United States, and investments in Mexican communities to reduce illegal outflows. This bilateral approach may offer more effective migration enforcement and management of flows between the United States and Mexico. The United States and Mexico may collaborate to manage migration flows and control unauthorized migration, but trust is essential. Mexico's reliability in a bilateral visa program, border enforcement, and port security is questioned. Success in combating illicit drugs and reducing violence is crucial for any major changes in the U.S.-Mexican migration relationship. The future of this relationship depends on economic and demographic trends impacting regional migration flows. The future of Mexico-U.S. migration flows depends on economic and demographic trends in both countries. Policy decisions and structural factors will also play a role in shaping migration patterns."
