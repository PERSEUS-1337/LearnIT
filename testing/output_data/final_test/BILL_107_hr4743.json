    "content": "The Act titled \"Social Security Caregiver Credit Act of 2002\" introduces deemed wages for caregivers of dependent relatives under Title II of the Social Security Act. The Act \"Social Security Caregiver Credit Act of 2002\" defines terms like \"qualifying month\" as a month where an individual provides care to a dependent relative for at least 80 hours without pay, and \"dependent relative\" as a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, parent, aunt, or uncle under certain conditions. The term 'chronically dependent individual' refers to someone who relies on daily assistance for at least 2 activities of daily living and would be unable to perform these tasks without help. Activities of daily living that a chronically dependent individual may need assistance with include eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, and transferring in and out of a bed or chair. \"Deemed wages of caregiver\" For benefit calculation purposes under this title, individuals are deemed to have received a monthly amount equal to the excess of 50 percent of the average wages and self-employment income credited to individuals over the actual amount received. The last 60 qualifying months are considered for benefit calculation. This rule does not apply if a larger benefit would be payable without it. \"Citizenship and Residency Requirements state that to be eligible for benefits, an individual must be a resident of the United States and either a citizen or a lawful permanent resident. For non-citizens, continuous residency in the US for 5 years prior to the qualifying month is required. The term 'United States' refers to the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\" \"An individual must provide the Commissioner of Social Security with the name, social security number, and other required information of the dependent relative they were caring for to qualify for benefits. Additionally, there is an annual reimbursement of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund.\" The Commissioner of Social Security is authorized to appropriate necessary funds to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund for payments to beneficiaries, administrative expenses, and interest losses to maintain the Fund's financial position."
