    "content": "Intellectual property (IP) law encompasses copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, protecting various types of subject matter. Federal copyright and patent law are rooted in the U.S. Constitution, while trademark and trade secret laws are based on the Commerce Clause. The Copyright Act, Patent Act, and Lanham Act provide legal protection against unauthorized use of intellectual property. The Copyright Act, Patent Act, and Lanham Act provide legal protection for intellectual property against unauthorized use, theft, and violations of rights granted to IP owners. Copyright owners have exclusive rights to control reproduction, distribution, public performance, and display of their works. Patent holders can exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling their inventions. The Lanham Act allows sellers to prevent competitors from using counterfeit trademarks or false advertising. The Lanham Act prohibits the use of false or misleading information in commercial advertising that may cause confusion or deception. It also grants owners of \"famous\" trademarks the right to seek injunctive relief against dilution of their trademark's distinctive quality. Trade secret law provides another form of protection for inventors' proprietary rights to specific technologies. Trade secret law grants inventors proprietary rights to technologies, processes, designs, or formulas that may not meet patent standards. The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 and the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 provide legal protection against theft of trade secrets. Enforcement of intellectual property rights can be done through lawsuits or criminal prosecution by the U.S. Department of Justice. The enforcement of intellectual property rights involves various federal agencies such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection, International Trade Commission, U.S. Trade Representative, and others to promote and enforce IP rights domestically and internationally. In copyright cases, civil actions must be initiated within three years of the claim accruing. In civil cases, a claim must be filed within three years of accruing, while criminal proceedings have a five-year limit. Federal courts follow state laws for trademark infringement claims, with laches sometimes used to determine timeliness. Criminal trademark infringement prosecutions follow a five-year statute of limitations. Patent infringement actions have no statute of limitations, but there is a time limit for monetary relief. The time limit for monetary relief in patent infringement claims is six years prior to filing a complaint. Federal law has a three-year statute of limitations for civil actions involving trade secret misappropriation. The Lanham Act, Copyright Act, and Economic Espionage Act have criminal and civil provisions for violations. Federal courts determine civil remedies for IP infringement cases. The Patent Act only provides civil remedies for patent infringement. Imprisonment terms for IP violations are specified in substantive statutes, while criminal fines for trademark and copyright violations are determined accordingly. The fine amount for violations of trademark and copyright laws is determined in conjunction with 18 U.S.C. Section 3571. Criminal fines for economic espionage or trade secret theft are specified in the Economic Espionage Act. Civil remedies and criminal penalties for copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret violations are detailed in table-format. These penalties are imposed upon conviction in criminal prosecutions or civil actions. Criminal forfeiture is available for offenses with forfeiture penalties. Forfeiture penalties can be imposed upon conviction of the owner of the offending property. Civil forfeiture is available if the government proves the infringing goods are subject to confiscation. Restitution is an option for defendants convicted of a criminal property offense."
