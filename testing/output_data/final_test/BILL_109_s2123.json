    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"FHA Manufactured Housing Loan Modernization Act of 2005\". The Congress finds that manufactured housing is crucial for low- and moderate-income families in the US, the FHA title I insurance program is important for manufactured home loans, the market is experiencing a downturn leading to a lack of private lending, and the FHA program has historically provided stability during such times. The FHA title I program for manufactured housing loans has seen a significant decline in usage since 2004 due to structural issues, loan limits not being adjusted for inflation, and a lack of new participants accepted into the program since 1989. This has led to higher loan costs, fewer originators, and an atrophied market for manufactured housing loans, leaving low- and moderate-income families with limited financing options for home-only purchases. The Act aims to provide adequate funding for FHA-insured manufactured housing loans for low- and moderate-income homebuyers, modernize the FHA title I insurance program, adjust loan limits for manufactured home loan insurance, and ensure no credit subsidy from the Federal Government is required. The National Housing Act is amended to allow exceptions for manufactured homes. Loan-to-value ratio and downpayment requirements are also addressed. The National Housing Act is amended to include loan-to-value and downpayment limitations on manufactured housing loans. Insured financial institutions must adhere to specific criteria for granting loans on manufactured homes or lots. The National Housing Act now includes loan-to-value and downpayment restrictions for manufactured housing loans. Insured financial institutions must follow set criteria when providing loans for manufactured homes or lots, requiring borrowers to pay at least 3 percent of the estimated costs in cash. SEC. 5.

Section 2(b) of the National Housing Act is amended to provide insurance benefits for manufactured housing loans executed under the FHA Manufactured Housing Loan Modernization Act of 2005.

Premium charges for manufactured home loans include an annual payment of up to 1.0 percent of the remaining insured principal balance, in addition to the initial premium. The charges are set to maintain a negative credit subsidy for the program. The Federal Government determines purchases for manufactured homes or lots based on risk under existing underwriting requirements. SEC. 8. REVISION OF UNDERWRITING CRITERIA.
