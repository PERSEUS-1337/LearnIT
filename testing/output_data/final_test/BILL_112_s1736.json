    "content": "The \"Acquisition Savings Reform Act of 2011\" includes provisions for using reverse auction methods, the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative, leveraging the government's purchasing power for savings, streamlining contract closeouts, and establishing cost efficiency objectives for service contracts. It also sets criteria for governmentwide acquisition savings and requires the Office of Management and Budget to implement savings requirements. Additionally, the Act includes provisions for expedited payment to small businesses. In this Act, key definitions include \"approved business case,\" \"acquisition,\" \"commercial item,\" \"executive agency,\" and \"Federal Acquisition Regulation.\" The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council is defined as the council established under section 1302(a) of title 41, United States Code. Federal Strategic Sourcing Vehicles are governmentwide interagency acquisition contracts designated by the Office of Management and Budget to save taxpayers money. Interagency contracts include governmentwide acquisition contracts and multi-agency contracts as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The term \"procurement\" is defined in section 111 of title 41, United States Code. It includes multi-agency contracts, Federal Supply Schedule contracts, and franchise funds, but excludes contracts under section 1535 of title 31. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council must amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation within 270 days to require executive agencies to use online reverse auctions for procurement of commercial items above a certain threshold to achieve savings. Agencies must consider the dollar volume of the acquisition and potential streamlining. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council must amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to include Federal Strategic Sourcing Vehicles in the acquisition planning process within 270 days of the enactment of this Act. The Office of Management and Budget will maintain a website with the list of these vehicles. Purchases can be made from sources other than Federal Strategic Sourcing. The plan allows purchases from sources other than Federal Strategic Sourcing Vehicles if deemed in the best interest of the Federal Government. Cost comparisons and administrative costs must be considered, with exceptions for urgent situations. Policies will be issued to maximize small businesses and other socioeconomic categories in Federal Strategic Sourcing Vehicles. The Office of Management and Budget will identify Federal Strategic Source Vehicle contracts and awardees on its website. Chief Information Officers and Chief Acquisition Officers will collect data on Information Technology purchases and services as part of the initiative. Executive agencies are required to gather data on information technology purchases and service acquisitions by North American Industrial Classification codes. They must submit annual reports to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget through fiscal year 2016, including collected data and a plan for strategic sourcing. The plan should outline specific milestones, measurable savings, and evaluation criteria. Additionally, each executive agency must submit annual reports estimating the amount of purchases for fiscal years 2013 through 2016. For fiscal years 2013 through 2016, executive agencies must estimate savings from Federal Strategic Sourcing Vehicles and other approved acquisition methods. They should also detail guidance issued for procurement through these vehicles, or provide an explanation if no guidance was given. SEC. 5 of the Act requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop a plan to achieve $1 billion in savings through Federal Strategic Sourcing Vehicles for fiscal years 2013-2016. The plan includes an annual scorecard to measure agency success in achieving savings. SEC. 6 addresses governmentwide contract vehicles. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council must amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation within 270 days to encourage agencies to use Federal Supply Schedules and other procurement instruments for multiple agencies. Agencies should prioritize small businesses and set-asides when utilizing these vehicles. Contracting officers are encouraged to maximize competition under procurement vehicles like Federal Supply Schedules to achieve the best value for the Federal Government. SEC. 7. STREAMLINING OF CONTRACT CLOSEOUTS. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council will amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to allow contracting officers to waive contract closeout audits above the simplified acquisition purchase threshold based on risk assessments. Factors for low risk assessments may include time and material contracts, low dollar cost contracts, and contractors with approved business systems and good past performance ratings. The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy will issue guidance in collaboration with the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy. The Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy will provide guidance for contracting officials on waivers of contract closeout audits. The AbilityOne Program should be used for non-inherently governmental tasks related to contract close-out. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council will amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation for firm-fixed contracts within 270 days. The Federal Acquisition Regulation will be amended for firm-fixed contracts to require contractors to submit a final invoice within 60 days of government acceptance. Contracting officers may close contracts without a final invoice if the amount due is minimal. Contracts can be closed with missing documentation if no additional products or services will be received. Additionally, unreconciled balances for low-risk contracts can be written off. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council will amend the regulations to allow contracting officers to write off unreconciled balances on low-risk contracts if all administrative actions are complete and a notice has been sent to the payment office. The head of contracting activity can grant exemptions to these requirements. Exemptions for contracting officers, including procuring and administrative officers, are defined in the contract file. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council must amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to require affordability as a mandate for certain acquisitions exceeding $100,000,000. Affordability is defined as conducting acquisitions within the agency's allocated resources. Additionally, cost efficiency objectives for service contracts are to be implemented. SEC. 9. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council will amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to mandate cost efficiency objectives for service contracts over $100,000,000 within 270 days. Exceptions can be granted by the head of contracting activity. SEC. 10. Governmentwide acquisition savings criteria will be established. The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, in collaboration with the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, will establish a methodology to track executive agencies' progress in achieving measurable acquisition savings, including price reductions and cost savings. Additionally, the Office of Management and Budget will set savings requirements. SEC. 11. The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, in coordination with other agencies, will develop a plan to reduce the use of certain contracts. SEC. 12. Small businesses will receive expedited payments. SEC. 12. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council will amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to expedite payments to small businesses within 270 days of the enactment of this Act."
