    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Pre-College Engineering Education Act\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that STEM education in elementary and secondary schools is crucial for developing student interest and aptitude in subjects relevant to research and innovation, which supports the nation's economic health, national security, and quality of life. STEM education also contributes to scientific and technological literacy for all citizens. Engineering education is the application of scientific and mathematical principles to innovate, analyze, design, evaluate, and manufacture machines, processes, and systems. It plays a vital role in attaining licensure as a professional engineer and can stimulate interest and improve learning in mathematics and science. According to the National Academy of Engineering, there is limited experience with engineering education in elementary and secondary schools. Some States have included engineering in their science or technology standards, and many school districts offer informal engineering education. The Next Generation Science Standards have identified science and engineering practices for students from kindergarten to high school graduation. According to the National Academy of Engineering, there is a lack of qualified teachers for engineering instruction. Teachers need professional training to align engineering concepts with students' diverse learning styles. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as Director, elementary school, institution of higher education, local educational agency, and secondary school. The curr_chunk defines \"STEM education\" as per the STEM Education Act of 2015. The curr_chunk focuses on the grant program related to STEM education. The Director will establish a grant program to promote sustainable engineering education in schools through public-private partnerships. This program aims to research instructional materials, teach analytical engineering approaches, prepare students for STEM careers, increase diversity in the engineering field, and encourage engineering studies in college. Grants for sustainable engineering education will be provided to higher education institutions with co-principal investigators from engineering and education colleges. Public-private partnerships will coordinate programs involving higher education institutions. Grants under this section will be awarded to higher education institutions in the same State as local educational agencies and private sector or government organizations employing engineers. The grants will cover a four-year period, with the first two years focused on developing research-based engineering instructional materials tailored to local needs. Instructional materials developed under this program will emphasize engineering fundamentals, design, manufacturing, testing, and essential skills like systems thinking, creativity, teamwork, communication, and ethics. The instructional program will introduce students to modern engineering tools and align with relevant science, engineering, and mathematics standards. The third year of funding will be used for a pilot instructional program. The funding provided under a grant will be used for implementing an engineering education program in one school, using selected instructional materials and mentors from relevant institutions. In the fourth year, the program will expand to other schools described in subsection (c)(2). An application for a grant under this section must show a strong long-term commitment from the institution(s) in providing space, training programs for teachers, and collaboration with local educational agencies, private sector, or government. The grant application must demonstrate a commitment from institutions to provide funding and collaborate with local educational agencies, private sector, government organizations, and nonprofit educational enterprises. The grant funding aims to support the engineering education program in elementary and secondary schools, ensuring its continuation and expansion. Collaboration with institutions, private sector, and government organizations is essential for the program's success. Private sector or government organizations can support the engineering education program in schools through financial assistance, personnel involvement, expertise, equipment provision, guidance on instructional materials, and other forms of support. New grants will be awarded annually based on availability. Authorization of Appropriations.--No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act. This Act shall be carried out using amounts otherwise made available for such purposes. The Director will arrange a study with the National Academy of Engineering to review and analyze the impact of activities under the Act on pre-college engineering education. The study will also recommend any necessary revisions to establish engineering education in all secondary schools across the United States. Additionally, an annual report to Congress will be provided. The Director will provide an annual report to Congress on activities and results under the Act, including grant applications, distribution of grants, participation of minority-serving institutions and underrepresented student groups, collaboration among grantees, program outcomes, and recommendations for program revisions."
