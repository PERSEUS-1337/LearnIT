The impact of marijuana usage on the risk of a driver being involved in a motor vehicle crash is a growing concern. State highway safety offices rate drugged driving as important as driving under the influence of alcohol. Stakeholders often compare impairment from marijuana to alcohol, but research on marijuana's effects on driving is limited. Marijuana is a more complex substance than alcohol, with less established correlations between consumption and impairment. Research on marijuana's impact on driving is limited compared to alcohol. Marijuana is absorbed and affects the body differently, making testing for its presence more complex. While some studies suggest a small increase in crash risk with marijuana use, the correlation is not clearly established. In real-world settings, the effects of marijuana on driving performance may not always translate to increased crash likelihood due to various influencing factors. The CRS report discusses the issue of marijuana-impaired driving, including patterns of use, detection of impairment, state laws, and challenges for law enforcement. It references the NHTSA's 2017 report on marijuana-impaired driving and highlights the key compounds in marijuana, such as THC. In recent years, there has been a trend towards acceptance of marijuana usage in the United States. Public opinion polls show an increase in support for legalization, with 33 states and the District of Columbia enacting laws allowing marijuana use under certain conditions. Additionally, 10 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana since 2012. Since 2012, 10 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana. Self-reported marijuana use has steadily increased among individuals aged 18 and older since 2008, with the highest usage among young adults aged 18-25. Self-reported marijuana use among adults aged 26 and older increased from 4.2% to 7.9% in 2017. Usage patterns have risen in most states, regardless of marijuana restrictions. NHTSA's roadside surveys show a rise in THC-positive drivers, indicating a potential increase in drug use. According to a survey, 12.7% of nighttime drivers tested positive for THC, up from 8.7% in 2007. NHTSA did not report THC concentrations or assess impairment. Driving is a risky activity with potential for injury or death, leading to laws against impaired driving in all states. Laws in the US and Puerto Rico prohibit driving while impaired, which can be caused by alcohol, drugs, fatigue, distraction, or emotional states. Some states require proof of impairment, while others have per se laws where specific substance levels lead to automatic guilt. Detecting marijuana impairment is more complex than alcohol impairment. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant that quickly enters the bloodstream and is metabolized by the body. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) peaks within an hour of drinking and declines gradually. Studies show that impairment increases with higher BAC levels, with legal limits set at .08% in the US. However, even lower BAC levels can cause impairment. In some European countries and Utah, driving with a BAC of .05% or higher is prohibited. Commercial truck drivers in the US are not allowed to drive with a BAC of .04%. Tests like breath analysis or blood/urine samples can determine BAC levels for legal purposes. Detecting impairment from marijuana use is more challenging due to how the body metabolizes THC differently from alcohol. Traces of THC can be found in the body weeks after marijuana usage, but there is no proven correlation between THC levels and driver impairment. Studies on marijuana's effects on driving performance are limited due to legal restrictions and varying potency of THC in different plants. Some researchers believe funded research on marijuana potency is low quality. Processing and ingestion methods affect THC levels in the body. Rule-of-thumb guides for impairment are less useful for marijuana compared to alcohol. Tables suggest two drinks can impair drivers, with NTSB advising caution for a 160-pound male. Based on current knowledge, it is difficult to determine a specific level of marijuana consumption and its effect on driving ability. Studies on the association between marijuana use and crash risk have shown inconsistent results. One study estimated a 1.83 times increased crash risk for marijuana users, while others found no association. The increased crash risk for drivers testing positive for marijuana is estimated to be between zero and three times that of unimpaired drivers. The increased crash risk of driving with a blood alcohol content of .01% to .05% is comparable to that of a driver with a BAC of .08%. Drivers under the influence of marijuana tend to drive below the speed limit, maintain a greater distance from other vehicles, and take fewer risks. This behavior is believed to be a conscious effort to compensate for the effects of marijuana. The NHTSA report highlights that drivers under the influence of alcohol tend to drive faster, follow cars closely, and take risks, while those under the influence of marijuana drive below the speed limit, maintain distance, and take fewer risks. Epidemiological studies on marijuana use and crash risk are limited, with few showing a low or no increased crash risk. The National Academy of Sciences and the National Institutes of Health reference studies showing that marijuana use before driving increases the risk of motor vehicle accidents. The NAS committee's report concluded that there is substantial evidence of a statistical association between cannabis use and an increased risk of crashes. Several factors complicate determining the impact of marijuana on crash likelihood. The distinction between correlation and causation is crucial when analyzing factors contributing to a driver being involved in a crash. For example, young male drivers have the highest rate of motor vehicle crashes and marijuana use, making it challenging to determine the role of marijuana in crash involvement. The exceptionally high rate of crash involvement of young male drivers is often linked to impaired driving arrests, where law enforcement officers use field sobriety tests to check for alcohol impairment. However, officers may not be trained to recognize impairment from marijuana or other drugs. NHTSA has developed training programs for law enforcement in this area. NHTSA has developed two training programs for law enforcement officers to recognize drug impairment in drivers during roadside stops. ARIDE provides basic information on drug impairment, while DREs are trained to identify and differentiate between categories of drugs. DRE training requires a significant time commitment, with around 1% of patrol officers being active DREs as of 2016. The nation's patrol officers, known as DREs, conduct a 12-step evaluation on drivers suspected of impairment in a controlled environment. Various tests like urine, hair follicles, blood, and saliva can detect THC and its metabolites. Blood tests are the gold standard for establishing marijuana presence in impaired driving cases, requiring a search warrant and a licensed person to draw blood. Oral fluid testing is simpler and can detect marijuana presence easily. Devices for oral fluid testing at the point of arrest are available, but their accuracy is questionable due to environmental exposure to marijuana. Hair testing is unreliable for drug-impaired driving enforcement as THC can be detected months after use, potentially from second-hand smoke or hair products. Urine testing is also unreliable as THC can be detected for days or weeks after use. The decision on whether to arrest a driver who tests positive for marijuana is complex due to inadequate tests for impairment. Unlike alcohol, the link between THC levels in the body and impairment is not well-established. THC concentration in the blood rises and falls rapidly after consumption, making it a poor indicator of impairment or recent marijuana use. Impairing effects can appear quickly and persist for some time. Tests for marijuana impairment can be complex due to the presence of THC metabolites that can linger for weeks. Some states have laws limiting THC concentration for drivers, while others have zero-tolerance policies. Challenges to per se impairment laws have yielded varying results due to the lack of reliable impairment tests. Some courts support per se standards for impaired driving despite the lack of reliable impairment tests for marijuana. Federal law prohibits marijuana possession and usage, especially for certain job positions like federal employees and transportation workers in safety-sensitive roles. Transportation workers in safety-sensitive positions, including drivers, are prohibited from consuming marijuana. They are subject to alcohol and drug testing before starting a new job, after a serious crash, and randomly. Those suspected of being under the influence at work can be tested immediately. Positive tests require evaluation, counseling, follow-up testing, and at least six random tests in the next year. This applies to approximately 12 million transportation workers. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Transportation deemed marijuana use unacceptable for safety-sensitive transportation workers subject to drug testing. Despite state legalization, these workers can still lose their jobs for using marijuana. Better information is needed for policymaking, including research on correlating THC levels with impairment and data on marijuana use by drivers, especially those involved in crashes or arrested for impaired driving. Substance-specific impaired driving data is crucial for analyzing pre and post-legalization effects of marijuana. Detection of impairment among marijuana users relies on observation of physiological, cognitive, and psychomotor indicators by law enforcement. Training for law enforcement officers and legal professionals is recommended to improve handling of drug-impaired driving cases. Federal regulations prohibit the legal use of marijuana for safety-sensitive transportation workers, regardless of state laws. There is no data on how many employees have lost their jobs due to positive marijuana tests. With the long detection period of marijuana in the body and uncertainty about its impact on driving, policymakers may reconsider testing all transportation workers for marijuana. Federal regulations prohibit marijuana usage for safety-sensitive transportation workers. Congress may choose to maintain the status quo until more research is available."
