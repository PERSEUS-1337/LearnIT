    "content": "The Act titled \"Teaching Geography Is Fundamental Act\" amends Title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to include a new section on Geography Education. This new section includes findings related to geography education. Congress finds that the United States' economic competitiveness relies on advanced geographic knowledge and tools. The geospatial industry generated $73 billion in revenue last year, with 500,000 high-wage jobs and growing at 25-30% annually. A lack of global awareness among citizens hinders their ability to engage with peers and participate in business, as highlighted in a 2012 report by the Council on Foreign Relations. Geographic literacy is crucial for citizens to engage globally in business, diplomacy, and military affairs. The 2010 National Assessment of Educational Progress revealed that less than 30% of students scored at grade level in geography. The National Academy of Sciences recommended a national program to enhance geographic competence in the US population. Geography is considered a core academic subject. The National Geographic Society found that all states recognize geography in their curricula, with an increasing number requiring it for graduation. Educators feel their professional development in geography is inadequate, and schools lack basic teaching materials. The National Geographic Society supports State Geographic Alliances in over 80 colleges and universities across all 50 states to enhance geography teaching through professional development programs for K-12 teachers. Teachers and higher education partners collaborate to conduct workshops, create teaching materials, and facilitate communication among educators. A study by Mid-continent Research for Education and Learning found that students taught by Alliance-trained teachers performed almost 10 percent better in geography on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The evolving threats to national security require qualified GIS and remote sensing experts, which are already in short supply according to a 2013 National Academies report. By 2030, there may be shortages in emerging and core areas due to competition and a limited number of graduates. By 2030, there may be shortages in emerging and core areas of cartography, photogrammetry, and geodesy. SEC. 262. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES. The purpose of this part is to promote geographic literacy and understanding of global cultures among K-12 students by expanding programs that utilize the expertise of higher education faculty. The objectives include increasing students' knowledge of geography and achievement in standards-based geography, as well as increasing the number of qualified geography teachers. The purpose of this part is to promote geographic literacy and understanding of global cultures among K-12 students by improving student mastery of geographic principles, increasing practical applications of those principles, encouraging geographic education research, developing effective instructional materials, promoting best practices, assisting States in measuring the impact of geography education, and expanding support for geography education partnerships. The Secretary is authorized to award a grant to a national nonprofit education organization or consortium for improving student understanding of geography through effective teaching in classrooms. Eligible entities must submit an application with required information. The funds are to be used for promoting geographic literacy, global culture understanding, mastery of geographic principles, research, instructional materials, best practices, measuring impact, and supporting partnerships. An eligible entity receiving a grant under this part must use up to 25 percent of the funds for activities such as strengthening relationships with educational institutions, supporting teacher training in geography, and conducting research on effective geography teaching. The grant supports research on effective geography teaching practices, assessment strategies, convenes national conferences on geographic literacy, and develops research-based materials for fostering geographic literacy. Eligible entities can use up to 75% of funds for subgrants to institutions of higher education. An eligible recipient, associated with various educational entities, can apply for a subgrant under specific guidelines set by the eligible entity. The eligible entity invites individuals in the field of geography education to review and recommend approval of subgrant applications. Other necessary individuals may also be invited for review. Eligible recipients can apply for subgrants under specific guidelines. Subgrant recipients must use funds for teacher training, GIS tools, distance learning technology, and academic standards in geography education. The curr_chunk discusses promoting research in geography education, carrying out field-based activities for teachers and students, promoting comparative studies of world cultures, encouraging replication of best practices, developing effective geography learning materials, and convening State-based conferences to assess geographic literacy. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for matching funds to be eligible for a subgrant under this part, with an eligible recipient needing to provide assurances and funds equal to 20 percent of the subgrant funds received for each fiscal year. Matching funds can come from various sources. Matching funds for subgrants under this part can be provided in cash or in kind, including facilities, staffing salaries, and educational materials. An eligible entity receiving a grant or subgrant under this part can use up to 15% of the funds for administrative costs. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2014 and the following 4 years."
