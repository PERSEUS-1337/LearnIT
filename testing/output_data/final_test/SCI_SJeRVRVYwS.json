    "content": "Automating Science Journalism (ASJ) is proposed as a new benchmark for neural abstractive summarization, involving summarizing scientific papers into press releases for a general audience. A specialized dataset for ASJ is introduced, aiming to improve factuality in press release generation through transfer learning with scientific abstracts and partitioned press releases. The evolution of neural text summarization models from extractive to abstractive and hybrid models, with advancements in reinforcement learning objectives, dataset sizes, and pre-trained representations, has significantly improved summarization capabilities beyond ASJ benchmark. The evolution of neural text summarization models has greatly improved capabilities, moving from extractive to abstractive and hybrid models. These advancements have been supported by the emergence of seq2seq models. ASJ is seen as a natural testbed for challenging these models with extreme paraphrasing tasks. Science journalism plays a crucial role in bridging scientific research with the general public, requiring journalists to summarize and paraphrase complex concepts in an accessible language. A dataset of 50,000 scientific papers paired with Science Daily press releases is presented to train models to emulate journalistic tasks. Our goal is to train a seq2seq model to convert scientific papers into layman-friendly summaries. Recent work shows that even simple word embeddings can capture scientific knowledge. We propose using transfer learning and multitask learning to enhance the model's ability to extract factual knowledge. Multitask learning (MTL) is used to improve factuality in seq2seq summarization for automating science journalism (ASJ). A novel evaluation measure is introduced to assess the likelihood of the target given random source fragments. The work presents a new application task and dataset for ASJ with complex scientific notions paraphrased in long texts. The paper proposes a transfer learning approach to enhance the factuality of generated summaries in automating science journalism. It introduces an automatic evaluation measure focusing on factuality and discusses various sections including previous work, new data for ASJ, models, transfer learning experiments, evaluation setup, experiments, and results. The study rethinks neural text summarization for scientific datasets and multitask learning applications. Automating science journalism involves text summarization where scientific papers are condensed into press release summaries. Neural models for this task can be abstractive, extractive, or hybrid. The focus is on factuality and changing the technical style of scientific papers. The lack of benchmark datasets has hindered progress in this area. The abundance of scientific articles online and their press coverage provide an opportunity to develop neural models for text summarization. Previous work focused on preserving the style of the source or generating short targets, but none integrated relevant information into articles using popular language. Multitask learning is utilized by combining datasets from scientific articles with different target domains like abstracts and press releases. This approach leverages recent advances in transfer learning for NLP. The proposed multitask learning setup for text summarization integrates various datasets from scientific articles with different target domains, such as abstracts and press releases. Inspired by the GROVER model, the decoder can generate either an abstract or a press release based on special tags or intermediate outputs. This approach builds on recent advancements in transfer learning for NLP. Our dataset consists of pairs of scientific papers and Science Daily press releases. We use the arXiv dataset for domain transfer, linking scientific papers to their abstracts. No explicit pre-processing is done on the papers. The dataset consists of 215K paper-abstract pairs from the arXiv database. Papers are not excessively long or too short, with each paper averaging 4,938 words and each abstract averaging 220 words. Figures, tables, math formulas, and citation markers were removed to focus on textual content. The target texts in this dataset are more extractive and the source texts are more mathematical compared to Science Daily. The Science Daily dataset stands out for having more abstractive target summaries with lower coverage and density. The arXiv dataset contains explicit formulas for coverage and density statistics, representing the fraction of words in extractive fragments and the average length of these fragments. The dataset consists of relatively large source and target sequences, with articles averaging around 7,000 words and press releases around 550 words. In comparison, the standard CNN/Daily Mail dataset has shorter sources of 800 words and targets of 50 words. The curr_chunk discusses the models used for summarization, focusing on a small vanilla convolutional seq2seq model with specific parameters. The FAIRSEQ library and convolutional seq2seq implementations were utilized for this purpose. The model was trained until convergence on the dev set with a learning rate of 0.25 and Nesterov accelerated gradient. The second model for neural story generation introduces attention mechanisms and multi-head self-attention on decoder layers. The model uses encoder layers with gated multi-scale multi-head self-attention and specific dimensions for encoder and decoder layers. The model for neural story generation includes encoder layers with gated self-attention heads and specific dimensions. Training involved convergence on the dev set with certain parameters and took around 20-30 epochs. Transfer learning experiments were conducted using datasets for seq2seq summarization, including the original Science Daily dataset and an augmented version with the arXiv dataset. The Science Daily dataset was augmented with the arXiv dataset using specific tags for source and target domains. A total of 80,000 points were used for training, with 10,000 each for testing and development. The encoder layers and decoder attention mechanism focus on these tags during processing and output generation. Augmented Science Daily dataset by partitioning targets into three equal parts during training. Model generates specific sections like highlights, body, and conclusion sequentially during inference. This approach allows for co-training with different summarization domains and signal transfer between them. In this study, the dataset was augmented by splitting targets into three equal parts during training. The model generated specific sections like highlights, body, and conclusion sequentially during inference. The text data was converted to byte pair encoding with 32,000 BPE tokens. Results showed that AB outperformed BASE and PART in terms of ROUGE points. Co-training with abstracts significantly improves ROUGE scores for FCONV, outperforming BASE and PART. Evaluating abstractive summarization systems without extensive human resources remains a challenge, leading to the need for a conditional model for generation. To generate summaries, a heuristic search procedure is used due to the vast solution space. The model aims to achieve a target probability distribution. The evaluation tests the model's ability to process meaning in the source text. During encoding and decoding, positional embeddings are added to token embeddings to give sequence representations a sense of order. A good automatic summarizer should focus on meaning rather than structure when extracting information. Science Daily and other real-world datasets do not have well-defined structures, so summarization should not rely on absolute position. To test these properties, instead of calculating p(t|s) for the entire source sequence s, we calculate p(t|r), where r =. To ensure that the model's processing of meaning is evaluated, a random 100-word sub-sequence of the source sequence is used to calculate p(t|r) instead of p(t|s). This approach aims to focus on meaning rather than sequence structure. The evaluation experiment involves generating ten points for each source-target pair, with one point using a 100-word fragment of the source and nine points using fragments from random sources in the test set. This method aims to assess the model's understanding of meaning in the input data. The evaluation involves inputting source fragments into the trained model and calculating the probability of the common target sequence. The random access (RA) measure is used to determine the percentage of groups where the true source yields the highest probability. This measure is important for testing summarization systems due to the large size of the sources. Results show that both AB and PART outperform the BASE significantly in the FCONV experiment. In the results, AB and PART significantly outperform BASE in both FCONV and STORY experiments by 39.8 and 39.1 RA points absolute, and 42.6 and 51.1 RA points absolute, respectively. RA is considered a good measure for the generalizability of transfer learning experiments in summarization. AB and PART not only improve ROUGE and RA scores but also provide advantages such as topical and factual generation, memorization of scientific concepts, and semantic structure due to the self-attention mechanism. Training using self-attention models on BASE yields irrelevant summaries with logical structure, while FCONV and STORY on AB provide high extractive ability. STORY on AB can extract relevant information but may not always present it accurately. When trained on AB, STORY can memorize and use scientific concepts, writing with conceptual and logical accuracy. Beam search generation is particularly effective. The curr_chunk discusses the effectiveness of beam search generation in producing structured and concise writing, accurately mentioning key details such as the use of x-ray crystallography. It also highlights the model's ability to learn and apply knowledge accurately, similar to previous studies on unsupervised word embeddings. Additionally, it mentions limitations of Transfer Learning in generating repetitive outputs and struggling with named entities. The output of AB and PART is often repetitive and limited, struggling with logic and factual accuracy. FCONV on AB and BASE share similar issues in generating summaries. STORY tends to over-fit to certain concepts, creating stories unrelated to the input sequence. The STORY models, despite focusing on DNA, may elaborate on separate topics. Generations show some conceptual understanding but lack topicality. External information like concerns about research cannot be captured by seq2seq models. Transfer learning improves factuality compared to models trained solely on BASE. Transfer learning improves factuality in models trained on BASE. Co-training helps the model focus on presenting correct information from the source. MTL setting benefits SD due to low language correlation in press releases. Proposed novel applications for seq2seq modeling (ASJ) and factuality-based evaluation (RA) are domain-agnostic and applicable to various summarization tasks. In future work, the researchers plan to enhance their models with pre-trained representations from large corpora for better factual seq2seq summarization. They aim to expand transfer learning objectives and improve summarization outcomes. The study found similarities in how archaeal cells and more complex cells package and store genetic material. Eukaryotes, including humans, have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, while prokaryotes lack a nucleus. Archaea and bacteria, both prokaryotes, are distantly related. Archaea and bacteria, both prokaryotes, are distantly related. Archaea are likely progenitors of eukaryotes and share proteins controlling gene expression. Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus containing compacted genetic material wrapped around histone proteins. The structure of eukaryotic nucleosomes was first reported in 1997 via x-ray crystallography. In the 1990s, John Reeve and a collaborator discovered histone proteins in nucleus-free archaea cells. They worked with Luger to crystallize histone-based archaeal chromatin and compare it to eukaryotic chromatin. After overcoming challenges, they resolved the structure of archaeal chromatin, which showed similarities to eukaryotes. Santangelo's team at CSU helped determine the biological significance of the structure. The structure of nucleosome assembly, composed of two domains, represents a key step in creating DNA structures with different sequences. Histones are the building blocks of DNA, essential for biological processes controlled by genetic makeup. The assembly includes four double helix and three double helix components, where DNA is wrapped around histones and broken into separate strands. The research team led by Professor Dr. Thomas Edron from the University of Colorado discovered how histones, important structures in cells, can be modified to form proteins. Using x-ray crystallography, they obtained a 3D structure of histones stripped from DNA, essential in diseases like cancer. This work can be used to design new drugs to fight cancer and understand the formation of DNA assemblies by different proteins. The scientists discovered that DNA is not fully understood and can be formed by different proteins in a specific pattern, not through a double helix as previously thought. The extra DNA is broken down into four double helices, forming a \"double helix.\" Professor Ekaterina Luger mentioned that this structure could potentially be used to control cancer cell development. The next research step is to understand how different histone structures affect cell architecture. The article outlines a process for creating DNA and mentions the importance of nucleosome remodeling in the development of multicellular organisms. Researchers from multiple universities have shown that the nucleosome structure plays a key role in this process. The nucleosome, the first step in DNA complex assembly, is formed in the nucleus of living organisms. Histone proteins, the building blocks of proteins, play a crucial role in various biological functions.

Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have identified a new type of DNA repair system that can break down the DNA double helix. Study senior author Richard A. Wilson stated that while DNA damage repair is known, this new system offers a novel approach to fixing DNA damage.

The study aims to understand the structure of histone molecules in cells for potential disease treatments. The researchers at the National Autonomous University of Mexico studied the effects of feeding rats fat at different times of the day on their blood fat levels. They found that feeding the rats fat at the beginning of their rest period caused a more drastic spike in blood fat levels compared to feeding them during their active phase. Removing the part of the rat's brain that controls the 24-hour cycle eliminated the change in fat levels. This study highlights the importance of following the biological clock for health, as high blood fat levels are linked to heart disease and diabetes. The study demonstrates the impact of eating out of sync with our biological clock on high blood fat levels and heart problems. Ignoring our biological clock frequently, such as with shift work or staying up late, can harm our health in the long-term. The circadian clock regulates glucose and fat levels, affecting triglyceride production in the liver. The study by Professor Ruudr Buijs at the School of Medicine focuses on the impact of triglycerides on liver cells and the development of new therapies.

Project funded by US Department of Defense raises concerns. A project funded by the US Department of Defense, called 'Insect Allies', is raising concerns about potential misuse for biological warfare. The program aims to use insects to spread genetically modified viruses to agricultural plants in fields, allowing for quick and large-scale genetic modifications to crops like corn. This could make plants less susceptible to pests or droughts by altering their chromosomes through genome editing using synthetic viruses. Genetic engineering in fields would allow farmers to alter crop genetics at any time, potentially disrupting traditional farming practices. DARPA funded a project to develop genetically modified viruses for editing crops in fields, with a total of 27 million US dollars allocated for research. The first of three consortia, consisting of 14 American research facilities, announced their participation in mid-2017 to develop modified viruses for genetically editing crops in fields. Researchers have developed a method to control the spread of viruses in the environment by identifying genes responsible for mosquito dispersal and introducing genetic mutations into the vector. The researchers developed a new method to introduce genetic mutations into mosquitoes, creating genetically modified mosquitoes capable of infecting host plants. These transgenic plants were then introduced into the environment to control crop pests. The goal is to understand how insects' genomes control their spread and develop sustainable pest control technologies. The researchers developed new biomethods using a genetic approach for pest control in crops. They studied the genetic effects of genetic resistance in transgenic crops and found that transgenic plants can produce their own genetic material. This new system is important for understanding the spread of diseases in staple crops like corn.

The study was conducted in collaboration with universities in Germany and Italy, and was funded by various research councils. The team of scientists studied the movement of the tendril and viscous fluid in the granular phase, where friction and pressure interact. The simulation model measured the movement between rock and friction force, showing that granular behavior is always random and can only be measured with high precision. The new model can be used to explain the behavior of rock motion on the ground. The new model developed by the opener and his colleague describes the granular state in a simple way, focusing on viscous fluid avalanches. The sliding force on a solid is proportional to the velocity of the drunken tide. The behavior of the torquato can be described using mathematical equations.

The ROUGE metrics are used for automatic evaluation of summaries, measuring word and phrase overlap. ROUGE metrics are used for automatic evaluation of summaries, measuring word and phrase overlap. ROUGE-N is a recall-based measure that evaluates how well a model can generate all n-grams in the target summary. ROUGE-L measures the longest common subsequence between the generated and reference summaries, focusing on word order rather than consecutive words. The LCS based F-measure for summarization evaluation involves computing the union of common subsequences between reference and generated summaries. Manual and automatic methods are used for evaluating summaries, with the Pyramid method being a popular manual approach. The system's score is calculated based on the average pyramid score of each generated summary, which is determined by the weights assigned to subject content units (SCUs). Positional embeddings are used to embed words in a vector space for input sequences in the model. The convolutional seq2seq model utilizes positional embeddings to enhance word embeddings for input and output tokens. The model consists of convolutional layers that adjust input representations without changing the length of the embedding sequence. The convolutional seq2seq model uses kernels to combine input representations locally. Kernels sweep over input embeddings, applying a weighted linear combination to create output elements. The convolutions double the dimensionality of embeddings to implement a gating mechanism. The convolutional seq2seq model uses convolutions to add new relationships to embeddings in each layer. The encoder network consists of convolution blocks that output the final embedding of the input document. The decoder receives a sequence of previously generated tokens and uses padding to mask future tokens. Each layer includes convolutions, a gating mechanism, and an attention mechanism. The decoder in the convolutional seq2seq model utilizes convolutions, a gating mechanism, and an attention mechanism to modify the encoder output for generating the next word in the sequence. During training, the model calculates the KL divergence between the output distribution and the target token, optimizing the training loss through back-propagation. This distribution is then used for token selection during generation. The decoder in the convolutional seq2seq model uses self-attention to model relationships between tokens in a sequence. Two main search techniques are employed: beam search and top-k-sampling. Beam search expands all possible next steps and keeps the k most likely ones, while top-k-sampling selects the k highest probability tokens uniformly at random. The self-attention mechanism is used in the convolutional seq2seq model to model long-term dependencies between tokens in a sequence. It is combined with the convolutional architecture for story generation, allowing the decoder to directly model relationships between tokens beyond the bounded context of a convolution. The mechanism calculates queries, keys, and values for each item in the decoder sequence, updating the decoder's outputs during generation. Adding a self-attention mechanism to the decoder and encoder layers can help the model relate different sections of the source paper and add long-range structure to the generated press release. FCONV lacks structured presentation of relevant information from the source due to the absence of self-attention, making it challenging for the encoder and decoder to model text relationships."
