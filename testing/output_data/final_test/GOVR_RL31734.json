    "content": "Federal agencies offer various forms of assistance to individuals, governments, and organizations following major disasters, including natural disasters and terrorist attacks. Aid can include operational, logistical, and technical support, financial assistance such as grants and loans, and the use of federally owned equipment and facilities. These programs are typically available after a major disaster declaration is issued, with more limited aid available under emergency declarations or on an as-needed basis. This report focuses on financial assistance programs commonly used in disaster response and recovery. The report focuses on financial assistance programs commonly used in disaster response and recovery. These programs are authorized as assistance programs listed at the General Services Administration website beta.SAM.gov. They do not include operational or technical assistance provided by some agencies in emergency situations. Congress may authorize specific forms of financial assistance following particular disasters. The financial assistance programs listed in the report are authorized for disaster relief by Congress and FEMA. They can address short-term and long-term recovery needs, such as survivor benefits and public facility repairs. Some programs may be changed as Congress and the Administration respond to domestic disaster needs. The Individuals and Households Program (IHP) is the primary FEMA assistance program for individuals and households after a disaster. It provides financial and direct assistance to those with uninsured necessary expenses and serious needs that cannot be met through other means. Program funds come from Congress and the Disaster Relief Fund. The Individuals and Households Program (IHP) provides financial assistance for various needs after a disaster, including temporary housing, repairs, replacement, and other expenses. FEMA covers 100% of housing costs, while other needs assistance (ONA) has a 75% federal and 25% state cost share. There are limits on financial assistance, with repair and replacement capped at $34,900 and ONA also capped at $34,900 (FY2019). Financial assistance for ONA under the Individuals and Households Program (IHP) is capped at $34,900 (FY2019), but assistance for renting alternate housing accommodations is excluded from this cap. The maximum amount of assistance is adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index and is intended to be temporary, generally limited to 18 months from the declaration date. Assistance may be extended by FEMA. Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) provides benefits to individuals affected by a major disaster who are not eligible for regular unemployment compensation. DUA is federally funded through FEMA and administered by the Department of Labor and state agencies. Applicants must apply within 30 days of the state announcing DUA availability, with some exceptions for good cause. Earnings history is used to determine benefits eligibility. DUA benefits are determined similarly to regular state UC rules, with a minimum weekly benefit of half the average UC benefit. Assistance is available as long as the disaster continues, up to 26 weeks after declaration. For more information, visit the CRS Report RS22022 by Julie M. Whittaker. Contact the Department of Labor for resources and assistance. The dislocated worker program provides training and assistance to individuals who have lost their jobs. 80% of funds go to states and local entities, while 20% are reserved for national grants. One type of grant is Disaster Relief Employment Assistance, which helps employ dislocated workers in temporary jobs after a national emergency. No matching requirements for WIOA programs. Contact the Department of Labor for more information. The Small Business Administration (SBA) provides disaster loans to individuals and households in declared disaster areas.

No cost-share requirements or time limitations are established for DLS. Contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency for more information. The Disaster Case Management (DCM) program, authorized under the Stafford Act, partners case managers with disaster survivors to create and implement recovery plans for unmet needs. Governors or tribal executives can request grants for DCM providers to assist survivors with long-term needs after a presidentially declared disaster. The program is time-limited to 24 months from the disaster declaration. Contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency for more information.

The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) provides grants to states for implementing mitigation measures after a disaster and to provide funding for previously identified mitigation measures to lessen future damage and loss of life. The federal government provides up to 75% of the cost share of eligible projects. Funding for HMGP comes through discretionary appropriations to the Disaster Relief Fund. The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) provides funding through discretionary appropriations to the Disaster Relief Fund. HMGP grants are awarded with a major disaster declaration and can be increased with an approved enhanced mitigation plan. Congress directed HMGP grants to be available with fire management assistance grants in FY2015, FY2017, and FY2018. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Grant Program offers grants and technical assistance for hazard mitigation activities to reduce injuries and loss of life. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Program provides funding for hazard mitigation activities to reduce injuries, loss of life, and property damage. Funding changed significantly with the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018, which authorizes the National Public Infrastructure Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Program, authorized by the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018, includes various assistance acts such as essential aid, repair of damaged facilities, debris removal, and federal assistance to individuals. FEMA has the discretion to shape the program, potentially increasing funding for public infrastructure projects to enhance community resilience. The new program may lead to significantly increased funding post-DRRA, but FEMA's implementation remains unclear. Contact the Office of Congressional Affairs for more information. The Community Disaster Loan (CDL) program provides loans to local governments that have suffered substantial revenue loss in a major disaster. The loan may not exceed 25% of the local government's annual budget, or 50% if the loss is greater. The maximum loan amount is $5 million with no matching requirement. Repayment is cancelled if revenues are insufficient after a disaster, and the loan term is typically five years. Approval by the governor's representative is required. In P.L. 115-72, Congress allocated $4.9 billion for the Community Disaster Loan (CDL) program to aid local governments affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, or Maria.
