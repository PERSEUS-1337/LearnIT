    "content": "Congressional interest in the patent system has been shown through the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), which is one of the most significant amendments to patent laws since 1952. Members of Congress have criticized the grant of compulsory licenses on patented inventions by US trading partners. Compulsory patent licenses have been a longstanding source of tension between the US and other nations. US law also allows for compulsory licensing of patented inventions under specific circumstances, where permission is granted for using someone else's intellectual property without their consent, typically requiring government approval and compensation to the patent owner. Compulsory patent licenses allow for the use of patented inventions without the patent owner's consent, typically for public health or national interests. Some view them as a threat to innovation, while others see them as necessary. The report discusses compulsory licensing under the TRIPS Agreement and U.S. law, as well as its role in innovation policy. The U.S. patent system is based on promoting progress in science and the arts through exclusive rights granted to inventors. To obtain patent protection, applicants must submit an application to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Examiners assess the application for disclosure, distinct claims, best mode of practicing the invention, and whether it meets substantive standards. For a patent to be granted, the invention must be useful, novel, and nonobvious, not fully anticipated by prior knowledge. A nonobvious invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of a competent artisan at the time the invention was made. If the USPTO allows the patent to issue, the patent proprietor obtains the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing into the United States the patented invention. Infringers may be held liable for damages and may be enjoined from further infringing acts. The maximum term of patent protection is usually 20 years from the application date. Patent protection lasts for 20 years from the application date. Patent rights require enforcement through litigation. The Federal Circuit handles most patent appeals, and the Supreme Court can review their decisions. Patents grant owners the right to exclude others from using the invention. Patents grant owners the right to exclude others from using the invention. Patent owners may allow others to use their technology through a license, either voluntarily or through a compulsory license under certain circumstances like national emergency or public health needs. The patent owner may abuse its economic power, leading to antitrust violations. In cases where multiple patents cover a technology, compulsory licensing may be necessary if one owner refuses to license. This process involves requesting a license from the government, which then decides on the terms. While formal compulsory licenses are rare, the existence of such statutes can encourage negotiations between parties. The Paris Convention allows member states to grant compulsory licenses to prevent patent abuse, with a waiting period of four years from filing or three years from grant. The TRIPS Agreement places limitations on compulsory patent licensing, requiring each application to be considered individually and the proposed user to have made efforts to obtain authorization from the patent owner on reasonable terms. The TRIPS Agreement requires efforts to obtain authorization from the patent owner for compulsory licensing. The license must be nonexclusive, limited to the authorized purpose, revocable when circumstances change, and provide adequate remuneration to the patent owner. The TRIPS Agreement allows for compulsory licensing of patented inventions to remedy anti-competitive practices and promote access to medicines. The Doha Declaration reaffirmed members' right to protect public health through the TRIPS Agreement. The Doha Declaration granted WTO signatories broad discretion for compulsory licensing to promote access to medicines. An amendment to the TRIPS Agreement, Article 31bis, allows countries with limited manufacturing capacity to import generic drugs. Ambiguities exist in the conditions for compulsory licensing, such as undefined terms like \"national emergency\" and lack of clarity on the requirement to primarily supply the domestic market. The United States has entered into free trade agreements that address compulsory patent licenses, which may have more restrictive terms than the TRIPS Agreement or Paris Convention. These agreements require signatories to grant compulsory patent licenses under specific circumstances, such as to remedy anticompetitive practices determined through legal processes. Compulsory patent licenses may be granted in cases of anticompetitive practices determined through legal processes or for public non-commercial use during national emergencies. The patent owner must be compensated, and no undisclosed information can be required. Compliance with international agreements like the TRIPS Agreement and Paris Convention may be necessary for compulsory licensing. The U.S. patent code does not have a general compulsory licensing provision, but other laws allow for compulsory licensing of patented inventions. Compulsory licenses can be granted through antitrust enforcement, patent infringement litigation, and federal government actions. Specific compulsory licenses exist for specialized subject matter under laws like the Atomic Energy Act and Clean Air Act. The Plant Variety Protection Act allows for compulsory licensing of seed-bearing plants protected by plant variety certificates. However, there have been no instances where compulsory licenses have been invoked. Enforcement of antitrust laws may result in patent owners agreeing to license their patents to competitors. The Bayh-Dole Act allows government contractors to obtain patents on inventions made with federal funding, but the government can grant additional licenses to other applicants through march-in rights if certain conditions are not met. The march-in right, similar to a compulsory license, has not been exercised. Injunctions used to be common for patent infringement cases, but the eBay ruling changed this, requiring courts to consider equitable factors before issuing an injunction. The eBay ruling changed the common practice of awarding injunctions in patent infringement cases. Courts now consider equitable factors before granting an injunction to the prevailing patentee. In cases where the patent owner does not commercialize the invention or has licensed it to others, the infringer may continue to use the patented invention but must pay a royalty until the patent expires. An adjudicated infringer differs from a compulsory license as it involves a specific infringer in a single litigation. Some federal jurists prefer the term \"ongoing royalty\" for cases where courts require payment of royalties by the infringer during the patent term. The U.S. government has the power of eminent domain to take private property for public use, but must compensate in some circumstances. The U.S. government can declare a compulsory license to use a patented invention without permission, but must compensate the patent owner. Section 1498(a) of Title 28 allows patent owners to sue the government for compensation if their invention is used without authorization. Under Section 1498(a), patent owners can sue the U.S. government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for compensation if their invention is used without permission. The government may not be stopped from using the patented invention, and damages are typically limited to a \"reasonable royalty.\" Many U.S. trading partners have provisions for compulsory licenses under specific conditions, such as public health needs or inadequate supply of patented inventions. Countries like Brazil, India, South Africa, and Thailand have enacted laws allowing compulsory patent licenses. Brazil, for example, implemented a new industrial property law in response to WTO accession, permitting compulsory licenses for non-exploitation of patented inventions. Brazil implemented a new industrial property law allowing compulsory licenses for non-exploitation of patented inventions. The United States challenged this law at the WTO, claiming it violated TRIPS Agreement requirements. Brazil and the U.S. reached an agreement for talks before granting compulsory licenses on U.S. company patents. In 2007, Brazil issued a compulsory license for the AIDS drug efavirenz, sold by Merck & Co. under the trademark STOCRIN\u00ae. Merck & Co. lowered the price of efavirenz in Brazil after a compulsory license was issued. The Brazilian government has used compulsory licensing threats to negotiate discounts on AIDS therapies. India issued its first compulsory license for sorafenib, sold by Bayer & Co. as NEXAVAR\u00ae, due to insufficient supply, high prices, and lack of local manufacturing. Natco Pharma Ltd. was granted a license to produce a generic version of NEXAVAR\u00ae. The Controller's decision required Natco to pay a 7% royalty to Bayer for manufacturing a generic version of NEXAVAR\u00ae. Indian authorities are considering compulsory licenses for other drugs like HERCPETIN\u00ae, IXEMPRA\u00ae, and SPRYCEL\u00ae. South Africa passed a law allowing compulsory licensing of patented pharmaceuticals, leading to legal challenges. South Africa agreed to redraft its patent statute in line with the TRIPS Agreement and consult with the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry agreed to withdraw a lawsuit. President Clinton issued Executive Order 13,155 to support access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals in sub-Saharan African countries. The South African government found antitrust violations by providers of two patented HIV/AIDS medicines in 2003. In 2003, the South African Competition Commission found antitrust violations by providers of patented HIV/AIDS medicines, leading to compulsory patent licenses for several medications in Thailand from 2006 to 2008. The Thai government issued compulsory licenses for several cancer drugs, including docetaxel, erlotinib, and imitinab. This decision sparked controversy due to Thailand's middle-income status and concerns about TRIPS Agreement compliance. However, public health advocates praised the government for addressing the healthcare needs of its citizens. Supporters of compulsory licenses noted that the TRIPS Agreement allows for liberal rules on issuing such licenses. Under the TRIPS Agreement, compulsory licenses are not limited to patents related to health emergencies but can apply to any patent. Some argue that developing nations with limited ability to pay for medications may benefit from compulsory licenses, while others believe it diminishes incentives for research and development in the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry may be less inclined to develop new drugs if patents are subject to compulsory licenses, impacting expected earnings and potentially the U.S. economy. Developing nations issuing compulsory licenses may hinder research on diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, redirecting resources to more profitable markets. The Public Health Emergency Medicines Act in the 109th Congress proposed creating a compulsory license for patented inventions needed during public health emergencies. The Secretary of Health and Human Services would determine compensation for government use of the invention. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may consider various factors when determining compensation for government use of a patented invention, including risks, costs, efficacy, public health benefits, publicly funded research, incentives for innovation, public interests, and anti-competitive practices. Congress may wish to monitor U.S. trade partners' activity regarding compulsory patent licenses. Concerns were raised over India's issuance of compulsory licenses for certain drugs, driven by interests in growing the pharmaceutical market, which could impact innovation and intellectual property protection in the U.S. economy. The tension between encouraging innovation and public access to patented inventions has led to conflicts among patent-granting states post-WTO era. The role of compulsory licenses in the patent system of the United States and its trading partners is a matter for congressional judgment."
