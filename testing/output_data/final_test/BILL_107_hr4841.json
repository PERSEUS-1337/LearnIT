The Congress finds that the first European exploration of the Hudson River and Lake Champlain, as well as the introduction of steam navigation, were significant historical events leading to early contacts between Native Americans and Europeans in the New World. The establishment of Fort Orange and Dutch and English settlements in what is now the capital city of New York, along with French Quebec settlements as far south as Lake George, had a significant influence on American history, culture, law, commerce, and traditions of liberty. In 1807, Robert Fulton's steamboat CLERMONT successfully inaugurated steam navigation on the Hudson River, revolutionizing waterborne commerce in the United States. The National Park Service in New York owns resources related to the early history of the nation and the Hudson River Valley.
