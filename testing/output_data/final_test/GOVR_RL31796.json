    "content": "The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been a major point of contention regarding government interference with property rights. The debate revolves around the extent to which the ESA restricts the use of privately owned land and whether the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires compensation for property owners. Court decisions show a range of private property impacts under the ESA, beyond just land-use restrictions. However, these decisions do not provide a comprehensive overview of the overall private property impacts of the ESA program. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has sparked debate over government interference with property rights. Court decisions reveal various private property impacts under the ESA, but they do not fully capture the overall effects. The report provides background on ESA's impacts on private property and Fifth Amendment takings law principles, along with summaries of ESA takings decisions. These decisions cover a range of property impacts, including land-use restrictions, but may not encompass all impacts. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has raised concerns about government interference with property rights. Court decisions show various private property impacts under the ESA, with only one case finding a taking. Listing a species as endangered or threatened is the starting point for potential property impacts under the ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows the Secretary to list species without considering economic costs or private property impacts. However, costs and impacts are considered when designating critical habitat. Congress deliberately distinguished between listing and subsequent agency responses to address private property concerns. Listing and critical habitat designation trigger ESA provisions that may affect private property use, such as Section 9 prohibiting certain acts in connection with endangered animals. Section 9 of the Endangered Species Act prohibits certain acts in connection with endangered animals and plants on both private and public land, regardless of critical habitat designation. Prohibited acts for animals include taking, possessing, selling, or transporting unlawfully obtained animals, while for plants, the list is narrower. The term \"take\" is expansively defined to include any act adversely affecting a species member. The Endangered Species Act prohibits harming listed animals, including indirect harm through habitat modifications. Special rules are in place for threatened species with unique management needs. The NMFS applies endangered species prohibitions to threatened species on a case-by-case basis. Experimental populations are treated as threatened species. The ESA allows exemptions from certain provisions to minimize constraints on economic growth. The Endangered Species Act allows exemptions to minimize constraints on economic growth, such as incidental taking permits for lawful activities that may harm listed species. These permits are issued after a habitat conservation plan is submitted, ensuring actions do not significantly impact species survival. The statute also provides an affirmative defense for violations committed in good faith to protect individuals from harm, although a similar defense is not mentioned. The Endangered Species Act provides exemptions to minimize constraints on economic growth, such as incidental taking permits for lawful activities that may harm listed species. It also includes an affirmative defense for violations committed in good faith to protect individuals from harm, but does not mention a similar defense for protecting property. Section 7 of the ESA requires federal agencies to consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure actions do not jeopardize endangered or threatened species or their critical habitat. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with FWS or NMFS to determine the impact of proposed actions on listed species and critical habitat. If jeopardy or adverse modification is found, reasonable alternatives must be suggested. If approved, an incidental take statement is issued, allowing the activity to proceed. The Endangered Species Act allows federal agencies to consult with FWS or NMFS to assess the impact of proposed actions on listed species and critical habitat. An Endangered Species Committee, known as the God Squad, can exempt federal actions from the section 7 mandate if no reasonable alternatives exist and the benefits outweigh conservation efforts. This exemption process is rarely used and was enhanced during the Clinton Administration to increase flexibility. During the Clinton Administration, efforts were made to enhance flexibility in dealing with property owners under the Endangered Species Act. Policies were implemented to streamline permit procedures for small landowners and encourage increased protection for listed species on their land. Safe harbor agreements allowed landowners to return to baseline conditions without penalty after increasing species habitat, and no surprises agreements ensured no further costs or land use restrictions for implementing a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). Federal managers also leaned towards threatened rather than endangered designations to utilize more flexible ESA provisions for threatened species. The Endangered Species Act includes special rules for authorizing takes of problem animals causing property damage, often carried out by government officials. Despite impact-softening mechanisms, the act can frustrate property owners economically, leading to arguments about property rights under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The \"Takings Clause\" of the Fifth Amendment addresses the issue of private property being taken for public use without just compensation. This clause has gained attention due to increased government land use controls and a more conservative judiciary. It aims to balance society's needs with the burdens imposed on individual property owners. The courts have developed principles for determining when a government action constitutes a Fifth Amendment taking of private property, requiring compensation for the owner. When filing a taking claim against the United States under the ESA, it must be done in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims if seeking over $10,000 and within six years of the alleged taking. The claim must also be ripe, meaning a final decision from the government agency regarding property restrictions must be obtained. This process may involve reapplying with modified proposals after an initial rejection. In the ESA context, a taking claim is not ripe until an ITP has been applied for and usually denied. Denial of the ITP is not always necessary for ripeness, especially if further negotiations with the federal agency are not needed or if there is an \"extraordinary\" delay in granting or denying the ITP. However, courts have not excused a plaintiff's failure to apply for an ITP yet. An agency's determination that a property owner's proposal requires an ITP application does not constitute a taking, as the permit may still be granted if applied for. The Takings Clause demands that the alleged taken property is considered \"property.\" Common interests in land are typically seen as property, including water rights. Takings law only considers direct impacts on the property, not indirect effects. There are three types of takings claims, each evaluated under a different Supreme Court test, which could arise in the ESA context. Regulatory takings claims under the ESA context can be categorized into total elimination of use or value, known as a total taking claim, or a partial regulatory taking claim. The concept asserts that government actions can restrict property use to the point of being considered a taking, even without physical occupation. Total elimination is generally seen as a per se taking, with exceptions based on background principles of property law. The government's actions can restrict property use to the point of being considered a taking, even without physical occupation. Total elimination of use or value is generally seen as a per se taking, with exceptions based on background principles of property law. Claims for less-than-total losses are more common and are evaluated using a fact-intensive approach known as the \"Penn Central balancing test.\" This approach considers the economic impact, interference with investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action. The Penn Central balancing test evaluates regulatory takings claims based on economic impact, interference with investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action. The test is criticized for being vague and easily manipulated, leading to the rejection of the majority of claims. The government-friendly pattern is also seen in ESA-takings cases, where the species-preservation goal of the ESA is not given special consideration in the takings calculus. The court must define the \"parcel as a whole\" for both total and partial regulatory takings claims. The relevant parcel notion is crucial in takings law to measure the impact of government action. It includes the entire contiguous lot in the same ownership, with noncontiguous lots thrown in if part of an integrated development. The relevant parcel cannot be limited to the portion of the property subject to the challenged use restriction. The Supreme Court has clarified that a regulation reducing use or value on only a portion of a property is unlikely to be considered a taking. The relevant parcel factor has limited ESA-based takings claims, as property owners with restrictions on part of their land still have economic use of the rest. The Court has also rejected the \"notice rule\" for takings claims, stating that restrictions imposed under laws existing when the property was acquired may still be considered a taking. This change is significant for the ESA, which was enacted long ago. The Supreme Court has clarified that a regulation reducing use or value on only a portion of a property is unlikely to be considered a taking. The relevant parcel factor has limited ESA-based takings claims, as property owners with restrictions on part of their land still have economic use of the rest. The Court has also rejected the \"notice rule\" for takings claims, stating that restrictions imposed under laws existing when the property was acquired may still be considered a taking. This easing of the notice rule is significant for the ESA, enacted in 1973, as most landowners today might be barred from claiming takings under the former, absolute rule. Regulatory takings claims are treated differently depending on whether the restriction giving rise to the alleged taking was initially deemed to be permanent or temporary. If an initially permanent government restriction is ultimately withdrawn or judicially invalidated, the analysis of whether it worked a taking while on the books is unaffected. The termination of the restriction nominally changes the permanent taking claim to a temporary one, but its only real effect is to limit the amount of compensation. Land use restrictions were lifted in some ESA cases once listed birds were found no longer present in an area. Physical takings involve the government causing a physical invasion on property, either permanently occupying or temporarily invading it. Permanent physical occupations are almost always considered takings as they violate the right to exclude others. In these cases, the extent of the occupation or economic impact is not considered, unlike in regulatory takings analysis. Physical takings involve the government causing a physical invasion on property, either permanently occupying or temporarily invading it. Takings plaintiffs often try to bring a physical occupation claim, such as required physical diversions for environmental purposes or the temporary presence of federal investigators. Temporary physical invasions are tested under the Penn Central balancing test and are generally considered nontakings. These claims are common in cases involving the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The exaction taking claim asserts a taking based on an exaction demanded by a land regulatory agency as a condition of approving a development proposal. The condition must have an \"essential nexus\" to the permit's purpose and be \"roughly proportional\" to the development's impact. The government bears the burden of proving rough proportionality, placing a greater burden on them than for regulatory takings. This is known as \"heightened scrutiny.\" The Supreme Court has clarified that not any condition attached to a development permit can ground an exaction taking claim. Lower courts have split on whether an exaction taking claim can be based on a monetary exaction, and the issue is now before the Supreme Court. Conditions in submitted HCPs could be subject to exaction taking challenge, including dedications of acreage or commitment to purchase mitigation credits. In practice, exaction takings challenges to HCP conditions are rare. One case involved a developer buying land near a wildlife refuge designated as critical habitat for an endangered species. The developer sold a portion of the land and later faced challenges related to mitigation conditions on development approval. In a case involving a developer selling land near a wildlife refuge, the developer faced challenges related to mitigation conditions imposed by the Navy for the sale of the remainder of the land. The Navy required the developer to purchase and transfer 77 acres to the FWS for inclusion in the Refuge in order to mitigate the loss of critical habitat for the Sandhill Crane. The developer claimed this mitigation condition was a taking, but the court held that the property interest asserted was mischaracterized by the trial court. The trial court initially mischaracterized the property interest in a case involving a developer selling land near a wildlife refuge to the Navy. The developer's right to develop the remainder parcel was the actual property interest alleged to have been taken, which is cognizable under the Takings Clause. The trial court must conduct a Penn Central analysis on the taking claim regarding the right to develop, considering the plaintiff's knowledge of the pre-purchase designation of critical habitat. Additionally, there is a ripeness issue concerning the FWS's evaluation of the remainder parcel. The trial court found the taking claim to lack final-decision ripeness, as plaintiff had not applied for an ESA incidental take permit. The case was dismissed with prejudice because the plaintiff no longer owned the property. Even if the claim had been ripe, it would have been difficult to prove a Penn Central regulatory taking. The absence of ESA mitigation requirement is not grounds for a taking. The eight acres sold prior to the sale to the Navy may be considered part of the parcel for takings analysis. Recent court rulings have found no taking based on pre-acquisition environmental restrictions. The pre-acquisition regulatory regime does not categorically prevent a court from finding a taking, as seen in Palazzolo v. Rhode Island. Lower courts have given weight to pre-acquisition laws in takings analysis. In Mead v. City of Cotati, the plaintiff applied to build duplexes on land subject to mitigation conditions for an endangered species. Plaintiff's consultant determined that for each acre of a nearby salamander breeding site affected by development, one acre of land must be dedicated to habitat conservation. The claim of a taking based on mitigation requirements is deemed unripe as the landowner did not obtain a final decision on permitted land uses or conduct a survey for salamander presence. The landowner has not received a final determination from FWS on whether salamander mitigation requirements apply to his land. The court assumes the affordable housing requirement claim is ripe and proceeds to the taking question. The landowner's claim is dismissed as he has not alleged sufficient facts for a Penn Central claim. In another case, plaintiffs sought to harvest timber for personal use but faced restrictions due to state and county land-use regulations. Plaintiffs were informed that harvesting trees on their property would harm listed salmon, requiring them to apply for an ITP and prepare a HCP. However, they believed the cost would exceed the value of their property and filed a taking claim instead. The court found the claim not ripe as there was no final agency decision on the cost of the application, and the agency had discretion to assist with the process. The court found the plaintiffs' taking claim not ripe as there was no final agency decision on the cost of the application, and the agency had discretion to assist with the process. This decision reflects the judicial insistence that a taking claim based on a federal permit requirement must engage in the permit application and negotiation process to be considered ripe. In Seiber v. United States, plaintiffs owned a 200-acre tract with 40 acres designated as spotted owl nesting habitat. They applied for an ITP under the federal ESA but it was denied. The FWS suggested alternative options, but plaintiffs only sought reconsideration. Eventually, Oregon and FWS no longer required an ITP due to the owls moving away. The court found that the plaintiffs' claim for compensation for a temporary taking from 2000 to 2002 was ripe but ultimately ruled that there was no taking. The court assumed that logging was barred by the federal ESA during the alleged taking period, which is necessary for a federal taking to occur. The FWS identified alternative options that the plaintiffs did not pursue, and the court determined that there was no physical or regulatory taking as the government action did not deprive the relevant parcel of all economic value. The court ruled that there was no economic injury caused by the temporary taking, and no regulatory taking by failing to advance a legitimate government interest. The case highlighted the issue of defining the \"relevant parcel\" and whether timber could be considered separately from the land it grew on. Boise Cascade Corp. v. United States, 296 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002) involved a dispute over logging in an old-growth tract in Oregon that could harm spotted owls. A court injunction prevented logging until an Incidental Take Permit (ITP) was obtained. When no owls were found in the area, the ITP requirement was lifted, and the injunction was lifted. Boise sought compensation for the temporary taking of its timber but the court ruled it was not a regulatory taking as the company was only enjoined from logging without a permit. The regulatory agency did not effect a regulatory taking in the case of Boise Cascade Corp. v. United States. The presence of spotted owls on the land was not considered a physical taking, but rather a regulatory restriction on logging. The court's decision aligned with previous rulings on challenges to wildlife protections. In Taylor v. United States, a plaintiff wanted to build a house on his residential-zoned lot but was informed by the FWS that land clearing and construction could harm nesting bald eagles nearby. The plaintiff was required to apply for an ITP for house construction, but declined due to overly restrictive mitigation demands. The claim was deemed ripe, but not a \"total taking.\" In Taylor v. United States, the court held that there was no total taking as the ESA development restrictions did not deprive the plaintiff's property of all economic value. The parties need to provide more evidence to determine if a partial regulatory taking occurred. Ultimately, an ITP was issued to Mr. Taylor, settling the case in April 2002. In Good v. United States, plaintiff purchased a 40-acre wetlands tract in Florida Keys in 1973 and sought permits to build a residential subdivision starting in 1980. Despite receiving wetlands permits from the Corps of Engineers, construction was delayed due to state, local permitting, and ESA issues. The final permit application was denied in 1994, citing endangered species concerns. The plaintiff claimed a total taking, but the court ruled it was not a taking as economic use was not completely barred. The plaintiff in Good v. United States purchased a wetlands tract in 1973 and sought permits to build a residential subdivision starting in 1980. The court ruled that the plaintiff could not claim a total taking as economic use was not completely barred. To support a claim, a property owner must show that his reasonable investment-backed expectations were frustrated. The plaintiff's delay in applying for permits and changing wetlands protection laws reduced his ability to claim surprise when the permit application was denied. The government can restrict property use under existing laws, even if acquired before the law was enacted. In Good v. United States, the plaintiff bought wetlands before the ESA was enacted. The court ruled that investment-backed expectations are relevant to total-taking claims. However, a later case held that expectations are irrelevant to total-taking claims. Since then, the Court of Federal Claims and Federal Circuit have generally followed the decisions in Palm Beach Isles. In Palm Beach Isles, Court decisions have generally followed the approach. Cane Tennessee, Inc. v. United States upheld the deletion of an area from a timber sale contract by the U.S. Forest Service due to the discovery of a northern spotted owl nest. The court ruled it was not a taking as the Forest Service did not abrogate any obligations under the contract. In a contract dispute, a party sought to exercise its rights under the contract and was held to be bound by it. Plaintiffs alleged coercion by the United States to prevent commercial construction for bird protection, but the claim was deemed not ripe as they had not applied for necessary permits. The plaintiffs seek court approval for their development without ESA restrictions, but the court will not preempt the FWS's responsibility. In Aloisi v. United States, plaintiff seeks to mine in Klamath National Forest but claims delays in consultation process notification. The plaintiff was not notified of the Forest Service's opinion until March 1992, leading to a second consultation with the FWS in 1994. Despite administrative delays from 1990 to 1994, the court ruled that there was no taking as the delays were not deemed extraordinary. The court ruled that the delays from 1990 to 1994 were not extraordinary, despite administrative delays in the consultation process. Takings claims based on administrative delays are difficult to win without government bad faith. In Wyatt v. United States, the court found that a taking based on extraordinary delay without bad faith is rare. Despite delays in the consultation process from 1990 to 1994, takings claims are difficult to win without government bad faith. The Casitas Municipal Water District v. United States case involved a reduction in irrigation water allowed to be diverted from a river, following the listing of West Coast steelhead trout as endangered in 1997. The water district requested revised operating criteria to augment river flow for the endangered fish. The Casitas Municipal Water District had to forego its water right to divert water for irrigation to help endangered fish. Water diverted by a dam was redirected back to the river for fish passage. The government argued it was a regulatory taking, not a physical one. The government's diversion of water away from the canal to the fish ladder reduced Casitas's water supply, constituting a physical taking. The argument that the U.S. did not divert the water for its own use is rejected, as habitat preservation benefits the government and the public. The distinction between regulatory and physical takings in previous cases is deemed irrelevant. The taking claim was found not ripe on remand, and California law did not preclude the water district's claim. The water district's claim of a taking was dismissed as unripe since the required diversions for fish protection did not significantly impact the district's water supply. The distinction between physical and regulatory takings is crucial in determining the outcome of such cases. In the Casitas appeal, the Federal Circuit addressed the Supreme Court's Tahoe-Sierra decision, reaffirming the classification of physical diversions as takings. The case is now back in the Federal Circuit on appeal from the remand decision. In another case, Klamath Irrigation District v. United States, a reduction in irrigation contract water delivery by the United States during a drought in 2001 led to a legal dispute. In Klamath Irrigation District v. United States, during a drought in 2001, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation stopped delivering irrigation water from its Klamath Project to protect fish species. Plaintiffs, including agricultural landowners and water districts, sued the United States for taking their water rights. The Federal Circuit later certified the case due to complex Oregon property law issues. The court certified three questions of Oregon property law to the state's high court in response to complex issues in the Klamath Irrigation District v. United States case. The Oregon Supreme Court's answers necessitated further proceedings, clarifying that districts can acquire a beneficial interest in Klamath Project water, but beneficial use alone is not sufficient to gain a property interest in water rights. Plaintiffs can assert beneficial interests in water held by the United States under Oregon law. The case involving Klamath Project water rights is remanded to the Court of Federal Claims for further determination based on Oregon Supreme Court's answers. The takings claims and breach of contract claims are to be reconsidered on a case-by-case basis. The Court of Federal Claims' previous decisions on these claims are vacated. During a drought in 1992-1994, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation reduced water pumping from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to protect fish species under the ESA. This led to reduced water availability for the California State Water Project, affecting water delivery to plaintiffs with contracts. The court ruled it was a taking of the plaintiffs' water rights due to the reduction, as their contracts granted exclusive use of specific water quantities. The federal government's actions during the 1992-1994 drought were deemed a physical taking of water rights from plaintiffs with contracts, as their exclusive use of specific water quantities was affected. The state's background principles of law did not limit plaintiffs' rights defined by their contracts. In 2004, a settlement was reached for $16.7 million without admission of liability by the United States. The Tulare Lake case involved ESA-based cutbacks in irrigation water delivery, leading to a court decision that found a taking. The court's rationale included controversial conclusions, such as a regulatory restriction constituting a physical taking. The Department of Justice received letters from other government agencies regarding the case. The Tulare Lake case involved ESA-based cutbacks in irrigation water delivery, leading to a court decision that found a taking. The Department of Justice received letters from various government agencies urging them not to settle but to appeal. Several Members of California's congressional delegation also took public positions on the proper course of action. The decision in the Tulare Lake case was criticized by three later decisions. During a drought in 1993-1994, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation reduced water delivery to certain users in California to protect endangered fish species. Landowners and water users in the Westlands Water District received up to 50% less water than usual. The decision to reduce water delivery was later criticized in court. Westlands Water District received 50% less water during a drought in 1993-1994. Court held no taking of contract rights despite modification under ESA. Livestock killed by wolves, court found no jurisdiction for compensation. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over taking claims against the United States under the Tucker Act. In the case of livestock killed by predators, such as grizzly bears, the availability of Tucker Act remedies is upheld. Christy shot a grizzly bear attacking his sheep in Montana, leading to a legal dispute over compensation for the livestock losses. The FWS's unsuccessful efforts to catch the bears resulted in Christy losing 84 sheep. He was fined $2,500 for killing a threatened grizzly bear. The court ruled it was not a taking by the government as the losses were incidental to reasonable regulation. Christy's case remains significant in government limits on defensive actions against wildlife. Christy's case remains significant in government limits on defensive actions against wildlife, with Justice White questioning if government limits on protecting property from animals are constitutional takings. Later court decisions have not followed this line of analysis. In United States v. Kepler, the defendant transported endangered species for lawful purposes under the ESA but was arrested when he transported two animals to a zoo in Kentucky. In United States v. Kepler, the defendant transported endangered species for lawful purposes under the ESA but was arrested when he transported two animals to a zoo in Kentucky. He was convicted of violating the ESA ban against interstate transport of endangered species in the course of a commercial activity. The ESA does not prevent all sales of endangered wildlife, only those in interstate or foreign commerce. Kepler could have sold the animals in Florida, and ESA section 10 allows interstate transport or sale of endangered animals if approved for scientific purposes. The remaining uses of the animals deflect the taking claim. In a criminal indictment, Hill was charged with selling parts of endangered species in violation of wildlife protection statutes. He argued that these statutes constituted an unconstitutional taking of his property interest, but the court disagreed, stating that he had not been denied all economic use of his property. The ESA allows for the sale of endangered species with a permit, and since Hill acquired the animal parts when they were already subject to ESA regulations, he had no property right to sell them. The court ruled that Hill had no property right to sell the endangered species parts, based on the ESA regulations. This decision was influenced by the Andrus v. Allard case, which dealt with wildlife protection laws and the limitations on commercial transactions involving bird parts. The court found that while the ban on selling the parts restricted the most profitable use, other uses like possession, transport, donation, or exhibition were still allowed."
