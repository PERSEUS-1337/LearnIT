    "content": "The Medicaid statute requires states to provide EPSDT services to eligible children and report annually using the CMS-416 form. Data from FY2006 showed low utilization of dental services among Medicaid children, with varying rates across states. In FY2006, Medicaid children had low utilization of dental services, with rates ranging from 6.7% to 51.0% across states. Physicians can educate parents about the importance of dental services during routine visits, with initial referrals recommended at age three or earlier if needed. Utilization patterns for preventive dental services showed a bell-shaped curve across age groups in all reporting states. Among children aged six to nine, the highest rates of preventive dental care were observed in 10 states, with Vermont meeting the Healthy People 2010 goal of 66% coverage. This age group benefits from school entry requirements for immunizations, which often lead to referrals for dental care. Many states acknowledge the underutilization of dental services among Medicaid recipients. Many states recognize underutilization of dental care among Medicaid recipients. State officials and representatives from Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia, along with the dental profession, recommended increasing dental reimbursement rates, removing administrative barriers, carving out dental benefits from managed care contracts, and involving dentists in designing new dental program features. When designing new dental program features, involve dentists and professional dental organizations; establish dedicated dental units in state governments to guide policy decisions; establish \"dental extenders\" to increase service capacity, including primary care medical professionals for oral evaluation and risk assessment, counseling for parents, and application of fluorides, and other allied dental providers for community outreach, education, and preventive services. States can learn from these experiences and recommendations to expand access to dental care under Medicaid. Provider groups have varying opinions on non-dentists providing dental services, which states may need to address. States may need to address issues to expand access to dental care under Medicaid for children and other sub-groups."
