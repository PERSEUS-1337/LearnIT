    "content": "The \"Fairness to Pet Owners Act of 2014\" applies to medication for domesticated household animals that require a prescription from the Federal Government. The Federal Trade Commission must establish rules within 180 days of the Act's enactment regarding veterinary prescriptions, including requirements for prescribers to provide a copy of the prescription to pet owners and pharmacies upon request. The prescriber of an animal drug cannot require the purchase of the drug from them or another person as a condition of providing a copy of the veterinary prescription. They also cannot require additional payment for the prescription beyond the fee for an examination and evaluation. The prescriber of an animal drug cannot require the purchase of the drug from them or another person as a condition of providing a copy of the veterinary prescription. They also cannot require additional payment for the prescription beyond the fee for an examination and evaluation. The prescriber may require payment for an examination and evaluation before providing a veterinary prescription, but only if immediate payment is needed in cases where no animal drug is required. The prescriber may not require the pet owner to sign a waiver or disclaim liability as a condition of providing or verifying the prescription. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. Violations of rules under this Act are treated as violations of unfair or deceptive practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC enforces this Act in the same manner as its own regulations. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"animal drug,\" \"domesticated household animal,\" \"pet owner,\" \"prescriber,\" and \"veterinary prescription.\" Veterinary prescription is a written, oral, or electronic order authorizing the dispensing of an animal drug for domesticated household animals, issued in accordance with State and Federal law, excluding drugs administered by the veterinarian during acute care."
