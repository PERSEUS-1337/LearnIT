    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Active Community Transportation Act of 2010\". Congress acknowledges the importance of active transportation, noting that a significant number of trips in the US can be made by walking or biking within a short distance. They highlight the success of communities with complete streets policies in promoting safe and convenient travel for all users. Additionally, investments in active transportation infrastructure lead to increased rates of walking and biking, enhancing community livability. Increased use of active transportation leads to reductions in traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, vehicle miles traveled, oil dependence, air pollution, and obesity. Achieving a mode shift to active transportation requires concentrated funding of interconnected systems within communities. Funding active transportation is a strategic and cost-effective Federal investment that aligns with national policy goals. The Act defines active transportation as human-powered mobility options like biking and walking, and an Indian tribe as defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The program refers to the active transportation investment program established under section 4. The Secretary of Transportation will implement an active transportation investment program to promote biking and walking for routine travel in selected communities. Communities must apply to participate, and the Secretary will select initial communities for the program in fiscal years 2011 through 2015. The Secretary will select additional communities to participate in the active transportation investment program in fiscal years 2013 through 2015 based on criteria including the development of walking and biking infrastructure. The active transportation investment program selects communities based on criteria such as broad community support, cohesive plans, regulatory incentives, and matching funds commitment. The active transportation investment program selects communities based on criteria such as broad community support, cohesive plans, regulatory incentives, and matching funds commitment. Projects eligible for assistance include strategic priorities like creating a network of active transportation facilities connecting neighborhoods with destinations and integrating them with transit services to improve access. The program aims to provide safe, convenient, and cost-effective mobility through walking and biking. Community support indicators include public input in transportation plans and leaders' commitment to project success. Grants are provided to selected communities for program participation. The program provides grants to local organizations, special districts, and tribes to promote biking and walking. Recipients can allocate funds to nonprofits. Four communities with pilot funding aim to shift towards biking and walking. The program provides grants to communities for active transportation, with grant amounts ranging from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 per fiscal year. The Secretary may justify larger grants based on population served and opportunities. Eligible Projects for grants under this program include constructing networks of active transportation infrastructure, providing bicycle facilities like cycle tracks and sharing stations, and upgrading existing infrastructure. The program supports projects for active transportation infrastructure, educational activities, safety initiatives, and technical assistance. The Secretary will track changes in motor vehicle, active transportation, and public transportation usage, assess impacts on congestion, energy usage, biking, walking, health, safety, and the environment. Progress will be measured through public engagement, educational outcomes, and project development. The Secretary will publish a request for applications within 60 days of the Act's enactment. Initial communities will be selected within 180 days, and additional communities by September 30, 2012. Grants will be provided for selected communities to participate in the program. The Secretary will submit interim and final reports to Congress on the progress of the program by September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2016 respectively. The Secretary's findings on best practices and impediments in communities participating in the program will be included in reports to Congress. Funding of $300 million for fiscal years 2011 and 2012, and $466.67 million for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 is authorized from the Highway Trust Fund. The funds appropriated under this section will be available for obligation and administered similarly to funds apportioned under title 23, US Code. The Federal share of project costs will be 100%, funds will not expire, and are non-transferable. The Secretary will set aside up to 1.5% of funds for administrative costs, including research and training activities. The Secretary may also enter into contracts with for-profit organizations. The Secretary may enter into contracts with for-profit organizations, government agencies, higher learning institutions, or nonprofit organizations to perform activities with funds set aside. The Federal share of costs can be up to 100%. Communities are not prohibited from receiving research funds under title 23 or 49, US Code. Noninfrastructure projects and infrastructure projects not involving construction assisted under this subsection are treated differently. The Secretary will develop regulations for Federal-aid projects to encourage the use of programmatic categorical exclusion and expedited procurement techniques for small, low impact projects within existing built environments. Collaboration with State departments of transportation will ensure implementation of these regulations. The Secretary will develop regulations for Federal-aid projects to encourage the use of programmatic categorical exclusion and expedited procurement techniques for small, low impact projects within existing built environments. States and the Federal Highway Administration are consistently implementing these regulations to avoid delays and ensure efficient use of Federal funds. Additionally, the Secretary may enter into agreements with eligible Indian tribes under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to carry out the purposes of this Act."
