The Elder Serve Act of 2008 acknowledges the increasing elderly population and the prevalence of abuse and neglect among older Americans. It highlights the widespread nature of elder abuse, with many cases going unreported. According to the most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics report, 90% of elder abuse incidents involve known perpetrators, often family members, with 2/3 of cases involving adult children or spouses. Establishment of Elder Serve Coordinating Councils Pilot Programs. The Attorney General will establish a three-year grant program called the Elder Serve Coordinating Councils grant program to provide grants to eligible entities for pilot programs to assist victims of elder abuse. To be eligible for a grant, an entity must be a crime victim assistance program receiving a grant under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984. The entity seeking a grant must demonstrate community coordination and the ability to create an Emergency Crisis Response Team program within 6 months of receiving the grant. They must provide a record of community coordination for each year they receive the grant. The pilot program must demonstrate community coordination through various documentation and consult with specific entities including Elder Serve Incorporated of Louisville, relevant public and private agencies, and local law enforcement. The Program involves various stakeholders like corrections personnel, prosecutors, medical examiners, investigators, and coroners, as well as long term care and nursing facilities. Grants are issued for a three-year period in six diverse locations, considering the elderly population and access to housing and health services for elder abuse victims. Pilot programs may employ staff to create Emergency Crisis Response Teams. Grants are used for providing care and services. The Emergency Crisis Response Teams program funded by grants aims to provide immediate services like shelter, care, food, and transportation to elder abuse victims referred for assistance. The program provides short-term housing for elder abuse victims referred by law enforcement agencies, with a limit of five consecutive days. The entity must collaborate with local law enforcement to receive weekly reports on elder abuse. Within a year of receiving a grant, the entity must establish additional programs and community collaborations to support elder abuse victims. Programs and community collaborations to support elder abuse victims include counseling, mental health screening, emergency legal advocacy, and job placement assistance. These programs aim to provide assistance for victims accessing benefits and identifying mental health disorders. The program provides job placement assistance, bereavement counseling, and other services for victims of elder abuse. Additionally, technical assistance is offered to grantees, and regular reports to Congress are required.
