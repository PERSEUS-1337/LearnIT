The \"Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2009\" allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for charitable purposes, with specific age requirements for qualified charitable distributions. The \"Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2009\" allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for charitable purposes, with specific age requirements for qualified charitable distributions. A distribution to a split-interest entity must have no person holding an income interest other than the individual, their spouse, or a qualifying organization described in section 170(c). Contributions must be deductible for the distribution to be considered a qualified charitable distribution to an organization described in section 170(c). The \"Public Good IRA Rollover Act of 2009\" allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts for charitable purposes, with specific age requirements for qualified charitable distributions. A distribution to a split-interest entity must have no person holding an income interest other than the individual, their spouse, or a qualifying organization described in section 170(c). Contributions must be deductible for the distribution to be considered a qualified charitable distribution to an organization described in section 170(c). In determining the extent of a distribution, a deduction for the entire value of the interest for the use of an organization described in section 170(c) must be allowable. In determining if a distribution is a qualified charitable distribution, the entire amount shall be included in gross income if it does not exceed the total amount that would have been included if all individual retirement plans were distributed as one contract. Adjustments will be made for other distributions in the taxable year and subsequent years. Special rules apply to distributions from split-interest entities like charitable remainder trusts and pooled income funds. Distributions from these trusts are treated as ordinary income for the beneficiary. Amounts given to a pooled income fund as a qualified charitable distribution are not included in gross income. Qualified charitable distributions made for charitable gift annuities are not considered as an investment in the contract. These distributions are not deductible under section 170. A split-interest entity, for this purpose, refers to certain charitable entities. The term 'split-interest entity' includes charitable remainder annuity trusts, charitable remainder unitrusts, pooled income funds, and charitable gift annuities. The amendment applies to distributions after December 31, 2008."
