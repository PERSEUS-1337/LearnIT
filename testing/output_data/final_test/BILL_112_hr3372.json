    "content": "The \"Dairy Pricing Deregulation Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes reform of federal milk marketing orders. The Dairy Pricing Deregulation Act amends the Terms and Conditions of Milk and Milk Products Orders under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, specifying uniform differentials for handlers of milk used for fluid purposes. The Dairy Pricing Deregulation Act amends the Terms and Conditions of Milk and Milk Products Orders under the Agricultural Adjustment Act by providing for payment to all milk producers delivering milk to regulated handlers, based on volume of delivered milk. The Dairy Pricing Deregulation Act allows cooperative marketing associations under the Capper-Volstead Act to blend proceeds from milk sales and distribute them to producers. Adjustments in payments by handlers do not have to be the same. The Dairy Pricing Deregulation Act allows cooperative marketing associations to blend proceeds from milk sales and distribute them to producers. Handlers may adjust payments differently under different paragraphs. Milk handlers subject to fluid milk differential requirements must comply with Federal milk marketing orders if they package fluid milk products in states with minimum raw milk purchase prices. The Dairy Pricing Deregulation Act requires handlers of Class I milk products to pay minimum prices for raw milk purchases in Federal order milk marketing areas. The Dairy Pricing Deregulation Act exempts certain handlers from the obligation to pay minimum class prices or fluid milk differentials for raw milk purchases if they are not regulated by a Federal milk marketing order. The Dairy Pricing Deregulation Act exempts certain handlers from paying minimum class prices for raw milk purchases if they operate a nonpool plant, have route dispositions of less than 3,000,000 pounds of milk, or receive less than 25 percent of fluid milk products at the plant. The Dairy Pricing Deregulation Act exempts handlers with route dispositions of less than 3,000,000 pounds of milk or receiving less than 25 percent of fluid milk products at the plant from paying minimum class prices for raw milk purchases. The Dairy Pricing Deregulation Act exempts handlers distributing Class I milk products in the marketing area from fluid milk differentials if their own farm production exceeds 3,000,000 pounds. The Secretary of Agriculture fixes differential payments to producers in marketing agreements related to milk products. The Dairy Pricing Deregulation Act establishes differential payments for milk used for fluid purposes, based on federal milk marketing orders from January 1, 2011. These differentials will decrease by 20% each year and will be discontinued in the fifth year after the Act's effective date. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 is amended to include non-fluid milk handlers supplying milk to fluid milk handlers. The Secretary of Agriculture will use notice and comment procedures to implement the amendments. Surveys will be conducted to publish data on payments made by milk handlers on a national and regional basis. Surveys will be conducted on a regional basis with mandatory participation by handlers. The amendments made by this Act will take effect on the first day of the first month one year after the Act's enactment."
