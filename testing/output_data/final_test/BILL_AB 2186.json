    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 647 of the Penal Code is amended to include disorderly conduct as a misdemeanor for soliciting or engaging in lewd conduct in public places. Section 647 of the Penal Code is amended to include disorderly conduct as a misdemeanor for soliciting or engaging in lewd conduct in public places. This includes soliciting or engaging in acts of prostitution and accosting others in public places for begging or soliciting alms. The Penal Code section 647 now includes disorderly conduct as a misdemeanor for various offenses such as loitering in public toilets, lodging without permission, and being under the influence of substances in a way that endangers oneself or others. When a person violates subdivision (f) of Penal Code section 647, a peace officer must place them in civil protective custody for 72-hour treatment and evaluation at a designated facility. This can be done with the same force as a misdemeanor arrest without a warrant. The individual placed in custody cannot be prosecuted for the incident. This does not apply to those under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Any person who a peace officer has probable cause to believe has committed a felony or misdemeanor, or who may attempt escape or be difficult for medical personnel to control, or who loiters, prowls, or wanders on private property without lawful business, or peeks into inhabited buildings while loitering. Any person who uses any instrumentality to view the interior of private areas where individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy with the intent to invade their privacy. This does not apply to areas used for counting currency or negotiable instruments in private businesses. Using a concealed camera to secretly record someone under their clothing without their consent, with the intent to satisfy sexual desires and invade their privacy in a situation where they expect privacy. Any person who uses a concealed camera to secretly record another person in a state of undress without their consent, in a private area where privacy is expected, with the intent to invade their privacy. Any person who intentionally distributes intimate images of another identifiable person without consent, causing serious emotional distress to the victim. This includes images of sexual acts or masturbation, and the distribution can be done personally or through arranging someone else to distribute the images. The distribution of intimate images without consent can cause serious emotional distress to the victim. An intimate body part is defined as any portion of the genitals, anus, and for females, any portion of the breasts below the top of the areola. Exceptions to this include distribution for reporting unlawful activity, compliance with a court order, or in a lawful public proceeding. This does not prevent punishment under other laws with greater penalties. In cases of repeat violations of distributing intimate images without consent, the defendant must serve a minimum of 45 days in county jail, regardless of probation or parole. The court cannot waive this requirement. Violating the subdivision absolves a person from spending at least 45 days in county jail. If a defendant is convicted multiple times of a violation, each previous conviction must be charged. If found true, the defendant must serve a minimum of 90 days in county jail before being eligible for release or probation. The court cannot absolve the defendant from this requirement. The court cannot absolve a person who violates this subdivision from spending at least 90 days in confinement in a county jail. The court may suspend a person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle for up to 30 days for violating certain sections of the Vehicle Code. Alternatively, the court may restrict the person's driving privileges to necessary travel for up to six months. A second offense can result in up to one year in jail or a fine of up to $2,000. If a crime is committed in violation of soliciting a minor, the punishment includes imprisonment in a county jail for up to one year or a fine of up to $10,000. In unusual cases, the court may reduce or eliminate the mandatory two days of imprisonment in a county jail if it serves the interests of justice. The court must specify the reason on the record."
