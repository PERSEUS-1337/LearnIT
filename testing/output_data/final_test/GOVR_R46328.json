    "content": "Significant recent flood events have led to interest in reducing flood risk and improving resilience. Traditional options like levees and dams are used, but there is also support for natural features like floodplains and coastal wetlands. Congress has directed the US Army Corps of Engineers to consider natural and nature-based features in flood risk reduction activities. The US Army Corps of Engineers is directed by Congress to consider natural and nature-based features for flood risk reduction. While these features can provide benefits, they may not always replicate the risk reduction of traditional measures. Incorporating natural features into flood risk management is a growing area of policy and research. Identifying where to use these features and determining their effectiveness is a key challenge. The US Army Corps of Engineers is exploring the use of natural and nature-based features (NNBFs) for flood risk reduction. Congress has authorized consideration of NNBFs, but their use by USACE remains limited. Congressional hearings have highlighted interest in utilizing NNBFs for managing flood risks and improving resilience. Reports requested by Congress on NNBFs may inform future deliberations on authorization and appropriations. USACE considers NNBFs to include wetlands, reefs, forests, and engineered components like rock gabions and concrete reef balls. Efforts to enhance floodwater management involve restoring natural features like mangroves and reefs that act as buffers against erosion and storm surge. The report introduces NNBFs in the context of USACE flood risk reduction activities, discussing their relation to USACE authorities for flood-related projects and repair programs. Challenges and opportunities for incorporating NNBFs in flood risk reduction efforts are addressed, along with questions about their future use. USACE has a long history of reducing flood risk through building dams and levees. The agency's early efforts involved building dams and levees along rivers. In the mid-20th century, Congress directed USACE to work on coastal storm risk reduction projects, including engineered dunes and beaches, storm surge gates, and levees. Congressional direction has evolved to include nonstructural alternatives for flood risk reduction, with a focus on NNBFs since the mid-2010s. Experts have encouraged the use of nonstructural approaches, such as elevation of structures and acquisition of floodplain lands, to mitigate flooding. In 2016, Congress defined nonstructural alternatives for flood control works to include natural resource restoration. USACE's Engineering With Nature initiative explores aligning natural processes for flood risk reduction. USACE's Engineering With Nature initiative, started in 2010, aligns natural and engineering processes in project planning. In 2015, NNBF concepts were incorporated into the North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study in response to Hurricane Sandy. Congress directed USACE in the WIIN Act of 2016 to consider NNBFs in water resource project planning, marking the first use of these terms in USACE authorities. The Act also required evaluation of NNBFs for flood risk reduction and ecosystem restoration projects. Additionally, Congress mandated consideration of natural features, nature-based features, nonstructural measures, and structural measures in USACE planning. In 2018, feasibility reports for flood risk reduction projects were required to consider the use of NNBFs. The USACE Engineering With Nature initiative integrates natural and engineering processes in project planning. NNBF concepts were included in the North Atlantic Coast Comprehensive Study after Hurricane Sandy. The WIIN Act of 2016 directed USACE to consider NNBFs in water resource project planning, including flood risk reduction and ecosystem restoration projects. Congress mandated the consideration of natural features, nature-based features, nonstructural measures, and structural measures in USACE planning. Feasibility reports for flood risk reduction projects in 2018 were required to consider the use of NNBFs. The USACE considers NNBFs as structural or nonstructural features for federal water resources projects and cost sharing. Congress defines nonstructural alternatives as efforts to restore natural resources to reduce flood risk, potentially including some NNBFs. Classification of NNBFs as structural or nonstructural may vary across USACE activities. For planning USACE flood risk reduction projects, NNBFs can be structural or nonstructural, altering flood hazards. Most NNBFs are considered structural measures, including engineered dunes and beaches. Nonstructural NNBFs could involve floodplain restoration or acquisition of lands. Engineered dunes and beaches, unlike other NNBFs, have established flood risk reduction benefits and long-standing approaches for evaluation. They require regular maintenance for storm damage reduction and may not rely solely on natural processes. Some concerns have been raised about potential environmental harm from engineered dune and beach projects. The report differentiates between novel applications of NNBFs and traditional engineered dunes and beaches. Levee setbacks combine structural elements with natural features to reduce flood risk, with USACE considering them as alternatives for projects and repairs. Classification of some levee setbacks as NNBFs is unclear, particularly those that augment natural storage and reduce peak flows. The report discusses incorporating Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBFs) into flood risk reduction efforts by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). NNBFs are being considered in feasibility studies and recommended plans for flood risk reduction, as mandated by statutory direction in 2016 and 2018. Examples of NNBFs in completed feasibility reports and their evaluation in cost-sharing for flood risk reduction projects are provided. This initiative aims to move NNBFs from concepts to potential project features. USACE evaluates flood risk reduction projects for economic justification and national benefits. Evaluation of NNBFs in feasibility studies is tailored to each project. The Principles and Guidelines guide the decision criteria for recommended plans in USACE feasibility reports. The Principles and Guidelines (P&G) dictate that USACE must select the plan with the greatest net economic benefit, known as the national economic development plan (NED plan), unless an exception is granted by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. These guidelines have been in effect since 1983 and flood risk reduction projects are primarily evaluated based on economic factors and the NED plan. Most projects undergo a benefit-cost analysis to determine their economic feasibility. NNBFs offer cost-effective flood risk reduction benefits compared to traditional structures like storm surge gates, levees, or dams. They require less long-term maintenance and do not need replacement or removal after use. However, it is unclear how USACE is factoring in these reduced costs when comparing NNBFs with other alternatives in feasibility reports. NNBFs offer cost-effective flood risk reduction benefits compared to traditional structures like storm surge gates, levees, or dams. They may support species habitat, water quality, or recreation, among other environmental and social benefits. USACE is directed to select the plan with the greatest net economic benefit in feasibility reports, but the adoption of NNBFs is shaping the evaluation of alternatives. The P&G have been guiding USACE planning since 1983. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has been using the Principles and Guidelines (P&G) for planning since 1983. In April 2020, plans were announced to replace the P&G with new guidance called Principles, Requirements, and Guidelines (PR&G) for federal water resource investments. The PR&G focuses on maximizing public benefits without hierarchy among environmental, economic, and social goals. USACE continues to implement the P&G while considering using Non-Structural Nature-Based Features (NNBFs) in flood risk reduction projects. The US Army Corps of Engineers is considering using Non-Structural Nature-Based Features (NNBFs) in flood risk reduction projects. Projects in New York and Virginia incorporate NNBFs along with traditional structural measures to reduce erosion and attenuate wave action. Cost effectiveness of NNBFs was evaluated compared to floodwalls, and the overall recommended plan was found to be economically justified. The feasibility report recommends Non-Structural Nature-Based Features (NNBFs) in combination with traditional structural measures for flood risk reduction. NNBFs include \"living shorelines\" and are economically justified for reducing maintenance costs. USACE has proposed projects using NNBFs alongside traditional engineered dunes and beaches. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) recommends using Non-Structural Nature-Based Features (NNBFs) like living shorelines in combination with traditional engineered dunes and beaches for flood risk reduction projects. Congressional authorization is required for USACE involvement in such projects, with costs shared with nonfederal sponsors. Table 1 shows the nonfederal cost shares for USACE flood risk reduction, coastal storm damage reduction, and ecosystem restoration projects. The nonfederal cost share for US Army Corps of Engineers projects includes real estate interests like land, easements, and rights-of-way, which can exceed the standard minimum nonfederal cost share set by Congress. Different means, including cash contributions, are established to address these costs for structural and nonstructural features. The nonfederal share for US Army Corps of Engineers projects must include more than LERRDs and in-kind contributions. Congress has set a maximum nonfederal construction cost share of 50% for structural measures if nonfederal LEERDs exceed 35%. Nonstructural projects with nonfederal costs over 35% are covered by federal funding. USACE treats most NNBFs as structural measures, applying cost-sharing requirements accordingly. Some stakeholders advocate for NNBFs to be eligible for nonstructural cost sharing. Congress has authorized coastal storm damage reduction projects using engineered dunes and beaches with periodic renourishment. USACE can fund repair of nonfederal flood control works and hurricane protection projects damaged by factors like storm surge. Assistance is available for works active in the USACE Rehabilitation and Inspection Program. The USACE P.L. 84-99 program, also known as RIP, funds repairs for nonfederal levee systems in acceptable condition at the time of damage. Around 1,200 nonfederal entities with 2,000 levee systems participate in the program, spanning nearly 10,000 miles. Congress funds this program through USACE's FCCE account and authorized nonstructural alternatives for reducing flood risk in 1996. The USACE P.L. 84-99 program offers nonstructural alternatives for repair projects upon request by nonfederal sponsors. Congress expanded this option to coastal storm damage reduction projects in 2014 and defined it further in 2016. USACE must notify and consult with sponsors about the opportunity to implement nonstructural alternatives. Costs for all LERRDs under the program are shared by USACE. Under the P.L. 84-99 program, USACE shares 100% of the costs for all LERRDs. Nonstructural alternatives may require new LERRD acquisition by the nonfederal sponsor. If a nonstructural alternative is chosen, USACE will not provide further flood-related assistance in the protected area. Repair guidelines are primarily based on Engineer Regulation (ER) 500-1-1 and updated agency policies for returning coastal storm damage reduction projects to design levels of protection. The P.L. 84-99 program primarily focuses on repair-in-place for levee segments to prevent erosive damage, with limited use of nonstructural alternatives. USACE considers levee setbacks as structural realignments for repair, not nonstructural alternatives. The P.L. 84-99 program focuses on repairing levee segments to prevent erosive damage, with limited use of nonstructural alternatives. Levee setbacks are considered structural realignments for repair, not for enhancing floodplain capacity or reducing peak flows. USACE may consider setbacks as complementary investments by nonfederal entities. USACE rebuilds flood-damaged levees it operates but has no authority to implement nonstructural alternatives for its infrastructure. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) primarily focuses on traditional structural measures for infrastructure projects, which can be easier to implement compared to nonstructural alternatives. However, the agency has less experience and guidance on nonstructural measures, which may require collaboration with more stakeholders. The adoption of nonstructural measures depends on the availability of information and evaluation procedures, as well as the classification of these measures as structural for flood risk reduction. The US Army Corps of Engineers faces challenges in incorporating nonstructural measures like engineered dunes and beaches for flood risk management. Congressional modifications have prompted new procedures to evaluate the benefits of these measures, including environmental and social aspects. Incorporating these benefits into decision-making processes remains a ongoing question. The US Army Corps of Engineers faces challenges in evaluating flood risk reduction benefits, including environmental and social aspects, for nonstructural measures under the P&G. The agency plans to replace the P&G with the PR&G in 2020 to address these issues. The US Army Corps of Engineers plans to replace the P&G with the PR&G in 2020 to maximize public benefits towards environmental, economic, and social goals. Nonstructural measures may be effective in reducing flood risk and providing environmental and social benefits. Stakeholders have identified knowledge gaps that may impact USACE's ability to support federal investments in nonstructural measures. The US Army Corps of Engineers faces challenges in developing cost and benefit information for natural infrastructure due to knowledge gaps, making it difficult to compare with hard infrastructure alternatives. Unlike traditional flood risk reduction structures, procedures for evaluating nonstructural measures are not standardized. USACE is working on a research strategy to address these issues. USACE is developing a research strategy to address knowledge gaps for natural infrastructure. Research activities aim to improve understanding of NNBF performance and develop tools for estimating performance trade-offs in planning and design. Other researchers are also studying NNBF flood risk reduction benefits, limitations, and costs. The identification and evaluation of NNBF alternatives remain a case-by-case process under current guidance. The evaluation of Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBFs) for flood risk reduction benefits remains a case-by-case process, influenced by the features' location and dynamic nature. Congress may need to consider USACE's approach to NNBF evaluation in planning processes constrained by time and funding. NNBFs, such as mangroves or wetlands, can shift in response to changing conditions, while floods or storms may damage them. This dynamic nature poses challenges in valuing NNBF benefits compared to traditional flood control structures. USACE is involved in efforts to develop best practices for Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBFs) to reduce flood risks. This includes leading international initiatives to create guidelines for NNBFs. The agency is exploring how to incorporate international guidance into its planning to address performance and economic benefits in various environmental conditions. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is considering incorporating environmental and social benefits into its planning process for flood risk reduction projects using Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBFs). This decision criteria under the Planning and Guidance (P&G) for flood risk reduction project remains the National Economic Development (NED) plan. The impact of these considerations on USACE's selection of plans using NNBFs is unknown, as it is a recent development in federal water resource investments. USACE has adapted its project planning process before to meet changes in authorities, such as in the late 1990s for ecosystem restoration projects. The US Army Corps of Engineers is exploring the inclusion of environmental and social benefits in flood risk reduction projects using Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBFs). The extent to which these considerations will be integrated into the planning process is unclear. USACE has authorized a general permit for coastal living shorelines as part of their regulatory program, but the activities are carried out by nonfederal entities. As more nonfederal projects utilize NNBFs like living shorelines, USACE may gain additional knowledge and experience from these projects. The US Army Corps of Engineers is considering the cost-sharing of Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBFs) in flood risk reduction projects. Some stakeholders suggest NNBFs should be cost shared as nonstructural measures to shift more costs to the federal government. Levee setbacks pose challenges for NNBFs classified as structural measures. The US Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating the cost-sharing of Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBFs) in flood risk reduction projects. Levee setbacks present challenges for NNBFs classified as structural measures due to limited benefit-cost ratios and high acquisition costs. Nonfederal sponsors may bear 100% of Land, Easement, Rights-of-Way, and Disposal Areas (LERRD) costs for these projects. Consideration of NNBFs as structural measures could result in higher cost-sharing responsibilities for nonfederal sponsors compared to nonstructural measures. The US Army Corps of Engineers evaluates cost-sharing for Natural and Nature-Based Features (NNBFs) in flood risk reduction projects. Traditional engineered dunes and beaches, while providing social benefits and habitats, can disrupt biological communities and have negative effects. USACE is addressing these effects but the cumulative environmental changes are not well understood. Some suggest that engineered dunes and beaches could incorporate natural processes for more environmental benefits, such as leaving gaps in sand placement or nourishing smaller areas at a time to allow species to recolonize. Integrating resilience into flood risk reduction raises questions about the role of traditional engineered dunes and beaches that rely on regular renourishment. NNBFs aim to use natural processes and be self-sustaining, recovering without much human intervention. Natural dune and beach systems are expected to recover on their own after a flood event, with minimal human intervention. They can maintain or raise elevation behind the dune through natural processes like sediment movement. Engineered dunes, on the other hand, are designed to resist being overtopped and may not allow for natural migration. Some suggest incorporating natural processes into engineered dunes for environmental benefits. Some stakeholders suggest constructing lower dunes and providing space behind them for sand movement to allow natural dune migration. Designing dunes with features like vegetation, natural screens, and varied terrain elevation can reduce sand loss and promote habitat development. USACE and partners could also consider promoting natural processes in coastal storm risk reduction projects by allowing dunes to spread out, limiting grading of dunes, and restricting beach driving. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is reconsidering procedures for incorporating natural processes and features into engineered dunes and beaches to enhance environmental and social benefits. This may involve securing Long-Term Erosion Response and Dune (LERRD) agreements for shifting dunes. Additionally, federal statutes allow for cost-shared nourishment of USACE-constructed dunes and beaches over 50 years. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is considering incorporating natural processes and elements into engineered dunes and beaches to enhance benefits. It is unclear if evaluations for extending renourishment projects consider natural elements, and the extent of incorporating natural processes into designs remains unknown. Congress has directed the Administration to produce reports on this matter. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is evaluating nonstructural features (NNBFs) as part of flood risk reduction projects, as required by the WIIN Act. Congress directed the Secretary of the Army to assess NNBFs, nonstructural and structural features in flood risk projects, with reports due to specific committees every 5 and 10 years. The reports must detail the implementation of evaluating NNBFs, including guidance issued by the Secretary and Chief of Engineers. The US Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating nonstructural features (NNBFs) for flood risk reduction projects as required by the WIIN Act. The agency has initiated the development of a report assessing costs, benefits, impacts, and trade-offs associated with coastal risk reduction measures recommended by the Secretary. Congressional directive in 2014 required the Secretary of the Army to review the use and performance of emergency authority for repairs of nonfederal projects. The US Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating nonstructural features for flood risk reduction projects as required by the WIIN Act. Congress mandated a review of emergency authority for repairs of nonfederal flood control works, with a report due within 18 months. The agency will assess nonstructural alternatives like dunes, wetlands, and marshes to enhance project resiliency and cost-effectiveness. Congress has yet to fund the review. The US Army Corps of Engineers has been exploring the use of natural processes in flood risk reduction projects since 2010 through its Engineering With Nature initiative. Congress has authorized the consideration of nonstructural alternatives like dunes and wetlands to reduce flood risk. While natural processes may offer flood resilience advantages, challenges remain in adopting these alternatives. USACE has recommended a few flood risk reduction projects using nonstructural features, often in combination with traditional structural measures for economic justification. The limited use of NNBFs in USACE flood risk reduction activities is influenced by factors such as NNBF performance and evaluation. NNBFs may not always provide similar flood risk reduction levels as traditional measures, but they can offer environmental and social benefits when used alone or in combination with traditional measures. The effectiveness and reliability of NNBFs in reducing flood risks in different conditions are still limited. USACE feasibility reports should consider NNBFs' environmental and social benefits along with their flood risk reduction potential. The unclear consideration of environmental and social benefits in USACE planning and decision-making regarding NNBFs raises questions about their flood risk reduction potential. Key questions include identifying knowledge gaps, directing research to address these gaps, and assessing the impact of decision-making processes on NNBFs' benefits and costs over time. The congressionally directed reports may inform USACE decisionmakers and planners about the benefits of using NNBFs for flood risk reduction and resilience efforts. They could also guide congressional discussions on supporting NNBFs in USACE projects."
