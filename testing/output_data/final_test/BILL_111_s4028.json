Congress finds that child safety is paramount, citing statistics on child abuse and neglect deaths. Research shows underreporting of such incidents, with many child fatalities going unrecorded. States receive millions of allegations of child abuse or neglect annually. Well trained child protective services workers are crucial for screening and responding to allegations to ensure children's safety. A grant program is established under Part B of title IV of the Social Security Act to support this.
