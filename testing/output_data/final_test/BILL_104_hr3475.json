    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alcohol Advertising Accountability Act of 1996\". It includes findings related to alcohol advertising. The Congress found in 1995 that underage drinking is a significant problem, with 11 million drinkers under 21 and 2 million heavy drinkers. A survey showed that a high percentage of students in 8th, 10th, and 12th grades engage in binge drinking. The median age for children to start drinking is just over 13 years old, with 67 percent of 8th graders having tried alcohol. Additionally, 50 percent of teenagers surveyed believe alcohol is a serious issue. In 1993, over 110,000 clients under 21 were admitted to State-funded alcohol treatment programs. Alcoholic beverage companies spent $2 billion on advertising in 1995, much more than the budget of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. A study found that viewing beer ads on TV may influence young people to drink beer. Almost half of adults believe alcohol industry advertising greatly influences underage drinking, while one-third think it has some influence. SEC. 3. REPORT OF SECRETARY ON ALCOHOL ADVERTISING.
