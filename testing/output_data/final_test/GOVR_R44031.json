China has agreed to universal suffrage but with conditions on candidate nominations. Current Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying's proposed changes face opposition from the Legislative Council and ongoing protests in Hong Kong. Since Hong Kong's reversion from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, there have been ongoing protests and opposition from some Legco members regarding the election of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage. Past attempts at reforming the election process have faced challenges, with a recent resolution being defeated in Legco in June 2015. It remains uncertain if there will be a new path towards universal suffrage for the 2017 election. In response to a request from CE Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, the NPCSC issued a decision in 2007 allowing for the Chief Executive to be elected by universal suffrage in 2017. Legislation in 2010 made modest changes to the CE selection process after an agreement between the PRC government and Hong Kong's Democratic Party. The prospects for democratic election reforms in Hong Kong are of interest to Congress due to the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 supporting democratization as a fundamental principle of U.S. foreign policy. The U.S. supports democratization in Hong Kong, which is crucial for U.S. economic interests in Asia. The resolution of political reforms in Hong Kong may also impact relations between China and Taiwan. The controversy surrounds the process of nominating the Chief Executive. The controversy surrounding possible CE election reforms in Hong Kong focuses on the process of nominating official candidates, with restrictions on the number of nominees and composition of the nominating committee. The nominating committee for the Chief Executive in Hong Kong must follow specific guidelines set by the NPCSC, including the requirement for a candidate to have the endorsement of more than half of all committee members. This decision has been criticized by pro-democracy groups for limiting the nomination of pro-democracy candidates and giving indirect control to the Chinese government. The pro-democracy voices in Hong Kong are urging the NPCSC to revise its decision on the 2017 CE election reforms, as they believe the constraints violate past commitments for autonomy and democratic processes in Hong Kong. The Chinese and Hong Kong governments have shown no willingness to reconsider their stance. The NPCSC decision on the 2017 CE election reforms has caused frustration among Hong Kong residents due to perceived broken promises and commitments dating back 25 years. Chinese and Hong Kong officials argue that the decision aligns with international commitments and laws governing the HKSAR, including past statements on universal suffrage. The Basic Law stipulates the election of the Chief Executive by a representative Election Committee with 1,200 members from various sectors. The Election Committee in Hong Kong consists of members from different sectors and organizations, serving for five years. Candidates for Chief Executive need the support of at least 150 Election Committee members for nomination. The committee is responsible for electing the Chief Executive in accordance with democratic principles. The Chief Executive Election Ordinance (CEEO) governs the Chief Executive selection process in Hong Kong, with specific procedures for candidate nomination and selection by the Election Committee. The CEEO also determines the number of seats for designated subsectors and eligibility to vote for Election Committee members. In the last Election Committee subsector elections in December 2011, nearly 250,000 registered voters participated. 27.6% of eligible voters took part in the contested seats. Leung Chun-ying was chosen as Chief Executive in 2012 with 689 votes. The Basic Law outlines the procedures to amend the selection process for the Chief Executive in Hong Kong. Any amendments require a two-thirds majority of the Legislative Council members and the Chief Executive's consent, with final approval from the National People's Congress Standing Committee. The six-step procedure for amending the selection process was established in 2004 and has been followed in subsequent attempts to amend Hong Kong's election process. The HKSAR government conducts public consultations to determine the need for electoral reforms and to propose changes to Legco. CE Leung initiated the six-step procedure for possible changes in the CE selection process in 2017 and Legco elections in 2016. The HKSAR government conducted public consultations to consider electoral reforms for the 2017 Chief Executive selection and 2016 Legislative Council elections. CE Leung submitted a report to the NPCSC after a consultation period to gather opinions on universal suffrage models for the CE election. The consultation document sought feedback on issues like the nominating committee's size and composition. During the consultation period, various Chief Executive election options were discussed, including a manifesto released by academics and activists in support of universal suffrage. Occupy Central with Love and Peace (OCLP) organized public fora and a referendum on different proposals for the 2017 election, with nearly 793,000 Hong Kong voters participating. 15 proposals were put forward in June 2014 for Chief Executive election reforms in Hong Kong, with nearly 793,000 voters participating. The Alliance for True Democracy (ATD) proposal, favored by 42.1% of participants, suggested candidates could be nominated by a nominating committee, petitions signed by 1% of voters, or by a political party with at least 5% of votes in the last Legco elections. Tsang's report to the NPCSC emphasized the importance of the nominating committee's power in selecting CE candidates. The current chunk discusses different views on the composition and nomination procedures of the Nominating Committee (NC) for Chief Executive (CE) candidates in Hong Kong. Views vary on whether the NC should follow existing methods of forming the Election Committee (EC) and how many candidates should be nominated. Some suggest a two-stage nomination process, while others debate the need to restrict the number of candidates. Additionally, opinions differ on whether there should be two rounds of voting to enhance the legitimacy of the elected candidate. In the report, CE Leung acknowledged calls for \"civic nomination\" in the nominating procedures for the Chief Executive election in Hong Kong. The NPCSC released seven requirements for moving to universal suffrage in 2017. The NPCSC released seven requirements for universal suffrage in 2017, including a nominating committee forming, democratic nomination procedures, candidate endorsement by committee members, voting rights for all eligible electors, and the selection of the Chief Executive-elect. The Chief Executive-elect, chosen through universal suffrage, must be appointed by the Central People's Government in Beijing. The method of universal suffrage for selecting the Chief Executive will be determined by amending Annex I of the Basic Law. If the method is not adopted according to legal procedures, the previous term's selection method will continue. Li Fei explained the NPCSC's rationale for the seven requirements, including the size, composition, and formation method of the nominating committee. During the drafting of the Basic Law, extensive discussion led to the formation of the broadly representative and balanced Election Committee (EC) in Hong Kong. The NPCSC limited candidates to two or three to ensure competitiveness and avoid complex procedures. Candidates must also receive endorsement from over half of the NC members, following democratic procedures. The NPCSC's decision on the nominating process for the NC in Hong Kong sparked varied reactions. The requirement for candidates to be endorsed by a majority of NC members surprised many, as it raised the threshold significantly. The limit on candidates to two or three was seen as strict, and interpretations differed on the NC's size, composition, and formation method. CE Leung welcomed the decision as a \"precious offer\" from the NPCSC. On the day the NPCSC decision was released, CE Leung welcomed the \"precious offer\" from the NPCSC regarding universal suffrage. Pro-establishment parties in Hong Kong expressed support for the decision, while pro-democracy parties showed disappointment and outrage. Emily Lau criticized the NPCSC, stating that they should not insult the intelligence of the Hong Kong people. Fung Kin-kee and Martin Lee criticized the NPCSC decision on Hong Kong's electoral reform, calling it unacceptable and objecting to Beijing's control over candidate selection. Pan-democrats in Legco vowed to oppose any legislation following the NPCSC's requirements. OCLP also denounced the decision, with founder Chan Kin-man accusing Li Fei of misleading the public. OCLP criticized the nominating committee as undemocratic and called for civil disobedience. Hong Kong student organizations organized a protest against the NPCSC decision, leading to a march to Tamar Park in Admiralty. On September 27, protesters in Admiralty called for the resignation of CE Leung and \"genuine universal suffrage.\" The police fired tear gas and pepper spray at the demonstrators, leading to the \"Umbrella Movement.\" Demonstrations spread to Causeway Bay and Mong Kok, with protesters blocking roads and erecting barricades. After the three occupation sites in Hong Kong were forcibly cleared in late 2014, supporters of the Umbrella Movement continued their campaign against the NPCSC decision. They gathered in Mong Kok, organized \"flash protests\" in shopping malls, and camped outside the Legislative Council Complex and the British Consulate. Members of HKFS, Scholarism, and other supportive groups were involved in these activities. Several groups in Hong Kong, including HKFS and Scholarism, have organized community education programs to discuss the NPCSC decision on universal suffrage. Public opinion polls have shown a divided opinion on Legco's passing of an election reform proposal consistent with the NPCSC decision, with no clear majority either in favor or opposed. A poll by HKUPOP commissioned by SCMP found 48% of respondents supported Legco vetoing the proposal. A series of public opinion polls in Hong Kong between September and December 2014 showed varying views on whether Legco should approve or veto government-proposed legislation for universal suffrage based on the NPCSC decision. Poll results ranged from 39% supporting approval to 54.7% favoring vetoing the legislation. The government proposed draft legislation to forbid people with different political views from standing for the Chief Executive election. Public opinion polls showed a shift in support for the government proposal, with 47.0% in favor and 38.0% opposed before the resolution was submitted to Legco. Ming Pao commissioned a poll with a different approach, revealing that 23% considered the NPCSC decision a step forward. In a survey regarding the NPCSC decision, 23% saw it as a step forward, 29% as a step backward, and 39% as neither. 56% of respondents would vote for legislation allowing universal suffrage, while 34% would vote against to maintain the old election method. 64% would support legislation based on the NPCSC for the 2017 election, with 23% against it. The HKSAR government initiated a second round of public consultation after the NPCSC responded to the CE's report on election reform. Chief Secretary Carrie Lam announced an indefinite delay of the second round of consultations on election reform following the Umbrella Movement. The second round of consultation eventually started on January 7, 2015, and ended on March 7, 2015, with individuals and organizations submitting their views through various channels. The pan-democrats in Legco walked out on CS Lam's announcement, carrying yellow umbrellas and chanting for CE Leung to step down. They reiterated their intent to vote against any legislation complying with the NPCSC August 2014 decision. The consultation document outlined four issues for the second round of consultation on universal suffrage. The consultation document for the second round of universal suffrage outlined key issues such as the composition of the Nominating Committee, procedures for nominating Chief Executive candidates, voting arrangements, and related issues. Adjustments to the Nominating Committee's composition may be made based on support, with the possibility of adding new subsectors or adjusting seat distribution. The electorate base of subsectors may remain unchanged or be adjusted if necessary. The consultation report recommended maintaining the current Nominating Committee structure or making adjustments if supported and practical. It suggested a two-stage nomination process and limiting each member to support one candidate. The selection of candidates would involve different voting methods. The consultation document proposed various voting systems for selecting candidates, including \"one person, three votes\" and \"voting on each person seeking nomination.\" It also discussed the possibility of a run-off system if no candidate receives a majority of votes. The consultation document proposed voting systems for selecting candidates and addressed issues like NC members' terms, CE-elect selection, and CE candidates disavowing political party affiliation. Pro-establishment Legco members supported the consultation, while pan-democrats and Umbrella Movement organizers criticized it. Several key figures, including Alan Leong Kah-kit, Benny Tai Yiu-ting, and Anson Chan Fang On-sang, were highly critical of the consultation document on election reform in Hong Kong. They expressed concerns about the lack of genuine democracy and fairness in the proposed reforms. Despite some reservations, Liberal Party members indicated they would support the government's election reform legislation in Legco. The pro-establishment DAB will conduct public fora to gather opinions on CE election reforms. CS Lam presented results of public consultation and outlined key elements of the reform legislation, including a 1,200-member Nominating Committee with unchanged subsector allocation and nominee selection process. The Nominating Committee (NC) will select official nominees for the Chief Executive (CE) election in two stages. In the first stage, each NC member can recommend one person who must receive 120 recommendations to be considered. In the second stage, NC members vote for at least two candidates, with the top two or three candidates with at least 601 votes becoming official nominees. The popular vote will use the \"first-past-the-post\" system. Pan-democrats showed opposition to the proposed CE election reforms during Lam's presentation to Legco. The pan-democrats reiterated their pledge to vote against any proposal complying with the NPCSC's decision. Pro-establishment Legco members announced support for the proposal. Protesters gathered outside the Legco Building expressing opposing views. The Hong Kong government planned to submit a resolution to amend the Basic Law on June 17, 2015, with no changes from the April announcement. The Shenzhen meeting with Chinese officials did not result in any breakthroughs. The meeting with Chinese officials did not result in any breakthroughs. Chief Secretary Carrie Lam presented the resolution to Legco on June 17, 2015, complying with the NPCSC's decision. The resolution outlined the process for selecting the Chief Executive by universal suffrage in 2017, with a Nominating Committee nominating 2-3 candidates. The resolution presented to Legco on June 17, 2015 outlined the process for selecting the Chief Executive by universal suffrage in 2017. The resolution required a person to receive the recommendation of 120 Nominating Committee members to be considered a candidate, and the support of more than half of all members (601 or more) to be an official nominee. After two days of debate, the resolution was defeated on June 18, 2015 by a vote of 28 against and 8 for the motion. The resolution for Chief Executive selection by universal suffrage in 2017 was defeated in Legco on June 18, 2015. Pro-establishment members staged a walkout to delay the vote, but it failed to stop the motion. The current CE selection system will remain in place for 2017 as a result of Legco's decision. The possibility of CE election reforms by 2017 appears dimmed. Legco could reconsider the motion, but it is unlikely to change the outcome. The Hong Kong government could submit a new resolution, but CE Leung has no plans to consider that option. Anson Chan's call to reopen the discussion was dismissed by CE Leung. The NPCSC's August 2014 decision will remain in force despite being vetoed by city lawmakers. The August 2014 decision will continue to serve as the constitutional ground for Hong Kong, enforcing universal suffrage in the chief executive election. CY Leung may resubmit a report to the NPCSC on changed circumstances, but it is unlikely to alter the conditions. Focus in Hong Kong has shifted to the upcoming District Council elections in November and the 2016 Legco elections. The upcoming District Council elections in Hong Kong are significant as all seats will be filled by popular vote. Various groups formed during the Umbrella Movement are reportedly forming new political parties to participate in the elections. Pan-democratic parties are also coordinating candidates to increase their chances of being elected. The results will serve as an indicator of public support for the pan-democrats and their defeat of the CE election reforms. Additionally, 117 District Council members will sit on the 2017 CE Selection Committee, with 5 of them becoming Legco members in 2016, making the 2016 Legco elections crucial for democracy in Hong Kong. The upcoming District Council elections in Hong Kong are crucial for democracy in the region. The outcome will reflect public support for either pan-democrats or pro-establishment parties and their stance on CE election reforms. The 2016 Legco may have a chance to consider CE election reforms if the CE selected in 2017 restarts the reform process. Hong Kong was a British Crown Colony for 155 years until the Joint Declaration was signed in 1984. The \"Joint Declaration\" signed in 1984 transferred sovereignty of Hong Kong to China on July 1, 1997. It promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, with unchanged social and economic systems for 50 years. The Chief Executive would be selected through local elections or consultations, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights would remain in force. The National People's Congress passed the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on April 4, 1990, in accordance with the Joint Declaration. The Chief Executive of Hong Kong will be appointed based on election results or local consultations, as outlined in the Joint Declaration and Annex I. The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, passed by the National People's Congress, states that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights apply to Hong Kong. The ICCPR guarantees citizens the right to participate in public affairs, vote in elections, and access public service. China's reservation to the ICCPR in 1976 excluded the requirement for elected councils in Hong Kong. Some believe China's decision in August 2014 violates the ICCPR and the Joint Declaration. Chinese officials argue the Joint Declaration is no longer valid, and the NPCSC decision aligns with the ICCPR for Hong Kong. A Hong Kong legal scholar argues the UK's reservation on the ICCPR will no longer apply. The reservation on the application of Article 25(b) of the ICCPR will end once the Chief Executive is elected. A Mainland scholar argues that the NPCSC decision does not impose unreasonable restrictions on the CE election, as China can establish laws governing the election as long as they comply with ICCPR rights. The ICCPR does not address candidate nomination, so the NPCSC decision aligns with China's ICCPR obligations. Hong Kong's Acting Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Lau Kong-wah explained that the ICCPR reservation made by the British government in 1976 regarding Article 25(b) does not apply to Hong Kong after the establishment of the HKSAR. The ultimate aim of universal suffrage in Hong Kong is based on the Basic Law and NPCSC decisions, not the ICCPR. China's Deputy Ambassador to the UK stated that the Joint Declaration signed with Britain is now void, covering only the period from 1984 to 1997. The US-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 maintains relations with Hong Kong, contingent on China upholding its international obligations, including the Joint Declaration's promise of autonomy for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The US-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 grants Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy except in defense and foreign affairs, supports democratization post-1997, allows the President to suspend special treatment if autonomy is lacking, and mandates annual reports on Hong Kong conditions. The State Department produces an annual report on Hong Kong conditions of interest to the United States. The mandate was extended until 2006, and then again in 2015 by Congress. A one-time report on the status of Hong Kong was released in April 2015, including a section on electoral reforms. The United States called for a multi-candidate competitive election for Chief Executive in 2017 to enhance legitimacy and political development in Hong Kong. The White House and State Department have been cautious in their statements regarding Hong Kong. The White House and State Department have shown support for universal suffrage in Hong Kong, emphasizing the importance of providing Hong Kong voters with a \"meaningful choice.\" They have refrained from directly commenting on the NPCSC August decision or the Chinese and HKSAR governments' positions on CE election reforms. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated that fulfilling the Basic Law's aim of universal suffrage would greatly enhance the Chief Executive's legitimacy in Hong Kong. The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong released a statement supporting the Basic Law's protections of fundamental freedoms, such as peaceful assembly, expression, and press. The State Department encouraged Hong Kong authorities and people to ensure a competitive process for selecting the Chief Executive through universal suffrage. President Obama and National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi to discuss the President's upcoming trip to Beijing. They expressed support for universal suffrage in Hong Kong and hoped for peaceful resolution of differences between authorities and protesters. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel testified at a Senate hearing on Hong Kong in December 2014. During a Senate Committee on Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing on Hong Kong in December 2014, Secretary Russel summarized the Obama Administration's position on Hong Kong's potential CE election reforms. He emphasized that the legitimacy of Hong Kong's Chief Executive would be greatly enhanced through universal suffrage, providing the people with a meaningful choice of candidates. Despite criticism of the NPCSC's August decision, Russel denied allegations of U.S. involvement in the ongoing protests in Hong Kong, stating that both the United States and China have a vested interest in the region's stability. The United States and China support electoral reform in Hong Kong for stability and autonomy. The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong believes Chief Executive legitimacy will be enhanced through universal suffrage. Assistant Secretary of State Tom Malinowski emphasized the importance of a meaningful choice of candidates for Hong Kong residents. The U.S. officials support competitive elections in Hong Kong for Chief Executive selection and respect the upcoming Legco vote. The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong did not issue an official statement following the vote. Consul General Clifford A. Hart, Jr., did not issue an official statement following the Legco vote. He encouraged Hong Kong authorities, the national government, and the people to work together towards achieving universal suffrage. He urged all perspectives to maintain civility, forbearance, and patience in addressing governance challenges. The U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue in 2015 discussed electoral reform in Hong Kong, potentially influencing political changes in Mainland China. Hong Kong could serve as a testing ground for political reforms that may be implemented in Mainland China. The \"one country, two systems\" policy was intended to allow democratic reforms in Hong Kong without causing political instability in Mainland China. However, recent decisions by the NPCSC and the Chinese government have raised concerns about the \"Mainlandization\" of Hong Kong, with observers noting a gradual shift towards Mainland characteristics due to increased interaction and Chinese government policies. The NPCSC August decision is seen as part of the \"Mainlandization\" of Hong Kong, with the Chinese government aiming to control the nomination process while appearing to implement democratic reforms. Criticism of the Umbrella Movement and past attempts to introduce pro-Beijing propaganda in schools are seen as signs of efforts to make Hong Kong more like Mainland China. The \"Mainlandization\" of Hong Kong is evident in the national education curriculum seen as pro-Beijing propaganda and suggestions for Mainland sedition laws. The Liaison Office has increased involvement in local political issues, while Hong Kong's economy is becoming more reliant on the Mainland economy. The retail sector caters to Mainland visitors and immigrants, contributing to the integration of Hong Kong with Mainland China. The Hong Kong press reports conflicts between Mainland tourists, immigrants, and local residents over cultural differences. Some fear the city is being taken over by Mainland companies. Observers are more concerned about \"Mainlandization\" than optimistic about Hong Kong's traditions. The outcome of the debate over CE election reforms will impact political influence across the Hong Kong/Mainland border. The \"one country, two systems\" model was originally intended for Mainland China and Taiwan, not Hong Kong. Chinese officials applied the concept to Hong Kong in hopes of persuading Taiwan to consider it for Mainland-Taiwan unification. Events in Hong Kong in 2014 may have weakened support in Taiwan for closer relations with Mainland China. Disenchantment with China's handling of Hong Kong events could have impacted Taiwan's Kuomintang party in local elections. The Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong has ties with Taiwan's Sunflower Movement, where activists protested the KMT's trade deal with China. Hong Kong's political situation has led to more residents emigrating to Taiwan. The success of Hong Kong's CE election reforms may influence Taiwan's stance on closer ties with China. Failure to adopt universal suffrage in Hong Kong could sway Taiwanese voters against closer relations with China. The level of congressional interest in Hong Kong's possible CE election reforms may depend on the progress of the reform process. The HKSAR government's treatment of alleged protest organizers could also impact congressional interest. Legislation has been introduced to amend U.S. policy towards Hong Kong, including support for democratization. During the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to amend the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 and potentially allow Hong Kong to qualify for the U.S. visa waiver program. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (HKHRDA; H.R. 5696 and S. 2922) was introduced in the House and Senate on November 13, 2014, reaffirming support for democratization in Hong Kong. Members of Congress closely monitored events in Hong Kong and criticized the Obama Administration's response. The HKHRDA bill supported democratic aspirations in Hong Kong, including the establishment of a genuine democratic option by 2017. It aimed to reinstate the State Department's annual report on Hong Kong's status for 10 years, highlighting areas where Hong Kong receives separate treatment from China under US laws. The bill faced controversy with the Obama Administration, the HKSAR government, and some supporters. The HKHRDA bill aimed to support democratic aspirations in Hong Kong by reinstating the State Department's annual report on Hong Kong's status. It faced controversy with the Obama Administration, the HKSAR government, and some supporters due to provisions rendering Hong Kong ineligible for different treatment unless certified as sufficiently autonomous. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations amended and approved S. 2922 on December 12, 2014, requiring the Secretary of State to certify Hong Kong's autonomy annually. Neither H.R. 5696 nor S. 2922 was voted on by Congress. The 113th Congress also considered other legislation related to Hong Kong. The 113th Congress considered various legislation related to Hong Kong, including bills that aimed to make Hong Kong eligible for the visa waiver program. Hearings were held to discuss the political situation in Hong Kong. None of the bills were enacted into law. The 113th Congress considered legislation related to Hong Kong, including the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (H.R. 1159) introduced by Representative Christopher Smith in February 2015. The act reaffirms U.S. interest in Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, supporting democratization as a fundamental principle of U.S. foreign policy. It aims to establish a genuine democratic option for nominating and electing the Chief Executive of Hong Kong by 2017. The provisions of H.R. 1159 are similar to the amended version of S. 2922 approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during the 113th Congress. Section 4 would reinstate the State Department's annual report to Congress as provided for in the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 for 10 years or until Hong Kong holds free and fair elections. Section 5 would require the Secretary of State to certify to Congress whether Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous for separate treatment from China in any new laws or agreements. The Department of State Operations Authorization and Embassy Security Act, Fiscal Year 2016 (S. 1635) submitted by Senator Bob Corker reinstates the annual State Department report required by the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 through 2020. It also requires the Secretary of State to certify to Congress whether Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous for different treatment from China in any new laws or agreements. The bill ensures that Hong Kong receives different treatment from China in new laws or agreements entered into by the United States. It allows for waiver authority if deemed in the national interest, with notification to relevant committees. Congressional hearings have addressed democracy in Hong Kong, among other Asian countries. Many years, Congress has funded programs to promote democracy in China and Hong Kong through the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), USAID, and NED. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 provided funding for these programs. Past U.S. programs in Hong Kong focused on providing technical assistance to political parties. Kong's political parties and groups receive assistance from NED and NDI for the Design Democracy Hong Kong project, creating election models. Allegations of foreign funding for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have been made, but evidence has not been publicly released. Some pro-democracy organizations and individuals in Hong Kong are wary of contact with Congress, the U.S. government, and other foreign entities due to alleged restrictions on movement by the Chinese and HKSAR governments. Legco members and students linked to protest movements have faced entry denials into Mainland China, and a Hong Kong resident was reportedly barred from returning from Taiwan due to involvement in the Umbrella Movement. British Parliament members were also prevented from traveling to Hong Kong by Chinese officials. The Chinese government officials informed the committee that they could not travel to Hong Kong to investigate the political situation, citing the Occupy movement as the reason for denial. The decision was made by China's government, not the HKSAR government, which has autonomy over immigration policies. The committee's chairman, Richard Ottaway, was told by China's deputy ambassador Ni Jian about the refusal of entry. The Chief Executive Election Ordinance allocates seats in different sectors for the Election Committee elections in Hong Kong. Committee elections in Hong Kong are overseen by the Electoral Affairs Commission. The Legislative Council members are divided into pro-establishment and pan-democrat factions. The Functional Constituency Members are listed by constituency and electorate. A motion concerning the amendment to the method for selecting the Chief Executive is also included in the document. The Amendment to the Method for the Selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is based on the Basic Law and decisions by the National People's Congress. The \"(Draft) Amendment to Annex I to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China Concerning the Method for the Selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\" was endorsed by the Council with a two-thirds majority. It states that starting from 2017, the Chief Executive will be selected by universal suffrage through a Nominating Committee and appointed by the Central People's Government. The Committee will consist of 1200 members from various sectors. The Nominating Committee for selecting the Chief Executive of Hong Kong will consist of 1200 members from different sectors, with a term of office of five years. If a by-election is held during the term, the new Chief Executive will serve the remainder of the previous Chief Executive's term. The Nominating Committee in Hong Kong consists of 1200 members from various sectors, who will elect Chief Executive candidates. Candidates can be recommended by 120 to 240 members, with each member recommending only one person. The Committee will nominate two to three candidates for the Chief Executive position. The Nominating Committee in Hong Kong, consisting of 1200 members, nominates two to three Chief Executive candidates by secret ballot. Each candidate must have the endorsement of more than half of the Committee members. Eligible electors will then elect one Chief Executive designate from the nominated candidates by secret ballot. The specific nominating and election methods will be prescribed by the electoral law."
