    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Natural Gas and Other Petroleum Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2001.\" Definitions include terms like \"deepwater,\" \"Fund,\" \"institution of higher education,\" \"Research Organization,\" \"ultra-deepwater,\" and \"unconventional.\" The Secretary will establish a program for ultra-deepwater natural gas and petroleum exploration technologies in areas available for Outer Continental Shelf leasing. This program will be conducted by the Research Organization. The National Energy Technology Laboratory and the United States Geological Survey will conduct long-term research on new natural gas and petroleum exploration technologies, including methane hydrates. They will also focus on developing technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from unconventional and ultra-deepwater exploration activities, including carbon sequestration. An advisory committee will be established. The Secretary will establish an Advisory Committee with 7 members from the natural gas and petroleum industry. The Committee will advise on selecting a Research Organization and implementing the Act. The Advisory Committee members will not receive compensation but will be reimbursed for travel expenses. Administrative costs will be covered by the Fund, and the Committee's duration is not limited by the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 6. RESEARCH ORGANIZATION. The Secretary will solicit proposals from eligible entities to create a Research Organization within 6 months of the enactment of the Act. Eligible entities must be tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and have experience in natural gas or petroleum exploration research. The proposal must include a detailed description of the entity's capabilities. The Research Organization will award grants to research institutions, higher education institutions, companies, and consortia for research on unconventional and ultra-deepwater natural gas or petroleum exploration technologies. They will also review grant activities to ensure compliance with the Act's requirements. The Research Organization will award grants to entities for research on unconventional and ultra-deepwater natural gas or petroleum exploration technologies. The Research Organization will award grants for research, development, and demonstration of technologies to maximize the value of natural gas and petroleum resources in unconventional reservoirs and ultra-deepwater, while improving safety and minimizing environmental impacts. The Research Organization will award grants for developing and demonstrating next-generation architecture for ultra-deepwater production of natural gas and petroleum to increase supply, lower costs, improve efficiency, and minimize environmental impacts. Grants provided under this section shall contain conditions including a signed contract defining intellectual property rights and a repayment schedule for successful commercialization of demonstrated technology. The Research Organization must ensure that grant payments do not hinder technology adoption in the marketplace. If there is any impedance, the grant agreement will be renegotiated. Grant applications must specify the commercial applications of the technology. The grant amount cannot exceed 50% of the total project cost. Funds provided under a grant must cover a percentage of total project costs, with the option to cover up to 90% for grants to independent producers. A portion of the funds should be used for disseminating technologies to various institutions. Demonstrations of ultra-deepwater technologies can be conducted in appropriate locations. Allocation of Funds under this Act: 15% for grants under subsection (a)(1), 15% for grants under subsection (a)(2), 60% for grants under subsection (a)(3), and 10% for carrying out section 4. The Research Organization must submit an annual plan to the Secretary outlining projects and funding for activities. The Secretary has 1 month to review and approve the plan; if not approved, funding will be withheld until a new plan is submitted. The Secretary must notify congressional committees of any disapproval. Additionally, there is a provision for audits under Section 9. The Secretary must hire an independent auditor to assess the expenditure of funds authorized by the Act. The auditor will report annually to the Secretary, who will then share the report with congressional committees and address any identified deficiencies. Establishment of the \"Ultra-Deepwater and Unconventional Gas Research Fund\" in the Treasury of the United States for allocation under section 7(c). Funding sources include $900,000,000 in appropriations for fiscal years 2002 through 2009, with income from ultra-deepwater oil and gas leases considered as repayment for the loans. Additional appropriations are authorized. Additional appropriations are authorized for the Secretary for fiscal years 2002 through 2009, to be deposited in the Fund. Not more than 7.5 percent of the income from Federal oil and gas leases can be deposited in the Fund for the same fiscal years. SEC. 11. SUNSET. No funds authorized after fiscal year 2009 for this Act. Research Organization terminated when funds expended."
