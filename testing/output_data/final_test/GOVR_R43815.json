    "content": "Space heating accounts for nearly 40% of total residential energy use, with natural gas furnaces being the most common type of equipment used. Furnaces distribute hot air throughout the home via ventilation duct systems. There are two main types of residential furnaces: weatherized for outdoor installation and non-weatherized for indoor installation. Non-weatherized furnaces are more common and come in condensing and non-condensing forms. Natural gas furnaces are the dominant type, with a 90% or greater AFUE being the most efficient. \"Condensing furnaces with 90% or greater AFUE recover heat by condensing water from exhaust gases to warm the home. Non-condensing furnaces lack this system, requiring chimney venting. Federal policymaking for energy efficiency standards for residential gas furnaces is discussed, with a chronology of key policy developments provided in Appendix B.\" The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 established national energy efficiency targets for residential appliances, including furnaces. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act of 1978 authorized the Department of Energy to enforce mandatory energy efficiency standards for covered products. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 set energy efficiency targets for residential appliances. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act of 1978 authorized the Department of Energy to enforce mandatory standards for covered products. Any amended standard must maximize energy efficiency, be economically justified, and result in significant energy conservation. DOE considers various factors before determining the economic justification of a standard. The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA) amended the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to establish energy conservation standards for residential furnaces and boilers, setting a minimum national standard of 78% AFUE. DOE was required to consider amending the standard in two subsequent rulemakings, with deadlines in 1994 and 2007. However, DOE missed the 1994 deadline for a new rulemaking. In 2005, the Energy Policy Act directed DOE to develop efficiency standards for products with missed deadlines. DOE also had to submit semi-annual reports on standard-setting activities. A lawsuit challenged DOE's failure to comply with efficiency standards deadlines, leading to a consent decree with agreed deadlines for actions on efficiency standards for various products. DOE agreed to deadlines for efficiency standards for different products. The consent decree required a rule for furnace efficiency standards by September 30, 2007. The court terminated the decree after DOE completed all required actions. In November 2007, a final rule was published to raise the residential gas furnace efficiency standard to 80% AFUE by November 19, 2015. The rule faced criticism for not demanding a greater increase in standards, leading to challenges in the U.S. Court of Appeals in January 2008. Challenges were filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit against the DOE Final Rule, citing flaws in economic analysis and minimal energy savings with the 80% standard. Concerns were raised about the impact on consumer costs and potential preemption of stricter state standards, with California intervening in the challenge. California and other states raised concerns about DOE's weak standards for residential furnaces and boilers preempting stricter state standards. Massachusetts sought exemption from DOE's 80% AFUE rule to maintain its 90% state standard, but DOE denied the petition. DOE reiterated its authority to grant state waivers but maintained that a 90% regional standard was beyond its scope. Legal challenges and concerns about energy savings impact and preemption prompted DOE to address these issues. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 empowered DOE to set regional energy efficiency standards for residential furnaces, central air conditioners, and heat pumps to account for geographic differences in heating or cooling needs. Congress authorized DOE to establish regional efficiency standards alongside a national \"minimum\" standard. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 authorized DOE to set regional energy efficiency standards for residential furnaces, central air conditioners, and heat pumps. This included a base national \"minimum\" standard and higher regional \"installation standard\" for products installed after the effective date. The law allowed DOE to use a \"direct final rule\" process for implementing new regional standards, departing from traditional rulemaking procedures. EISA Section 308 authorized DOE to set standards through an expedited rulemaking process involving collaborative negotiation. In 2008, key manufacturers and energy efficiency advocates collaborated to design new energy efficiency standards for residential furnaces. The process was praised by representatives of AHRI and the American. The agreement between AHRI and ACEEE is a breakthrough in regulatory rulemaking, aiming to achieve greater energy efficiency by providing predictable standards for manufacturers and shifting enforcement responsibility to distributors, contractors, and local officials. It also calls for changes to building codes to increase efficiency in new homes. In late 2009, AHRI and ACEEE reached a consensus agreement to set new standards for residential furnaces and other EISA-identified products. The agreement called for a base national standard of 80% AFUE for natural gas furnaces, with a regional standard of 90% AFUE. DOE initiated a regional standards rulemaking for residential furnaces, heat pumps, and central air conditioners based on the authority granted by EISA. In March 2010, a Rulemaking Analysis Plan (RAP) was published for residential furnaces. The Rulemaking Analysis Plan (RAP) for residential furnaces outlines key elements and models used by DOE to estimate energy savings for different furnace efficiency levels. DOE's modeling involved engineering and economic analysis to estimate energy prices, efficiency levels, equipment energy use, manufacturer costs, consumer costs, lifecycle costs, and potential impacts on manufacturers, utilities, employment, and environmental emissions. DOE expected similar industry impacts from the new standards as seen in previous rulemaking. The RAP highlighted potential disruptions to supply chains and increased costs as a result of the new standards. In March 2010, DOE published a notice requesting public comment on proposed efficiency requirements, regional divisions, and compliance dates for residential furnace standards based on a consensus agreement. EISA Section 308 allows DOE to establish energy efficiency standards through a direct final rule process. In June 2011, DOE published a direct final rule for non-weatherized residential natural gas furnaces as directed by EISA Section 308. The rule included provisions for a parallel traditional rulemaking process in case of opposition. The direct final rule for non-weatherized natural gas furnaces included standards for selected technology products, with an 80% AFUE national standard and a 90% AFUE northern regional standard. If adverse comments are received, the Secretary must determine if they warrant withdrawal of the rule. The DOE concluded that the benefits of today's energy efficiency standards outweigh the costs, with significant energy conservation and commercially available products meeting the standards. In October 2011, after closing the public comment period, the DOE confirmed adoption of the DFR despite adverse comments. DOE confirmed adoption of the DFR despite adverse comments, stating that the new energy efficiency standards for residential furnaces and air conditioners would result in significant energy conservation. The standards aim to achieve maximum energy efficiency deemed technologically feasible and economically justified. The DOE adopted new energy efficiency standards for residential furnaces and air conditioners to achieve significant energy conservation. The standards are estimated to save 4 billion watts of power plant construction and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 113 to 143 million metric tons over 30 years. Non-weatherized gas furnaces with 90% AFUE have an average life-cycle cost savings of $150 and a payback period of 10 years. The rule also addresses the potential rebound effect on energy savings, incorporating a 20% rebound effect for furnaces in the analysis. The DOE believes that the rebound effect from increased consumer value would offset foregone energy savings. EPCA establishes lead times for compliance with amended energy standards for furnaces and air conditioners. The November 2007 Rule completed the first round of rulemaking for amended energy conservation standards for furnaces, satisfying the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 6295(f)(4)(B). The current rulemaking is the second round for amended energy conservation standards for furnaces, with a five-year period between publication and compliance date. The Consensus Agreement in 2010 set a May 1, 2013 compliance date for the gas furnace regional standard, with AHRI initially supporting the shorter lead time. The DOE and AHRI supported a shortened compliance period of slightly more than three years for amended energy conservation standards. The consensus agreement in 2010 set a May 1, 2013 compliance date for the gas furnace regional standard. EISA Section 306 directed DOE to initiate a separate rulemaking for enforcement of regional standards within 90 days after the direct final rule and to complete it within 15 months. In December 2011, DOE published a Regional Standards Enforcement Framework Document addressing certification, compliance, and enforcement issues for regional standards. The document discussed the differences between traditional national standards and new regional standards based on installation location. Regional standards require compliance at the point of installation, shifting enforcement down the supply chain. This change accelerated compliance timing. The regional standards accelerated compliance timing by shifting enforcement down the supply chain, impacting distributors and contractors beyond manufacturers. Compliance with regional standards is required at the point of installation. DOE proposed alternative modes of information production for compliance with regional standards, involving manufacturers, distributors, and contractors. The enforcement program aims to involve all industry sectors without overburdening any participant or DOE. Three potential approaches have been developed for enforcing regional energy conservation standards for central air conditioners, heat pumps, and furnaces. Representatives from manufacturers, distributors, and contractors strongly opposed DOE's proposals to expand industry information processing requirements for regional standards compliance. Industry requested continued compliance information requirements with support from the AHRI equipment certification directory and revision of FTC Energy Guide labels. AHRI sought clarification on tying compliance date to product manufacture date, not installation date. DOE clarified its intent to enforce an installation standard for regional standards in addition to a manufactured compliance date for national standards, citing constraints by statutory language. DOE emphasized the distinction between terms in EISA \u00a7306 and stated it could not violate the law. AHRI noted delays in DOE's rulemaking process but did not object to the compressed compliance lead-time for gas furnace standards. In 2011, compliance lead time for furnace standards was reduced to 18 months, much less than the industry's anticipated three-year lead time. Despite historically having 5 years for compliance, the HVAC industry accepted the shorter lead time due to delays in adopting consensus standards by the DOE. AHRI was willing to reduce lead time from 5 years to 18 months for the May 2013 implementation date. AHRI anticipated DOE would issue a final compliance enforcement rule by the end of 2012 for the May 2013 implementation date. The delay in rulemaking added complexity and uncertainty for industry compliance. DOE's Final Guidance did not address compliance information requirements. Court action led to DOE agreeing to vacate the DFR for gas furnace regional standards. EISA directed DOE to seek public comment on the proposed rule. The DOE must seek public comment on the proposed rule and consider any adverse comments or alternative recommendations that could lead to withdrawal of the rule. Industry concerns raised include potential inventory issues with the regional standard. The DOE is implementing new \"installed by\" compliance rules for residential heating equipment, causing potential inventory issues and supply shortages in the Northern region before the compliance date of May 1, 2013. This change prohibits the installation of 80% residential gas furnaces in the 30 northern states. AHRI petitioned DOE for an 18-month extension of the May 1, 2013, compliance date for the regional gas furnace standard, citing concerns about the departure from the consensus agreement regarding the effective date of the standard. AHRI requested an 18-month extension of the May 1, 2013 compliance date for regional gas furnace standards. Manufacturers need time to comply with standards and labeling requirements, distributors and installers need \"sell-through time\" to avoid losses from stranded inventory. AHRI and ACCA supported the AHRI-proposed extension for regional gas furnace standards compliance date. HARDI emphasized the challenges faced by distributors with DOE's regional standards approach. AHRI and HARDI requested DOE to grant the petition by September 15, 2012 to avoid market disruptions and economic losses. The 18-month delay would set the effective date to November 1, 2014, aligning it closely with DOE's enforcement rule publication. AHRI and industry groups sought an extension for compliance with regional gas furnace standards due to uncertainties in enforcement requirements and product labeling. AHRI petitioned DOE to delay the final rule publication until the end of 2012, citing the need for clarity on enforcement measures. AHRI and industry groups requested a 12-month compliance lead time for tracking products and submitting additional information. AHRI also highlighted the need for several months of lead time for product labeling for regional standards enforcement. They emphasized the importance of adjusting the furnace standards' effective date to allow manufacturers and distribution channels adequate time to prepare. DOE has an enforcement rulemaking responsibility for its standards. In December 2011, DOE proposed three approaches for an effective enforcement program design to distribute compliance information burdens on manufacturers, distributors, and contractors. Approach 1 would require manufacturers to track serial numbers of units shipped to each distributor location. Approach 1 requires manufacturers to track serial numbers of units shipped to each distributor location. Approach 2 involves maintaining records of distributors and contractors for each unit, while contractors must record installation details. Approach 3 mandates a complete tracking system for each unit by serial number from manufacturer to installation, placing a heavier burden but ensuring comprehensive enforcement. AHRI, along with other industry associations, responded to DOE's Regional Standards Enforcement Framework Document. AHRI stated that none of the proposed enforcement schemes would significantly improve compliance with regional standards and would instead create unnecessary administrative burdens and costs for all parties involved in distribution and installation. AHRI responded to DOE's Regional Standards Enforcement Framework Document, criticizing the proposed enforcement schemes for creating unnecessary administrative burdens and costs. AHRI suggested modifying Energy Guide labels to align with existing industry requirements and emphasized not supporting additional reporting requirements beyond current regulations. They recommended recognizing existing record-keeping schemes to avoid new burdens. AHRI emphasized the burden of record-keeping and reporting for residential HVAC units, highlighting the overwhelming paperwork under proposed enforcement schemes. They argued for a status quo approach based on the statutory basis for industry trade associations in certification processes. The AHRI online equipment certification directory is a key source for certified performance information on residential furnaces and central air conditioners. DOE's adoption of regional standards for residential furnaces and central air conditioners triggers an equipment-labeling requirement for the FTC. The FTC is directed to establish methods for disclosing equipment information to ensure compliance with regional standards within 15 months of the final rule publication by DOE. FTC initiated a rulemaking to update Energy Guide labels for furnaces and hardware in support of regional standards established by DOE. AHRI proposed an expansion of compliance information process involving all links in the supply chain. AHRI's ideal enforcement regime would limit manufacturers' obligation to inform distributors. AHRI proposed modifications to the FTC label for residential furnaces, air conditioners, and heat pumps to address information compliance issues. They believe revisions to Energy Guide labels alone can meet the objectives of FTC and DOE without imposing additional reporting requirements on manufacturers. AHRI also suggested incorporating a reference to the AHRI directory of certified product performance in all labels to help consumers make informed decisions. AHRI recommends using the AHRI directory of certified products as a method for disclosing information related to new regional standards for residential furnaces, air conditioners, and heat pumps. They believe that the FTC Energy Guide labels, modified as proposed by AHRI, will be the most effective tool for implementing regional standards. HARDI opposes new record-keeping requirements for regional standards enforcement, believing current certification procedures are sufficient. They support AHRI's proposal for an updated energy-efficiency label and advocate for voluntary communication and education to ensure compliance with the law. In February 2013, the FTC updated its Energy Guide labeling rule for residential furnaces and air conditioners to include regional information and a map on labels. The final rule mandates the Energy Guide label on product packaging, at the point of sale, on websites, and on the product itself. ACCA expressed opposition to DOE's proposals, particularly regarding technical installation concerns about the regional natural gas furnace standard. They highlighted issues with meeting the 90% AFUE standard using condensing furnaces that require side wall venting, posing challenges for certain residential buildings like row houses. ACCA expressed concerns about the regional natural gas furnace standard, specifically regarding the installation challenges for non-weatherized furnaces in row houses. They highlighted potential issues with meeting the 90% AFUE standard and the uncertainty surrounding waivers for condensing furnaces in the northern region. The waiver process for condensing furnace standards in the Northern Region is causing confusion and uncertainty. ACCA and APGA have expressed concerns about the potential impact on installations and enforcement of the rule. APGA raised concerns about DOE's proposed regional standard rule, stating that it could lead to fuel switching from gas to electric appliances. They emphasized the need for the standard to consider the income level of affected consumers to prevent this outcome. APGA criticizes DOE's rationale for not considering the economic impact on lower income consumers when proposing regional standard rules, emphasizing that upfront costs drive fuel switching from gas to electric appliances. They advocate for a waiver provision to address this issue. APGA advocated for two waiver provisions: one based on income level and one based on building characteristics. They proposed that 250% of the poverty level would catch most lower income customers for residential furnace waiver qualification. APGA recommended a blanket waiver provision for row houses and similar residential buildings, regardless of income level, to exempt them from the 90% AFUE standard. The waiver process could allow case-by-case exemptions from the regional standard, either as a new process or building upon DOE's existing waiver process. DOE acknowledged concerns about \"stranded\" appliances sharing venting with a furnace and higher installation costs for condensing furnaces in row houses. They are open to alternatives to mitigate unintended consequences and requested public input on a waiver process. The Furnace Waiver Design Group responded with recommendations on the Enforcement Framework Document in February 2012. The Furnace Waiver Design Group responded to DOE's request for comments on the Enforcement Framework Document, suggesting the establishment of a waiver process for the new regional furnace standard. Waivers should be available for furnace replacement in existing homes under specific criteria, documented by the installer on a standardized form for submission to DOE. The Furnace Waiver Design Group suggested a waiver process for the new regional furnace standard, with installers needing appropriate training and certification. DOE should periodically review the waiver policy for adjustments, with any significant changes requiring a public notice-and-comment process. HARDI expressed concerns about the proposed waiver process, citing issues with retroactive nature, enforcement, and potential fraud. HARDI recommended that DOE maintain the current waiver criteria and enforcement process for energy efficiency standards. They also suggested that the FTC adopt AHRI's proposal for an updated energy efficiency label. HARDI believed that AHRI's certification system could ensure compliance with regional energy efficiency standards. DOE's Final Guidance Document did not address the issue of gas furnace waivers. The document did not make a final decision on gas furnace waivers, with the urgency overshadowed by court action. APGA petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals, arguing against the 90% efficiency standard for the northern region and contesting DOE's actions as arbitrary and capricious. DOE's actions in publishing the DFR were deemed arbitrary and capricious, leading to a dispute with various parties intervening. Trade organizations supported APGA's challenge, while environmental groups backed DOE's efficiency standards. A settlement was reached between DOE and APGA in January 2013, but intervenors on both sides opposed the agreement. HARDI opposed the proposed settlement on the grounds that it would maintain certain standards for central air conditioners and heat pumps. They sought to replace APGA as the petitioner in the case to continue challenging the DFR. Environmental and consumer groups also objected to the settlement, believing the efficiency standards to be beneficial. The court granted motions to stay implementation of the DFR, scheduled for May 1, 2013, due to delays in issuing efficiency standards. Parties requested a strict timeline for new rules. A joint proposed format for re-briefing the case was submitted on September 28, 2013. On March 11, 2014, a new settlement was approved with DOE seeking a remand. DOE agreed to seek a remand of the non-weatherized gas furnaces portion of a direct final rule. The rule relating to energy conservation standards for non-weatherized gas furnaces were vacated and remanded for a new rulemaking proceeding. DOE also agreed to clarify its process for direct final rules, enforcement authority, and enforcement discretion for 18 months. The Court approved the settlement agreement on April 24, 2014. On April 24, 2014, the Court approved a settlement agreement vacating and remanding standards for non-weatherized gas furnaces and mobile home gas furnaces to DOE for further rulemaking. The DFR standards for these furnaces will not go into effect, instead, the 2007 Final Rule standards will be implemented starting on November 19, 2015. Other efficiency standards for furnaces, central air conditioners, and heat pumps remained in place as per the Court order. The vacatur of the direct final rule and notice of effective date is limited to energy conservation standards for non-weatherized gas furnaces. Other furnace standards remain unaffected. DOE is required to make data public before proposing new standards for non-weatherized gas furnaces within one year. The adopted settlement maintains the current national standard of 78% for central air conditioners until November 19, 2015, when a new standard of 80% will be implemented. Regional standards will also apply in certain states starting January 1, 2015. DOE is required to issue an enforcement policy statement regarding compliance with regional standards. DOE pledges not to seek civil penalties for violations of regional standards until July 1, 2016, due to uncertainty from litigation. A notice and comment rulemaking proceeding will clarify the process for promulgating Direct Final Rules. DOE issued a final rule technical amendment on July 21, 2014, reflecting the Court's order vacating amended energy conservation standards for non-weatherized gas furnaces. DOE has agreed to a new rulemaking process for residential gas furnaces as part of a settlement agreement. They will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking within one year, with a 90-day public comment period. A final rule must be issued within two years of the remand or within one year of the proposed rule. Additionally, DOE is preparing a NOPR for enforcement guidance and has established a working group to negotiate proposed requirements for regional standards. The American Gas Association (AGA) and APGA recommended separate product classes for condensing and non-condensing residential gas furnaces in a white paper issued in October 2014. They highlighted the differences in venting mechanisms, condensate disposal, and installation environments between the two types of furnaces. These differences impact consumer utility and should be considered in the DOE's standards development process. DOE agreed to reconsider separate product classes for condensing and non-condensing non-weatherized gas furnaces as per EPCA's special rule for unique product features. AGA and APGA argue that EPCA mandates distinct standards for these furnaces due to their special performance characteristics and consumer utility. DOE is urged to establish separate product classes for condensing and non-condensing gas furnaces to enhance energy efficiency in northern states. This initiative, part of the DFR for regional furnace efficiency standards, aims to expand the use of more efficient technology. The upcoming rulemaking may see the implementation of regional furnace standards, albeit in a more limited scope than initially envisioned. The DFR policy mechanism was created to expedite the energy efficiency rulemaking process, specifically addressing delays in updating furnace standards. Industry concerns about preparation time for new regional installation standards added complexity, leading to court challenges and delays. Regional standards may increase efficiency in northern states for gas furnace retrofits and new construction. The implementation of new energy efficiency standards for residential furnaces, originally set for 2013, may now be delayed until 2020. This delay could impact national energy savings goals, but it is uncertain if it will affect state energy efficiency targets. The Department of Energy published a Rulemaking Analysis Plan in March 2010 based on the criteria specified in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The DOE must set efficiency standards for covered products that maximize energy efficiency while being economically justified and leading to significant energy conservation. The standards must consider technological feasibility and economic benefits, with a thorough assessment process that includes public input and the evaluation of various trial standard levels. DOE runs an elimination process for TSLs starting with the highest technologically feasible level and lowering it until economically justified. Focus is on non-weatherized gas furnaces for teardown analysis. The DOE analyzed various types of gas and oil-fired furnaces to estimate manufacturer markup. The distribution channel for furnaces involves OEMs, distributors, contractors, and end-users. Contractors play a key role in interacting with consumers, providing installation, maintenance, and repair services. Contractors in the furnace market interact directly with consumers, offering installation, maintenance, and repair services. They sell products as part of an installation package and do not list retail prices separately. Various factors, such as local markets and weather conditions, can impact the prices contractors charge for furnaces. The DOE expects similar issues with the new DFR rule as with previous equipment rulemaking. DOE's RAP notes similarities in market participants and distribution channels for different types of equipment covered by the 2007 rule. Distributors and contractors of central air conditioners and heat pumps also service furnaces and face similar issues with regional standards. DOE's RAP highlighted concerns from distributors about potential disruptions to supply chains due to new regional standards for heating and cooling products. Distributors were worried about disparities between regional boundaries and distribution boundaries, as well as the impact on efficiency and cost control. National and regional distributors anticipated decreases in economies of scale. The distributors expressed concerns about decreases in economies of scale affecting nationwide product distribution. They anticipated increased costs in regions where certain products could not be sold, especially for distributors with service areas overlapping regional borders. Additionally, the DOE foresaw supply chain disruptions leading to higher management and compliance costs for furnace distributors and contractors due to new regional standards. The DOE Plan anticipates increased costs for distributors and contractors due to regional standards enforcement, leading to higher inventory management costs, compliance costs, and potential price increases. DOE believes additional costs from regional standards on furnace distributors and contractors would be reflected in markups. Analysis includes estimating markups changes based on inventory in different regions and enforcement costs. Energy price assumptions from EIA's projections used for Appliance Standards Program. The DOE analyzed future monetary costs of furnace equipment and energy use by selecting a consumer discount rate. The discount rate used in the analysis represents the rate from an individual consumer's perspective. The potential risk of fuel switching was also addressed. The DOE addressed the risk of fuel switching in relation to standards for higher-efficiency furnaces, considering factors like first costs, energy source prices, and potential product switching by home builders and owners. DOE will consider factors from the rulemaking on heat pumps that may influence fuel switching from furnaces, including the potential installed costs of heat pumps. To estimate cumulative energy savings, DOE will conduct NPV calculations using real discount rates of 3 percent and 7 percent, as per OMB guidelines. The 7-percent rate reflects the average before-tax rate of return to private capital in the U.S. economy. The RAP noted that DOE wanted public comment on key issues including the consensus agreement, combining equipment standards, proposed definitions of regions, and regional standard enforcement mechanisms. DOE is interested in data on these topics to assess potential financial burdens on various stakeholders. DOE seeks public input on key issues related to equipment standards and regional enforcement mechanisms for distributors, dealers, and installers. They are interested in data on potential financial burdens on stakeholders."
