    "content": "The \"Anti-Gunrunning Act of 2003\" restricts handgun transfers to one per month to prevent gun trafficking. The Congress acknowledges that crime involving drugs and guns is a widespread issue, exacerbated by the interstate movement of firearms. Handguns are easily trafficked across state lines, contributing to the national problem of illegal gun sales to prohibited individuals. The movement of firearms across state lines significantly impacts the national market for guns, enabling traffickers to acquire handguns from states with fewer restrictions and sell them anonymously without background checks or record-keeping. This illegal activity contributes to concerns about violent crime and gun violence, leading law-abiding individuals to fear traveling interstate or through certain parts of the country. Handguns sold by traffickers are often untraceable and used by criminals, exacerbating national handgun violence. Firearms trafficked across state lines lead to subsequent crimes, hindering efforts to combat illegal purchases. The Congress has the power to enact measures to prevent criminals from obtaining firearms through gun traffickers. It is unlawful for licensed dealers to sell more than 2 handguns to a single person within a 30-day period. It is illegal for individuals, other than licensed dealers, to receive more than one handgun within a 30-day period, unless for target shooting purposes with specific regulations. The curr_chunk states that handguns can be transferred to licensed private security companies for use in security operations, handguns can be delivered to licensed individuals for repair or customization, and a single handgun can be loaned or rented from a licensed individual. The curr_chunk outlines exceptions to handgun transfer regulations, including possession limits, redemption of pawned handguns, receipt by licensed collectors, replacement of lost or stolen handguns, bequest transfers, transfers to family members, and personal firearms transfers. The curr_chunk discusses exceptions to handgun transfer regulations, including transfers of personal firearms collections and penalties for false statements in required records. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to firearm regulations, including increased penalties for violations and changes to the Brady Law. The curr_chunk introduces new requirements for firearm licensees, including notifying the national instant criminal background check system of any background checks conducted within the previous 30 days that did not result in a handgun transfer. Additionally, information retained under Public Law 103-159 can be used to enforce section 922(z) of the title. The effective date of these changes will be determined by the Attorney General."
