    "content": "The ancient Bronze Age civilization of Dilmun in Bahrain was a trade hub connecting Mesopotamia and the Indus valley until trade declined around 2,000 B.C. Bahrain converted to Islam in the 7th century and has been ruled by the Sunni Muslim Al Khalifa family since 1783. They captured the island from a Persian garrison and signed a treaty with Britain in 1830, making Bahrain a protectorate. Shah Pahlavi of Iran tried to prevent Bahrain from granting oil concessions to the US and Britain. Bahrain sought permanent status as Britain reduced its military presence in the Gulf in 1968. A 1970 U.N. survey confirmed Bahrain's desire for independence from Iran. Bahrain became independent on August 15, 1971, while the other emirates formed the UAE. King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa has led Bahrain since 1999. King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, the current ruler of Bahrain, succeeded his father in 1999. Educated at Sandhurst Military Academy in Britain, he was previously commander of the Bahraini Defense Forces. King Hamad is known for his efforts towards accommodating Bahrain's Shia population, who have long felt marginalized. His son, Crown Prince Shaykh Salman bin Hamad, advocates for further reforms to address internal strife in the country. Ahmad bin Muhammad Al Khalifa suggests that additional reforms could help ease internal strife in Bahrain. The Crown Prince, Shaykh Salman bin Hamad, was strengthened by his appointment as First Deputy Prime Minister in 2013, alongside young reformists. The potential successor to King Hamad could be his younger son, Shaykh Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa. The \"anti-reform\" faction, led by Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, opposes concessions to the Shia majority. The Prime Minister, who has been in power since Bahrain's independence in 1971, is supported by Minister of the Royal Court Khalid bin. The Prime Minister's allies, known as \"Khawalids,\" are influential members of the ruling Al Khalifa family. They have allies in security, intelligence services, and the judiciary. The king, through the Prime Minister and cabinet, holds broad powers, appointing ministers and judges. Al Khalifa family members hold key cabinet positions, including defense, interior, and foreign affairs. Shia ministers are also typically included in Bahrain cabinets. Upon assuming office in 1999, Hamad became king, with a new constitution issued in 2002. The National Assembly consists of an appointed Shura Council and an elected Council of Representatives, criticized for lack of public ratification and deviation from the 1973 constitution. The Shura Council is appointed with more educated, pro-Western members, without a quota for women. The Assembly has limited power despite constitutional amendments in 2012. The National Assembly, despite constitutional amendments in May 2012, has limited power. The elected Council of Representatives has the authority to reject the government's work plan and remove individual ministers through a vote of no-confidence. The Assembly can declare \"non-cooperation\" with the Prime Minister, but the king decides on dismissal. Legislation can be originated by either chamber, but enactment requires the King's concurrence. The National Assembly has limited power despite constitutional amendments in 2012. The king's \"veto\" can be overridden by a two-thirds majority vote. King Hamad's reforms were more extensive than his father's, including the establishment of a Consultative Council. The elected national assembly established in 1973 was abolished in 1975 due to Sunni-Shia tensions. The elected national assembly established in 1973 was abolished in 1975 due to Sunni-Shia tensions. Amir Isa's refusal to restore an elected Assembly sparked daily Shia-led antigovernment violence during 1994-1998. COR elections have been held every four years since 2002, generating tension over government efforts to deny Shias a majority. Shia opposition seeks to establish election processes allowing them to translate numbers into political strength. Political parties are banned, but factions organize as \"political societies\" like Wifaq, the most prominent Shia society. Wifaq, a prominent Shia society in Bahrain, has engaged with the government in national dialogues since the 2011 uprising. Its leaders include Secretary-General Shaykh Ali al-Salman and his deputy Khalil al-Marzuq. The faction also includes Shia cleric Isa Qasim, whose citizenship was revoked in 2016. Wifaq allies with other political societies like the National Democratic Action Society and the Democratic Progressive Tribune. Al Haq, a Shia faction calling for regime change, is outlawed and its leaders imprisoned. The Bahrain Islamic Action Society and Amal, along with other Shia factions, have been outlawed and their leaders imprisoned since the uprising. Waad is a secular opposition group that includes both Sunnis and Shias. Sunni Islamist factions like Minbar and Al Asala are also prominent in Bahrain. In Bahrain, various political groups like Al Saff, the Islamic Shura Society, and the Al Wasat Al Arabi Islamic Society have been active. The National Unity Assembly (NUA), a progovernment Sunni coalition, was formed in response to the uprising. Tensions between the Shia majority and the regime escalated during elections held between 2002-2010, with Sunni candidates winning two-thirds of the seats in the Council of Representatives. In Bahrain, the government adjusted election districts to favor Sunni candidates, leading to increased Sunni voter turnout. Wifaq, a political faction, won 17 seats in the Council of Representatives, becoming the largest bloc. The King appointed a Shura Council with a diverse representation. Despite accusations of gerrymandering, Wifaq participated in the elections, increasing their seats to 18 and reducing Sunni Islamist representation. The 2011 Bahraini uprising began after Sunni Islamists were reduced to five seats in the Council of Representatives, while Wifaq gained 18 seats. Shia dissatisfaction led to major protests, with security forces clashing with demonstrators at the \"Pearl Roundabout.\" Wifaq deputies resigned, and the Crown Prince invited protester representatives for talks. In late February, large demonstrations led to the Crown Prince inviting protester representatives for formal dialogue. Many demonstrators were released, and two Al Khalifa family members were removed from the cabinet. In March 2011, the Crown Prince proposed \"seven principles\" for a national dialogue, including a parliament with full authority and fair voting districts. Protest leaders welcomed dialogue but wanted a constitutional monarchy with a fully elected parliament selecting the Prime Minister and cabinet. They also demanded an end to gerrymandering, more jobs, and economic opportunities. On March 13, 2011, protesters blockaded the financial district of Manama. On March 13, 2011, protesters blockaded the financial district of Manama, leading to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) sending forces into Bahrain on March 14, 2011. The GCC's joint Peninsula Shield force, including Saudi armored forces and UAE police, cleared demonstrators from Pearl Roundabout and demolished the Pearl Monument on March 18. A state of emergency was declared by the King on March 15, which ended on June 1. In response to opposition and international critics, a Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) was established on June 29, 2011. The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI), led by Dr. Cherif Bassiouni, investigated government response to unrest. The 500+ page report confirmed excessive force, torture, and forced confessions against protesters. It also highlighted opposition demands and lack of evidence linking Iran to the unrest. The report included 26 recommendations for holding accountable government personnel responsible for abuses. King Hamad pledged full implementation of the recommendations and established a 19-member National Commission to oversee this process. The Bahrain Government, chaired by the Shura Council Chairman, established a \"Follow-Up Unit\" to implement the BICI recommendations. While officials claim most recommendations have been fully implemented, assessments suggest partial implementation in areas like torture prevention and media access. The State Department mandated reports on Bahrain's progress, with the latest in June 2016 confirming government efforts to rebuild demolished Shia religious sites. The Bahrain government implemented reforms such as making the inspector general independent, stripping the BNSA of arrest powers, providing compensation for victims, rehiring dismissed employees, and promoting tolerance and human rights. The government of Bahrain has partially implemented recommendations on freedom of expression and needs to allow oversight agencies greater independence, according to reports by outside assessments. The government has not fully addressed the issues that caused the uprising, as highlighted in various reports by human rights organizations. The BICI process in Bahrain led to a government-opposition \"National Dialogue\" process, with 300 delegates participating, including Shia opposition members. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to restrict U.S. weapons sales to Bahrain until all BICI recommendations were fully implemented. The National Dialogue in Bahrain involved 300 delegates, including Shia opposition members. The dialogue addressed political, economic, social, and human rights issues, but the detention of senior oppositionists led to Wifaq exiting the talks. Consensus recommendations included an elected parliament with expanded powers, combating corruption, and reducing sectarian divisions. Despite opposition claims that core issues were not resolved, the National Assembly adopted the recommendations. The National Assembly in Bahrain adopted significant elements of the consensus recommendations in January 2012, which were signed into law as constitutional amendments in May 2012. These amendments imposed limitations on the king's power to appoint members of the Shura Council and required consultation with the heads of the two chambers before dissolving the COR. The COR was given the ability to draft legislation and veto the government's four-year work plan. This marked an expansion of their powers to vote no confidence against individual ministers. In January 2013, Wifaq and five allied parties accepted the King's call to restart political dialogue. The second National Dialogue began on February 10, 2013, but talks quickly stalled over opposition insistence on public referendum for consensus recommendations. The dialogue was suspended in January 2014 after the opposition boycotted the talks. The Crown Prince tried to revive negotiations with Wifaq leaders in January 2014, despite their leaders being charged. He proposed a five-point framework for dialogue, but opposition parties rejected it for not meeting their core demand of selecting a prime minister through an elected COR. No further national dialogue has taken place since then, and unrest continues at a lower intensity than in 2011. In 2017, the King signed a bill allowing military courts to try civilians for terrorism. The government has increased citizenship revocations, expulsions, and arrests of opposition leaders. Demonstrations occur annually on the February 14 uprising anniversary. The government and opposition have discussed confidence-building measures, but the King has ruled out replacing the Prime Minister. Oppositionists in Bahrain have suggested accepting a more moderate ruling family member or a Sunni non-royal leader. Hardline Sunnis, supported by Saudi officials, are against compromise. The government tried to normalize the political situation by urging opposition participation in the COR election, but reduced electoral districts to limit Shia representation. Wifaq and allies boycotted, leading to a 50% turnout with minimal violence. Independent candidates mostly won seats, reducing polarization. Sunni Islamist parties had limited success, and no pro-government candidates were elected. The 2018 COR elections in Bahrain saw tensions and criticism from oppositionists and observers for not being free or fair. Legislation banned dissolved political societies from participating, leading to Shias competing as independents. Wifaq members boycotted the vote, but a small ally participated. In the 2018 COR elections in Bahrain, tensions arose as oppositionists criticized the process for not being free or fair. Shias competed as independents, with Wifaq members boycotting the vote. Various Sunni groups also participated to avoid losing representation to independents. The final list of candidates included 293 individuals, with 41 women candidates, the highest number in any Bahrain COR elections. Only nine COR seats were decided on November 24, with two women emerging victorious. Municipal council seats were also undecided, awaiting a runoff on December 1. The government claimed a high turnout of 67%. The December 1 runoff election in Bahrain saw a high turnout of 67%, with oppositionists claiming it was only about 30%. Despite five political societies participating, 85% of the seats were won by independents. Six women achieved victories, the highest ever, and Sunnis likely constitute a majority in the Council of Representatives. The new COR elected its first female speaker, Fawzia Zainal, while Shia deputy speaker Abdunabi Salman serves as an unofficial envoy to address Shia grievances. The King excluded members of political societies from the December Shura, aggravating government-opposition tensions. Small violent underground groups have attacked security forces with bombs and IEDs, leading to arrests. In December 2017, six Bahraini Shias were sentenced to death for allegedly forming a terrorist cell. In January 2017, 10 detainees convicted of militant activities broke out of Jaw prison. According to the 2017 State Department international terrorism report, terrorist activity in Bahrain increased, with Shia militant attacks killing four police officers. The Al Ashtar Brigades (AAB) is a prominent underground group responsible for multiple bombings against security personnel, including a 2014 attack that killed three police officers. In January 2017, the government executed three Shias for this attack, the first executions since the 2011 uprising. The Trump Administration designated two Ashtar Brigades members as Specially Designated Global Terrorists in March 2017. The Al Ashtar Brigades, an Iran-based group, were designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) and a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) by the State Department. Qassim Abdullah Ali Ahmad, a purported leader, was also designated as an SDGT. The \"14 February Coalition\" claimed inspiration from Egyptian protesters and carried out attacks in Bahrain. In 2013, 50 Shias were sentenced for alleged involvement in the group. In 2017, militants attacked a key pipeline in Saudi Arabia. In November 2017, militants attacked a key pipeline supplying Saudi oil to Bahrain. Various groups, including the Bahrain Liberation Movement and al-Wafaa, are linked to the Al Ashtar Brigades. Authorities arrested individuals allegedly part of an armed network supported by the IRGC-QF. In 2018, 169 persons were charged with forming a \"Bahrain Hezbollah\" with Iranian backing. In 2019, 19 al-Wafaa activists were sentenced for maintaining links to Iran's IRGC and Lebanese Hezbollah. Oppositionists dispute the government's claims of Iran's support for these groups. The State Department reports Bahraini groups working with IRGC-QF, supplying militants with weapons. Bahrain uncovered warehouse with equipment from Iran for making EFPs. US urges Bahrain not to use force against protesters, but has not called for regime change. No sanctions imposed on Bahraini officials. The Obama Administration withheld arms sales to Bahrain, but military cooperation continued. President Obama called for reform and dialogue in Bahrain. Secretary of State Kerry expressed concern over the dissolution of Wifaq in 2016. The Obama Administration expressed concern over the dissolution of Wifaq in 2016, calling on Bahrain to reverse recent measures and work towards reconciliation. Critics cited Secretary of State Clinton's comments in 2010 praising Bahrain's commitment to democracy. In 2014, the government ordered Assistant Secretary of State Tom Malinowski out of Bahrain for meeting with Wifaq leader Shaykh Salman. In 2014, Assistant Secretary of State Tom Malinowski was expelled from Bahrain for meeting with Wifaq leader Shaykh Salman. The Trump Administration has downplayed U.S. concerns about Bahrain's human rights record and imposed new sanctions on Bahrain militant groups. President Trump assured King Hamad in 2017 that U.S.-Bahrain relations would be free of strain on human rights issues. Crown Prince Salman visited Washington, DC. In 2017, Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain visited Washington, DC, to discuss regional and bilateral issues with President Trump, including defense and economic relations. The State Department criticized the dissolution of Waad as unhelpful to political reconciliation. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo faced criticism for not publicly raising human rights issues during his January 2019 visit to Bahrain. The United States has funded programs to accelerate political reform in Bahrain and empower its political societies. The \"Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI)\" has been funding prodemocracy programs in Bahrain since 2003, including support for the Ministry of Justice's Judicial and Legal Studies Institute (JLSI) and training for judges, lawyers, and journalists. The United States provided about $350,000 for democracy and human rights promotion programs in Bahrain in FY2016, with a significant portion through the National Democratic Institute (NDI). The bulk of worldwide criticism of Bahrain's human rights practices focuses on the government. The criticism of Bahrain's human rights practices focuses on the government response to unrest, lack of accountability of security forces, suppression of free expression, and treatment of prisoners. Laws allowing jail sentences for \"insulting the king\" are used to silence opponents. Several organizations are chartered as human rights groups, but the government views them as opposition advocates. Notable groups include the Bahrain Human Rights Society, Bahrain Transparency Society, Bahrain Center for Human Rights, and Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights. In response to criticism of Bahrain's human rights practices, the government has taken steps such as reestablishing the National Institution for Human Rights (NIHR) and enhancing its powers. The country has also faced condemnation from U.N. bodies and other governments for human rights abuses. The United States, Britain, and eight other EU countries have criticized Bahrain's human rights abuses. Opposition activists have called for a U.N. Special Rapporteur on human rights in Bahrain and a formal U.N. office in the country. Bahrain has denied entry to international human rights researchers and activists. Despite advancements in women's rights, Bahrain has not taken steps to address international concerns on human rights abuses. The CoR in Bahrain elected its first female speaker after the 2018 elections. Despite some progress in women's rights, traditional customs and laws still limit them. Women can drive, own property, and initiate divorce, but face challenges in obtaining divorces and transmitting nationality. Prominent Bahraini women and organizations like the Bahrain Women's Union advocate for a codified family law. The State Department reports on religious freedom highlight discrimination against the Shia majority and clergy. The Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs in Bahrain dissolved the Islamic Ulema Council, the main assembly of Shia clerics, for alleged illegal political activity. The Court of Cassation upheld the dissolution in April 2015. In June 2016, an amendment to a 2005 law banned religious figures from engaging in political activities, aiming to weaken Wifaq. Bahrain enacted a unified personal status law in July 2017, covering both Shias and Sunnis, despite opposition from Shia legislators. The government of Bahrain allows freedom of worship for Christians, Jews, and Hindus, with registration required for non-Muslim and Muslim groups. There are 19 registered non-Muslim religious groups, including Christian churches and Hindu and Sikh groups. A small Jewish community also exists in Bahrain without facing harassment. In Bahrain, members of the Baha'i faith face discrimination but can worship openly. The country is a destination for migrant workers, particularly vulnerable domestic workers. Bahrain was upgraded to \"Tier 1\" in the 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report for key achievements in combating forced labor. In 2014, the Obama Administration waived a mandatory downgrade for Bahrain to Tier 3 after it was assessed for three consecutive years as \"Tier 2: Watch List.\" Bahrain subsequently was assessed as making notable progress on the issue of forced labor. U.S. government reports credit Bahrain with significant labor reforms, including a 2002 law granting workers the right to form unions. The right to strike is restricted for workers in certain sectors. The General Federation of Bahrain Trade Unions has many Shia members. During the 2011 unrest, the GFBTU organized general strikes protesting force against demonstrators. Nearly 5,500 workers were dismissed, including 25% of union leadership, but most were rehired. In 2015, the government made efforts to reinstate workers. U.S. MEPI funds supported AFL-CIO projects with Bahraini labor groups. The LMRA, separate from the Ministry of Labor, led recent labor reforms by dismantling the sponsorship system. The LMRA in Bahrain has implemented labor reforms by abolishing the sponsorship system and ensuring health insurance for expatriate workers. Despite public awareness campaigns against human trafficking, allegations of torture by authorities persist. Expatriate workers protested due to slow wage payments, but all back wages were eventually settled by the Ministry of Labor. The State Department's 2011 human rights report highlighted numerous reports of torture during the state of emergency in Bahrain. Since 2013, the government has not allowed visits by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture. U.S.-Bahrain ties have deepened over the years, with a long-standing bilateral security relationship dating back to World War II. Hundreds of Bahraini students study in the United States each year. Bahrain has a strong defense cooperation with the United States, with 7,000 U.S. military personnel deployed in the country. The Defense Cooperation Agreement was signed in 1991, and high-level officials have expressed appreciation for Bahrain's support. Bahrain is also a member of the GCC and engages in defense cooperation with other GCC states and NATO under the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative. Bahrain has a strong defense cooperation with the United States, with 7,000 U.S. military personnel deployed in the country. The U.S. has had a naval command presence in Bahrain since 1948, with the U.S. Fifth Fleet headquartered at NSA-Bahrain. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is headquartered at NSA-Bahrain, where over 20 U.S. and allied warships are coordinated for operations in the Arabian Sea to interdict terrorists, pirates, and weapons of mass destruction. Bahrain has a strong defense cooperation with the United States, hosting 7,000 U.S. military personnel. The U.S. military implemented a $580 million military construction program at NSA-Bahrain from 2010 to 2017, doubling the facility's size to over 150 acres. The expansion included buildings for administration, maintenance, housing, and docking larger U.S. ships, supporting the deployment of additional U.S. coastal patrol ships and the Navy's new littoral combat ship. Infrastructure for families of U.S. military personnel, including schools, was also added. The United States has spent over $2 billion to improve the NSA-Bahrain facility, with some urging the U.S. to consider alternatives due to unrest in Bahrain. The U.S. military has instructed personnel to avoid areas with demonstrations, but there is no plan to relocate the facility. The NSA-Bahrain facility has been improved with over $2 billion, but there are suggestions to consider alternatives due to unrest in Bahrain. Potential relocation options include Qatar's New Doha Port, Kuwait's Shuaiba port, and the UAE's Jebel Ali, but none have confirmed willingness to host the facility. Bahrain's Khalifa bin Salman Port is one of the few in the Gulf that can accommodate U.S. aircraft carriers and amphibious ships. In December 2014, Bahrain allowed Britain to establish a naval base at Mina Al Salman pier. In December 2014, Bahrain allowed Britain to establish a naval base at Mina Al Salman pier, where facilities were improved for Britain's Royal Navy. The GCC also announced the establishment of a joint naval force in Bahrain to cooperate with the United States. Shaykh Isa Air Base in Bahrain hosts various U.S. aircraft with funding from the U.S. About $19 million was spent on a U.S. Special Operations Forces facility in Bahrain. Bahrain was part of the U.S.-led coalition in the 1991 Gulf War, hosting U.S. troops and combat aircraft. The Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) signed between Bahrain and the United States in 1991 allows the U.S. access to Bahrain's air bases, preposition strategic materiel, conduct joint exercises, and train Bahraini forces. The agreement includes a \"Status of Forces Agreement\" (SOFA) for U.S. military personnel operating in Bahrain under U.S. law. Bahrain's participation in containing Iraq during the 1990s was facilitated by the DCA, with hosting of U.S.-led Multinational Interdiction Force (MIF) and the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM). Bahrain played a significant role in supporting U.S. military operations in the region, including hosting the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) inspection mission and deploying forces to Afghanistan and Kuwait. In 2002, Bahrain was designated a \"major non-NATO ally\" by President George W. Bush, allowing them to purchase U.S. arms and engage in defense research. Bahrain, a \"major non-NATO ally\" of the United States, can purchase U.S. arms, receive excess defense articles, and engage in defense research cooperation. The U.S. provides military assistance to enhance Bahrain's regional security missions. Sales of arms that could be used against protesters were put on hold by the Obama Administration, while the Trump Administration has maintained restrictions on such equipment. The main recipient of U.S. military assistance in Bahrain is the Bahrain Defense Force (BDF), which includes 8,000 active duty personnel. The BDF, along with Bahrain's police forces, are run by Sunni Bahrainis and also recruit personnel from Sunni Muslim neighboring countries. Human rights groups have raised concerns about the use of BDF equipment, such as Cobra helicopters, against protesters. U.S. military assistance to Bahrain is primarily in the form of Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to purchase and maintain U.S.-origin weapons. The Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program is used to help Bahrain purchase and maintain U.S.-origin weapons, enhance interoperability with U.S. and GCC forces, augment air defenses, and improve counterterrorism capabilities. Some FMF funds have been used to build up Bahrain's Special Operations forces and support the use of U.S.-made Blackhawk helicopters. The Defense Department estimates that about 50% of Bahrain's forces can integrate into a U.S.-led coalition. FMF to Bahrain has been reduced since the unrest began to push for political reforms. The Obama Administration's FY2012 aid request included $25 million in FMF for Bahrain, but only $10 million was provided. The United States has provided significant military assistance to Bahrain, including support for maritime security, upgrading the Coast Surveillance System, and providing coast patrol boats, training for special forces, and biometric equipment. Bahrain has also received over $400 million worth of excess defense articles since 1993, including tanks and naval equipment. In July 1997, the United States transferred the FFG-7 \"Perry class\" frigate Subha to Bahrain as Excess Defense Articles (EDA). Bahrain decided to maintain the Subha instead of receiving another frigate. Bahrain receives International Military Education and Training funds (IMET) to promote civilian control of the military and interoperability with U.S. forces. About 100 BDF students attend U.S. military schools annually through the IMET program. Bahrain's defense equipment is mostly of U.S.-origin, with purchases including F-16 aircraft. In 2016, Bahrain requested new F-16Vs worth nearly $4 billion. The Obama Administration conditioned approval on human rights improvements, but the Trump Administration dropped this requirement. In 2017, a potential sale of 19 F-16Vs and upgrades for existing F-16s were notified to Congress. The sale process for Bahrain's defense equipment included the approval of a possible sale of a variety of munitions, including AMRAAMs and large bombs for its F-16 fleet, at an estimated value of $750 million. A resolution of disapproval for the sale was introduced on May 13. The State Department approved a potential sale to Bahrain of ballistic missiles and rockets valued at $300 million, with joint U.S.-Bahraini control to address concerns about missile proliferation. A resolution to block the sale was introduced but was not advanced by the Senate. Additionally, Bahrain was made eligible to receive Stinger missiles under a foreign operations appropriation act. The United States has sold Bahrain Stinger missiles and armored vehicles, including Humvees and TOW missiles. The sale was initially put on hold due to concerns about human rights abuses, but was later approved by the State Department in June 2015. In June 2015, the State Department announced the sale of weapons to Bahrain would proceed due to progress on human rights reforms. In September 2017, the Trump Administration notified Congress of a potential sale of 221 TOW missiles valued at $27 million. The weapons were intended for Bahrain's maritime defense. The Trump Administration notified Congress of potential sales of weapons to Bahrain, including fast patrol boats and attack helicopters. Bahrain is also upgrading naval vessels and has Patriot missile defense batteries deployed. Limited budget constraints Bahrain's role in coordinated missile defense efforts. The State Dept. approved a potential sale of Patriot missile defense system to Bahrain worth $2.5 billion. Bahrain has diversified arms supplies, including purchases from Russia like the S-400 missile defense system. This could lead to U.S. sanctions under CAATSA. Bahrain faces terrorist threats from Iran-backed and Sunni jihadist groups, with some Bahrainis convicted for supporting the Islamic State. Critics claim security services use antiterrorism laws to suppress Shia dissidents. US cooperation with Bahrain's Interior Ministry on counterterrorism is limited due to concerns over brutality towards Shia population. The departure of Ian Henderson in the late 1990s did not improve the Interior Ministry's reputation for brutality among the Shia population. Despite the expulsion of Malinowski in February 2014, some U.S. cooperation with the Ministry resumed later that year. The Trump Administration has maintained restrictions on working with the Ministry and selling it arms, as confirmed by Ambassador Justin Siberell in September 2017. Sales of U.S.-made small arms to the Interior Ministry are typically commercial, licensed by the State Department with Defense Department approval. In May 2012, the State Department halted license requests for small arms, light weapons, and ammunition sales to Bahrain. The FY2014 Consolidated Appropriation Act prohibited U.S. funds for small arms, light weapons, and ammunition to Bahrain for crowd control purposes. The Trump Administration has maintained restrictions on new sales of U.S. arms to Ministry of Interior forces, except for Bahrain's Coast Guard. The United States provides assistance primarily to the Ministry of Interior. The United States provides assistance to the Ministry of Interior through NADR funds to combat violent extremists and terrorist groups. The MOI Police Force's progress on counterterrorism and criminal investigations has been hindered by a lack of training and outdated methods. The use of NADR-ATA funding for the ministry was reviewed to ensure it was not used against protestors. The Leahy Law requirement led to the cancellation of planned ATA courses for Bahrain in 2015, but one course did take place that year according to the 2015 State Department report on international terrorism. The Trump Administration allocated $400,000 in NADR funds in FY2018 to train MOI personnel in investigative techniques with a human rights focus and combat terrorist use of explosives. Bahrain has been a leader in countering terrorism financing and hosts the MENA/FATF secretariat. Bahrain's financial intelligence unit cooperates with the Egmont Group and U.S. efforts against terrorism financing and money laundering. Bahrain cooperates with U.S. efforts against terrorism financing and money laundering, amending laws to increase monitoring and penalties. King Hamad issued decrees imposing prison sentences and financial penalties on those raising funds for terrorist groups. Bahrain hosts workshops on combating terrorist financing and is part of the U.S.-led anti-Islamic State coalition. In 2017, Bahrain joined the U.S.-GCC Terrorist Financial Targeting Center to coordinate counterterrorism financing efforts. Bahrain's Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs leads efforts to counter radicalization by organizing workshops for clerics from both Sunni and Shia sects and reviewing school curricula. The country drafted a National Countering Violent Extremism strategy in 2016. Bahrain's foreign policy aligns with other GCC states, especially regarding Iran, and it has a close relationship with Saudi Arabia. Bahrain's close relationship with Saudi Arabia is evident through their alignment on foreign policy, including interventions in regional conflicts. The unresolved dispute with Qatar poses a challenge to the proposed Middle East Strategic Alliance against Iran. Efforts to forge GCC unity have been hindered by the intra-GCC rift, delaying the formal launch of MESA. Recent communication between Bahrain and Qatar hints at potential reconciliation. Bahrain's close relationship with Saudi Arabia is demonstrated by the social ties between the two countries, including a causeway connecting them. The proposed political and military union among GCC states, known as the \"Riyadh Declaration,\" faced opposition from other GCC states. Bahrain also has political ties with Kuwait, with both royal families sharing historic connections. Kuwait has at times tried to mediate the political crisis in Bahrain, despite some resentment from Shias in Kuwait. Shias in Kuwait resent Kuwait's alignment with Bahrain's ruling family. Kuwait, along with Saudi Arabia and UAE, provided financial aid to Bahrain. Bahrain's relations with Qatar have been strained due to territorial disputes dating back to the 18th century. The territorial dispute between Bahrain and Qatar was referred to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which ruled in favor of Bahrain on the Hawar Islands but awarded Fasht al-Dibal reef and Zubara town to Qatar. Qatar accepted the ruling despite expressing disappointment. Bahrain has supported Saudi-led isolation of Qatar and withdrew its ambassador in 2014 due to disagreements over Qatar's support for Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated movements. In December 1981 and June 1996, Bahrain accused Iran of attempting to organize a coup by pro-Iranian Bahraini Shias. In September 2018, Bahrain charged 169 individuals for allegedly forming \"Bahrain Hezbollah\" with support from the IRGC-QF, citing Iranian statements as evidence of Iran's intent to overthrow the government. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i criticized the revocation of Bahraini citizenship as \"blatant foolishness and insanity.\" The revocation of Bahraini citizenship was criticized by Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i as \"blatant foolishness and insanity,\" seen as removing a barrier between Bahraini youths and the state. The Trump Administration supports the view that Iran arms Shia militants in Bahrain, with Bahrain backing Saudi Arabia in disputes with Iran. Bahrain broke diplomatic relations with Iran in 2016 and declared Hezbollah a terrorist organization, closing Future Bank, a Bahrain bank owned by Iranian banks. Bahrain has expressed support for Iran's right to civilian nuclear power but opposes its development into weapon-grade nuclear capabilities.
