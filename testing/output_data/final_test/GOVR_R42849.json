    "content": "Iranian acquisition of ballistic missiles and pursuit of a space launch capability are of concern to Congress due to Iran's nuclear program, support of anti-U.S. and anti-Israel militant movements, and past sanctions. Congress has established reporting requirements on Iranian WMD and ballistic missile programs and supported funding for BMD programs to counter Iranian missiles. The U.S. is considering deploying a ballistic missile defense site on the East coast to defend against potential Iranian ICBMs. The House allocated $103 million in the FY2013 defense authorization bill for this purpose, while the Senate version does not include such a provision. The House FY2013 defense appropriations bill (H.R. 5856) and the Senate defense appropriations bill did not include a provision regarding Iran. Iran is a topic of concern for policymakers due to its regime's threat to U.S. interests, as highlighted by President George W. Bush in 2002. The Obama Administration also views Iran as a major threat to U.S. national security interests. The United States views Iran as a threat to its regional security interests due to its nuclear programs and military assistance to armed groups. Decision makers agree on the danger posed by Iran, with the Obama Administration prioritizing Iran's nuclear program as a top concern. Iran's nuclear program is a top concern for the Obama Administration, leading to U.S. and international sanctions. Iran's ballistic missile programs are also a major worry for various countries. Concerns over Iran's threat affect Russia, Israel, the Middle East, Europe, and beyond, with recognition of the growing danger posed by Iran's development of long-range ballistic missiles. Iran's ballistic missiles challenge U.S. military capabilities and influence in the Middle East, causing concern among various countries including Russia, Israel, and the Gulf States. The failed Iranian space launch in 2008 raised suspicions about Iran's potential desire to build nuclear weapons, with concerns about their growing inventory of ballistic missiles. Iran has the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle East, expanding in scale, reach, and sophistication. These missiles pose a threat to U.S. forces and allies in the region, deterring potential military engagement. Iran views its missile forces as integral to its strategy for deterrence and retaliation against regional forces, including the U.S. Iran's ballistic missiles pose a threat to U.S. forces and allies in the region, deterring potential military engagement. Iran's neighbors could be blackmailed into meeting demands, such as raising oil prices. U.S. military action against Iran would be challenging and could impact oil prices significantly. Iran is seen as a challenge to U.S. national security interests in the region. Iran's progress in developing ballistic missiles poses a threat to U.S. national security interests in the region. Concerns over the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems, especially ballistic missiles, have led to an increase in U.S. military sales of anti-missile systems to Persian Gulf states. Iran's self-sufficiency in ballistic missile production raises fears of potential supply to other nations or actors. The prospect of Iran armed with a nuclear ballistic missile creates a less stable and reliable deterrence dynamic compared to the past. Iran's ballistic missile and space launch programs are major drivers of the U.S. BMD program. The United States remains concerned about Iran's potential intercontinental range ballistic missile (ICBM) program, with assessments suggesting Iran could develop an ICBM capable of striking the United States with foreign assistance. The 2012 DOD Annual Report on Military Power of Iran stated that Iran may be capable of testing an intercontinental ballistic missile by 2015, with improved accuracy and new submunition payloads. The Pentagon's plan to deploy the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) in Europe and possibly the Persian Gulf is based on potential Iranian missile threats to U.S. allies and friends. The Alliance declared an interim territorial missile defense capability in Chicago, based on U.S. BMD assets under NATO command to guard against missile attacks from Iran. The EPAA aims to develop and deploy BMD over four phases by 2020, with Phase 1 completed in 2011. Phase 2 is expected by 2015, but future of EPAA may be affected by defense spending limitations. The U.S. EPAA will be integrated with other BMD systems developed by NATO member states under NATO command. Some analysts suggest that countries could threaten U.S. territory by deploying shorter range missiles on surface ships, bringing them close to coastal areas. This report focuses on Iran's efforts to develop ballistic missiles and a space launch capability with assistance from other countries and entities. Iran's progress in developing ballistic missiles is challenging to assess due to the secrecy and obfuscation surrounding its capabilities. While many U.S. allies also have ballistic missile programs, it becomes problematic when pursued by a state hostile to the U.S. Iran's pursuit of a ballistic missile program raises concerns, especially if it involves developing a weapon of mass destruction like a nuclear weapon. While no major intelligence community has confirmed Iran's decision to develop nuclear weapons, its civilian nuclear program actions raise doubts about its intentions. Developing an effective nuclear weapons capability involves unique technical challenges that must work together as an operational system. The report focuses on Iran's ballistic missile and space programs, emphasizing the need for a reliable nuclear warhead for the proliferation of Iranian ballistic missiles to be considered a significant imminent threat. The report emphasizes the need for a reliable nuclear warhead for the proliferation of Iranian ballistic missiles to be considered a significant imminent threat. It relies on official sources and acknowledges the challenges of varying accounts from non-government sources. The report discusses the challenges in rocket science and missile engineering, highlighting the difficulties faced by the United States in developing ballistic missiles. Despite its capabilities, the Pentagon encountered technical issues when developing a new solid rocket motor for the Ground-based Interceptor. Eventually, they opted for an interceptor based on existing launch vehicles. Iran faces challenges in developing new missile systems despite its persistence and indigenous capabilities. Unlike advanced states with established expertise, Iran's industrial base is significantly challenged. However, Iran continues to improve its capabilities in rocket science, leveraging established technology and facing international opposition. Iran's missile development efforts are limited compared to advanced countries like the United States and Russia. While these countries have conducted numerous missile flight tests over the years, Iran has conducted very few tests of its modern missiles. This lack of testing raises concerns about the confidence Iranian decision makers and military leaders may have in their missile systems. Iran's limited missile development efforts raise concerns about the confidence Iranian decision makers and military leaders may have in the reliability and performance of their ballistic missile force. Difficulties in developing rocket motors, including the impact of sanctions and export control regimes, add to the challenges. Missile engineering requires direct experience and trial and error, especially in formulating solid propellants for specific missile systems. Despite the well-understood rocket science principles, the predictability of solid rocket motor performance depends on subtle factors. The predictability of solid rocket motor performance depends on subtle factors, requiring extreme reliability controls in manufacturing. Developing an effective ballistic missile involves a guidance system and testing for data to create mathematical models. Errors can accumulate from silo to launch, necessitating rigorous testing to reduce structural or inherent errors. Operational tests are crucial to assess system reliability. Operational tests are crucial to ensure the success of ballistic missile systems. Strong management and organization are key factors in a good missile program, with Iran being assessed to have an impressive organizational and managerial program. Their disciplined and well-structured approach to missile development is unique in the proliferation world. Iran's missile development program is unique and well-structured, surpassing DPRK, Iraq, and Pakistan. Despite relying on foreign sources for key items, Iran's capabilities allow them to produce missiles of their desired range. Aaron Karp highlights the complexity of missile programs, emphasizing the importance of skills, experience, and judgment in engineers and program managers. Foreign assistance plays a significant role in ballistic missile development. Karp emphasizes the importance of appropriate organization and managerial choices in successful ballistic missile programs. An incremental development strategy, like the one pursued by Iran, has proven to be the most effective. States that take huge leaps in their missile programs tend to face greater difficulties. The UK and India faced challenges in their missile programs due to taking huge leaps in development. Assessing and projecting ballistic missile capabilities has been proven unreliable, leading to failed efforts in timing responsive measures accurately. The US was surprised by the Soviet Union's advancements in space rocket and ballistic missile capabilities, while projections for MRBMs and ICBMs in 1990 were inaccurate. Projections of ballistic missile trends in countries may not materialize as expected, with assessments in 2000 showing no developing country had acquired long-range missile capabilities as forecasted in 1990. Missile proliferation estimates can slow, halt, or even reverse from earlier assessments. The developmental record of successful nuclear-armed ICBM states demonstrates the significant technical effort and resources required. Despite 50 years of commitment, operational failures still occur occasionally in missile programs. The ease of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile from a space launch program has not been seen in emerging missile and rocket powers. India may have used elements of its space program to develop an ICBM-range missile in 2012. The small number of ICBM programs may be due to few countries perceiving the need for ICBMs. Five countries make ICBMs, while nine have successful SLVs similar to ICBMs. The time and resources required by nuclear-armed ICBM states do not necessarily apply to other ICBM contenders. Iran's missile proliferation is complex, with varying names for missiles and differences in capabilities. Despite this, Iran is somewhat transparent in its ballistic missile activities, regularly showcasing them publicly. Iran demonstrates transparency in its missile and space launch programs, showcasing tests and conducting televised interviews with officials. This openness is seen as a signal of transparency to the United States and other countries, considering the lack of diplomatic relations or arms control agreements. Iran acknowledges that its activities are visible to satellite systems of countries controlling the space above Iran. Iran's transparency in missile and space programs is evident through showcased tests and televised interviews. However, there are doubts about relying on Iranian statements due to their history of misleading information. Iran wishes for U.S. satellites to observe their weapons sites, but they have been known to make deceitful statements about their ballistic missile and space launch programs. The report raises serious doubts about relying on Iranian statements regarding their ballistic missile and space launch programs. It highlights examples of Iranian misinformation, including photo-shopped test results and misleading claims about satellite launches. The report emphasizes the need for further corroboration of Iranian statements due to the potential for distortions in the media. Iranian media may distort information about ballistic missile capabilities. Questions raised about accuracy of translations leading to misinformation. Iran has invested in developing ballistic missiles and space launch capacity. Lack of public detail on actual number of missiles Iran possesses. Iran's interest in developing ballistic missiles dates back to the 1960s and is tied to its regional security interests. The U.S. intelligence community believes Iran's strategic objectives include regime survival, regional power dominance, and economic advancement. Iran's growing inventory of ballistic missiles is a concern due to the lack of public information on the actual number of missiles they possess. The U.S. intelligence community believes Iran's expanding inventory of ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles enhance its power projection capabilities. Iran views its conventionally armed missiles as a deterrent and continues to develop ballistic missiles capable of targeting Arab adversaries. These missiles are inherently capable of carrying Weapons of Mass Destruction, fitting into Iran's strategy for regional defense. Iran continues to develop ballistic missiles capable of targeting Arab adversaries, Israel, and central Europe, including an extended-range variant of the Shahab-3 and a 2,000-km medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) called the Ashura. Iran has improved the lethality and effectiveness of its missile systems with accuracy enhancements and sub-munition payloads. There is limited open-source data on Iran's military expenditures, with reports indicating an annual spending of about $6.2 billion (U.S. constant dollars) from 1997-2009, placing Iran fourth among Gulf States and the GCC in military spending. Iran's military expenditures rank fourth among Gulf States and the GCC, placing it sixth in the world based on GDP. Iran has an extensive ballistic missile and space launch complex scattered throughout the country, with various missile sites and suspected production facilities. Some ballistic missiles have been deployed near major cities like Tehran and Shiraz. Iran has multiple ballistic missile and space launch sites scattered throughout the country, including locations near Qom, Qeshm Island, Garmshar, Sharud, Semnan, and Tabas. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Air Force operates Iran's ballistic missile forces, with short-range ballistic missiles having ranges of less than 1,000 km. Some analysts differentiate tactical ballistic missiles with ranges between 10-300 km. Iran views its short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) as a crucial part of its military capability, providing an effective mobile capability to strike coalition forces in the region. The exact number of Iran's SRBMs is not publicly disclosed, but it is estimated to be in the hundreds with 50-100 launchers. These systems are continuously being improved for survivability through technological advancements. Figure 2 illustrates the locations and estimated operational ranges of Iran's SRBMs. The curr_chunk discusses the operational ranges of Iranian SRBMs and their origins from Libya and Syria during the Iran-Iraq War. It also mentions imagery of short-range missile bunkers in western Iran. Iran acquired Soviet Scud B and Scud C SRBMs from North Korea during the Iran-Iraq War, renaming them Shahab-1 and Shahab-2. These liquid-fueled ballistic missiles are now produced by Iran with some foreign-produced components. The Shahab-1 and Shahab-2 are road-mobile systems that can be moved to various launch sites. Iran acquired Soviet Scud B and Scud C SRBMs from North Korea during the Iran-Iraq War, renaming them Shahab-1 and Shahab-2. These missiles operate within a radius of about 100 km from their bases for operational security. The Shahab-1 has a range of about 300 km, while the Shahab-2 has a range of about 500 km. Iran likely has a few hundred of these missiles, with the only reported test in August 2010. The Qiam missile, based on the Shahab-2, has a range between 500 and 1,000 kilometers. The Qiam missile, Iran's first missile without stabilizer fins, is harder to detect and has high precision targeting capabilities. It was delivered to the Aerospace Force of the IRGC in late May 2010. The design reduces the possibility of detection by enemy anti-missile systems and increases speed for accurate hits. Gen. Vahdi stated that the Qiam is self-sufficient in missile production, with supersonic speed making it difficult to track or intercept. The Fateh-110 missile is a solid-fuel, road-mobile tactical ballistic missile with a range of about 200 km. An upgraded version was tested in 2012 with a new guidance system, claimed to strike targets up to 300 km away with high accuracy. Experts doubt this claim, stating the missile's maximum range is only 200-250 km. Iran has invested in acquiring MRBMs with a range of 200-250 km, viewed as a deterrent to military action. The number of deployed MRBM launchers has grown from less than 20 to less than 50 by 2009, with some possibly housed in underground bunkers. The missiles are believed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads, targeting U.S. bases in the region. Official numbers of deployed MRBMs are not publicly disclosed by the U.S. government. Iran has invested in acquiring MRBMs with a range of 200-250 km as a deterrent. The number of deployed MRBM launchers grew to less than 50 by 2009, possibly housed in underground bunkers. Official numbers of deployed MRBMs are not publicly disclosed by the U.S. government. Other sources lack preciseness on the exact number of MRBMs Iran has deployed. Possible ranges of Iranian MRBMs are illustrated in Figure 4, showing the area potentially covered by these missiles. Iran has developed medium-range ballistic missiles, including the Shahab 3 and Ashura. Iran faces geographical constraints in testing its ballistic and space launch systems due to its shape. Gen. Rahim-Safavi highlighted the limited distances available for testing within Iran. Iran's MRBM tests may be based on observing missiles fired non-optimally, such as in lofted or nominal trajectories. It is unclear if Iran has the telemetry capabilities for true ballistic trajectory testing. If MRBM tests land over land, it may suggest a lack of capability. Iran lacks telemetry and instrumentation devices in its ballistic missile programs, but Uzi Rubin argues that recent missile tests show Iran's capability to deploy instrumented ships or aircraft near impact points in the Indian Ocean to gather data. Rubin believes Iran's quick recovery from failures implies abundant telemetry data and suggests that a successful space program would require a full suite of telemetry and ground support equipment. This section provides an overview of Iran's MRBMs, with the Shahab-3 being a ballistic missile. Iran's Shahab-3 ballistic missile, based on the No-dong 1 from DPRK, has been rapidly manufactured by Iran since the early 1990s. It has undergone various modifications, potentially giving it a range of 800-1,000 km. Iran has also developed longer-range missiles like the Ghadr-1 and Sejil to extend its ballistic missile capabilities. Iran has developed longer-range missiles such as the Sejil or Ashura, including the Ghadar-1 with a range of 1,000-2,000 km. The Ghadar-1 features a smaller payload, lighter airframe, improved guidance system, and a separating warhead for carrying airburst warheads or submunition packages. In 2006, Western intelligence experts suspected Iran of modifying the Shahab-3 missile with a triconic warhead, possibly for a nuclear payload. The design, possibly from North Korea, could indicate higher accuracy for nonnuclear missions. Official confirmation is lacking. Reports indicate that Iran has not officially confirmed its decision to develop a nuclear weapon, causing concern among decision makers. The Shahab missile programs in the 1990s may have led to the development of the Shahab-3 MRBMs or the Ghadr-1. Other reports suggested Iran was working on solid- or liquid-fueled MRBMs or space launch vehicles, possibly leading to programs like the Ashura/Sejil. Confusion remains over designations like Shahab-5 and Shahab-6, but these programs likely evolved into Iran's current ballistic missile and space launch initiatives. Iran may have launched two programs today, one leading to the Ashura/Sejil and the other to the Safir space launch vehicle. The Sejil is a solid-fueled ballistic missile with a range of about 2,000 km, possibly up to 2,500 km. The Ashura, later renamed Sejil, was announced in November 2007 with an unsuccessful test. The Sejil, previously known as Ashura, is a solid-fueled ballistic missile that Iran successfully flight tested in November 2008. Additional tests of the Sejil or a more advanced version (Sejil 2) occurred in 2009. The missile is believed to be nuclear-capable, with a payload capacity for a first-generation nuclear warhead. The issue of whether Iran acquired Soviet-era R-27 SLBMs or components remains unresolved. The origin and design of the BM-25 missile, also known as Musudan, used by Iran and North Korea, remains unclear and controversial. The debate among experts revolves around whether Iran acquired these missiles or their components, which could potentially enhance their ballistic missile capabilities. Some experts believe Iran may possess BM-25 missiles acquired from North Korea, with ranges of 2,500 km and 3,500 km. A 2011 UN report mentioned Iran receiving 19 BM-25 missiles in kits from North Korea. German missile scientists confirm the BM-25's presence in North Korean and Iranian arsenals. Iran's display of the BM-25 in a 2007 parade was actually a different, short-range missile. The Washington Post reported in 2010 that Iran may have obtained BM-25 missiles from North Korea, but there is uncertainty about their existence in Iran as they have not been publicly seen or tested. US officials relied on a 2005 article from a German tabloid quoting intelligence sources. Some analysts believe the missiles shown in North Korea were mock-ups. Some analysts believe North Korea displayed mock-up BM-25 missiles, possibly based on Soviet-era technology. Experts like Michael Elleman suggest components of the R-27 missile may have been smuggled to North Korea in the 1990s without Russia's knowledge. Ted Postol and Elleman argue that Russia never acknowledged this transfer to protect its reputation. Russia's reputation as a country that claims to have never sold technology that could be used in an intercontinental ballistic missile is being questioned. Some missile parts and components, or their design features, have made their way into North Korean and Iranian missile and space launch programs. Postol has pointed out similarities between the Iranian Safir space launch missile and the R-27 missile, suggesting a potential transfer of technology. This was further highlighted during the June 2011 \"Great Prophet\" military exercises by Iranian military leaders. Iran has a secret network of underground missile silos housing Shahab-3 missiles, different from those of the US, Russia, and China. The large chamber and tunnel reduce challenges for missile launches. Iran's IRGC Aerospace Forces Commander claims capability to attack American facilities in the region with these missiles. The network has been built over the past 15 years. Iran has a secret network of underground missile silos in Iran, housing medium and long-range missiles. The UN has not confirmed their operational status. Iranian interest in these silos dates back to 1993, with construction possibly starting in 1996. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu mentioned Iran's activities in 1998. Construction of Iranian missile silos may have started as early as 1998, with claims of hardened sites being made in 2006 and more specific details emerging in 2008. Blogs mentioned a possible silo missile base near Tabriz, Iran around that time. Between 2003 and 2005, a silo complex was built near Tabriz, Iran, consisting of two missile silos for Shahab-3 series IRBMs. Additional silos were constructed in 2007-2008 and 14 kilometers west of Tabriz. Satellite imagery from around 2000 confirms the presence of these missile silos in northwest Iran. The construction of a second silo site near Tabriz, Iran, was gradually observed through satellite imagery from around 2000 to 2011. This site, labeled 'Site 2', was mentioned by O'Connor and has not been officially acknowledged by the US. In June 2011, British Foreign Minister William Hague accused Iran of conducting secret tests of ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons, which was denied by an Iranian spokesman. In 1929, Iran denied British allegations of testing missiles with nuclear capability. The UN report revealed Iran's missile tests, including a Shahab-3 with an 800 km range and Sejil 1 with a 2,000 km range. The UK believed Iran was hiding the extent of their weapons programs. The report was not circulated due to opposition from China and Russia at the UN Security Council. The UN report disclosed previously undisclosed Iranian MRBM tests, including the launch of Sejil/Ashura in October 2010 and a Sejil and Shahab-3 test in February 2011. Iran later admitted to test-firing two long-range missiles into the Indian Ocean in early 2011. The tests were likely of the Sejil-2 or Shahab-3 missiles, with no public announcement or condemnation from the United States. Iran's recent missile tests, including launches of Sejil/Ashura and Shahab-3 missiles, were not publicized by Iran. Possible reasons for this lack of publicity include failed tests, testing of new ranges, or a decision to not demonstrate MRBM capabilities publicly. Iran's recent missile tests, including launches of Sejil/Ashura and Shahab-3 missiles, were not publicized by Iran. The lack of publicity could be due to failed tests, testing of new ranges, or a decision to not demonstrate MRBM capabilities publicly. Concerns over UNSCR 1929 were raised, with Iran claiming to have flown a 2,000 kilometer missile, which was not independently verified. Despite the lack of public announcement, these tests could still be verified by others. The United States and other nations did not criticize Iran for these tests, possibly to forge consensus for additional sanctions behind closed doors. U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN Susan Rice complained about Iran's noncompliance with UNSCR 1929 in June 2011. Iran's noncompliance with UNSCR 1929 in June 2011 was noted, with troubling findings of violations related to Iran's missile launches. The Final Report in June 2012 did not mention earlier tests due to a different reporting period. The U.S. Government may have withheld public release of the information to facilitate talks with Russia. The United States defines ICBMs as ballistic missiles with ranges over 5,500 kilometers. Only five countries have operational ICBMs with nuclear weapons: US, Russia, China, France, and UK. Some countries like Iran are believed to have ICBM programs. Possession of ICBMs complicates US planning and intervention, according to Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet in 2000. The U.S. intelligence community has warned since the late 1990s that Iran could develop an ICBM capable of reaching the United States by 2015. Iran denies this, but open-source analyses suggest otherwise. This raises concerns about Iran's ballistic missile capabilities and potential space launch technology for ICBMs. The U.S. intelligence community has warned since the late 1990s that Iran could develop an ICBM capable of reaching the United States by 2015. In 2010, the DIA assessed that Iran could develop and test an ICBM with foreign assistance. Iran demonstrated progress in space launch technology with the Safir and Simorgh vehicles. The 2012 annual report on Iran's military power to Congress reiterated that Iran has launched space launch vehicles that could be used to develop long-range ballistic missile technologies. These assessments focus on Iran's ability to test an ICBM but do not make judgments on their capability to deliver a nuclear warhead at ICBM range. These assessments are the basis for U.S. military efforts to respond to the Iranian ICBM threat. The U.S. military is working on responding to threats like the Iranian ICBM program through various efforts, including the BMD program and diplomatic actions like sanctions. There is no consensus within the U.S. intelligence community on the likelihood of an Iranian ICBM test, with some predicting it before 2015 and others believing it is unlikely before that time. The U.S. assessments also consider the need for foreign technology for Iran to develop an ICBM capability. Iranian ICBM capability may rely on foreign technology from North Korea or Russia. Some argue it could be developed from the Iranian space program. Iran demonstrated space launch capability in 2009, but there is no evidence of an ICBM test. A UN Security Council Panel of Experts in 2012 noted similarities between ballistic missile and space launch programs. The Panel noted that space launch programs are often developed from ballistic missile programs, with some arguing that the U.S. assessment of Iran's potential threat is a worst-case scenario. Different governments have varying opinions on Iran's capability to develop ICBMs, with the UK House of Commons report stating Iran's space launch aspirations could lead to longer-range missile technology by the end of the decade. Iran could potentially test long-range ballistic missiles by the end of the decade. In 2005, reports suggested Iran acquired assembly kits for mobile BM-25 missiles from North Korea. Russia denied any transfer of missile technology to Iran and stated that Iran lacked the technological capability to build ICBMs. Iran lacks the technological and technical resources to build intercontinental ballistic missiles, according to Russian officials. They believe Iran is far from developing missiles that could reach the United States due to a lack of appropriate materials for mass production. Israel also predicts Iran will have ballistic missiles capable of striking the United States in the future. Israel believes Iran will have ballistic missiles capable of striking the United States within two to three years. Israeli Finance Minister Steinitz stated that Iran is investing billions to develop ICBMs that could reach the east coast of America. A UN report in 2012 raised doubts about Iran's ability to produce long-range missiles independently. Iran relies on foreign suppliers for missile components and materials. Experts doubt Iran's ability to build longer range missiles independently. Iran imports engines and critical components for its liquid-fueled missiles. Iran denies developing ballistic missiles capable of reaching the US, despite intelligence assessments suggesting otherwise. Defense Minister Ahmad Vahdi stated Iran has no plans to build such missiles. Iran denies collaborating with other nations to develop ICBMs and obtaining ballistic missiles from North Korea. The Commander of the Aerospace Division of the IRGC stated that Iran has the technology but no intention of producing missiles with ranges greater than 2,000 kilometers. Iran's focus is on targeting U.S. and Israeli bases in the region, with the Iranian Space Agency coordinating its space activities. The Iranian Space Agency (ISA) was established in 2004 to support Iran's peaceful space activities. It falls under the leadership of a Supreme Council of Space chaired by the President, responsible for policy making, satellite use, and regional cooperation. ISA is affiliated with Iran's Ministry of Communication and Information and conducts space launches from the Semnan Launch Center. Iran has established a new space launch complex in the Sistan and Baluchistan Province, near Qom and Emamsharh. This location allows Iran to launch rockets in a southeastern direction over the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. The complex is about 80% complete, with speculation that it is being built in southeastern Iran. Launch corridors are somewhat constrained to avoid overflying other countries like Oman and Pakistan. Iran's new space launch complex in southeastern Iran, near the Gulf, is highly vulnerable to attack, suggesting its purpose is for space launch activities. The complex would greatly enhance Iran's space launch capabilities, with range safety concerns alleviated by launches occurring over the ocean. Iran previously used the Safir SLV to launch the Omid satellite into orbit in 2009 and continues to develop this liquid-fueled SLV. Iran continues to develop its liquid-fueled Safir SLV, with the Safir-2B designed to carry a 50-kilogram payload into low-earth orbit. Iran also displayed a more powerful rocket named Simorgh, capable of carrying a 60-kilogram payload. The launch of Simorgh, now called Safir-2, was delayed but is expected to occur at a new site in Semnan or a planned space complex in southeastern Iran. Iran became the ninth country to demonstrate an indigenous space launch capability. Iran became the ninth country to demonstrate an indigenous space launch capability on February 2, 2009 by launching an Omid satellite from a Safir 2 rocket. The launch took place at the Semnan Missile and Space Center east of Tehran and the satellite reentered the atmosphere on April 25, 2009. Despite Iran claiming Omid was a communications satellite, U.S. officials expressed concerns about Iran's missile capabilities and the technical basis for developing long-range ballistic missile systems. The Department of Defense expressed concern about Iran's launch of a satellite, noting the potential dual-use capabilities that could be applied towards developing long-range ballistic missiles. Analysts suggest Iranian missile experts may have modified Soviet-era rockets for their space program. Iran launched two additional satellites, Rasad-1 and Navid-e Elm-o Sanat, for imaging and experimental purposes. Iranian Defense Minister announced the development of Fajr and Rasad satellites with high-resolution imaging capabilities and a space laboratory called Explorer-4. Iran is preparing a space laboratory called Explorer-4 and has named four satellites to be launched: Fajr, Rasad, Amir-Kabir-1, and Zafar. Iran has outlined plans to develop, test, and launch rockets into space to study its effects on animals in preparation for manned space flight. Iran launched a rocket in 2007 and a sub-orbital rocket named Kavoshgar-1 in 2008. Iran launched a series of rockets named Kavoshgar-1, Kavoshgar-2, Kavoshgar-3, Kavoshgar-4, and Kavoshgar-5 between 2008 and 2011. These rockets carried scientific data, a space laboratory, animals, and a monkey on board. Despite some failures, Iran announced plans to resume sending live animals into space in 2012. Iran expressed interest in manned space flight during a Soviet-Iranian Summit in 1990, but plans were disrupted by the break-up of the Soviet Union. In 2008, Iran announced plans for its own manned space program, aiming to launch a manned mission into space within a decade to become the leading space power in the region by 2021. President Ahmadinejad stated in 2010 that Iran's first astronaut would be sent into space on an Iranian spacecraft. Iran's first astronaut is planned to be sent into space on an Iranian spacecraft by 2019, following a manned sub-orbital spaceflight by 2016. There are rumors of Iranian involvement in a Chinese space station. Iran's commitment to a public manned space effort suggests a legitimate space launch program, despite concerns about its potential connection to long-range ballistic missiles. Iran's efforts to procure ballistic missiles and develop a space launch infrastructure have been extensively covered in articles and news stories. While some details may be accurate, it can be challenging to distinguish accurate information from inaccurate accounts. Official government sources offer broader trends over time but lack specificity. This section aims to provide an overview of foreign cooperation with Iran's ballistic missile and space launch programs, highlighting Iran's close working relationships with other countries in developing its indigenous capabilities. Iran developed its own indigenous solid-propellant rocket industry in 1982, but also relied on other countries for whole systems, components, and training to build up its ballistic missile force. While Iran is self-sufficient in major parts of its ballistic missile programs, it still depends on outside sources for key missile components, especially for its longer range ballistic missile program. Iran's ballistic missile program began with cooperation from Libya and Syria in the 1980s, acquiring Scud-B missiles. Iran also developed a close relationship with North Korea for missile development, becoming self-sufficient in its programs. Currently, Iran likely surpasses North Korea in technical capacity for ballistic missile development. Iran has likely surpassed North Korea in developing ballistic missiles, but may still rely on others for certain materials. North Korea has sold missile technology to countries like Syria and Iran, with concerns about their willingness to sell to any country with the cash to pay. Iran has discussions for a 1,000 km missile and is likely to receive it from North Korea. By the end of the 1990s, Iran could assemble short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles. Russia's report states Iran's missile potential is based on Scud B SRBMs from Syria and North Korea. North Korea was upgrading Scud-class missiles obtained from Egypt and exporting them to countries like Iran. The DPRK was also testing the \"Nodong 1 IRBM\" for potential sale on the global market. Iran and North Korea had a close relationship, with North Korea providing ballistic missile technology to help Iran achieve self-sufficiency in MRBM production. This collaboration allowed Iran to shorten the acquisition time for an ICBM. Iran could shorten the acquisition time for an ICBM by purchasing components from North Korea. Iran publicly acknowledged obtaining missiles from North Korea in 2006 but claimed self-sufficiency in missile production. Doubts remain about Iran's ability to produce missiles indigenously without foreign support. The IC provided testimony on Iran's relationship with North Korea regarding ballistic missile technology. Russian involvement in Iranian missile programs evolved slowly, with uncertainty about government involvement. Despite Russian government efforts to curb involvement, Russian entities expanded their role, accelerating Iranian missile programs. Russian arms transfer agreements with Iran totaled $1.6 billion from 2004-2007, but Russian involvement has since decreased. During the Soviet era, Iran did not acquire ballistic missile systems, technology, or training from the Soviet Union. Concerns arose in the 1990s about former Soviet defense industries potentially selling missile technology for profit, with Russia and Ukraine showing a willingness to violate the MTCR. In the 1990s, there was a growing willingness to sell prohibited missile technology due to internal pressures. Reports of transfers were often hoaxes, but some sensitive technology did go to China. Concerns were raised about China passing advanced military technologies to others. By 1996, Russia had become a primary source of missile goods for foreign countries, especially Iran. The 1997 threat assessment mentioned Iran's potential ballistic missile cooperation with Russia. In 1997, Iran acquired Kilo-class submarines from Russia and upgraded its anti-ship missile capabilities. Russian officials issued a decree in 1998 to prohibit exports of items used for developing WMDs. Despite some signs of slowing proliferation activities, the U.S. Intelligence Community noted the challenge in restricting dual-use technologies. The 1998 721 Report highlighted Iran's acceleration of missile development with Russian technology, despite some positive steps taken by Russian officials to curb proliferation activities. Russian assistance continued in various aspects of Iran's missile program, aiding in the development of more advanced and longer-range missiles. The 1999 721 Reports highlighted Russia's continued supply of ballistic missile-related goods and technology to Iran, despite efforts to curb proliferation activities. Economic conditions in Russia worsened, increasing pressure on Russian entities to bypass export controls. Russian entities provided substantial missile-related technology, training, and expertise to Iran, accelerating Iranian efforts to develop longer-range ballistic missiles. The 1999 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) stated that Iran could test an ICBM capable of delivering a payload to the United States by the late 2000s with Russian assistance. Russian entities continued transferring missile technology to Iran until at least 2010, helping Iran move towards self-sufficiency in missile production. However, Iran still relies on foreign suppliers for key components, including Russian suppliers. Ongoing cooperation between Russia and Iran was reported in the 721 Reports to Congress during the 1990s. In recent years, there have been concerns about Russian entities cooperating with Iran on proliferation activities. However, the 2011 and 2012 reports to Congress did not indicate ongoing cooperation between Russian entities and Iranian ballistic missile programs. Iran is moving towards self-sufficiency in missile production but still depends on foreign suppliers for key components, with entities in China, Russia, and North Korea being likely suppliers. The specificity of earlier Russian cooperation with Iran is now more ambiguously described. The specificity of earlier Russian cooperation with Iran on ballistic missile programs is now more ambiguously described, with reports indicating collaboration with other countries and foreign entities. The open-source literature contains speculative and misinformed information, limiting the public policy debate on informed and accurate assessments. Two different schools of thought exist within the expert community on the extent of Russian involvement in Iran's ballistic missile programs. The official, unclassified record does not definitively confirm either view. One view suggests Iran may have gained access to Russian ballistic missiles via North Korea with technical assistance from Russia and China, possibly funded by Iran. Authors argue that licensed production arrangement may still be ongoing, leading to Iranian possession of North Korean-origin ballistic missiles. Iran may have acquired North Korean-origin ballistic missiles through collaboration with North Korea, Russia, and China. There are debates on whether Iran reverse-engineered Soviet-era missiles with Russian assistance or received licensed production lines. Michael Elleman argues that there is no concrete evidence of Iran independently obtaining liquid-fueled engine technology. Iran may have acquired North Korean No Dong engine with Russian assistance for their ballistic missile programs. MIT Professor Ted Postol believes the Shahab series are of North Korean origin, adapted in Iran with some reverse engineering. He acknowledges possible Russian assistance but also highlights Iranian expertise in developing their ballistic missiles. The extent of Russian involvement in Iran's missile capabilities remains uncertain. China has been involved in proliferating WMD and ballistic missile programs to other countries, posing a major concern for the United States. While some U.S. policymakers see China's progress as too slow, others believe progress is being made towards nonproliferation objectives. China has implemented export controls and works with the United States to prevent proliferation activities within its borders, forcing countries like Iran to exploit weaknesses in the Chinese system. China's arms transfer agreements with Iran decreased significantly from 2004-2011. The U.S. Intelligence Community expressed concerns about China selling longer-range missiles and technology to produce them to other countries, potentially leading to the proliferation of WMD capabilities, especially in the Middle East. In 1996, Russian intelligence assessed Iran's missile programs were limited to Scud purchases from Syria and North Korea. Iran faced challenges like a shortage of skilled personnel, technology, materials, and financing. The Intelligence Community warned that China and other entities were willing to sell missile systems to developing countries, potentially including Iran. The IC reported to Congress about China's role in providing missile-related goods to Iran, describing China's assistance as significant. Iran's efforts to acquire foreign missile technology were relentless, with China playing a key role in helping Iran achieve self-sufficiency in missile production. By 1998, the IC noted that Chinese defense industries were under pressure to become profitable. China's defense industries faced pressure to become profitable, leading them to seek WMD technology partnerships with Pakistan and Iran. China's contributions to WMD advancements in these countries were significant, despite having laws governing nuclear exports. The IC regularly expressed concerns about Chinese entities providing missile-related items to countries of proliferation concern, such as Iran. The IC reports to Congress regularly discuss Chinese involvement in missile programs with Iran and other countries, despite PRC commitments to restrict exports. China's stance on MTCR commitments differs from the US, possibly due to lax enforcement of laws. Chinese entities, both private and state-owned, are reported to engage in WMD-related proliferation activities. The US has imposed sanctions on Chinese companies for such sales. China's lax enforcement of export control legislation has led to Chinese entities supplying missile-related items to Iran, Syria, and Pakistan. Despite Iran's self-sufficiency in ballistic missile programs, the US Intelligence Community believes Iran still relies on foreign suppliers for key missile components. The United States has imposed sanctions on Chinese companies for their involvement in WMD-related proliferation activities. Iran continues to procure missile components from foreign sources, including navigation guidance units, control systems, and high-quality production materials like carbon-carbon and aluminum powder. China has provided solid-propellant production facilities and equipment, contributing significantly to Iran's missile capabilities. Iran has gained knowledge and capabilities in operating solid fuel missile facilities with help from China. This has allowed Iran to potentially develop solid fuel missiles of any size and range, although it will require time and resources. Iran is now seen as a growing proliferator with self-sufficiency in missile technology. There are concerns about Iran exporting its ballistic missile systems or knowledge to other countries. Additionally, Iran has assisted Syria in developing solid-propellant rocket motor capabilities, but the ongoing civil war in Syria may hinder progress. Iran's determination to develop ballistic missiles and space launch capabilities, despite international opposition, raises concerns about its military intentions and potential proliferation of technology. The effectiveness of slowing down Iran's programs and forcing them to seek less reliable alternatives is questioned. The debate over finding alternatives to deal with Iran's ballistic missile and space launch capabilities is ongoing, with no consensus on the best approach. Some question the feasibility of ending Iran's pursuit of these capabilities, while others suggest that Iran is unlikely to change its behavior without a regime change. The United States and its allies may have limited options beyond the current path. Additionally, there are indications that Congress's views on the Cold War-era deterrence policy may be evolving in the face of nuclear and missile threats. The evolving views of Congress on Cold War-era deterrence policy, influenced by nuclear and missile threats, suggest a shift towards considering defensive options as less destabilizing. Declaration 2 in the Resolution of Ratification for New START indicates a broader assessment of missile threats beyond rogue states like Iran, challenging even mature missile powers like Russia to adopt a more defensive posture. This could lead to a devaluation of offensive missile and nuclear weapon programs. The focus on assessing rogue states' progress in ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs may become less intense in Congress as U.S. policies become more broadly based. Congress will likely continue to monitor Iran's role in the region and its missile programs, but it is unclear if there is more Congress can do to affect Iran's commitment to its ballistic missile and space launch programs. Cooperation and oversight with the Administration will be key in staying prepared to take additional action as needed. Since 2006, Iran has conducted military exercises known as \"Great Prophet\" exercises, which include ballistic missile tests. These tests provide valuable information to intelligence communities assessing Iran's ballistic missile programs. Iran conducts \"Great Prophet\" military exercises to test and evaluate ballistic missile programs, showcase military capabilities, and provide operational training. The exercises include missile launches shown on Iranian media and YouTube. This appendix tracks and details the missile launch components of these exercises. Iran conducted military exercises named \"Great Prophet\" in 2006, involving missile launches. Reports were conflicting about the types of missiles launched, with Iranian media mentioning radar-evading anti-ship missiles, multi-warhead missiles, and torpedoes. Outside observers were skeptical of Iranian claims, with some suggesting the weapons were of Russian or Chinese origin. The Pentagon expressed doubts about Iran's technical capabilities and noted their tendency to exaggerate. Iran claimed to have tested an improved intermediate-range ballistic missile, but a Pentagon official mentioned a Shahab-2 SRBM test. Iran conducted military exercises in November 2006 to demonstrate power and enhance deterrence capability. They tested advanced weapons, conducted operational tactics, and coordinated land, naval, and air operations. Iran also expressed readiness to share missile systems with allies and neighboring countries. Iran conducted military exercises in November 2006 to demonstrate power and enhance deterrence capability. They test-fired a variety of missiles, including Shahab-2, Shahab-3, Zolfaghar-73, Scud B, Fateh-110, and Zelzal, with enhanced range and cluster warheads. They also launched new naval warfare missiles named Noor, Kowsar, and Nasr, covering the Strait of Hormuz, Persian Gulf, and Sea of Oman. The U.S. naval commander expressed concern over the threat posed by these missiles to vessels in the region. In July 2008, Iran conducted missile tests in the Strait of Hormuz and the desert, showcasing their military capabilities. Iran conducted missile tests in the Strait of Hormuz and the desert from July 8-10, 2008. The missiles were launched from the Semnan Missile Test Range with warheads impacting within Iran or its coastal waters. U.S. officials and others determined that no new capabilities were demonstrated, with uncertainty over the exact number of missiles launched. Television footage showed at least six missiles firing simultaneously, including the Shahab-3. Iran conducted missile tests in the Strait of Hormuz and the desert from July 8-10, 2008. There was confusion over the number of missiles launched, with reports suggesting Iran may have doctored photos to exaggerate their success. The U.S. intelligence community expressed skepticism towards Iran's disclosures about their missile tests. The State Department emphasized that the focus should be on Iran testing increasingly longer and more capable missiles in the region. Iran conducted military and missile exercises in September 2009, launching Shahab-3 and Sejil-2 MRBMs. Iranian missiles were said to have a range of 1,300 \u2013 2,000 kilometers. The exercise aimed to evaluate technical developments in surface-to-surface missiles, including simultaneous and successive launches of various tactical ballistic missiles. Iran conducted military exercises in April 2010 and June 2011, launching various tactical ballistic missiles including Shahab-1, Shahab-2, Zelzal, and Fateh-110. The exercises aimed to strengthen Iran's deterrent power and ability to respond to aggression. No short or medium-range ballistic missiles were launched in the April 2010 exercise. Iran conducted military exercises in April 2010 and June 2011, launching various tactical ballistic missiles including Shahab-1, Shahab-2, Zelzal, and Fateh-110 to strengthen its deterrent power. Reports indicated the launch of Qiam SRBM, Shahab-3, Ghadr, or Sejil MRBM, with up to nine missiles fired simultaneously. The Department of Defense confirmed a multiple missile salvo, unveiling underground missile silos for the first time. Iran claimed the silos were built indigenously, while Israel suggested they were built with DPRK assistance. Iran's hidden silos were reportedly built with DPRK assistance, with one analyst suggesting a DPRK missile launch from a silo. The location of the silos near Tabriz and Khorramabad was kept secret by Iran. IRGC deputy commander BG Hossein Salami stated that Iranian missiles have aggressive, tactical, and defensive features. Iran began building a network of silos across the nation 15 years ago, with a Shahab-3 missile fired during military exercises in July 2012. Iran held military exercises and missile launches in July 2012, firing various types of ballistic missiles. The exercises were meant to send a message to potential aggressors, including the US and Israel, about Iran's readiness to defend itself. The missile tests showed improved accuracy, with 90% success rate reported. Iran conducted missile tests in July 2012, demonstrating improved accuracy with 90% hitting their targets. Iran warned that 35 U.S. military bases in the Middle East are within their missile range and could be destroyed within seconds. Additionally, Iran claimed to have launched a missile capable of reaching targets 2,000 km away but only fired it to a range of 1,300 km. No official U.S. response was reported regarding Iran's claims."
