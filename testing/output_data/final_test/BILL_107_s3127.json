    "content": "The Private Well Testing Assistance Act, also known as the Safe Drinking Water Act, provides assistance for testing private wells. Congress finds that over 15 million households in the US rely on private drinking water wells. While owners are responsible for testing, cases of contamination often require costly state agency tests. Federal funding is available for initial assessments but not for regular sampling to prevent contaminant migration. Many State governments lack resources for regular testing of drinking water wells near suspected groundwater contamination areas. State fiscal conditions are worsening, with revenue below estimates in 43 States and cuts in public services in 36 States. Economic conditions have led to the discontinuation of many State well testing programs. Many State well testing programs have been discontinued, increasing the risk for households with private drinking water wells. Federal assistance with a State cost-sharing requirement could incentivize regular testing of drinking water wells near areas of suspected groundwater contamination. Definitions include the Administrator as the head of the EPA and an \"area of concern\" as a geographic area where groundwater may be contaminated or threatened. The curr_chunk defines terms related to hazardous substances, pollutants, contaminants, and substances of concern, including their meanings as per the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. The Administrator will establish a program to provide funds to each State for testing private wells, and regulations will be promulgated to determine areas of concern within 30 days of enactment. The State must submit an application to the Administrator for funds, including a certification of potential threats to human health posed by groundwater in each area of concern. The Administrator will approve or disapprove the application within 15 days. The Administrator will provide funding to States for testing private wells based on the number of wells, local testing costs, and substances of concern. The funding will not exceed $500 per well, unless certain wells require more funding. The Federal government will cover up to 80% of the cost for testing private wells, with the non-Federal share allowed in cash or in kind. States will consider seasonal groundwater variations and contamination levels when determining the number and frequency of tests for private wells in areas of concern. The Federal government will cover up to 80% of the cost for testing private wells, with limitations on the number of tests allowed. Assistance for testing private wells under this section is in addition to any other federal assistance for the same purpose. A report must be submitted to Congress within one year of the section's enactment. The Ground Water Association must submit a progress report to Congress on the implementation of this section. Authorization of $20,000,000 is allocated annually for fiscal years 2003 through 2006, with each State receiving a minimum of 0.25 percent of the total amount."
