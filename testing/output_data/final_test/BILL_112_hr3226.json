    "content": "Restoration of TANF Emergency Contingency Fund. The Social Security Act is amended to establish the Emergency Contingency Fund for State Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Programs with a $10 billion appropriation for fiscal year 2012. The funds will be available through fiscal year 2013. The Emergency Contingency Fund for State Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Programs will provide grants to States in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, with limitations on grants after 2013. Grants will be given to States based on caseload increases in each quarter of the specified fiscal years. The Emergency Contingency Fund provides grants to States based on caseload increases in each quarter, with the grant amount being 80% of the difference in caseload from the base year. The Emergency Fund provides grants to States based on increased expenditures for basic assistance or non-recurrent short term benefits in specific quarters. The Emergency Fund provides grants to States based on increased expenditures for non-recurrent short term benefits in specific quarters, if the State meets certain requirements. The Emergency Fund provides grants to States for increased expenditures on non-recurrent short term benefits in specific quarters, with the grant amount being 80 percent of the excess described. Additionally, grants are also provided for increased expenditures on subsidized employment in fiscal year 2012 or 2013. The Emergency Fund provides grants to States for subsidized employment expenditures that exceed those in the corresponding quarter of the emergency fund base year. The Emergency Fund provides grants to States based on 80 percent of the excess in subsidized employment expenditures. The Secretary can adjust data to ensure comparability for caseload and assistance expenditures. The Secretary may develop a mechanism for collecting expenditure data and set deadlines for revisions. The total amount payable to a single State for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 combined is limited. States can only use the funds as authorized by section 404, and the implementation of this subsection should be done as quickly as possible. The subsection applies to Indian tribes with approved tribal family assistance plans under section 412. Definitions include \"average monthly assistance caseload\" and \"emergency fund base year.\" The term 'emergency fund base year' refers to either fiscal year 2009 or 2010, depending on which year had the lesser amount for a State and specific category. Categories include the average monthly assistance caseload and total expenditures for non-recurrent short term benefits. The term 'qualified State expenditures' refers to total state spending on subsidized employment programs funded under this part. The modification of the Caseload Reduction Credit allows states to choose the emergency fund base year for fiscal years 2011 or 2012. The emergency fund base year for the State's average monthly assistance caseload can be chosen for fiscal year 2011, with amendments to the limitation on total payments to territories under the Act."
