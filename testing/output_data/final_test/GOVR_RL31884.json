    "content": "Since the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, there has been interest in expanding citizenship benefits for aliens in the military. The deaths of noncitizen soldiers in action highlighted provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act granting posthumous citizenship for those who die during active-duty service in hostilities. Title XVII of P.L. 108-136 amended military naturalization and posthumous citizenship statutes, providing immigration benefits for immediate relatives of military personnel. Between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2008, approximately 45,000 service members were naturalized, with 6,196 being naturalized abroad or on Navy ships at sea. Posthumous citizenship was granted to 118 service members. As of June 2008, there were 4,255 pending military naturalization applications, with almost 60% completed within 120 days. The report provides an overview of naturalization based on military service, current law and policy, data on noncitizens in the military, and legislative proposals. Title 3, Chapter 2 of the INA allows all LPRs to potentially become citizens through naturalization. To become citizens through naturalization, LPRs must reside in the US for five years (three for spouses of US citizens and military members), show good moral character, and pass English and civics tests. Fees of $675 are paid, and USCIS handles the process. Expedited naturalization is available for noncitizens serving in the military. Noncitizens serving in the U.S. military can petition to naturalize after one year of service during peacetime or immediately during military hostilities. Certain requirements are waived, including continuous residence in the U.S. Posthumous citizenship is granted to noncitizens who die during active duty, with benefits extended to immediate family members. The number of approved naturalization petitions fluctuated in the mid-1990s but increased from FY2003 to FY2006. The number of approved naturalization petitions fluctuated in the mid-1990s, dropped in FY1997, rose in FY1999, and increased from FY2003 to FY2006. Military naturalizations coincided with the Persian Gulf Conflict and the War on Terrorism. President George W. Bush designated the period after September 11, 2001, as a \"period of hostilities,\" allowing immediate naturalization eligibility for active-duty U.S. military service members. During the War on Terrorism, President George W. Bush allowed immediate naturalization eligibility for active-duty U.S. military service members. Special naturalization provisions for aliens serving in the military have been in place since the Civil War, with specific conditions varying under different statutes enacted before the Immigration and Nationality Act. The early statutes governing naturalization through military service had various requirements, including residency, years of service in the Navy or Marine Corps, age, and honorable discharge. Subsequent statutes had similar requirements with variations in service length and residency waivers. Statutes during World War I and the Korean War allowed naturalization proceedings abroad for the first time. During World War I, the statute waived naturalization fees, required a declaration of intent to naturalize for reenlistment, and set deadlines for filing based on service periods. Filipinos needed three years of service for naturalization. Special provisions for wartime service were enacted during specific wars until the Vietnam War. Special provisions for wartime service were enacted during specific wars until the Vietnam War. Congress enacted laws to include the Korean War and the Vietnam War, amending the INA in 1968 to allow the President to designate periods of armed conflict for naturalization purposes. Only two additional periods of hostilities have been designated since the Vietnam War, including the Persian Gulf Conflict in 2002. President Clinton designated the Persian Gulf Conflict and President Bush designated the War on Terrorism as periods of hostilities. The Grenada campaign designation was invalidated by a federal court due to geographic limitations. Military actions in Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Haiti, and Panama were not designated as periods of hostilities. During World War II, special considerations were made for Filipino veterans who fought the Japanese in the Philippines, a U.S. territory at the time. Congress amended \u00a7329 in 1990 to address their status, exempting them from certain requirements. Naturalization processing was allowed in the Philippines, with special considerations applying to applications filed by February 2, 1995. Additionally, members of Hmong guerilla units were also given special consideration. The Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000 provided exemptions for Laotian refugees who supported the U.S. military during the Vietnam War. Special provisions were given to guerrilla veterans, their widows, and spouses, with a limit of 45,000 beneficiaries. Applications had to be filed within three years after specific dates in 2000. The Lodge Act, enacted in the 1950s, allowed aliens who enlisted outside the US to naturalize if they completed five years of service and were honorably discharged. It expired in 1959. Prior to the current statute on posthumous citizenship for those who die in active-duty service during hostilities, posthumous grants were done through private laws for specific individuals, with no immigration benefit for surviving relatives. The authority to grant posthumous citizenship was established in 1989. Before Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, there were 57,754 foreign nationals serving in the U.S. Armed Forces, with over 37,000 noncitizens among the 1.4 million in active duty, making up 2.6% of the total. Almost 12,000 foreign nationals were in the Selected Reserves, and 8,000 in the Inactive National Guard and Individual Ready Reserves. The Navy had the largest number of foreign nationals (15,845 or 27.8%), followed by the selected reserves (11,861 or 20.8%) and the Army (11,523 or 20.2%). By 2007, there was a shift in foreign nationals serving in different military branches, with a decrease in total numbers. The Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines had 21,752 foreign nationals in active duty, while the Reserves, Inactive National Guard, and Individual Ready Reserves had 23,285 foreign nationals. The Navy had the largest number of foreign nationals (36% of all noncitizens in the military), followed by the National Guard (21%). In 2007, there was a shift in foreign nationals serving in different military branches, with a decrease in total numbers. The top source countries for aliens in the armed forces were the Philippines, Mexico, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, and Haiti. The Navy had the largest number of foreign nationals, followed by the National Guard. In 2003, foreign nationals from the Philippines were the largest group in the Armed Forces, followed by Mexico, Jamaica, El Salvador, and Haiti. California was the top state for alien military members, followed by New York, Florida, and Texas. Other top states included New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland, Virginia, Massachusetts, and Washington. The accession location for military naturalization is where the alien's unit is located, not necessarily where they have resided the longest or where their family lives. There are provisions for expedited naturalization based on military service during peace time, war time, and posthumous naturalization. Immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen who died during a period of hostilities can also be naturalized without specific residency requirements. USCIS provides a fact sheet on military naturalizations. Section 328 of the INA allows for expedited naturalization through military service during peacetime. Service can be in inactive reserve units, including National Guard organizations. Fees for naturalization are waived, and the applicant must have served at least one year and file the application while in service or within six months of leaving. Honorable service or discharge is required, and naturalization may be revoked if discharged under other than honorable conditions. Naturalization through military service under Section 328 of the INA allows for expedited naturalization without the usual residency requirements. Revocation may occur if the service member is discharged under other than honorable conditions before serving honorably for a five-year period. Good moral character, allegiance to the US, knowledge of civics and English are still required. Lawful permanent residence is necessary for naturalization, but enlistment is limited to citizens or LPRs. Section 329 of the INA allows for expedited naturalization through U.S. military service during designated periods of hostilities, including World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf Conflict, and the War on Terrorism. Enlistment is limited to citizens or LPRs, and fees for naturalization apply. Naturalization through U.S. military service during designated hostilities allows for expedited citizenship. Eligibility requires active-duty service, honorable discharge, and no specified residency period. Revocation possible if discharged dishonorably before five years of honorable service. No residency or physical presence requirement prior to application. Naturalization through U.S. military service during designated hostilities allows for expedited citizenship. No residency or physical presence within the United States is required prior to application. Other requirements include good moral character, allegiance to the United States, knowledge of civics and English. Waivers are available for certain conditions, such as being subject to a final order of removal. Fees for naturalization application may be waived under specific provisions. The waiver of fees for naturalization applications based on active-duty service during designated hostilities is found at 8 U.S.C. \u00a71440e. This waiver dates back to a World War I statute and is still in effect. The definition of \"active-duty\" excludes inactive service in reserve or National Guard units. The INA allows for posthumous naturalization for those who died while on active-duty during designated periods of hostilities. Before this provision, posthumous citizenship could only be granted through private legislation. The next-of-kin or representative had to file a request within two years of the date of enactment for past hostilities or the death of the noncitizen member of the Armed Forces for other periods. Posthumous naturalization under the INA allows for granting citizenship to those who died while serving in the U.S. military during designated periods of hostilities. Legislation was enacted to extend the deadline for requesting posthumous citizenship for eligible individuals who died during past hostilities. The conditions for posthumous grant include serving honorably during World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, or other designated periods of hostilities, with death resulting from injury or disease incurred during service. Posthumous citizenship can be granted to individuals who died while serving in the U.S. military during designated periods of hostilities. The request for posthumous citizenship must be filed within two years of the service member's death, and the service branch must certify honorable service during a designated period of hostilities. The USCIS/DHS will approve the request if the individual enlisted in the U.S. or its territories or was admitted as a LPR after enlistment. Posthumous citizenship is a symbolic honor granted to noncitizens who died in defense of the United States. It does not automatically affect the immigration status of surviving family members, but benefits were extended to them under P.L. 108-136. Prior to this, INA \u00a7319(d) allowed for the naturalization of the surviving spouse of a U.S. citizen who died while serving in the military. Section 1703 of P.L. 108-136 expanded naturalization benefits to the surviving immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen who dies during honorable service in the U.S. Armed Forces, including children and parents. This provision also applies to service members who died on or after September 11, 2001, and were granted posthumous citizenship. Surviving spouses, children, and parents of a U.S. citizen who died as a result of combat-related injury or disease may self-petition as immediate relatives. Immediate relatives of a U.S. citizen who died in combat-related circumstances can self-petition for lawful permanent residency within two years of the citizen's death. Certain immigration benefits are also available to spouses, children, and parents of aliens who served in the U.S. Armed Forces and died as a result of combat-related injury or disease. Certain grounds of inadmissibility are waived for family members of military service members seeking lawful permanent residency. Exemption from selective service registration or a draft, desertion from the Armed Forces, or evasion of the draft can bar individuals from naturalization, even if they subsequently enlist and serve honorably. Individuals who evade the draft or desert the Armed Forces may be barred from naturalization, even if they later enlist and serve honorably. Certain restrictions apply to lawful permanent residents (LPRs) enlisting in the military, including limitations on reenlistment, officer commissions, and positions requiring security clearance. Exceptions exist for citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia or the Republic of the Marshall Islands under the Compacts of Free Association. The United States provides defense for countries without armed forces, allowing their citizens to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. The Secretary of Defense authorized a program for recruiting nonimmigrant aliens with critical skills vital to national interest, such as physicians and nurses. The limited pilot program recruits up to 1,000 individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds to enhance military readiness. Certain occupations like intelligence operations and special forces require U.S. citizenship, with restrictions on noncitizens serving in the Air Force. Extensions may be granted for noncitizens awaiting naturalization. The Coast Guard requires U.S. citizenship or LPR status for enlistment, with naturalized citizens needed for reenlistment. Nonimmigrants and LPRs with prior military service are not eligible to enlist. Noncitizens in the Coast Guard cannot become officers. The Coast Guard security manual does not explicitly require U.S. citizenship for officers, but refers to federal guidelines. Nonimmigrant and undocumented aliens have enlisted in the military despite restrictions. Expedited naturalization under 8 U.S.C. \u00a71427(f) may be relevant for aliens contributing to national security. The provision allows for up to five aliens per year to be naturalized if they have made extraordinary contributions to national security or intelligence activities. The usual residence and physical presence requirements are waived, but the alien must be otherwise eligible. The Director of National Intelligence/CIA must inform congressional committees before the application is filed. The provision allows for up to five aliens per year to be naturalized based on extraordinary contributions to national security or intelligence activities. Residence and physical presence requirements are waived, but the alien must be eligible and have continuously resided in the US for one year prior to naturalization. The naturalization ceremony can occur in any federal district court, and proceedings must align with intelligence protection. Special immigrants are defined as those who served honorably in the US Armed Forces after October 15, 1978, for a total of 12 years under specific conditions. Special immigrants who have served in the US Armed Forces for a total of 12 years under specific conditions may be granted special immigrant status, allowing them to be paroled into the United States and adjust their status. This provision also extends to the spouse or child of the immigrant if recommended by the executive department. These special immigrants, even under peace-time military naturalization provisions, are likely to qualify for naturalization due to their length of service. The legislative activity since September 11, 2001, has focused on streamlining the naturalization process for military personnel and providing immigration benefits for their immediate relatives. P.L. 108-136, the Defense Department FY2004 Authorization bill, was the result of congressional efforts to address these issues. The provision benefits nationals of the Philippines, Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, particularly Philippine nationals in the U.S. Navy. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, known as H.R. 1588, amended military naturalization statutes to expedite citizenship for military personnel. It was a result of legislative efforts following the events of September 11, 2001, and the War on Terrorism. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 expedited military naturalization by amending existing statutes. Changes included reducing the service period for naturalization to one year, waiving fees for military service, allowing revocation of citizenship under certain conditions, processing naturalization overseas, providing priority consideration for military personnel, and extending naturalization to members of the Selected Reserve. The USCIS designee can request posthumous citizenship with next-of-kin permission. The law grants immigration benefits to immediate relatives of citizens who die from combat-related injuries. Immediate relatives can self-petition for immigrant status within two years of the service member's death or posthumous citizenship grant. Adjustment requirements and public charge grounds are waived for eligible family members of deceased U.S. citizens. Survivors of U.S. citizens who died during active-duty service, including posthumous citizens after September 11, 2001, can naturalize without prior residence requirements. The INA Act references were changed to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Provisions are retroactive to September 11, 2001, with fee waivers and naturalization abroad effective from October 1, 2004. Legislation like the Active Duty Naturalization Accommodation Act of 2004 aimed to expedite naturalization for military service members. The legislation provided additional flexibility for service members stationed abroad in active duty to meet naturalization requirements. It allowed for suspension of requirements and deadlines until 30 days after returning to the US. U.S. nationals could attend military academies and receive ROTC scholarships on the condition of naturalizing before graduation. The DREAM Act of 2007 allowed two years of military service to count towards achieving LPR status. Only LPRs and nationals of certain countries with Compacts of Free Association with the US are permitted to enlist in the Armed Forces. The Kendell Frederick Citizenship Assistance Act proposed waiving the fingerprint requirement for Armed Forces members who submit a naturalization application within 12 months of enlistment. Other legislative proposals included the Soldiers to Citizens Act, aiming to provide citizenship benefits to aliens serving in the military. The Soldiers to Citizens Act (S. 3947) proposed allowing aliens to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces and granting them U.S. citizenship after two years of service during hostilities. Other related legislative proposals aimed to expedite naturalization for military service members. Several bills aimed to expedite military naturalization by removing requirements for English and civics knowledge, good moral character, and allegiance to the US. They also eliminated the specific period of service and allowed veterans to apply for naturalization at any time. Additionally, H.R. 661 proposed immigration benefits for spouses, children, and parents of US citizens who died in combat zones related to Operation Iraqi Freedom. The provisions of P.L. 108-136 aimed to establish guidelines for immigration benefits for survivors of service members who died during honorable service in the U.S. Armed Forces, extending naturalization eligibility to spouses, children, and parents of deceased service members. The provisions of P.L. 108-136 extended naturalization eligibility to survivors of service members who died during honorable service in the U.S. Armed Forces, including spouses, children, and parents. Additionally, legislation such as H.R. 901 and H.R. 4498 aimed to prioritize immigrant visas for children and adult sons and daughters of Filipino World War II veterans, with waivers for naturalization requirements for adopted children of military personnel stationed outside the U.S. The Kendell Frederick Citizenship Assistance Act allows military service members' spouses and children to maintain their LPR status while accompanying the service member abroad. It also streamlines the naturalization process by allowing the use of fingerprints taken by the DOD at enlistment for military-service naturalization applications. The Kendell Frederick Citizenship Assistance Act streamlines the naturalization process for military service members by allowing the use of fingerprints taken at enlistment for naturalization applications. It also requires cooperation between Homeland Security and Defense to make biometric data more accessible for naturalization purposes. Rapid electronic transmission of biometric data is to be implemented within one year of enactment. The Kendell Frederick Citizenship Assistance Act mandates timely updates to agency websites and application forms after changes to military naturalization regulations. The Secretary of Homeland Security must submit a report on the adjudication process for military-service-based naturalization applications within 120 days of enactment, focusing on methods, supervision, training, and technology use. The Comptroller General and Inspector General of the DHS are also required to provide reports. The Kendell Frederick Citizenship Assistance Act requires the GAO and IG of the DHS to study technology for military naturalization efficiency and its impact on privacy. They must submit a report to congressional committees within 180 days of the Secretary of Homeland Security's report on the adjudication process. The immigration reform bills, S. 1348 and H.R. 1645, included provisions for a toll-free telephone service to assist military service members with naturalization. The issue of requiring fingerprints from military personnel was addressed by USCIS, with changes made in collaboration with DOD and FBI. The Military Personnel Citizenship Processing Act expedites military service-related applications by allowing the use of DOD fingerprints for immigration purposes. FBI processing delays are still a concern, but a FBI liaison office in USCIS monitors background checks and sets deadlines for naturalization applications. This applies to current and former service members, spouses of service members abroad, and surviving spouses and children. The Military Personnel Citizenship Processing Act expedites military service-related applications by allowing the use of DOD fingerprints for immigration purposes. USCIS must provide explanations for delays in processing applications for naturalization filed by or on behalf of members of the U.S. Armed Forces, deceased members of the Armed Forces, and their spouses and children. The Comptroller General must submit a report to Congress on USCIS processing times within 180 days of enactment. The Military Personnel Citizenship Processing Act expedites military service-related applications by allowing the use of DOD fingerprints for immigration purposes. USCIS must provide explanations for delays in processing applications for naturalization filed by or on behalf of deceased members of the Armed Forces, their spouses, and children. P.L. 110-36 allows time spent abroad as a translator or interpreter for the U.S. Department of State or Armed Forces to not break continuous residence in the U.S. for naturalization. Notable bills were introduced in the 110th Congress regarding the Immigration Needs of America's Fighting Men and Women. H.R. 6020, the Lance Corporal Jose Gutierrez Act of 2008, aimed to expand immigration benefits for military service members and their families by allowing naturalization for those who serve honorably in the Armed Forces in support of contingency operations. It also proposed extending the time to file for naturalization after leaving military service and eliminating certain naturalization requirements during non-continuous service periods. The bill aimed to expand immigration benefits for military service members by allowing naturalization for those who serve honorably in the Armed Forces. It proposed extending the time to apply for naturalization after leaving military service and eliminating certain requirements during non-continuous service periods. Additionally, it provided special consideration in removal proceedings for aliens who have served or are serving honorably in the Armed Forces. The bill proposed expanding immigration benefits for military service members, including waivers for certain inadmissibility or deportation grounds. It also aimed to provide immediate immigrant visas for spouses and children of LPRs serving in the Armed Forces. The bill aims to adjust the status of certain family members of eligible Armed Forces members to that of a Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) if they meet specific criteria. This benefit is available for two years after the death of the Armed Forces member. The DREAM Act included in S. 1348 allows two years of military service to fulfill requirements for achieving unconditional LPR status for undocumented aliens who entered the US under the age of 16. Additionally, S. 1348 would have amended INA \u00a7329 to allow non-US citizens to serve in the Armed Forces with approval from the chain of command. The proposed legislation, H.R. 1745, aimed to grant U.S. citizenship to aliens who have completed two years of honorable active-duty service in the Armed Forces. The bill outlined three conditions for eligibility, including filing a naturalization application, demonstrating English proficiency and good moral character to the military chain of command, and taking the naturalization oath of allegiance. Immediate relatives of active duty or reserve members would also receive immigration benefits under this legislation. The bill aimed to waive inadmissibility for immediate relatives based on misrepresentation or false claims, and extend V nonimmigrant visas to military families. This would allow spouses and children of LPRs to wait in the US for an immigrant visa if the petition has been pending for three years or longer, regardless of military status. No immigration legislation was found in the 111th Congress. During the 111th Congress, no immigration legislation was found concerning military service benefits. While some bills were passed in the previous Congress, unresolved issues and proposals may be addressed. Efforts to streamline the naturalization process for military personnel serving abroad are supported, with some suggesting automatic naturalization for those deployed to combat zones. Critics advise caution despite recognizing the sacrifices made by military personnel in such zones. Supporters of proposals to streamline naturalization for military personnel in combat zones argue for waiving requirements like good moral character, civics, and English knowledge, attributing these qualities to those serving honorably. Some suggest giving authority to the chain of command in the DOD to determine if a service member meets these requirements. Opponents argue that allowing commanding officers to judge a service member's eligibility for naturalization would burden them with learning immigration law and potentially introducing personal biases. Limited proposals suggest allowing DOD to fulfill certain naturalization requirements, such as medical exams. Currently, there are no special provisions for military personnel awaiting immigrant visas based on their relationship to a service member. Advocates argue for special immigration benefits for family members of military personnel to ease anxiety during active duty. Opponents believe family members should not receive special treatment and warn of implications beyond assisting military personnel. Procedural complications and delays exist for family members seeking removal relief and other immigration benefits. Medical examinations required for immigrant visa applications, admission to the United States as an immigrant, or adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence cannot be performed by most military physicians. This imposes time and expense on military families to obtain examinations from DHS-designated physicians with at least four years of experience. U.S. military physicians with four years of experience are considered civil surgeons for immigration purposes. Military physicians with at least four years of experience are considered civil surgeons for immigration purposes, specifically for special immigrants who enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces abroad. However, legislation would be needed to mandate that military physicians be considered civil surgeons for medical examinations required for the family of service members. ICE policy considers military service when deciding on prosecutorial discretion for aliens subject to removal, especially those eligible for naturalization based on military service. The policy disfavors initiating removal actions against members of the U.S. Armed Forces, but ICE officers may still pursue them. The policy is not required by law, so ICE officials could choose to change it. Legislation would be needed to make the policy permanent or to protect service members from removal proceedings. Proponents argue that removal actions create unnecessary stress and expenses for service members eligible for naturalization based on military service. The curr_chunk discusses the negative impact of prosecuting actions against active service members, which burdens the federal government and undermines the effectiveness of the U.S. Armed Forces. It includes data on noncitizen accession locations and citizenship status of service members."
