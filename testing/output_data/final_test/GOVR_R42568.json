    "content": "During the spring of 2011, the Secretaries of Energy, Agriculture, and the Navy signed a Memorandum of Understanding to support the development of a sustainable commercial biofuels industry. The goal is to construct or retrofit advanced biofuel plants and refineries that can produce drop-in fuels as substitutes for petroleum-based products. The Navy aims to reduce its dependence on petroleum fuels through this initiative. The Navy aims to reduce its dependence on petroleum-based fuels by developing a domestic industrial capacity for biofuels. They plan to conduct fleet exercises using biofuel-powered ships and aircraft, with support from the Defense Production Act. Congressional budget actions will help define the parameters for agencies to support the domestic development of alternative energy sources. The current debate in Congress is whether the Defense Production Act's authority should extend to developing an industrial capacity for biofuel. The Navy has a history of initiatives to secure its fuel supply, including transitioning to nuclear power in 1955 with the USS Nautilus. Discussions on renewing the DPA have included interest in nuclear-powered Navy and a nuclear power industry. The Navy currently has 395 ships in its inventory. The Navy's inventory includes 395 ships, with 36 nuclear powered warships, 50 conventional warships, and various auxiliary and civilian operated Military Sealift Command ships. Conventional ships use diesel fuel marine, while naval aircraft primarily consume JP-5 jet fuel with a higher flash point for safety. The Navy has certified several aircraft to operate on HRJ-5, a blend of hydrotreated renewable fuel and conventional JP-5. DOD fuel consumption varies annually, with domestic consumption representing roughly 2% of the total US consumption in 2011. The Defense Logistics Agency\u2013Energy (DLA-E) purchases fuel for all of DOD's services and agencies, both in the continental United States (CONUS) and outside (OCONUS), typically awarding fuel contracts based on the lowest cost to the point of delivery. DLA-E internally transfers (sells) the fuel to its DOD customers with a small markup to cover operational costs, with customers paying through their annual appropriations for Operation and Maintenance (O&M). The DWCF allows DLA-E to take advantage of price breaks for large quantity purchases and provide DOD customers with stabilized prices. The Defense Logistics Agency-Energy (DLA-E) purchases fuel for DOD services and agencies, domestically and internationally, based on lowest cost. DLA-E sells fuel to DOD customers with a small markup, utilizing DWCF for price breaks and stabilized prices. DOD relies on NATO and regional partners for overseas fuel supply. DLA-E's authority to procure fuel stems from Navy's authority under 10 U.S.C. \u00a77229. The Defense Logistics Agency-Energy (DLA-E) purchases fuel for DOD services and agencies at the lowest cost. DLA-E relies on general procurement authority to buy various supplies. DOD projects a 3% decline in fuel budget from FY2013 to FY2017. Navy fuel consumption decreased from $4.75 billion to $3.73 billion from FY2008 to FY2010. In FY2011, DLA-E spent $1.57 billion on 12.6 million barrels of Navy JP-5 jet fuel. U.S. government purchases of F-76 diesel ranged from $2.19 to $2.75 per gallon in 2011. In 2009, DLA awarded contracts for HRJ-5 jet fuel ranging from $66 to $149 per gallon. In late 2011, the Navy purchased biofuel for $26 per gallon in a bulk procurement of 450,000 gallons. Congress has historically supported industrial capacity for conventional and synthetic fuels for national defense preparedness. Congressional actions in the 20th century led to the establishment of Naval Oil Reserves and Oil Shale Reserves, as well as programs for developing synthetic fuels during World War II and the Korean War. Congress has directed DOD to develop a program to accelerate the commercial development of strategic unconventional fuels, examine military utility of alternative fuels, and study how to reduce life-cycle emissions. In the early 20th century, Congress established Naval Oil Reserves and Oil Shale Reserves for national defense preparedness. The Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920s involved a noncompetitive lease agreement for Petroleum Reserve No. 3 in Wyoming, leading to federal officials' indictment. This scandal prompted a shift to open competitive bids for federal leasing. Congress later allowed private production in the oil reserves and transferred management to the Department of Energy and Department of the Interior. Additionally, Congress promoted alternative fuel from coal during World War II through the U.S. Synthetic Liquid Fuels Act of 1944. The Liquid Fuels Act of 1944 aimed to aid World War II by producing synthetic liquid fuel from various sources. The Bureau of Mines ran a demonstration plant program until 1955, and during the Korean War, the Defense Production Act of 1950 authorized the processing of liquid fuels for government use. In the 1970s, the DOE focused on commercializing coal liquefaction, coal gasification, and oil shale technologies. Congress later amended the Defense Production Act in 1980. In 1980, Congress amended the Defense Production Act to authorize the President's purchase of synthetic fuels for national defense. President Carter directed the Secretary of Defense to determine the quantity and quality needed. Financial assistance was offered to produce synthetic fuel from various sources, aiming for a daily production capacity of 500,000 barrels by 1987 and 2 million barrels by 1992. The Navy and NPSRO had been interested in oil shale as an alternative resource for jet fuel since 1951. The Navy and NPSRO began evaluating oil shale for military fuels in the early 1970s, testing distillates for various jet fuels. The Air Force also explored oil shale for JP-4 jet fuel but found it unsuitable. Oil shale mainly produces middle-range distillates, not suitable for JP-4, which led to the Air Force transitioning to JP-8 in the early 1990s. The Air Force phased out JP-4 in the early 1990s in favor of JP-8. The House considered abolishing the Synthetic Fuels Corporation in the mid-1980s with the Synthetic Fuels Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1985. Congressional debate focused on reducing the federal deficit, purchasing oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, conflicts of interest, and subsidies to profitable oil companies. The DOD had certified the need for synthetic fuel for national defense as late as 1983. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 directed the development of a program to accelerate the commercial development of strategic unconventional fuels, including oil shale and tar sands. The act also directed the Secretary of Defense to develop a strategy to use fuel derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands to meet the fuel requirements of the DOD. The DOD pursued coal-to-liquids technology but stopped due to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. This act prohibited federal purchase of alternative fuels with high greenhouse emissions, limiting DOD to procure limited quantities of coal and gas-to-liquids fuels for testing. The Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 required the Secretary of Defense to study alternative and synthetic fuels for military use. RAND Corporation found that a domestic alternative fuel industry could be profitable and reduce world oil prices, but there is no direct benefit to the Department of Defense. RAND concluded that there is no direct benefit to the Department of Defense from using alternative fuels rather than petroleum-derived fuels. The production of hydrotreated renewable oils in the United States may increase greenhouse gas emissions, and fuel production from algae remains uncertain. The Defense Production Act of 1950 provides the President with authorities to shape national defense preparedness programs and enhance the domestic industrial base. The Defense Production Act of 1950 provides authorities to shape national defense programs and enhance the domestic industrial base by promoting activities essential for national defense, including military, energy production, construction, homeland security, and critical infrastructure protection. The Defense Production Act of 1950, beyond shaping the U.S. military preparedness, can also be used to support domestic preparedness, response, and recovery from various emergencies. The DPA has been amended and reauthorized multiple times since its enactment in 1950, with the authorities set to expire on September 30, 2014. The DPA declaration of policy emphasizes the importance of ensuring domestic energy supplies for national defense needs through renewable sources and energy conservation measures. Executive Order 13603 defines \"energy\" broadly to include various forms like petroleum, gas, electricity, and renewable sources like solar and wind. Under the DPA's declaration of policy, Congress has found it crucial for national defense preparedness to ensure domestic capacity for producing traditional and renewable energy sources, including biomass. Title III of the DPA authorizes the President to support industry with loans to expedite deliveries, expand production, develop technologies, and purchase essential materials for national defense. The Defense Production Act (DPA) allows the President to purchase industrial items, provide incentives for technology development, and ensure availability of critical materials for national security. Energy is designated as a strategic material under the DPA. The Defense Production Act (DPA) designates energy as a strategic material. The Reauthorization of 2009 removed restrictions on the President's authority to engage in energy production, including synthetic fuels. The Defense Production Act (DPA) no longer includes provisions exempting synthetic fuels from energy production restrictions. Funding for DPA purposes is authorized by statute, with a Treasury account named the Defense Production Act Fund. The Fund collects appropriated funds and proceeds from DPA activities, with a limit of $750 million at the end of each fiscal year. Table 1 shows appropriations to the DPA Fund since FY2010. The federal government has not used the loan guarantee authority provided in Section 301 of Title III in over 30 years. Current projects are initiated under Section 303 of Title III, granting the President authorities to maintain, protect, and expand domestic industrial base capabilities essential to national defense, including energy development. The President is authorized to develop various energy sources essential for national defense under the Defense Production Act (DPA). The Secretary of Energy is one of the agency heads delegated authority under E.O. 13603. The Department of Defense (DOD) is the only agency with an active Title III program, but other departments like Energy and Homeland Security have collaborated on energy projects. Two current Title III projects funded by the DPA Fund and DOD focus on lithium-ion and thermal battery production. President Obama directed the Secretaries of Agriculture, Energy, and others on energy initiatives in 2011. President Obama directed the Secretaries of Agriculture, Energy, and the Navy to collaborate on developing biofuels as part of a plan to secure US energy resources. Three months later, the Navy, DOE, and USDA signed an MOU to support the commercial-scale development of advanced biofuels. This unique agreement focuses on advancing biofuels and involves key federal agencies in the process. The MOU between the Navy, DOE, and USDA aims to construct or retrofit domestic advanced biofuel plants and refineries to produce biofuels meeting military specifications. The USDA, DOE, and Navy plan to fund the production of advanced biofuels meeting military specifications at competitive prices. The initiative will receive $510 million over three years, divided equally among the agencies. Within three months, they announced collaboration with the private sector to produce biofuels for military and commercial use. Additionally, the Navy and USDA announced a purchase of 450,000 gallons of advanced biofuel. The USDA, DOE, and Navy plan to fund the production of advanced biofuels meeting military specifications. The largest purchase of biofuel in government history, 450,000 gallons, will be made by DLA-E. Plans include directing federal dollars to develop a facility for military-grade biofuels. The Navy will use the fuel in a Green Strike Group demonstration in 2012. USDA committed $170 million and requested $171 million in funding for bio-based jet fuel production. CCC, DOE, and Navy are collaborating to develop the product due to the lack of a viable commercial source. The 2008 farm bill contains bioenergy programs that expire in FY2012, creating uncertainty in funding levels. The current economic climate may limit funding for energy programs and USDA support for advanced biofuels. DOE plans to move to pilot-scale projects in FY2013 with up to $40 million in support. In FY2013, DOE plans to move to pilot-scale demonstration projects with up to $40 million in funding to support technology maturation for defense biofuels production. The Navy requested $70 million in the FY2013 budget for a government-industry partnership to construct or retrofit biofuel production facilities. The Navy has collaborated with DOE and USDA for a government-industry partnership to construct or retrofit biofuel production facilities. The Air Force issued a Special Notice for an Advanced Drop-In Biofuel Production Project under the Defense Production Act Title III Program. The Air Force, as the DOD Executive Agent for the DPA Title III Program, aims to establish domestic biofuel production value chains. This includes feedstock production, conversion, blending, transportation, and biorefinery operations. The project requires domestically produced biofuel, compliance with Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, and suitability for military use. The Navy's biofuel initiative requires a biorefinery with a capacity of 10 million gallons per year, 50% cost sharing, and phased approach. Committees have differing views on funding, with the House Energy and Water Development Committee not recommending funding, while Senate Committees support the initiative. The House report does not provide funding or legislative language for the proposed biofuel initiative, questioning the Department of Energy's justification for funding. The Senate report supports collaboration between the Navy, Agriculture, and Energy for advanced biofuels. The Senate Armed Forces Committee supports collaboration between the Navy, Department of Agriculture, and DOE to develop innovative technologies for jet and diesel fuels for military use. They recommend a provision to limit funds for procurement of alternative fuel if the cost exceeds traditional fossil fuels, except for testing purposes. The committee strongly supports the Department of Defense's initiatives to reduce fuel demand. The Senate Armed Forces Committee supports Department of Defense initiatives to reduce fuel demand through new technologies. They are concerned about higher costs for biofuels and direct the Secretary of Defense to provide guidance on using alternative fuels operationally versus for research. They recommend a provision to prohibit the DoD from entering into contracts for biofuel refineries without specific approval. The Senate Armed Forces Committee supports DoD initiatives to reduce fuel demand through new technologies and is concerned about higher costs for biofuels. Section 314 limits funds for procurement of alternative fuels if costs exceed traditional fossil fuels. Advanced biofuels lack domestic commercial-scale production facilities but are seen as promising in the renewable fuels market. Advanced biofuels are a preferred renewable fuel alternative due to their potential to not compete with traditional food crops. However, there may still be competition for resources like land and water. Proponents argue that advanced biofuels will enhance US energy security, but economic and technical barriers may delay mainstream consumption. The use of agricultural land for advanced biofuel production is a key concern, with debates on federal government involvement in this sector. Some proponents question the form of federal involvement in advanced biofuels. Some question federal involvement in advanced biofuels, particularly in the Navy's testing of expensive aviation biofuels. However, DOD is a major oil consumer and relies on unstable foreign sources. The focus of the advanced biofuel industry is proving commercial-scale production, while planning for factors like feedstock supply and infrastructure is crucial for a stable market. The advanced biofuel industry focuses on commercial-scale production and planning for factors like feedstock supply and infrastructure to ensure a stable market. The United States imports 49% of its petroleum, with Canada providing 25%, but a domestic biofuel industry could address long-term supply disruptions. The United States maintains the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to meet short-term disruptions, limited by refinery capacity to produce jet fuel. Consumers subsidize military jet fuel production, raising the question of the necessity of a biofuel industry. The policy question at hand is whether a biofuel industry is necessary for national defense, with proponents arguing for a domestic biofuel industry to guarantee fuel supply for the Navy amid uncertain future availability of petroleum resources. Despite past concerns about \"Peak Oil,\" domestic crude oil production has increased, making the United States a net exporter of refined petroleum products. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that U.S. crude oil production will reach 6.7 million barrels per day by 2020, a level not seen since 1994. Despite a projected decline after 2020, production is expected to remain above 6.1 million barrels per day through 2035. U.S. refineries consumed 5.4 billion barrels of crude oil in 2011. Biofuel proponents argue that importing crude oil supports foreign adversaries, but currently, only Iran is listed as a terrorist country by the U.S. State Department. The U.S. State Department lists Iran as a terrorist country, and UN trade sanctions restrict Iran's oil exports. Logistical challenges arise in delivering fuel in overseas operations, with vulnerabilities like attacks on fuel convoys in Afghanistan. Despite vulnerabilities, fuel sources are generally available, but their alliances may be questionable. Refueling in foreign ports also poses risks, as seen in the USS Cole attack in Yemen in 2000. The USS Cole attack in Yemen in 2000 illustrated the consequences of State Department efforts to cultivate U.S.-Yemeni ties. The Navy faces challenges in maintaining its fleet due to the limited number of Military Sealift Command oilers available for at-sea refueling. Decisions on refueling Navy ships at sea or in foreign ports depend on tactical and political considerations. The United States can exercise diplomatic \"soft power\" by contracting with local companies for marine fuel supply, reducing financial, operational, and strategic risks associated with reliance on petroleum-based fuels for the Department of Defense. The Navy faces strategic challenges in fuel supply lines and global oil flow. Investing in a domestic biofuels industry could enhance energy independence and security. Increased fuel prices impact readiness accounts, with every $1 increase per barrel costing $31M annually. The Navy's lower petroleum dependence is due to nuclear-powered carriers and submarines. The Navy's nuclear reactor program, a result of the Defense Production Act, validated nuclear power and paved the way for commercial nuclear power. Policies to replace petroleum-based fuels with alternative resources have been overshadowed by economic advantages of newly discovered petroleum resources. The Navy can acquire biofuels through customary procurement processes, as demonstrated by limited quantity procurements at $26 per gallon. The Navy seeks to fund the MOU for biofuel procurement at $26 per gallon, totaling $510 million for 467 thousand barrels of HRJ-5. Private interests developing biofuel plants under DPA funding would still need to compete for future fuel contracts."
