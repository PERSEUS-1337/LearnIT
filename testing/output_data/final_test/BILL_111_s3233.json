    "content": "The \"Surplus Uranium Disposition Act of 2010\" allows for the barter, transfer, or sale of surplus uranium under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. In this section, definitions include terms like Commission (Nuclear Regulatory Commission), Department (Department of Energy), initial core (uranium for first reactor cycle), long-term contract (minimum 3-year duration), and reserve inventory (excess uranium stockpile). The Secretary of Energy may barter, transfer, or sell surplus uranium to eligible entities at fair market value, in accordance with the section. Eligible entities must submit a request to obtain uranium for initial cores. The Secretary of Energy may offer 20,000,000 pounds of uranium for initial cores to eligible entities building new reactors. Eligible entities must have a combined operating license approved by the Commission to obtain uranium. Additionally, the Secretary may offer further uranium barters, transfers, or sales to eligible entities. The Secretary may offer uranium to eligible entities through barter, transfer, or sale on a first-come, first-served basis at fair market value. In 2010, 3.0 million pounds of uranium were available, increasing to 3.3 million pounds in 2011, 3.8 million pounds in 2012, and reaching 5.0 million pounds from 2013 onwards. The Secretary must ensure fair market value and transparency in bartering, transferring, or selling uranium to eligible entities. Any uranium sold by the recipient must be at fair market value and considered part of the Department's annual sales quantity for that year. The Secretary must publish in the Federal Register the determination required for bartering, transferring, or selling uranium to eligible entities. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is required, and proceeds from such transactions must be used appropriately. The Secretary must ensure that proceeds from uranium transactions are used for Department programs without specific congressional approval. Long-term contracts must cover at least 50% of uranium quantity each year. The Secretary must maintain enough uranium inventory for Department missions and programs. The Secretary must maintain a reserve inventory of at least 20,000,000 pounds of uranium and can release it only in a national energy emergency. A technical amendment replaces \"Atomic Energy Commission\" with \"Nuclear Regulatory Commission\" in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954."
