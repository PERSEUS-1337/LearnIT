    "content": "Qualifications for the earned income tax credit (EITC) depend on earned income, adjusted gross income (AGI), and having a qualified child. A qualified child for the EITC must meet criteria for relationship, residence, and age. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) eligibility criteria include having a qualified child who is unmarried, lives in the United States, and meets age requirements. The EITC amount increases with earnings up to a maximum, then remains constant for a certain income bracket before gradually decreasing. Disqualification occurs if investment income exceeds a specified level. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has specific phase-out levels for married couples filing jointly, with increases over the years. Legislation such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 have adjusted these phase-out levels and extended provisions for marriage penalty relief. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has phase-out levels for married couples filing jointly, with increases over the years. The phase-out level for joint filers was higher than for other tax filers in 2012 and will continue to be higher in 2013. A table in the income tax booklet helps determine the credit amount based on income increments. Parameters for the EITC for tax years 2010-2012 show increases in maximum earned income, maximum credit, and phase-out income levels due to inflation indexing. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has seen increases in phase-out levels for married couples filing jointly between 2011 and 2013. Higher-income EITC-eligible tax filers will experience the largest percentage increases during this period. Changes in tax laws, such as the creation of a new credit category for families with three or more children in 2009 and 2010, have also impacted the EITC. Additionally, the option to receive the credit during the tax year was eliminated starting in 2011. The ARRA provisions for marriage penalty relief and the EITC changes from EGTRRA were extended through tax year 2012 by P.L. 111-312. The EGTRRA changes made by P.L. 107-16 include redefining earned income, eliminating EITC reduction for AMT, simplifying credit calculation using AGI, and providing marriage penalty relief. ATRA (P.L. 112-240) made the EGTRRA changes permanent. P.L. 112-240 (ATRA) made the EGTRRA changes permanent and extended the ARRA provisions for families with three or more children and marriage penalty relief for five years (through tax year 2017)."
