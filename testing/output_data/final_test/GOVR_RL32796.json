They also aimed for universal access to HIV treatment by 2010, investing in an HIV/AIDS vaccine, and increasing funding for malaria prevention and treatment. Additionally, they committed to improving health systems and training healthcare workers in Africa. The G8 also reaffirmed prior commitments, including canceling foreign debt. The G8 summit in 2005 reaffirmed commitments to cancel foreign debt for African countries, with specific actions taken such as relieving Nigeria of $30 billion in debt. They also confirmed a pledge to train and equip 75,000 peace support troops worldwide by 2010, with a focus on Africa. Additionally, there were pledges to increase aid to Africa, including a promise by the European Union countries to provide 0.7% of GDP as development aid by 2015. The G8 summit in 2005 reaffirmed commitments to cancel foreign debt for African countries and pledged to train and equip 75,000 peace support troops worldwide by 2010, with a focus on Africa. The European Union countries promised to provide 0.7% of GDP as development aid by 2015, with an interim target of 0.56% by 2010. The United States proposed to double aid to Africa by 2010 through initiatives like the Millennium Challenge Account and PEPFAR. President Bush announced plans to seek $1.2 billion to fight malaria in Africa over five years. The G8 summit in 2005 reaffirmed commitments to reduce trade barriers, end export subsidies, and improve market access. They set a deadline for concluding WTO talks by the end of 2006 and pledged to support Africa and other developing countries in building trade capacity and raising agricultural productivity. The summit also welcomed efforts to strengthen governance, democracy, and human rights in Africa. The G8 summit in 2005 reaffirmed commitments to reduce trade barriers, end export subsidies, and improve market access. Despite not endorsing an International Finance Facility or specific trade barrier reductions, Prime Minister Tony Blair viewed the summit as a positive step towards ending poverty in Africa. Blair praised the G8 summit as a \"turning point\" in ending poverty in Africa, highlighting additional aid and debt relief agreements. Bob Geldof and Bono commended the summit's progress on aid and debt, crediting public pressure for influencing politicians. Jeffery Sachs from Columbia University's Earth Institute also played a significant role in advocating for Africa's development. Jeffery Sachs, from Columbia University's Earth Institute and the United Nations Millennium Project, praised Prime Minister Blair for moving the world closer to halving poverty by 2015 at the Gleneagles summit. Despite US footdragging, Sachs argued that most aid increase promises came from the European Union. The White House claimed US leadership in launching historic commitments to assist Africa, with President Bush and Prime Minister Blair leading debt relief promises at the summit. The G8 summit, led by President Bush and Prime Minister Blair, received mixed reviews from NGOs. The Make Poverty History campaign criticized the lack of action to alleviate poverty, while Christian Aid and ActionAid questioned the effectiveness of the promised aid to Africa. ActionAid criticized the G8 summit for not providing enough debt relief and including a larger group of countries. Prime Minister Blair and Chancellor [author name scrubbed] aimed to eradicate extreme poverty in Africa by achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Prime Minister Blair, during his presidency of the G8 group of nations, focused on Africa development initiatives, including aid increase, debt forgiveness, and removing barriers to African exports. The G8 meeting also addressed climate change. The upcoming U.N. General Assembly will review progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Prime Minister Blair has championed a \"Marshall Plan\" for sub-Saharan Africa, calling for increased aid, debt forgiveness, good governance, infrastructure development, and access to markets in exchange for true democracy and respect for human rights in Africa. Prime Minister Blair appointed a 17-member Commission for Africa in February 2004 to assess Africa's development problems. The commission's 450-page report issued in March 2005 endorsed the main elements of Blair's initiative, focusing on governance, conflict prevention, education, health, and other issues. Blair and Brown led a campaign for African development at the 2005 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, calling for increased aid and trade. Support came from leaders like Schroeder, Chirac, Clinton, Gates, and Bono. Italy and others endorsed the initiative, with some urging the Bush Administration to do the same as a gesture of reciprocity for Blair's support on Iraq and terrorism. The United States had differing views on Blair's proposal for an International Finance Facility (IFF) for Africa, with some arguing against it due to competing priorities. Chancellor Brown, despite being seen as a political rival of Blair's, played a key role in formulating the G8 initiative for African development. Brown advocated for increased aid and trade in Africa, proposing a $50 million IFF for the region. The Commission for Africa's report modified the initial proposal for an International Finance Facility (IFF) for Africa, recommending $25 billion in additional annual aid over three to five years, with a potential increase to $50 billion based on progress. The IFF would raise funds through bond sales and distribute them to aid agencies from 2006 to 2015, with donors committing to repay the bonds post-2015. This \"big push\" of aid was seen as a moral duty for G7 countries. The report emphasizes the need for G7 countries to provide predictable aid to Africa to promote economic expansion. The cost of U.S. participation in the IFF is estimated at $6 billion per year initially. Blair sees funding for the IFF dependent on G7 progress towards giving .7% of GDP in development aid. Brown and Blair propose the IFF as a way to \"frontload\" aid towards the .7% goal. The G7 countries aim to reach the .7% aid level, with an interim target of .56% by 2010. European Union ministers pledged to achieve this goal in 10 years, with caution about budget constraints. The United States faces challenges in meeting the .7% goal due to budget deficits and other commitments. Blair suggests a gradual approach towards reaching the aid target. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, are skeptical of the international financing facility (IFF) proposal due to concerns about cost-effectiveness and lack of accountability. Supporters argue that funds disbursed through existing aid agencies would ensure oversight and evaluation. The United States is already increasing aid through programs like PEPFAR and the Millennium Challenge Account, although by smaller amounts than Blair and Brown propose. PEPFAR aims to disburse $15 billion for AIDS treatment, prevention, and care from FY2004 to FY2008. The MCA was intended to add $5 billion annually to U.S. foreign aid by FY2006, but Congress has appropriated less than requested. President Bush has asked for $3 billion in FY2006 for the MCA. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has been slow in disbursing funds, with the first compact announced for a program in Madagascar. The United States agreed to increase resources for the World Bank's International Development Association. John Taylor stated that the US could not participate in the IFF as proposed by Brown. The United States cannot participate in the IFF proposed by Brown due to constitutional concerns about guaranteeing bonds after 2015. However, there may be ways to overcome this issue, as the US regularly assumes debt through bonds and agrees to multi-year replenishments for development banks. Additionally, the US has callable capital obligations to international financial institutions. President Bush expressed concerns about the IFF proposal, stating it does not align with the budget process. Despite this, he announced an additional $674.4 million in aid to Africa in FY2005. Blair's Commission for Africa recommended forgiving public debt owed by poor African countries, focusing on multilateral debt, particularly to the World Bank's IDA. Blair's initiative sought forgiveness of Africa's debt to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and multilateral development banks (MDBs), totaling $59 billion in 2002. The proposed debt relief involves developed countries taking over African countries' debt payments, estimated at $2 billion per year. Britain agreed to pay 10% of the multilateral debt owed by 22 poor countries. Blair and Brown also urged repayment of debt to the IMF. The IMF holds 103.4 million ounces of gold valued at $9 billion but worth $45 billion at current prices. U.S. officials initially supported 100% debt forgiveness for poor countries and the HIPC initiative. However, they opposed revaluing IMF gold at the Spring 2005 meetings. Experts were concerned about potential destabilization from a major IMF gold sale. The price of gold could potentially destabilize gold reserves held by many countries. Some argue for small, gradual gold sales to minimize risk. U.S. officials support debt cancellation for poor countries without new contributions from the G7. Concerns arise about depleting banks' capital and reducing poverty alleviation capacity. Supporters believe G7 can provide replenishments as needed. U.S.-British differences on debt relief persist. At a June 10-11, 2005 meeting in London, U.S.-British differences on debt relief were resolved by a G8 agreement. $40 billion in debt owed by 18 countries reaching the \"completion point\" in the HIPC process will be written off. Donors will contribute additional funds to the World Bank and African Development Bank to offset the loss, with the IMF absorbing the loss from its own resources. 14 of the 18 countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, with 9 more African countries in the HIPC process nearing completion. African countries in the HIPC process are nearing the completion point with an agreement in June 2005 covering $40 billion in debt. The overall cost is estimated at $16.7 billion, with the United States agreeing to pay between $1.28 billion and $1.75 billion per year. The agreement was praised for easing Africa's debt burden, but concerns were raised about monitoring the commitment. Nigeria's debt of $30 billion was not covered in the agreement. Nigeria's debt of $30 billion, primarily owed to bilateral lenders, was not covered in the June 2005 agreement on debt relief for African countries. Chancellor Brown advocates for ending developed country protectionism by removing trade-distorting subsidies and barriers to trade. Critics blame the G7 for not opening their markets to African exports, leading to the failure of the 2003 Cancun WTO summit. The Blair Commission recommends an immediate end to protectionist practices. The Blair Commission recommends ending trade-distorting agricultural support programs by 2010 and reducing tariffs to zero by 2015. The US and Europe agreed on a framework to reduce subsidies and trade barriers. President Bush proposed scaling back farm subsidies in his budget. Negotiations are ongoing for cutting domestic farm support programs and eliminating export subsidies. The reduction in trade barriers sought by Blair and Brown may face challenges, as some developing countries may not be willing to make concessions on market access. Political opposition in the US and Europe towards reducing subsidies and barriers could hinder progress. The US has made strides in removing trade barriers through the AGOA program, providing duty-free access for products from sub-Saharan countries. The Bush Administration is negotiating free trade agreements with African countries, while 78 developing countries have preferential access to European markets. Concerns exist that reductions in trade barriers may benefit Africa's competitors like China. Prime Minister Blair's initiatives highlight concerns over Africa's lack of development despite abundant resources. Despite Africa's abundant resources such as petroleum, diamonds, and rich agricultural lands, the sub-Saharan region still struggles with low GDP per capita, high HIV infection rates, and challenges like child malnutrition and lack of access to clean water. The region's average GDP per capita was only $585 in 2003, with over 25 million people infected with HIV. Life expectancy has also declined to about 46 years. Africa faces significant obstacles in meeting the Millennium Development Goals according to a January 2005 report by the United Nations Millennium Project. Project argued that Africa needed a substantial increase in aid to meet the Millennium Development Goals, with estimates of $48 billion in 2006 and $74 billion by 2015. Various factors like the tropical environment, historical events like the slave trade and colonialism, and the region's current challenges contribute to Africa's struggle with development. The region of Africa, with 48 countries, faces challenges such as corruption, poor governance, and anti-market economic policies. Despite some market reforms and governance improvements since the late 1980s, corruption remains a significant issue. Recent criticism of Kenya's government for failing to address corruption highlights ongoing concerns. Some believe African leaders have not done enough regionally to address these issues. African leaders launched NEPAD in 2001 to address governance and corruption issues, including the African Peer Review Mechanism for accountability. Critics point to neighboring countries' reluctance to address human rights violations in Zimbabwe as evidence of NEPAD standards not being upheld. Observers note that many African governments are failing to meet the proposed standards. Many African governments are criticized for not meeting the standards proposed by Prime Minister Blair in 2001, despite receiving significant assistance. Jeffrey Sachs believes Africa is in a \"poverty trap\" and advocates for increased foreign aid to help well-governed countries in the continent. The \"big push\" in foreign assistance to Africa aims to strengthen education, health care, infrastructure, and create viable economies attractive to investors. Proponents argue that the risk of committing large amounts of aid is worth taking, as it could be afforded by G7 countries working together. This could lead to new markets, access to resources, and a more stable environment in Africa. G8 meetings in the 1990s addressed similar themes expected at Gleneagles, emphasizing the challenges faced by sub-Saharan Africa. The G8 meetings in the 1990s focused on development challenges in sub-Saharan Africa, emphasizing the need for substantial assistance and debt relief for the poorest countries. Initiatives like the HIPC program were launched to reduce poor country debt. Additionally, efforts were made to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases in Africa. The G8 meetings in the 1990s focused on development challenges in sub-Saharan Africa, emphasizing substantial assistance, debt relief, and efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. The G8 also expressed support for African peacekeeping capacities and emphasized the importance of developing countries promoting their own development through sound economic policies and investment. Meetings in Genoa and Kananaskis intensified the focus on Africa, with sub-Saharan presidents reporting on new development efforts. At the G8 meetings, African leaders like Thabo Mbeki, Olusegun Obasanjo, and Abdoulaye Wade attended, where the Africa Action Plan was issued. The plan aimed to support Africa in areas such as peace, governance, trade, debt relief, health, agriculture, and water management, closely linked to NEPAD objectives. Mbeki, Obasanjo, and Wade were key figures in NEPAD's development. At the G8 meetings, African leaders attended and issued the Africa Action Plan to support Africa in various areas. The plan included commitments to stopping polio, combating corruption in Nigeria, and training peace support troops. Prime Minister Blair proposed 100% debt forgiveness for the world's poorest countries at the U.S.-hosted summit in Sea Island, Georgia, but no agreement was reached. Many critics argue that the G8 summits have not adequately responded to Africa's needs, with calls for increased aid and debt relief. Jeffrey Sachs advocates for expanded aid programs, while advocates express outrage over the lack of action on debt cancellation for the poorest countries. Many question the G8's commitment to peace and security. Many critics question the G8's commitment to peace and security, criticizing the response to conflicts like the one in Sudan's Darfur region. The Council on Foreign Relations report highlighted initiatives in Africa, such as the U.S. Anti-Corruption Initiative and Canada's public-service reform efforts. The U.S. AGOA program was also noted for boosting African trade and investment. The report highlighted increasing aid to sub-Saharan Africa, with ODA reaching $23.7 billion in 2003. U.S. assistance in FY2006 was $3.9 billion, supporting peace and security efforts. The Bush Administration's budget request includes funds for new initiatives. The Bush Administration's FY2006 budget request seeks funds for a new Global Peace Operations Initiative to train foreign peacekeeping troops, with a focus on Africa. The G8 is urged to increase support for NEPAD, review proposals to end agricultural subsidies, provide more assistance for health infrastructure, and offer further debt relief."
