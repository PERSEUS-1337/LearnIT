    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Power Asset Privatization Act of 1995\". The Congress finds that the Federal Power Marketing Administrations have helped bring electricity to many areas in the Nation with taxpayer investment. It is in the best national interest to halt the practice of federally owned power generation and transmission facilities. Any sale of assets should be open to longtime consumers, as taxpayers have established equity in the facilities and deserve the highest possible return in the sale process. The Secretary of Energy is authorized to sell all federally owned electric power generation and transmission facilities currently operated by Federal departments and agencies. Sales can only be made to U.S. citizens or entities organized under state laws. After the sales, the Federal Power Marketing Administrations will be terminated, with assistance from other affected Federal departments and agencies. The goal is to obtain the highest possible price for the assets. The Secretary is required to obtain the highest possible price for federally owned electric power facilities, including future tax revenues. A financial advisor must be retained through a competitive bidding process to assist in achieving the highest price within 30 days of enactment. The advisor must provide a report on the assets within 90 days of being retained. The financial advisor must provide a report on assets that can be transferred to private sector ownership, their value, transactional methods, and estimated proceeds to the government. The financial advisor will provide a report on assets for potential sale, including future revenue estimates and market rates for wholesale power sales. Sales of facilities will follow a schedule, with terms and conditions set at least one year in advance. It is recommended that former employees of PMAS be considered in the process. The Congress recommends that the purchaser of facilities should consider hiring former employees of the Federal Power Marketing Administrations. Sale proceeds will be deposited in the Treasury, and funds will be used to prepare assets for sale and conveyance. The Secretary of Energy will oversee the sale of assets, including identifying relevant laws and regulations. A study will be conducted on the impact of facility sales on existing power contracts. Within a year of each sale, the Secretary will close out the administration and report to Congress. The sales will not be considered disposal of federal surplus property under certain laws. The sale of assets will be overseen by the Secretary of Energy, who will identify relevant laws and regulations. The sales will not be considered disposal of federal surplus property under specific laws, including Section 203 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and Section 13 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944. The Secretary of Energy will complete the sale of electric power generation and transmission assets in the next 5 years according to a specific schedule. The sales for different Power Administrations must be completed before specific dates ranging from 1996 to 2000. Following the sale of assets of each Federal Power Marketing Administration, unexpended funds will be returned to the Treasury. Additionally, rate stabilization for affected consumers will be implemented. RATE STABILIZATION FOR AFFECTED CONSUMERS: Purchasers of electric power generation facilities must ensure that the price of electric power sold to consumers does not increase by more than 10 percent annually above the baseline price. This requirement ends when the price matches the average market rate for wholesale electric power sales in the region. SEC. 6. LICENSING OF PROJECTS TO PRESERVE CURRENT OPERATING CONDITIONS. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will issue an original license for a hydroelectric generation facility sold under this Act, valid for 10 years. The license will include standard terms and conditions, as well as additional terms deemed necessary to maintain project operations. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will publish license terms and conditions for each facility to be sold under this Act. The Commission will have jurisdiction over any hydroelectric generation facility sold under this Act. SEC. 7 of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 1993 is repealed. SEC. 8 defines a power generation facility as a facility used exclusively for generating electric energy, excluding portions used for other purposes like flood control or water supply."
