    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Affordable Reliable Electricity Now Act of 2015\". It includes definitions for key terms. The Act, known as the \"Affordable Reliable Electricity Now Act of 2015,\" defines key terms such as Administrator, Demonstration project, Existing source, Greenhouse gas, and Modification. The Act defines terms such as modification, modified source, new source, and reconstructed source in relation to the Clean Air Act. Standards of performance for new, modified, and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units are outlined in the Act. The Administrator is restricted from issuing rules under the Clean Air Act for emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units unless specific requirements are met. These rules must separate coal and natural gas sources into distinct categories. The Clean Air Act restricts the Administrator from setting emission standards for greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units unless certain conditions are met. These conditions include categorizing coal and natural gas sources separately and achieving emission standards for new sources within a fossil-fuel category. The Clean Air Act requires the Administrator to establish separate subcategories for coal and natural gas sources and set emission standards for new sources within each category. For coal-fired units using coal with a heat content of 8,300 or less BTUs per pound, a separate subcategory is established. Results from demonstration projects cannot be used to set the standard. The Clean Air Act mandates the establishment of subcategories for coal and natural gas sources with emission standards for new sources. The Administrator cannot set a standard based on the best system of emission reduction unless specific criteria are met by at least 3 units within the subcategory. The Clean Air Act requires subcategories for coal and natural gas sources with emission standards for new sources. To establish a standard, at least 3 units within the subcategory must meet specific criteria and operate on a full commercial basis for 12 months without using results from any demonstration projects. SEC. 4. STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR EXISTING FOSSIL FUEL-FIRED ELECTRIC UTILITY GENERATING UNITS, COMPLIANCE EXTENSION, AND RATEPAYER PROTECTION. The Administrator is restricted from issuing, implementing, or enforcing any rule related to carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units unless it meets specific requirements. This includes rules succeeding previous guidelines for addressing carbon pollution emissions. The Administrator must submit a report to Congress detailing the greenhouse gas emission reductions projected by any rule related to carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units. Modeling must also be conducted on how the rule impacts climate indicators. The Administrator must submit a report to Congress detailing greenhouse gas emission reductions projected by a rule related to carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric utility units. State-specific model plans must be issued to show how each State will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Courts cannot consider this information when determining the Administrator's authority to issue rules. States are not required to adopt a State plan if it would have a negative impact on ratepayers. The plan may negatively impact economic growth, competitiveness, and jobs in the State, the reliability of the electricity system, and electricity ratepayers, including low-income ratepayers, through rate increases. Compliance dates for final rules are defined as the deadline for states, local, tribal governments, or individuals to comply with requirements. The compliance dates for final rules are extended by a specific time period starting 60 days after the notice of promulgation of the rule appears in the Federal Register, and ending when all legal actions are finalized. The compliance dates for final rules are extended by a specific time period starting 60 days after the notice of promulgation of the rule appears in the Federal Register, and ending when all legal actions seeking review of any aspect of the rule are finalized. SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON EFFECT OF NONCOMPLIANCE. Noncompliance by a State with any rule described in section 3 or 4 shall not lead to highway sanctions under the Clean Air Act.\n\nSEC. 6. REPEAL OF EARLIER RULES AND GUIDELINES. The rules regarding greenhouse gas emissions for new stationary sources, specifically for electric utility generating units, have been deemed ineffective and withdrawn. This includes two proposed rules issued in 2012 and 2014. The proposed rules for carbon pollution standards for electric utility generating units have been withdrawn due to ineffectiveness. Any successor rules applicable to fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units must meet specific requirements. Any proposed or final rule under the Clean Air Act that establishes standards for greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units prior to the enactment of this Act will be affected. SEC. 7. RESTATEMENT OF EXISTING LAW. Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act is amended to establish standards of performance for existing sources and consider the remaining useful life of the source. This includes regulations for source categories under section 112 and grants authority to the Administrator in promulgating standards. The Administrator is prohibited from regulating any source category under section 112 as an existing source under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act."
