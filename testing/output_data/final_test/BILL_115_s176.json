    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Helping Ensure Long-Term Protection for Coal Miners Health Care Act of 2017\" or the \"HELP for Coal Miners Health Care Act of 2017\". Congress acknowledges the struggles faced by the coal industry and its communities due to overregulation, leading to job losses, mine closures, and bankruptcies since President Obama's inauguration. Since President Obama's inauguration, Kentucky has lost over 10,000 coal mining jobs, and the total number of operating coal mines has reached a record low. Due to health risks in mining, many coal companies are unable to provide health benefits to retirees and their dependents. Congress has intervened in 1992, 2006, and in 2016 to secure health benefits for retired miners, providing a 4-month extension in the last instance. It is crucial to provide a permanent extension of health care benefits for retired miners and their dependents to prevent the loss of retirement health benefits. SEC. 3. INCLUSION OF CERTAIN RETIREES IN THE MULTIEMPLOYER HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 is amended to calculate excess for beneficiaries enrolled in the Plan under the HELP for Coal Miners Health Care Act of 2017.

Beneficiaries enrolled in the Plan as of the enactment of the HELP for Coal Miners Health Care Act of 2017 are deemed eligible for health benefits on January 1, 2017. Certain retirees are treated as eligible to receive health benefits. The amendments made by this section apply to fiscal years beginning after September 30, 2016. The amount of transfer for a fiscal year shall be reduced by any amount transferred to the Plan to pay benefits required under the Plan from a voluntary employees' beneficiary association established as a result of a bankruptcy proceeding. Every 3 years, the Comptroller General of the United States will study the Multiemployer Health Benefit Plan under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to analyze the appropriate use of Federal funds by the Plan.
