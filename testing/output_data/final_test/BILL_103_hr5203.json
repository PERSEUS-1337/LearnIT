    "content": "The Act titled \"Small Business Export Enhancement Act of 1994\" is also known as the \"Short Title\". It includes findings related to small businesses and export enhancement. The Congress finds that United States exports are dominated by a few large companies, while small businesses have untapped export potential but face barriers such as high transaction costs and lack of market information. There is a need for export assistance services tailored to smaller exporters, as the majority of exporters have annual sales under $5,000,000 and most export shipments are valued at less than $20,000. Additionally, there are over 150 Federal export promotion programs in place. The Federal export promotion programs are fragmented among 19 different agencies, leading to duplication of effort and confusion. The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee highlighted the bureaucratic hurdles faced by small and medium-sized firms. The National Performance Review emphasized the need for reallocating resources to sectors with growth potential and improving accessibility of services. State-based and private sector organizations often have more up-to-date information on companies. State-based providers of export assistance, such as State departments of trade, local industry associations, and international freight forwarding companies, have good local networks to deliver services but limited resources compared to the Federal Government. Effective outreach is crucial for small businesses seeking export assistance. Trade finance is essential for all companies looking to export, and the Federal Government should support the private sector in delivering trade finance effectively. Partnerships between the Federal Government and State-based providers of export assistance can enhance the focus on small businesses by combining resources for long-term export market development. The Federal Government aims to expand financial support for State-based export enhancement activities. The Federal Government authorizes funding for export enhancement programs, including grants for qualified entities, financial support for small businesses, and a grant program for foreign trade missions primarily for small and medium-sized businesses. ITA will provide financial support for trade missions that advance the State's economic development and export promotion strategies, with funding at least equal to federal government trade missions. The International Trade Administration will prioritize expanding financial support for State-based export enhancement activities using discretionary funds within its budget, including matching grants for new programs. Additionally, efforts will be made to improve information and technical assistance for small businesses to comply with export control requirements. Federal agencies will work with small businesses and other organizations to create a plan within one year to consolidate and simplify information on export rules and restrictions. They will also establish an outreach program to help small businesses comply with these regulations. The International Trade Administration, in consultation with other Federal agencies, must submit a plan to Congress within 180 days of this Act's enactment to consolidate or eliminate similar export assistance programs. The plan aims to achieve savings of at least $100,000,000 annually through improved efficiency and targeting resources to high export potential sectors."
