    "content": "The Act of 1998 is titled the \"Expand and Rebuild America's Schools Act.\" The Congress finds that many States and school districts need to build new schools to accommodate increasing student enrollments. Research shows a direct correlation between school facilities' condition and student achievement, with students in poor condition schools scoring 10.9 percentage points lower on tests. Research shows a 10.9 percentage point gap in test scores between students in poor condition schools and those in excellent condition buildings. Studies indicate a potential 20 percent increase in test scores when students move to new facilities. States and communities struggle to provide adequate school facilities, with the poorest communities facing the most challenges. Financing for school construction and renovation is difficult, especially in states requiring a 2/3 majority voter approval for local bond initiatives. The Federal Government can help by offering interest subsidies. The Federal Government can lower costs for school infrastructure investment through interest subsidies, incentivizing businesses to support improvement efforts. The US competitive position in the global economy is at risk if the future workforce is not properly educated for the 21st century. America must prioritize education to compete globally. The Act aims to assist local educational agencies in upgrading public school facilities and constructing additional classrooms to accommodate the increasing student population. It introduces a credit for holders of school construction bonds under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Act introduces a credit for taxpayers holding school construction bonds, allowing a credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year. The credit amount is determined by the credit rate and the face amount of the bond held by the taxpayer. There is a limitation on the credit based on the amount of tax. The section defines a school construction bond as a bond issued for qualified school purposes by a government entity. The issuer must designate the bond for this section, certify approval from the local education agency, and ensure each bond's term does not exceed the maximum allowed. A qualified school is a public school under the supervision of an eligible local education agency providing education below the postsecondary level. The qualified public school aims to enhance the academic curriculum, improve graduation and employment rates, and prepare students for postsecondary education and the workforce. Students will be held to state academic standards and assessments, and measures have been taken to alleviate overcrowding and enhance education quality. The student-teacher ratio in the school district must meet certain criteria. The issuance of bonds for new school construction, rehabilitation of old facilities, or improved communications infrastructure must meet certain criteria, including a student growth expectation. The eligibility criteria for local education agencies to issue bonds for school construction or rehabilitation include a requirement for a minimum 10 percent student growth rate over the next 5 years or the need for construction due to natural disasters. The term 'qualified purpose' refers to constructing or rehabilitating school facilities like classrooms, labs, libraries, or media centers for public elementary or secondary students, excluding athletic stadiums or facilities primarily for sports events with admission fees. There is a national limitation on the amount of bonds designated for school construction. The national school construction bond limitation is $1.4 billion for 1999 and 2000, and zero thereafter. The allocation of this limitation is based on factors like poverty levels and projected student growth rates among states. The limitation amount allocated to a State for school construction bonds is determined by the Secretary of Education and allocated to qualified schools within the State. The maximum amount of bonds that can be issued for a qualified school in a calendar year is limited to the allocation amount. Unused limitations can be carried over to the following year. The limitation amount for school construction bonds in a State can be increased for the following year if the amount of bonds issued exceeds the allocation amount. Definitions from section 1397E apply, and the credit allowed under this section is included in gross income. A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by this section apply to school construction bonds issued after December 31, 1998."
