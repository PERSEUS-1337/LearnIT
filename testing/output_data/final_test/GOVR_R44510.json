This report summarizes SAMHSA's major programs, activities, and organizational structure, without addressing specific legislative changes. The Appendix includes an overview of SAMHSA's budget, with more detailed information available in SAMHSA's annual budget request. Major programs include block grants and discretionary grants. SAMHSA's major programs include two block grants for mental health and substance abuse services. The Community Mental Health Services Block Grant supports services for adults with serious mental illness and children with serious emotional disturbance. Funds are distributed to states based on a formula, which can then be allocated to local entities according to each state's plan. The MHBG grant supports community mental health services for adults with SMI and children with SED. States have flexibility in fund usage within federal requirements. Each grantee must have a mental health planning council with majority consumer or family member representation. States may also have behavioral health planning councils for mental health and substance abuse services. Allotment formula is based on population at risk, service costs, and resources for each state and territory. The MHBG program provides funding based on population for mental health services. It operates under the PHSA and receives appropriations annually. The SABG grant supports substance use disorder services and is distributed to states and tribal entities. States have flexibility in fund usage and must have mental health planning councils. The SABG grant allows states to distribute funds for substance use disorder services according to their plan. Grantees must allocate 20% for prevention strategies and enforce laws against tobacco sales to minors. Funding formula considers population at risk, service costs, and resources. The SABG grant is distributed based on population at risk, service costs, and available resources. States and territories receive allotments proportional to their population. Indian tribes can request funds directly, and appropriations for the SABG are authorized through FY2003. The program continues to operate under general authorities and receives funding through annual appropriations. SAMHSA's Programs of Regional and National Significance (PRNS) receive funding through annual appropriations. PRNS activities include grants and activities in mental health, substance abuse treatment, and prevention. Eligible entities vary by program, which can change yearly. PRNS grants fall into \"Capacity\" and \"Science and Service\" categories, with a focus on training and technical assistance. PRNS, primary and behavioral health integration falls under Capacity and Science and Service categories. PHSA Title V Part B mandates the HHS Secretary to address priority needs in mental health and substance abuse through grants or cooperative agreements with various entities. Some PRNS grants operate solely under the authority for mental health, substance abuse treatment, or prevention. The PHSA Section 520A authorizes mental health PRNS, but most explicit authorizations of appropriations have expired.

Current grants and activities categorized as mental health PRNS are listed in Table 1, with additional details available in SAMHSA's FY2017 budget request. Suicide prevention activities are an example of active mental health PRNS activities funded in FY2016. Six suicide prevention programs operate within the mental health PRNS, three of which are separately authorized under the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. The other three programs operate under the mental health PRNS authority. Additionally, some programs authorized by the GLS Act have never been funded. PHSA Section 509 authorizes the substance abuse treatment PRNS. The authorization of appropriations for specific grants and activities categorized as substance abuse treatment PRNS has expired, but some programs continue to operate and receive funding.

SAMHSA's budget is divided into four categories: mental health, substance abuse treatment, substance abuse prevention, and health surveillance and program support. CBHSQ is funded through various sources including a set-aside in the SABG, transfers from the PHS Evaluation Tap, and transfers from the Prevention and Public Health Fund. The main funding sources for SAMHSA include discretionary budget authority from annual appropriations acts, PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside funds, Prevention and Public Health Fund transfers, and user fees. SAMHSA's FY2017 budget request also includes new mandatory spending. The PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside Funds allow the HHS Secretary to redistribute a portion of eligible PHS agency appropriations for program evaluation. Congress specifies the maximum percentage for the set-aside in the annual Labor-HHS-ED appropriations acts. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) established by the ACA provides permanent annual mandatory appropriations for prevention and public health activities. The Administration's annual budget proposal for the PPHF reflects its intended distribution and use of funds. SAMHSA was authorized to collect fees for data requests and publications under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014. SAMHSA's FY2017 budget request and funding history are presented in Table A-1, showing program-level funding and proposed new mandatory spending programs. The Administration's budget proposal includes new mandatory spending programs, PHS evaluation funds, PPHF transfers, and user fees, which are subtracted from program-level funding to determine discretionary budget authority."
