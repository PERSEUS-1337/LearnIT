    "content": "The \"Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2005\" regulates the production, storage, sale, and distribution of ammonium nitrate due to its potential misuse for illegal activities. The \"Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2005\" defines ammonium nitrate as solid material with specific nitrogen content and outlines facilities as sites where it is produced, stored, or distributed. The \"Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2005\" defines terms like handle, handler, purchaser, and Secretary related to the production, storage, sale, and distribution of ammonium nitrate. SEC. 4. REGULATION OF HANDLING AND PURCHASE OF AMMONIUM NITRATE. The Secretary may regulate the handling and purchase of ammonium nitrate to prevent misuse. Regulations may include registration requirements for handlers and purchasers, as well as record-keeping. Prior information submission may be used for registration. The Secretary may request information from the Attorney General and use existing licenses for registration. Consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture is required to ensure access to ammonium nitrate for agricultural producers is not overly restricted. Data confidentiality is also addressed. The Secretary is prohibited from disclosing certain information obtained from facilities, handlers, or purchasers of ammonium nitrate to ensure data confidentiality. This includes details such as the identity, address, and quantity of purchases. The Secretary may disclose purchase transaction details to authorized individuals or entities, the public in the public interest, or as required by a Federal order. The Secretary can disclose purchase transaction details as required by a Federal court order, under protective measures. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. The Secretary can inspect places handling ammonium nitrate without a warrant to ensure compliance with regulations. If there are concerns about improper handling, the Secretary can issue an order to prevent sale or distribution. Appeal procedures allow for contesting such orders through administrative adjudication. The Secretary can initiate in rem proceedings in the district court to seize ammonium nitrate handled in violation of the Act. Successful appeals result in the rescission of orders. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS. The Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements with the Secretary of Agriculture or State agencies to enforce the Act. The Secretary can delegate authority to States for administration and enforcement, upon request from the Governor. Funding is provided for agreements. If the Secretary delegates functions to a State, adequate funds must be provided for carrying out those functions. This delegation does not apply to certain functions related to facilities or handlers that elect not to participate. SEC. 7. CIVIL LIABILITY. Unlawful Acts include failure to perform duties, violate registration terms, neglect record-keeping, or disobey sale orders under the Act. Penalties for violations may result in a civil penalty of up to $50,000 per offense, with notice and hearing rights provided. The district courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction over civil damages actions against a handler for harm or damage resulting from the use of ammonium nitrate in violation of the law. SEC. 8 of the Act preempts State laws regulating ammonium nitrate handling to prevent misuse. SEC. 9 authorizes appropriations for Act implementation."
