    "content": "The UNFCCC outlines common obligations for all parties, including the US, to inventory, report, and control GHG emissions, cooperate in climate change adaptation, mobilize financial resources, and assess implementation through COP. The treaty aims to stabilize GHG concentrations to prevent human-induced interference. The UNFCCC aims to stabilize GHG concentrations in the atmosphere to prevent dangerous human-induced interference with the Earth's climate system. Parties are working towards bringing their GHG emission trajectories in line with the Article 2 objective. Negotiations at COP21 in Paris are expected to further articulate the purpose of the agreement. Negotiations at COP21 in Paris have produced a draft text of an agreement intended for adoption, with over 174 Parties submitting Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) containing pledges to limit or reduce GHG emissions. Many INDCs include policies, measures, and intentions to adapt to climate change, seeking assistance in financing, technology cooperation, and capacity building. Negotiations at COP21 in Paris aim to produce two agreements: a legally binding Agreement and a Decision by the COP under the UNFCCC. Parties intend to negotiate a legally binding Agreement, but the inclusion of specific provisions binding them to obligations is uncertain. The Decision will outline follow-up processes, tasks for the Secretariat, and unresolved issues to be addressed in 2016 and beyond. The negotiations at COP21 in Paris aim to produce a legally binding Agreement and a Decision by the COP under the UNFCCC. The inclusion of specific provisions binding Parties to obligations is uncertain, with some opposing new substantive obligations. Even if legally binding, the Agreement may include exhortatory provisions rather than strictly binding ones. Many Parties to the UNFCCC have submitted INDCs for COP21, with China committing to achieving its targets regardless of legal enforceability. Other countries like Mexico, the EU, and the US have incorporated their emission reduction programs into law, although the US is facing challenges with the Clean Power Plan. Financial assistance pledges to low-income countries are also being discussed. Recent negotiations have prompted countries across the economic spectrum to pledge financial contributions to global climate finance. China pledged $3.1 billion, while countries like Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, Mongolia, and Peru also committed to the Green Climate Fund. Resolving how to embody \"differentiation\" in a new Agreement may be a challenging issue in Paris. The expected Agreement will likely require all Parties to communicate Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) with self-differentiated pledges to mitigate GHG emissions. The COP meeting guidelines define GHG emissions requirements for Parties to the Agreement. Flexibility may be given to countries with lower capacity. Developing countries may oppose the obligation to submit communications. The Agreement may include requirements for progression in GHG mitigation in NDCs. Adaptation is expected to be a prominent aspect of the Paris Agreement, possibly a required component of NDCs. Cooperation processes are likely adaptation options. The likely adaptation options for the Paris Agreement include enhancing cooperation through information sharing and building technical and governance capacities. The Agreement may prioritize adaptation for available funds and reiterate existing obligations for financing, technology cooperation, and capacity-building. Setting specific amounts of financing or mandatory increases post-2020 is unlikely to be included. Calls for transparent reporting and review of financing may be included to assist Parties in meeting their commitments. An Agreement may include guidelines for transparency in financing and GHG mitigation policies, with a balance between reporting from donors and recipients. NDCs would be reviewed and resubmitted for durability, but the periodicity of this review is uncertain. Least Developed Country Parties may receive greater flexibility and assistance. A Global Stocktake could review Parties' performance periodically, possibly every five years. Global Stocktake would periodically review Parties' performance against the UNFCCC objective or a long-term goal, such as limiting global temperature increase. Key differences in negotiating positions exist, with some Parties willing to block consensus. Countries like the United States, India, and China are crucial players. France plays a significant role as the host. France, as host of the talks, is determined to conclude a legally binding Agreement in Paris, potentially influencing the European Union. Divisions and strongly held positions on key issues may hinder resolution in the final hours of the Paris sessions. The most challenging issues include differentiation among Parties and the legal binding of GHG emission mitigation pledges. The negotiations in Paris are focused on whether GHG emission mitigation pledges should be legally binding for all Parties, developed country Parties, or no Parties. There are discussions on characterizing the UNFCCC's objective as avoiding a temperature goal of 2\u00b0C, 1.5\u00b0C, or decarbonizing economies. Some propose changes to financing commitments, including mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020 and allocating responsibilities to individual Parties. There are debates on including financing in the Agreement, quantifying it, and whether it should continually increase over time or be limited to developed country Parties. Some proposals in the negotiations focus on meeting developing countries' needs, altering financing terms to rely on public funds, and implementing a transparency framework for all Parties. There are debates on international reviews, addressing \"loss and damage,\" and concerns about national sovereignty. Parties vulnerable to climate change are discussing these issues. Parties vulnerable to climate change seek provisions for \"loss and damage\" funding, technology cooperation, sustainable development support, compliance facilitation, and emissions control. Market-based mechanisms and private sector involvement are crucial for meeting NDCs. Existing processes for technology development and diffusion will likely continue, with some Parties proposing options for developing countries to receive finances or intellectual property rights at no cost. The Agreement may include provisions to facilitate compliance, such as advice and assistance, or declarations of non-compliance. The draft also addresses GHG emissions from international transport, with requests to address emissions from international aviation. The proposal in the draft aims to address GHG emissions from international aviation and shipping by implementing mandatory or exhortatory measures to limit or reduce these emissions. Parties are currently required to report these emissions, but they are not included in the Kyoto Protocol's mitigation targets. Annex I Parties are in favor of market-based mechanisms like emissions trading, while others prefer non-market approaches for sustainable development. Some Parties have concerns about the reliability of these approaches. Parties have concerns about reliable accounting and accountability for emission reductions. Despite disagreements, draft texts agree on legal and institutional arrangements, establishing the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC as the supreme body. Details on the Secretariat, subsidiary bodies, and NDC requirements are largely resolved, with some issues remaining, such as constraints on becoming a party or voting rights based on compliance. The draft Agreement text for the COP21 session grew significantly despite efforts to slim it down. Many textual options may not be resolved until late in the scheduled session, with concerns about the limited time until the official deadline for reaching agreement. Placeholder remains on whether a Party can place reservations on its accession to the Agreement, with withdrawal terms still under discussion. The draft Agreement text for the COP21 session has grown significantly, with many provisions unlikely to be resolved until late in the scheduled session. Options for the Parties include slimming down the Agreement, extending the sessions, or postponing provisions to later meetings. It may take longer than December 2015 to determine the success of the Paris negotiations in stabilizing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. Expectations were raised before the 2009 COP in Copenhagen, leading to disappointment when a legally binding decision was not adopted. The outcome of the Copenhagen meeting was viewed differently by those opposing international climate change efforts. Despite the failure, some see progress in the Copenhagen Accord and subsequent actions. Expectations for a legally binding decision at the Paris talks have been raised. Major emitters like China, Mexico, and South Korea are committed to their GHG reduction goals even without a binding agreement. The consequences of not reaching an agreement at COP21 remain uncertain. Some emerging economies, like Russia, China, and India, are making efforts to meet their emission reduction targets. China and India may even reach their goals earlier than expected due to economic reforms and pollution reduction measures. However, some countries, like the United States, still lack policies to fully achieve their targets. Additionally, some countries are relying on international financing to meet their goals, which may not be guaranteed without a formal agreement. Finances available to assist low-income Parties were $62 billion in 2014 under the non-binding 2010 Cancun pledge, falling short of the $100 billion pledged by 2020. Most funds come from private sources, not public funds. The impact of a binding agreement in Paris on financial flows is uncertain. Market-based and cooperative mechanisms may increase available financing. The absence of a binding agreement in Paris could affect advocates of international accords for climate change policies. Disillusionment with the UNFCCC process may lead to a shift towards other venues for climate change policies, such as sub-national governments and bilateral agreements. Efforts outside of the international process could result in faster but more diverse outcomes. The idea that Paris may \"fail\" is based on the belief that international negotiations drive outcomes, rather than nations determining their own policies. The Kyoto Protocol extracted commitments beyond domestic policies, but not all countries followed through with greenhouse gas reductions. The Paris Agreement includes civil society and non-state entities in addressing GHG emissions and climate change. It emphasizes inclusiveness and participation, with programs for indigenous communities, youth, women, local governments, and the private sector. The Agreement is legally binding on the United States, ratified in 1994. The UNFCCC, ratified by the United States in 1994, may lead to a subsidiary agreement imposing binding emission reductions. Congressional action would be needed if new legal obligations are imposed. In 1992, the George H.W. Bush Administration stated that congressional involvement in adopting future UNFCCC protocols would depend on the agreements' nature. Any agreement with GHG emission targets would likely need Senate approval as a treaty. The George H.W. Bush Administration stated that changes to the lists of parties in the UNFCCC likely wouldn't require Senate approval. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations emphasized that any decision to adopt targets and timetables would need Senate advice and consent before ratification. The UNFCCC does not currently require specific reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, but any new agreement with specific targets would impose new obligations on the United States, requiring Senate approval. The understanding at the time of U.S. ratification supports the view that a new legally binding agreement on GHG emissions would need to be ratified as a treaty with Senate consent. The President can negotiate non-legally binding agreements with foreign entities without Senate approval. These agreements do not change legal obligations under domestic or international law. Congress can oversee these agreements through appropriations or statutory enactments. The United States' 2009 pledge to reduce GHG emissions is not legally binding and does not require congressional approval. Security concerns arose after terrorist attacks in Paris, but the Paris COP-related events will proceed with heightened security measures. Officials stated that programs in closed and secure spaces will continue with strengthened security measures. Various reports and insights on climate change financing, greenhouse gas reduction targets, and joint announcements by China and the United States are referenced.
