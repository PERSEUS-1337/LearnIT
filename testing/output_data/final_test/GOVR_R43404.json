    "content": "Several legislative changes to government intelligence operations have been proposed in response to NSA surveillance programs. These changes focus on amending procedures of the FISC and the FISA Court of Review, which handle classified surveillance orders. Unlike traditional federal courts, FISC operates primarily in secret with limited public access to its opinions. The FISA Court of Review has only sat twice, with opinions redacted. Proposals aim to increase transparency by disclosing FISA opinions, raising separation of powers issues. This report will analyze the legal implications of mandating executive branch release of FISA opinions. The analysis will examine the shared authority between Congress and the executive branch regarding the release of FISA opinions. FISA involves government surveillance applications reviewed by the FISC, with the option for government review by the FISA Court of Review. Most FISC proceedings are ex parte under FISA, with submissions made accordingly. Under FISA, submissions to the FISC are made under seal, and appeals are sent under seal to the FISA Court of Review or the Supreme Court. Records of the FISC and the FISA Court of Review's proceedings are maintained under security measures established by the Chief Justice. The FISA courts can adopt security procedures as necessary. The FISC's procedures took effect in 2010, complying with executive branch regulations governing classified information. The FISC complies with executive branch regulations on classified material, maintaining records securely. Exceptions allow for petitions in certain cases, with ex parte and in camera reviews permitted for classified information. Disclosure of court opinions is limited and requires compliance with Executive Order 13526. The FISC has limited situations where court opinions can be released, requiring compliance with Executive Order 13526. Judges can publish opinions, redacted for classified information, or provide records to Congress. The executive branch can also share records with Congress, but must notify the court at the same time. This provision has caused issues with FOIA requests for FISC records. The FISC rejected the proposition of allowing FOIA requests for FISC records without approval, stating that FISA only regulates disclosure of opinions in the possession of the FISC, not the executive branch. Most filings to the FISC are classified as Secret or Top Secret before being sent to the court. The FISA files are not automatically reviewed until after 50 years, and the executive branch can choose to declassify portions of opinions. Legislation requiring public disclosure of FISA opinions raises separation of powers questions between Congress and the executive branch. The central issue is the extent of Congress's power to regulate access to national security information. The public disclosure of FISA opinions raises questions about the power of the courts. Releasing court opinions implicates the President's power under Article II. Legislation compelling the release of FISA opinions directs specific action by the President, impacting his Article II powers. In United States Department of Justice v. Tax Analysts, the Supreme Court ruled that the origin of documents is irrelevant in determining agency records. The government argued it did not control the opinions because district courts could. The Supreme Court rejected the government's argument that it did not control the opinions of district courts, stating that the proper inquiry is on an agency's possession of the requested materials. FISA opinions retained by the executive branch are considered agency records, classified as Top Secret or Secret. FOIA cases have been filed to obtain FISA opinions from the executive branch. The Constitution assigns responsibility for national defense to Congress and the President, with the President as Commander in Chief of the armed forces. The Supreme Court has been deferential to the executive branch in matters of national security, recognizing the President's vast authority in foreign relations and war powers. The Commander-in-Chief Clause grants the President the power to direct military forces as deemed necessary. The President has the authority to command military forces to harass, conquer, and subdue the enemy, while Congress also holds significant power over national security and foreign affairs. The Supreme Court has acknowledged the importance of all three branches of government in times of conflict, emphasizing the need for cooperation and adherence to constitutional limitations on presidential powers. Congress has the power to create and regulate federal agencies, appoint officers, and impose duties on them. This includes the ability to require agencies to disclose their records. Congress can generally require federal agencies to disclose their records, but the disclosure of sensitive national security information may raise concerns regarding the President's independent power to control access to such information. The Steel Seizure Case involving President Truman's seizure of steel mills during the Korean War is a notable example of the tension between congressional and presidential powers. The Supreme Court declared President Truman's seizure of steel mills during the Korean War unconstitutional as Congress had not authorized such action. Justice Jackson outlined three categories for examining presidential power: with congressional authorization, where Congress is silent, and when the President's actions go against congressional will. In the last category, the President's power is at its \"lowest ebb.\" In situations where Congress regulates according to its constitutional powers, the President's actions defying a congressional statute will be invalidated unless based on independent constitutional powers. The Supreme Court has ruled on cases like Hamdan v. Rumsfeld and Zivotofsky v. Secretary of State, where presidential compliance with legislation was determined based on the scope of presidential power independent of congressional control. Control over access to national security information is shared between the legislative and executive branches, rather than exclusive to either. Congress requires disclosure of sensitive information to relevant committees and has passed legislation like CIPA, FISA, and FOIA to regulate access. Courts have upheld Congress's oversight function in this area. Courts have recognized Congress's power to regulate access to classified information through statutes like CIPA, FISA, and FOIA. The executive branch has discretion in classifying information, but Congress may have limits in compelling its release. The President's authority to classify information for national security is derived from constitutional powers, separate from congressional grants. Common law privileges also protect certain information. Courts have recognized Congress's power to regulate access to classified information through statutes like CIPA, FISA, and FOIA. The executive branch has discretion in classifying information, but Congress may have limits in compelling its release. The Supreme Court has upheld statutes regulating information held by the executive branch, such as in Nixon v. General Services Administration. This demonstrates the shared power between Congress and the executive branch in regulating access to national security information. The executive branch has relied on cases supporting presidential control over national security information, citing Department of the Navy v. Egan. This case acknowledges the executive branch's authority to classify information and issue security clearances, but does not explicitly endorse expansive presidential control. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Merit Systems Protection Board could review the substance of the Department of the Navy's security clearance determination. The Supreme Court reversed, stating that one agency cannot review another's security clearance without specific congressional direction. This case highlights the reluctance of courts to interfere with the Executive in military and national security affairs unless directed by Congress. The court rejected the assertion that regulating the state secrets privilege would raise constitutional problems, noting that the executive branch's authority to protect national security information is not exclusive or absolute. The executive branch's role in national security has been recognized in previous cases, showing shared power over national security secrets. The Supreme Court declined to review a challenge to the President's denial of foreign air travel applications, citing congressional intent. This demonstrates that the executive branch does not have absolute power in this area. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) ruled on a subpoena issued to AT&T regarding warrantless wiretapping by the executive branch. The executive branch argued for control over classified information citing national security risks, while the legislative branch asserted its subpoena power. The court highlighted shared power over national security secrets, rejecting the notion of absolute executive authority in this area. The judiciary rejected the executive branch's claim of ultimate authority in national security risks and emphasized that congressional subpoena power is not absolute. The court also stated that judicial deference to the executive branch in national security matters does not impede Congress's legislative powers. The case was remanded to the district court for further negotiations after an impasse. The parties reached an impasse and returned to the D.C. Circuit. The executive branch argued for absolute discretion in national security, but the court rejected this, stating that both branches share power over national security. The court highlighted Congress's powers in national security, such as declaring war and supporting armed forces. The court rejected absolute claims of the executive branch over national security, noting shared power with Congress. Congress argued for broad subpoena powers, but the court ruled they are not absolute. AT&T case aims for compromise to resolve issues. AT&T rejects absolute claims of executive branch and Congress over national security information. Historical practice supports shared power. Various statutory regimes regulate access, including disclosure to courts. CIPA provides procedures for courts to determine admissibility of classified information in criminal trials. Courts can dismiss prosecutions if government refuses to comply. Executive branch submits classified information for in camera review. Government can choose not to prosecute if cost of disclosure outweighs benefits. The Supreme Court clarified the scope of judicial review for FOIA exemption claims based on classified information in Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink. The Court ruled that FOIA did not authorize in camera review of classified material, leading to subsequent amendments by Congress. Since the Supreme Court's ruling in Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, Congress has amended FOIA to allow in camera review of classified material. This allows courts to ensure proper national security exemption claims by the executive branch. FOIA also grants the public access to government records and gives courts discretion to order release of information. Disputes over exemption claims are reviewed de novo, with courts examining materials in camera to verify their classification. Courts have the authority to review classified materials in camera to verify sensitive information and prevent broad exemption claims by the government. If convinced that the material is not properly classified, courts can order its disclosure and may hold non-compliant employees in contempt. While courts do not always force disclosure of classified material, they do sometimes require public release, highlighting the tension between government secrecy and transparency. Courts can review classified materials to prevent broad exemption claims by the government. In ACLU v. CIA, the D.C. Circuit rejected the CIA's FOIA response as overly broad and remanded the case to the district court. The CIA used a Glomar response, but this can be trumped if the agency has officially acknowledged otherwise exempt information. The CIA's FOIA response was rejected by the D.C. Circuit in ACLU v. CIA for being overly broad. The court questioned whether the CIA had any documents on drone strikes, given public remarks about the drone program. The case was remanded to determine the contents of the documents. The court remanded a case to determine if officially acknowledged records' contents can be protected from disclosure. The Ninth Circuit rejected the government's national security privilege claims in a case regarding FBI investigations at Berkeley, ordering the release of some information and segregation of classified information. The court emphasized that general assertions of harm to national security were insufficient for exemption claims. The Ninth Circuit rejected the government's national security privilege claims in a case regarding FBI investigations at Berkeley, ordering the release of some information and segregation of classified information. The government must show why specific documents would harm national security to claim an exemption. The court recognized the dangers of compelling the release of classified information under the state secrets privilege. Courts dismiss claims against the government based on national security concerns, even in civil cases under federal statutes. Some courts will dismiss cases entirely if the subject matter is a state secret to avoid revealing sensitive information. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit justifies this practice to prevent a constitutional conflict with the Executive branch. Other courts base the privilege on protecting national security rather than constitutional concerns. The privilege of protecting national security is a common law doctrine that may be altered by statute, but the executive branch may object to legislation that intrudes on the President's power as Commander in Chief. Congress and the President share power over access to national security information, with Congress regulating access to classified information and the President determining what information is classified. FISA opinions contain sensitive national security information and legal reasoning, with proposals allowing the executive branch to redact classified information before public release. The executive branch has the authority to redact classified information from FISA opinions before public release, aligning with statutes like FOIA and satisfying constitutional obligations under Article II. Proposals that mandate all past FISA opinions be released without redactions may raise separation of powers issues and invite constitutional objections from the executive branch. Legislation compelling the retroactive release of past FISA opinions could also face objections. A law that applied retroactively to release past FISA decisions could impact classified information, while a prospective law could lead the executive branch to change its information strategy for FISC applications. This change may raise separate constitutional questions."
