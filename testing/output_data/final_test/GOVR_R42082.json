    "content": "Congress completed action on and the President signed into law all 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2012 by December 23, 2011. The bills were consolidated into two laws, P.L. 112-55 and P.L. 112-74, with additional funding for disaster relief in P.L. 112-77. A table in the report shows proposed and enacted discretionary appropriations for FY2012, allowing for comparison between House and Senate proposals, the Administration's request, and enacted appropriations. For detailed analysis on each bill, refer to the CRS Appropriations Status Table. Table 1 displays discretionary appropriations in proposed and enacted FY2012 legislation, with comparisons to FY2011. Figures may not include all budget adjustments and vary by subcommittee. Security spending is only listed for specific proposals. The discretionary appropriations in proposed and enacted FY2012 legislation were specifically designated, excluding most House proposals drafted before the Budget Control Act of 2011."
