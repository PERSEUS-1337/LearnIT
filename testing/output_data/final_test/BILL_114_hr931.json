The \"HEAL Act\" approves certain antibacterial drugs for use in a specific patient population with unmet medical needs, including improved efficacy and decreased harms compared to current therapies. The \"HEAL Act\" allows approval of antibacterial drugs for treating serious or life-threatening diseases in a specific patient population based on clinical trial results. The \"HEAL Act\" allows approval of antibacterial drugs for specific patient populations based on superior outcomes in well-controlled studies, including decreased mortality, irreversible morbidity, and validated surrogate endpoints. The approved drugs must prominently include this information in the prescribing label. The \"HEAL Act\" allows approval of antibacterial drugs for specific patient populations based on superior outcomes in well-controlled studies. The Secretary must require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for each approved drug to ensure safe use. The \"HEAL Act\" allows approval of antibacterial drugs for specific patient populations based on superior outcomes in well-controlled studies. The Secretary must require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for each approved drug to ensure safe use. The subsections (e) and (f) of section 505-1 outline elements for safe drug use, with standards of evidence under subsections (c) and (d) remaining unchanged. The Secretary retains authority to approve products as authorized prior to the enactment of this subsection. The \"HEAL Act\" allows approval of antibacterial drugs for specific patient populations based on superior outcomes in well-controlled studies.

If necessary, a public advisory committee may be convened to discuss scientific evidence. The Secretary evaluates new scientific studies on changes in patient outcomes related to susceptibility test interpretive criteria and publishes suggested updates annually.
