Congress finds that chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and disability for women in the United States, especially among minority groups. Unhealthy behaviors like poor diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and substance abuse contribute to over 50% of premature deaths in the country. Over 60% of Hispanic, African-American, and American Indian women are overweight or obese. American Indian women have the highest mortality rates related to alcohol and drug use. High poverty rates and barriers to healthcare contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health factors. Early life experiences are linked to adult chronic diseases. Community health workers, primarily women, play a crucial role in providing prevention and intervention services in medically underserved populations, addressing barriers such as poverty, isolation, and lack of access to services to improve health outcomes and increase the utilization of preventive health services. Research has shown that community health workers are effective in increasing screening and medical follow-up visits among residents with limited access to healthcare. States on the United States-Mexico border have high percentages of impoverished and ethnic minority populations. SEC. 399O. GRANTS TO PROMOTE POSITIVE HEALTH BEHAVIORS IN WOMEN.
