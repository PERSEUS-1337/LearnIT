    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Worker Protection Against Combustible Dust Explosions and Fires Act of 2008\". Congress acknowledges the emergency regarding worker exposure to combustible dust explosions and fires, citing the tragic incident at Imperial Sugar in 2008. The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board reported numerous combustible dust incidents between 1980 and 2005, emphasizing the serious hazard they pose in American industry, particularly in food facilities. The Chemical Safety Board (CSB) recommended that OSHA issue a standard to prevent combustible dust fires and explosions in general industry, based on current NFPA dust explosion standards. They also suggested revising the Hazard Communication Standard to ensure that combustible dusts are covered and that MSDSs contain relevant hazard information. OSHA has not initiated rulemaking in response to the CSB's recommendation. OSHA issued a grain handling facilities standard in 1987 that has effectively reduced the risk of combustible grain dust explosions. No OSHA standard comprehensively addresses combustible dust explosion hazards in general industry. Voluntary NFPA standards exist to reduce the likelihood and impact of combustible dust explosions. SEC. 3. ISSUANCE OF STANDARD ON COMBUSTIBLE DUST. The Secretary of Labor must issue an interim final standard regulating combustible dusts within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The standard will apply to various industries handling combustible particulate solids and their dusts, excluding processes already covered by OSHA's grain facilities standard. The interim final standard for combustible dusts must include hazard assessment, written program requirements for inspection and control, engineering controls effective after 6 months, administrative controls, and operating procedures. Requirements for controlling combustible dust hazards include measures such as controlling dust emissions and ignition sources, safe use and maintenance of dust systems, minimizing dust accumulation, sealing inaccessible areas, housekeeping to prevent dust buildup, and employee participation in hazard management. Requirements for written safety and health information and annual training to employees, including housekeeping, hot work, preventive maintenance, ignition sources, and lock-out procedures, shall take effect without procedural requirements. The interim final standard for engineering controls will take effect 30 days after issuance and will remain in place until a final standard is enacted under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The final standard for regulating combustible dust explosions must be promulgated within 18 months, including the scope outlined in the previous subsection. The final standard for regulating combustible dust explosions must include worker protection provisions, requirements for managing change of dust producing materials, building design specifications, explosion protection measures, and compliance with National Fire Protection Association standards. The standard will be promulgated in accordance with procedural requirements for rulemaking under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655(b)) and title 5, United States Code, including requirements for small businesses in chapter 6. SEC. 4. REVISION OF THE HAZARD COMMUNICATION STANDARD. The hazard communication standard in section 1910.1200 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, will be revised to include \"a combustible dust\" as a physical hazard. The modification will be in force until superseded by new regulations and will be enforced similarly to other rules. The effective date for this modification is within 30 days after the publication of the revised rule. The House of Representatives passed the document on April 30, 2008, as attested by Lorraine C. Miller, Clerk."
