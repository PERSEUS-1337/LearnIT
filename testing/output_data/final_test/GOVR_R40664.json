    "content": "Since the mid-1990s, the United States has provided assistance to the Palestinian Authority for civil security and counterterrorism. After Yasser Arafat's death in 2004, Condoleezza Rice established the U.S. Security Coordinator office to reform and train PA security forces under Mahmoud Abbas. The USSC aims to professionalize PA forces and coordinate with Israeli officials as per the 2003 Roadmap for a Two-State Solution. Since Hamas gained control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Lieutenant General Keith Dayton has provided guidance for training West Bank-based PA security personnel funded by the U.S. through the State Department's INCLE account. This training aims to improve security cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians as part of the Roadmap for a Two-State Solution. The INL Bureau coordinates with the USSC to train Presidential Guardsmen and National Security Forces in Jordan. The goal is to train ten NSF battalions for the West Bank. Dayton will remain in his post through 2010. Reports indicate improved law and order in areas where U.S.-trained PA forces are deployed. Improved law and order in the West Bank has been observed where U.S.-trained PA forces are deployed, with successful operations in Jenin, Hebron, and Qalqilya countering militant groups like Hamas and PIJ. Questions remain about the effectiveness of the USSC mission due to limitations on equipment and Israeli restrictions. Israel's security operations in the West Bank and control over Gaza are influenced by international agreements and its need to combat terrorism. The presence of Israeli forces and settlers complicates efforts to establish lasting civilian control over Palestinian security forces. The challenges in establishing civilian control over Palestinian security forces in the West Bank include the presence of Israeli forces and settlers, assistance from various countries, competing goals, historical obstacles, and political complexity. This complexity mirrors challenges faced in other U.S. security assistance missions in the region. The long-term implications for Hamas-controlled Gaza remain uncertain. The uncertainty of U.S. security assistance to the Palestinian Authority in influencing outcomes on various fronts, including the Israeli-Palestinian political track, Palestinian civil society, and efforts to end divisions between Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, remains unclear. This assistance was initiated after the Oslo agreements in the mid-1990s, allowing for the establishment of Palestinian security forces in Gaza and parts of the West Bank. Security forces were established in the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank for limited Palestinian self-rule, raising concerns about potential threats to Israel's security. The forces were largely made up of the PLO's Palestinian Liberation Army and Arafat's personal security detail. Arafat also created security and intelligence organizations not mandated under Oslo agreements, such as the Preventive Security Organization (PSO). Israeli leaders allowed these organizations to operate to help Arafat combat terrorist activity by Palestinian groups opposed to the Oslo peace process. The United States initially provided limited financial support to the Palestinian Authority for police salaries and non-lethal equipment. However, U.S. involvement increased in 1996 due to political pressure following terrorist attacks by Hamas in Israel. Other international actors, such as Jordan, Egypt, Japan, the European Union, and individual European states, took on leading roles in providing training and funding for Palestinian security forces. The Clinton Administration provided covert assistance to Palestinian organizations with personal ties to Arafat to improve security services and combat terrorism. The US and European Union bypassed official channels to directly support preferred organizations, potentially undermining calls for a consolidated security sector under civilian control. The US and European security assistance programs continued despite the Hasmonean/Western Wall Tunnel riots in September 1996. The CIA played a role in mentoring leaders from the Preventive Security Organization and coordinating Israeli-Palestinian security activities. Israeli officials praised Palestinian counterterrorism efforts after 23 months without major suicide attacks. The second intifada in September 2000 followed unsuccessful peace efforts at Camp David in July. During the intifada, some Palestinian security forces targeted Israeli soldiers. Some Palestinian security forces engaged in activities against Israeli soldiers and civilians, leading to a halt in Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation despite U.S. efforts to revive it. The PA security forces' infrastructure was destroyed by Israel, and covert U.S. counterterrorism assistance programs continued. Following Arafat's death in 2004, the Bush Administration saw an opportunity for progress on Palestinian security reform. The United States established the office of the U.S. Security Coordinator and appointed Lieutenant General William Ward to lead the efforts. Despite challenges, including Hamas' victory in 2006, consultations with Israeli and Palestinian authorities continued for the PA's security responsibilities in Gaza. The USSC faced challenges after Hamas' victory in the 2006 Palestinian elections and the establishment of a Hamas-led government. Despite limited capabilities and no budget, the USSC trained Presidential Guards loyal to Abbas. Reports suggest Arab states supplied arms to Abbas's forces with Israeli approval. After Hamas took over Gaza in 2007, the US provided more substantial assistance to the PA in the West Bank. Since Hamas' victory in the 2006 Palestinian elections, the USSC has coordinated with the State Department's INL Bureau to provide approximately $395 million in U.S. funds for security assistance to the Palestinians. This support aims to help the PA meet its Roadmap obligations, focusing on the Ministry of Interior, Presidential Guard, and National Security Forces. The assistance takes place in the context of Israeli occupation and Palestinian factional conflict. The EU, Russia, and various Muslim-majority countries provide security assistance to the Palestinian Authority, with the EU heavily involved in reform and training efforts for the Palestinian Civil Police. EUPOL COPPS program in Ramallah has received $47 million in contributions from EU member states, Norway, and Canada since June 2008 for specific projects. Canada, along with other countries, has contributed $47 million to EUPOL COPPS since June 2008 for projects aimed at strengthening the Palestinian Authority's criminal justice sector. The impact of U.S. efforts in the region is difficult to judge due to various factors, such as Hamas's focus on Gaza, PA leaders' determination to improve West Bank security, and militants' decision to lay down their weapons. Israeli security operations in the West Bank have shown some success in establishing law and order and countering terrorism with U.S. assistance. However, the lasting value of these tactical successes for the Palestinian people is uncertain. There is political support for continuing these efforts, but tensions between the USSC and the PA have emerged, potentially driven by different political agendas. The PA's concerns about maintaining control over its internal affairs led to a reduction in informal contacts with PA commanders in favor of more formalized communications with PA Ministry of Interior and security officials. The USSC also decreased its public profile in the latter half of 2009. The USSC reduced its public profile in 2009, but maintained a working relationship with the PA in 2010. Efforts to integrate USSC/INL mission with political resolution of Israeli-Palestinian conflict are led by Special Envoy George Mitchell. US aims to help PA consolidate security organizations under civilian control. The United States faces challenges in convincing Israel to grant more freedom to Palestinian Authority forces without compromising security. The success of US efforts in enhancing PA competencies to combat militant networks is debated, with some attributing success to factors beyond US programs. These factors may include the assertive deployment of security forces by PA leaders after the 2007 Hamas takeover of Gaza and security operations by PA intelligence organizations. The PA security structure includes the PSO and GIS, criticized for human rights violations. Security successes in the West Bank may be attributed to support from Israel. Concerns arise over PA forces' targeting of Hamas members, seen as either a security effort or political leverage for President Abbas. Reported figures from the Independent Commission for Human Rights highlight these issues. Over 400 people arrested for political reasons in the West Bank as of May 31, 2009, according to the Independent Commission for Human Rights. PA security reform led by Prime Minister Fayyad aims to neutralize Fatah partisans, potentially leading to greater defactionalization. Uncertainty surrounds the replacement of PA Interior Minister Gen. Abdel Razeq al Yahya with Abbas loyalist Said Abu. The new Fayyad-led PA government faces challenges in security reform, including corruption and factionalism. Success in security is crucial for political progress and peace negotiations with Israel. Some believe U.S.-sponsored PA security reform is necessary for a Palestinian state at peace with Israel. A Palestinian consensus government with Hamas is needed to unite the West Bank and Gaza under unified leadership. The integration of Hamas's militia into PA security forces is a sensitive issue that could hinder progress. Some doubt the effectiveness of U.S. security assistance due to restrictions and concerns about potential violence. The Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF) consists of five organizations under the Interior Minister's control. There are discussions on whether to have the PA rely on itself, third parties, or an international peacekeeping force for security in the West Bank. The Presidential Guard and General Intelligence Service remain subordinate to the PA president. The Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF) includes the Presidential Guard and General Intelligence Service, which are subordinate to the PA president. The president and Ministry of Interior have direct command over the PSO, with the NSF falling under the president's ultimate control. The aspiration for full command and control within the MoI has not been fully realized, despite efforts to consolidate under the Roadmap. The United States has sent conflicting signals on this issue. The Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF) have undergone consolidation efforts under the Roadmap since 2003, with President Abbas urged to directly command key security forces during Hamas control in 2006-2007. In 2008, GIS chief Gen. Tawfiq al Tirawi was removed, and a merger of GIS into PSO was announced but not yet implemented. PASF are deployed in 10 of 11 West Bank governorates, with priority areas in Jenin, Nablus, Hebron, and Ramallah. The National Security Forces in the West Bank, with approximately 8,000 personnel, are considered akin to a national army and receive significant U.S. INCLE assistance. Each NSF area commander oversees security operations in their respective governorate, aiming to defend the people and help build a nation. The NSF area commander leads security operations in his governorate, while the Presidential Guard protects VIPs and official PA facilities. They lack arrest powers and support the Palestinian Civil Police in law enforcement. Intelligence organizations also play a role, potentially undermining the PCP's influence. The USSC, a multinational organization, has a core staff of approximately 45 personnel, including Americans and non-U.S. persons. Non-U.S. staff have advantages in travel to the West Bank. INL Bureau provides INCLE funding for security assistance to the PA. INL office in Jerusalem consulate is staffed by foreign service officers and contractors. INL, in coordination with the USSC, employs contractors and local Palestinians to provide assistance to Middle Eastern countries' internal security forces. This includes staffing Mobile Training Teams and the Strategic Planning Directorate to support the Palestinian Ministry of Interior in reforming and strengthening civilian control over the Palestinian Authority Security Forces. The U.S.-based company DynCorp International is the primary contractor for training and equipment delivery to reform and strengthen civilian control over the Palestinian Authority Security Forces. Around 22 U.S. and foreign specialists work on Mobile Training Teams, while seven technical advisors support the Strategic Planning Directorate in Ramallah. USSC/INL and contractors offer consultation on recruitment, strategic planning, and deployment issues for PA security officials. Training for the PASF is mainly conducted by Arabic-speaking Jordanian police trainers. Jordanian police trainers, supported by Mobile Training Teams, provide training at the Jordan International Police Training Center for Palestinian Authority Security Forces. U.S.-funded non-lethal equipment is supplied to the PG and NSF with Israeli approval, subject to monitoring. INCLE assistance is used for constructing training facilities and bases in the West Bank. A breakdown of the $295 million funds from FY2007-FY2009 shows $118.7 million allocated for U.S.-sponsored training activities for the PASF. Additional funds were appropriated for FY2010 but not officially apportioned yet. Some U.S. funds are allocated for training activities for the Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF) at the Jordan International Police Training Center. Training includes specialized courses for the PG and plans to train PA Civil Defense personnel in 2010. Newly-formed NSF Special Battalions receive \"gendarmerie-style\" training at JIPTC to serve as strategic reserves. Existing PG Operations & Support Battalion and NSF 2nd Special Battalion completed training in 2008. The NSF troops underwent training at the Jordan International Police Training Center from 2008 to 2009. The goal is to have ten NSF battalions trained in Jordan, with one for each designated governorate. Questions remain about the adequacy of 5,000 U.S.-sponsored, JIPTC-trained NSF troops alongside existing PA security forces in maintaining order and combating militants/terror. The question arises whether 5,000 new NSF troops can work effectively alongside existing PA security forces in the West Bank. Some Palestinians see the NSF as more of a \"proto-army\" rather than law enforcement, which could create challenges for coordination with Israeli counterparts and dealing with Hamas-controlled forces in Gaza. The ambiguity surrounding the NSF's role may hinder its ability to reform and operate effectively. In early 2008, the PA implemented an early retirement scheme to remove less-motivated officers and make room for new recruits in the security forces. Around 6,000 officers left, with more retiring since then. Joining the PASF offers steady employment, leading to high demand during recruitment. New battalions can select top recruits through competition. All troops undergo vetting before attending U.S.-sponsored training at JIPTC. The State Department conducts thorough vetting of potential trainees at JIPTC to ensure they have no affiliations with terrorist organizations or gross human rights violations. Less than 4.4% of new recruits are turned away, with an average age of 20 to 22. Names are checked against various databases to prevent recruitment of individuals with criminal or terrorist backgrounds. New recruits undergo basic training at PA facilities in Jericho before 19 weeks of U.S.-sponsored training at JIPTC in Jordan. Training aims to foster professionalism, discipline, and non-chauvinistic Palestinian patriotism. Trainees are vetted to ensure no affiliations with terrorist organizations or human rights violations. Less than 4.4% of recruits are rejected, with an average age of 20 to 22. Some PA officials question the cost-effectiveness of training in Jordan at JIPTC, as the expenses are higher compared to training within the West Bank. Specialized courses are also offered in both locations, with some focusing on specific skills for platoons and others aimed at spreading knowledge throughout the battalion. Senior Leaders courses have been conducted in Ramallah since October 2008, with more planned in the future. Each U.S.-funded course includes international training. Courses are conducted on a continuing basis for commanding officers from various PA security organizations, including the PSO and GIS. The training is led by a Palestinian major general from the NSF, with participants undergoing vetting for human rights, terrorist links, and criminal records. Similar courses for intermediate leaders are set to begin in January 2010, while junior officers receive one month of training. In January 2010, junior officers from NSF battalions undergo one month of basic leadership training at JIPTC before a four-month general training program. USSC/INL aims to train key leaders in the PA security system to promote skills, discipline, rule of law, and human rights. After completing the Senior Leaders course, trainees return to their organizations with ingrained institutional cultures. Many are assigned to crucial positions in law-and-order and counterterrorism efforts, supported by $72.6 million in non-lethal equipment assistance from the State Department. DynCorp provides equipment to PG and NSF troops, including uniforms, field gear, vehicles, surveillance equipment, first aid/medical gear, riot control gear, computers, and other standard items. The equipment is carefully controlled to ensure secure procurement and delivery, with end-use monitoring in place to verify its intended use by the Palestinian Authority. The State Department has a Letter of Agreement with the PA allowing inspection of provided property and records, along with assistance in implementing an automated inventory system. The contractor provides equipment to Palestinian Authority forces, with end-use monitoring in place to track delivery and usage. They conduct annual surveys to inventory equipment and ensure its proper condition. On-site oversight and training are provided to PA representatives, with equipment only provided with prior approval from Israel. For example, flak jackets were delivered in August 2008 following Israeli approval. Flak jackets were delivered to PA forces in August 2008 after Israeli approval, previously withheld due to concerns. Delays in providing equipment have frustrated international security assistance providers. NSF commander Diab al Ali stated the need for more equipment and light arms for the NSF to carry out its mission effectively. Israel confiscated most of PASF's weapons during the second intifada, with Hamas gaining possession of the remaining weapons. The PASF lost possession of many weapons to Hamas during the second intifada. Israel controls the approval of weapons received from other countries, causing delays in arming the PASF. Concerns exist about weapons falling into the wrong hands or being used against Israel. The PASF is cautious about weapons falling into Hamas' hands but confident in their security measures. U.S. INCLE funds are used for training facilities and barracks in the West Bank, including the Presidential Guard College in Jericho. Additional facilities are under construction by Palestinian contractors under INL and PA supervision. The Nuweimeh training facility for the NSF in Jericho, supervised by the PA, is part of plans to develop a larger PASF academy. NSF barracks in Jericho are partially completed and in use, with more capacity expected in 2010. Construction of NSF barracks in Jenin and other PA governorates is delayed by the need for Israeli approval in \"Area B\" zones. Discussions on this issue are ongoing between Israel and USSC/INL. The U.S. has provided training assistance to PA security forces, with notable success in cities like Jenin and Hebron. Trained forces have helped regulate demonstrations and apprehend militants affiliated with terrorist organizations. The U.S.-sponsored PA forces, including the PG 3rd Battalion trained by JIPTC, played a key role in establishing law and order in Nablus and Jenin. The PG 3rd Battalion, a specialized counterterrorism unit, contributed significantly to the success of the operations in Jenin in 2008. The PA forces, including the PG 3rd Battalion trained by JIPTC, have helped establish law and order in Jenin. Illegal weapons and armed gangs have been cleared from the streets, leading to an increase in public morale. Economic development has occurred, but questions remain about its sustainability and effects on West Bank stability. The PA aims to sustain these improvements and weaken support for Hamas and other militants. Operations are being stepped up in Hebron, a hotspot for tensions involving Israeli settlers and Palestinian clans. The deployment of approximately 600 PA security personnel, including U.S.-sponsored troops, to Hebron improved law and order in the area. The operation, code named \"Homeland Rising,\" successfully avoided conflict between Israeli settlers and Palestinian residents and apprehended suspected Hamas militants. U.S., Israeli, and Palestinian officials considered the operation a major success. The JIPTC-trained PASF contingent outperformed their non-JIPTC-trained counterparts in an operation, leading to protests from Hamas and other Palestinian groups. These groups accused the PA forces of targeting Hamas members for political reasons and being influenced by external forces. Despite the criticism, U.S.-sponsored, JIPTC-trained PASF personnel have been stationed in major urban areas of the West Bank. In April 2009, PA forces uncovered a weapons laboratory in Qalqilya, leading to confrontations with Hamas militants. This resulted in the killing of Hamas's chief military commander and his assistant, along with three other militants. Hamas condemned the targeting of its militants in Qalqilya as \"traitorous\" and vowed to avenge them. In June 2009, a man in Nablus was arrested by PA forces for receiving \u20ac1.5 million from Hamas's Gaza leadership to fund attacks on PA officials and buildings. Hamas used PASF operations in Hebron and Qalqilya as a reason to suspend Palestinian unity talks with Fatah. Hamas may be appealing to a political constituency suspicious of international interactions. During the conflict in Gaza in December 2008, fears arose of potential violence in the West Bank. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal called for a \"third intifada,\" while troops from the NSF 3rd Special Battalion, trained by the U.S., were deployed to help maintain public order. This raised concerns among a constituency suspicious of international interactions with PA security forces. During the conflict in Gaza, Palestinian demonstrators protested Israeli military action. EUPOL COPPS trained PCP personnel for crowd control. IDF in the West Bank delegated crowd control to the PA. IDF trusted PA forces, allowing them to handle the situation successfully. The PA forces successfully contained demonstrations in the West Bank, preventing escalation into violence. Despite tensions in Hebron leading to casualties, overall security remained stable. Analysts suggest confusion among Palestinians may have lessened the potential for uprisings. The impact of U.S.-sponsored training on PA security forces is still uncertain. The impact of U.S.-sponsored training on PA security forces is still uncertain, with several factors contributing to their successes. These include distractions among militants, increased security emphasis by PA leaders, strategic and tactical planning, large PASF personnel levels, and lifting of restrictions by the IDF. The coordinating role of the USSC and resources provided by the United States have also played a significant role in organizing, training, and disciplining new NSF battalions. The success of PA security forces in operations like Jenin, Hebron, and Qalqilya, as well as during the Gaza conflict, could indicate the effectiveness of training programs. PA and Western officials stress the importance of reforming the criminal justice sector alongside security reforms to ensure long-term success. The PA's success in identifying and arresting criminals has outpaced the criminal justice sector's ability to detain and prosecute them, leading to concerns about transparency, fairness, and human rights violations. PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad emphasized the need for reform in the criminal justice sector to establish \"de facto Palestinian statehood\" within two years. This includes improving security capabilities, law and order, and ensuring due process for all individuals. The need for physical infrastructure to provide effective services in all areas is crucial for establishing Palestinian statehood. Concerns arise over the legitimacy of President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad's rule without a functioning legislature, potentially leading to authoritarianism and security policy disagreements within the PA. In response to a prisoner abuse incident in Hebron in June 2009, the PA has taken steps to prevent future incidents, including issuing a directive forbidding punishment and holding commanders responsible. Several PA intelligence officials involved in the incident are facing consequences, and the EU, particularly EUPOL COPPS, is playing a significant role in the process. The European Union, through EUPOL COPPS, is heavily involved in overseeing international assistance for criminal justice reform in the PA, including improving professionalism and accountability of law enforcement, judicial, and prison personnel. Many Palestinian prisons were destroyed during the second intifada and have not been rebuilt. Concerns about the PA's ability to process criminals led to increased donor assistance plans. The U.S. initiated a program in Jenin in 2008 to address security and economic development issues. The State Department used $2 million for a pilot program aimed at training prosecutors, improving technical capacities, and enhancing coordination between police and judicial organs. A Jordanian appeals court judge with experience in training Palestinian prosecutors, police, and judges was involved in mentoring Jenin public prosecutors. The Jenin pilot program, funded by the U.S. in 2008, involves mentoring public prosecutors, providing feedback to improve office administration, and enhancing coordination between police and judicial organs. Its impact on criminal justice reform beyond spring 2010 is uncertain. Some concerns have been raised about potential coordination issues with other international programs in the West Bank. The US has allocated $20 million over five years for training prosecutors and building new court houses and forensic laboratories in the PA. Despite coordination with other donors, some analysts feel that criminal justice reform in the PA is progressing too slowly. Pressure from donors, including General Dayton, has led PA leaders to show more interest in addressing justice sector issues and drafting a comprehensive reform strategy. The justice sector in the Palestinian Authority is a genuine concern and a priority, with progress expected soon through strengthened missions and donor programs. There is uncertainty whether increased U.S. resources can expedite reform due to entrenched realities and public distrust. Structural challenges in criminal justice reform may not be solved by more money alone. The Palestinian Authority's justice sector faces structural challenges that may not be solved by increased funding alone. PM Fayyad is in dialogue with the EU to address these issues, and US involvement could enhance the impact. Careful coordination with existing donors is crucial to avoid duplication of efforts. Key actors within the PA judicial sector need to be supported for effective reform. The appointment of a new Supreme Court chief justice/Supreme Judicial Council chair, Farid Jallad, has raised hopes for reform in the Palestinian Authority's justice sector. U.S. officials believe that Jallad can improve coordination and make the sector more amenable to change, especially in light of the successful Jenin pilot program. However, challenges remain in translating expertise from supervising security forces to the criminal justice sector. The USSC is slowly understanding the PA criminal justice sector. Israeli-PA coordination is important for freedom of movement and transit of prisoners. PA forces have improved public safety and morale in Jenin and Hebron. Israeli officials praise the PA forces' performance, with Defense Minister Ehud Barak's chief of staff commending Dayton's work. Israeli confidence in the Palestinian Authority Security Forces (PASF) in the West Bank is growing, with praise for their improved professionalism and effectiveness. However, there are still reservations about granting them full security responsibility, as indicated by IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi. Despite some progress, there are ongoing concerns about the PASF's capabilities in handling security challenges. IDF operatives killed three alleged Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades affiliates in Nablus following the fatal shooting of an Israeli settler without consulting the PASF, highlighting Israel's insistence on acting alone. PA President Abbas expressed frustration, stating they are not Israel's security guards but partners. Israel's flexibility will determine the success of U.S.-sponsored, JIPTC-trained forces. Israel had lifted curfews on PASF activity in four West Bank cities to allow 24-hour operations. Israel allowed 24-hour operations in four West Bank cities, giving the PASF this prerogative in \"Area A\" locations. The PASF in Bethlehem are already operating around the clock, while manned Israeli roadblocks in the West Bank were scaled down in response to improved security and international pressure. The improvements in Israeli-PA security coordination are seen as significant but incremental, with some believing more time is needed for the PA forces to help overcome doubts. However, some argue that coordination has regressed since Prime Minister Netanyahu's government took office. The IDF is less willing to allow PASF personnel to operate in urban areas near its troops. There is skepticism due to the \"chicken-egg\" security dilemma, where Israel may not leave the West Bank to PASF until they can suppress attacks, but PASF can't develop this capacity while Israeli forces stir Palestinian resentment. The IDF restricts PASF operations through curfews, checkpoints, and limitations on arms transfers. The effectiveness of the IDF in apprehending terror suspects reinforces Israeli skepticism about handing over control of anti-terror operations to the PA. Many PASF personnel feel that IDF operations undermine public confidence in the PA forces as legitimate protectors. Israelis may need to be convinced of the PA forces' capability to suppress terrorist infrastructures before agreeing to IDF withdrawal from the West Bank and the creation of a Palestinian state. The PA forces need to demonstrate their capability in suppressing terrorist infrastructures to convince Israel to withdraw IDF presence in the West Bank and establish a Palestinian state. Training at JIPTC focuses on law and order rather than counterterrorism techniques, raising doubts about the PA's current and future capabilities in this area. Recent PASF operations against Hamas militants may not necessarily indicate overall progress in counterterrorism efforts. Success in building the PA's counterterrorism capacity within a consolidated security structure subject to civilian control is crucial. Building the PA's counterterrorism capacity under civilian control is crucial for progress in negotiations with Israel. The USSC may need broader authority over PASF organizations to ensure effective security reforms. Limiting USSC involvement with PA intelligence organizations could pose risks to the security reform mission. The risk exists that exceptions to security reform could undo successes achieved by organizations like the National Security Forces. Palestinian public blames Dayton for human rights abuses and political intimidation, handled exclusively by the CIA. Lack of harmonization in the U.S. approach leads Palestinian counterparts to believe the U.S. Consulate and CIA, not Dayton, lead on policy and funding. Objection to involving USSC directly with PA intelligence organizations due to potential risks. The U.S. risks appearing improper by getting closer to PA intelligence organizations with questionable human rights records. However, some argue that helping the PSO and GIS address accountability and human rights issues is more important for PA security reform. Current U.S. security assistance efforts are compared to those during the Arafat era, but differences are noted, such as recruiting new troops for U.S.-sponsored NSF battalions instead of using recycled militiamen. Some observers question the effectiveness of U.S. security assistance efforts in the Palestinian Authority, despite improvements in training and recruitment for NSF battalions. Concerns remain about undisciplined elements in the PA security forces and potential provocations from Israel that could escalate conflict. Skeptics doubt that the differences from the Arafat era are enough to guarantee a better outcome. Despite improvements in training and recruitment for NSF battalions, concerns remain about undisciplined elements in the PA security forces and potential provocations from Israel. Skeptics question the effectiveness of U.S. security assistance efforts in the Palestinian Authority, noting similarities to the Arafat era and the challenges of consolidating security organizations under civilian control. International assistance often bypasses the Ministry of Interior, raising doubts about countering institutional inertia. Israeli officials' positive characterizations of PA security efforts are also viewed with skepticism. Efforts by Israeli officials in recent months resemble praise during the Arafat era after the 1998 Wye River Memorandum. US efforts to broker Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation are tied to hopes for progress in peace negotiations. Concerns arise about potential damage to Israeli-PA security cooperation if political progress towards a two-state solution is not achieved under the Obama Administration. The risk of PA forces using their training against Israel despite efforts to prevent it, potential challenges in reaching a political resolution due to Hamas control in Gaza, and questions of legitimacy surrounding Palestinian leadership. Lessons from US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are considered in current security efforts. Several military officers and political actors have concluded that tactical successes in security must be reinforced by economic and political progress to draw support away from extremist groups like Al Qaeda and the Taliban. This logic may also apply to PA security reform, linking success to economic development and resolving disputes with Israel to weaken support for Hamas and other militant groups. Security alone is not enough for a Palestinian state, as noted by Dayton in a 2009 interview. In March 2009, a senior U.S. officer emphasized the importance of economic development alongside security measures in counterinsurgency operations. This approach aims to provide jobs, restore personal pride, dignity, and hope to local citizens to deter radicalism and violence. The lack of consideration for these factors by Israel contributes to the undermining of Palestinian security forces' credibility. The Palestinian rocket threat post-second intifada has made meeting Israeli security expectations more challenging. The second intifada has made meeting Israeli security expectations more challenging. A report by U.S. defense policy experts suggested that Israel may be hesitant to withdraw from the West Bank without guarantees against rocket attacks. The 111th Congress has the opportunity to monitor the Obama Administration's actions closely, including security assistance efforts. The 111th Congress may consider U.S. security assistance efforts in the Israeli-Palestinian political track, Palestinian civil society, governance, and economic development, and efforts to end divisions between Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Concerns include the legitimacy of Abbas and the PA, and whether U.S. involvement is strengthening or detracting from them. The 111th Congress may consider U.S. security assistance efforts in the Israeli-Palestinian political track, Palestinian civil society, governance, and economic development. Concerns include the legitimacy of Abbas and the PA, and whether U.S. involvement is strengthening or detracting from them. Some argue that efforts to bolster Palestinian moderates have inadvertently made Hamas stronger, while others question if U.S. assistance can help the PA overcome security challenges and obstacles. The challenges faced by U.S. security assistance in the Israeli-Palestinian political track include obstacles posed by Israeli occupation and concerns about contributing to future violence. Periodic reevaluations are recommended for cost-efficiency and effectiveness of training, equipment provision, and strategic assistance. There is also a concern that U.S. efforts could be used by Israelis or Palestinians to fit a political narrative not in U.S. interests of promoting a lasting two-state solution. Some question the sustainability of PA security reform efforts and its economic dependence on international donors. Concerns include the ability to cover salary obligations, pensions, facility maintenance, and equipment acquisition. Some recommend improving the quality and quantity of USSC staff members to reduce the PA's dependence on external assistance. The Washington Institute for Near East Policy suggests staffing the USSC to capacity with personnel possessing Arabic-language skills and military experience. Some suggest increasing the number of full-time USSC staff to enhance its effectiveness, with an ideal range of 50 to 80 personnel. The expansion should align with Palestinian Authority needs and other donor commitments to better support Palestinian moderates. This would require assessing resources and capabilities to determine the mission's potential impact beyond its current efforts. Expanding the USSC/INL mandate could involve increases in personnel and funding to enhance its effectiveness in supporting Palestinian moderates. Giving USSC/INL too many tasks could hinder the security assistance effort by spreading resources too thin and distracting from core objectives. The core objectives include training and outfitting National Security Forces, assisting the Ministry of Interior with strategic planning, and facilitating Israeli-Palestinian security coordination. $13.5 million out of $295 million has been allocated for these efforts. Measures should be taken to ensure that other assistance programs do not obstruct USSC/INL's mandate. Some have raised concerns about travel restrictions for American staff members. Some have protested the strict limitations on travel by American staff members of the USSC to and within the West Bank, suggesting that greater freedom could increase effectiveness. Calls have been made to exclude USSC staff from travel limitations and transfer authority to the Defense Department to remove restrictions on assistance. However, formal militarization of the mission could upset the current balance. Formally militarizing the U.S. security assistance mission to the PA could disrupt the current diplomatic balance. The Defense Department, focused on military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, may not be eager to take on full responsibility. Interagency consultation and coordination are ongoing, drawing on international donor best practices. Congress should prioritize contingency planning for unforeseen regional events. The curr_chunk discusses working closely with the Obama Administration on potential contingencies related to Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements, Palestinian statehood, Hamas involvement in government, PA authority in Gaza, and authoritarian rule in the West Bank. The curr_chunk discusses potential responses to various contingencies in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including authoritarian rule in the West Bank, Palestinian factional conflict, and outbreaks of violence in the region. Response options may include cessation or expansion of U.S. assistance, continuation of security assistance through specific Palestinian entities, and plans for integrating PA and Hamas forces. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict may lead to responses such as cessation or expansion of U.S. assistance, integration of PA and Hamas forces, and coordination with peacekeeping forces. Secretary of State Clinton warned of withdrawing assistance if Hamas did not meet Quartet conditions. Congressional involvement in contingency planning could be through public hearings, private consultations, or information-gathering visits. Weigh the pros and cons of publicity carefully when considering security assistance efforts for the Palestinian Authority. Congress should regularly evaluate progress and tailor appropriations based on these evaluations, with benchmarks such as terrorist attack frequency and progress in dismantling terror networks. Performance benchmarks for the PA and its security forces could be verified through executive branch certification. Proposed benchmarks for Palestinian Authority security reform should be verifiable through executive branch certification or third-party observation. The impact of U.S. assistance should be isolated from other variables to track progress effectively. Consideration should be given to how benchmarks fit into the larger Israeli-Palestinian context, potentially adjusting based on Israeli actions such as easing restrictions or removing obstacles. An alternative to setting benchmarks for Palestinian Authority security reform could be requiring periodic reports on U.S. assistance and PA security activities from the executive branch. This approach would provide accountability without specific benchmarks, allowing flexibility for Congress to assess the success of U.S. security assistance. An option for Congress is to require periodic audits of U.S. security assistance to the Palestinian Authority by the Comptroller General/Government Accountability Office (GAO). An initial report from GAO on this assistance is expected in spring 2010."
