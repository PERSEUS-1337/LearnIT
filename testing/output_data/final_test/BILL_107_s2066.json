    "content": "The Act is titled the \"International Cooperative Antiterrorism Act of 2002\" and includes findings related to terrorism. Congress finds that terrorism is detestable and illegitimate, international terrorist organizations pose a direct threat to the United States with the proliferation of dangerous weapons, and the war against terrorism must continue with cooperation from other countries and entities. Protecting the United States from terrorism is a top priority in foreign relations, requiring global cooperation to prevent financing, share information, eliminate terror cells, and combat anti-Americanism. The promotion of terrorism, intolerance, and anti-Americanism in state-owned media and education systems poses a long-term threat to the safety of the United States and global security. Cooperation in the global war on terrorism is essential, as many countries are not countering proterrorist messages, which undermines US security interests. The National Commission on Terrorism recommends strengthening efforts to discourage countries from supporting international terrorists and suggests the President designate foreign governments as \"not fully cooperative\" with US counterterrorism efforts. United States assistance programs and transfers are also highlighted. United States assistance programs and the transfer of items on the United States Munitions List are crucial for US foreign policy and combating global terrorism. Countries receiving this assistance must support the global fight against terrorism, as various laws prohibit aid to nations that do not cooperate in anti-terror efforts. The United States requires countries to fully cooperate in global antiterror efforts to receive assistance, including preventing the promotion of terror in media and educational systems. The United States policy states that no assistance or export licenses will be provided to any foreign country or entity that is not fully cooperative in the global war against international terrorism. SEC. 4 prohibits United States assistance and commercial arms exports to any country or entity not fully cooperative in the global war against international terrorism. No assistance or export licenses will be provided unless the President determines maximum effort in cooperation. The President, with key officials, must prepare an annual report listing countries or entities not fully cooperative in the global war against terrorism. The report details specific failures and reasons for lack of cooperation. The annual report on countries or entities not fully cooperative in the global war on terrorism must be submitted to Congress by December 31 each year. The report will not be classified, but may include a classified addendum if necessary. The Presidential waiver allows for United States assistance or exports to be provided to a country or entity if the President deems it essential to national security interests. A report must be submitted to Congress 15 days before such assistance is permitted. In this Act, the term \"expression of support for terrorism against the United States\" refers to actions or expressions that provoke anti-American violence or glorify violence against US citizens or officials. The term \"fully cooperative in the global war against international terrorism\" means a country or entity that prevents financing of terrorism, including direct financial support to terrorist organizations. The curr_chunk discusses measures to prevent terrorist organizations from receiving financial services and soliciting funds, as well as the sharing of intelligence information with the United States. The curr_chunk outlines actions against terrorist organizations, including preventing terrorist acts, safe houses, and providing support to US investigators. The curr_chunk focuses on countries taking actions against terrorism, such as investigating suspected terrorists, enforcing international agreements, and curbing support for terrorism in state-owned media and gatherings. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to actions against terrorism, including humanitarian assistance and terrorist organizations designated by the Secretary of State. It also outlines the meaning of United States assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The curr_chunk defines the United States Munitions List as defense articles and services controlled by the President under the Arms Export Control Act."
