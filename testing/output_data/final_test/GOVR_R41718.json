    "content": "The federal deposit insurance system in the United States, established in the 1930s, protects depositors from losses due to unprofitable lending activities and bank runs. Deposit insurance promotes public confidence in the financial system, especially during times of large losses. During the 2008 financial crisis, the number of depository institution failures increased, with the FDIC administering 25. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) administered multiple bank failures from 2008 to 2011, with a decline in failures after 2011. The Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) reimburses depositors when banks fail. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) reported credit union failures from 2005 to 2011, with some corporate credit unions facing liquidity issues and placed under conservatorship. The NCUA manages funds in the NCUSIF to reimburse credit union members. Credit union failures have decreased since 2011. Regulators and legislators responded to the depletion of the DIF and a temporary dip in the NCUSIF by increasing deposit insurance assessments and borrowing funds from the U.S. Treasury. The 111th Congress provided the FDIC and NCUA with greater liquidity support for depository institutions. Additional legislative action may be needed depending on future developments. The report provides an overview of the FDIC and NCUA, the status of the DIF and NCUSIF, and resolution procedures for failing depository institutions. Efforts to support the DIF and minimize losses to the NCUSIF are summarized. The FDIC insures various types of bank deposits under the Glass-Steagall Act. The FDIC insures various types of bank deposits, including checking accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit, as well as funds held in traditional and Roth IRAs. It provides separate coverage for deposits in different account ownership categories. When a bank fails, the FDIC assumes responsibility for repayment of the principal balance in depositor accounts up to the insurance limits, with most depositors having access to their insured funds within one business day. Additional time may be required for certain deposits like 401(k) accounts, but the FDIC aims to make an insurance determination within several days. The FDIC provides insurance coverage for various types of bank deposits, including checking accounts, savings accounts, and IRAs. In the event of a bank failure, depositors can typically access their insured funds within a few days. Congress has increased the maximum deposit insurance coverage over the years to enhance public confidence and reduce the risk of bank runs. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2006 raised the limit on deposit insurance for IRAs to $250,000. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 temporarily raised the limit on deposit insurance until December 31, 2009, providing coverage of up to $250,000 for individual checking accounts and IRAs. The FDIC provides insurance coverage for various types of bank deposits, including checking accounts, savings accounts, and IRAs. Congress has increased the maximum deposit insurance coverage over the years to enhance public confidence and reduce the risk of bank runs. The increase in the deposit insurance limit was made effective until December 31, 2013 by the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009, and made permanent by the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. The FDIC collects insurance premiums from member depository institutions to cover losses associated with bank failures and maintains a designated reserve ratio (DRR) to protect depositors and maintain public confidence. The FDIC is required to devise a restoration plan to recapitalize the fund if it falls below its mandated range. A well-capitalized DIF helps maintain public confidence in protecting deposits. By the end of 2013, there were $6,011 billion in FDIC-insured deposits and 24 bank failures. The decline in insured deposits from 2012 to 2013 was due to the expiration of temporary unlimited insurance coverage on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. The DRR was 0.79% as of December 31, 2013, reflecting losses to the DIF and an increase in insured deposits. The FDIC has adopted a restoration plan to meet the 1.35% minimum requirement. The FDIC has adopted a restoration plan to recapitalize the DFF to meet the 1.35% minimum requirement by September 30, 2020. Credit unions are non-profit depository financial institutions owned and operated by members. Retail credit unions hold member deposits referred to as \"shares\" and provide loans, while corporate credit unions offer financing and investment services to retail credit unions. U.S. Central Federal Credit Union is one such corporate credit union. The U.S. Central Federal Credit Union is a wholesale corporate that serves 27 other corporate credit unions. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) oversees federally regulated credit unions, providing chartering, supervision, and deposit insurance. Share deposit insurance helps prevent panic behavior and failures, with NCUA serving as the lender-of-last-resort for credit unions. The NCUA provides insurance coverage for individual account holders up to the legal limit, including IRA and KEOGH accounts. The federal deposit insurance coverage limit was raised to $250,000 for non-retirement accounts until 2009 and made permanent by the Dodd-Frank Act. The NCUSIF, managed by the NCUA, is the insurance fund for federally regulated credit unions funded by premiums from insured credit unions, similar to the FDIC's DIF. The NCUSIF is funded by premiums from insured credit unions, similar to the FDIC's DIF. Premiums cover operating expenses, losses, and reserves. Premiums were originally set at one-twelfth of 1% of member share accounts, but P.L. 98-369 required a 1% deposit. Examination fees and penalties collected are also deposited. Reserves consist of the 1% deposit, insurance premiums, fees, and interest earnings. The statutory equity ratio is set at a minimum of 1.2%. The NCUA Board determines the \"normal operating level\" annually. The NCUA Board annually determines the \"normal operating level\" for the ratio of fund equity to insured shares, which must fall between 1.2% and 1.5%. A procyclical bias exists in the pricing of NCUA share deposit insurance, with premiums assessed if the ratio falls below 1.2% and dividends declared if it exceeds 1.5%. This can impact the NCUSIF during economic downturns depending on the pace of failures and losses in the credit union system. HFSTHA extends the time to restore the equity ratio below 1.2% to eight years, potentially reducing the need for assessments to rise. In 2008, corporate credit unions faced liquidity pressures due to mortgage-backed securities losing value. Several credit unions were placed into conservatorship in 2009 and 2010. In 2009 and 2010, several credit unions, including U.S. Central, WesCorp, and Southwest Corporate Federal Credit Union, were placed into conservatorship. These corporates represented a significant portion of the system's assets and investment losses. By the end of 2013, there were 17 credit union failures, with $865 billion in NCUA-insured share deposits. The NCUSIF equity ratio was 1.30% as of December 31, 2013, with actions taken to minimize losses to the credit union system. The FDIC and NCUA resolution procedures involve closing insured depository institutions that fail to maintain sufficient capital. Bank assets include consumer and commercial loans, while liabilities consist of funds borrowed to provide loans. Banks borrow from depositors to originate loans, renewing short-term borrowings until longer-term loans are repaid. Banks fund loans by borrowing from depositors, treating their funds as short-term loans. Deposits are considered a stable and inexpensive funding source, especially for community banks. Banks can borrow funds through various methods such as the federal funds market, repurchase agreements, and loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The composition of a financial institution's liabilities changes more frequently than its assets due to the refinancing of short-term borrowings. The total amounts of federally insured deposits are estimates and not known with certainty until a bank fails. Financial ratios are computed to determine if a bank has enough reserves. Banks must maintain sufficient reserves to act as buffers against default and liquidity risks. If a bank fails to meet required ratio thresholds, it may become insolvent and be shut down by regulators to protect depositors. The FDIC is appointed as the receiver of failed banks and evaluates resolution alternatives to minimize costs to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). The FDIC pursues the least-costly transaction, typically a purchase and assumption process, to resolve failed banks. This involves a healthy institution buying assets and liabilities of the failed bank. The goal is to minimize costs to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) and ensure minimal disruptions to customers. Total losses to the DIF may exceed deposit reimbursement costs due to additional expenses in resolving bank failures. The FDIC repays bank creditors ahead of depositors, with the FHLB having priority. Loss-sharing agreements limit potential losses for acquiring banks. Unpurchased assets are liquidated by the FDIC. Predicting DIF costs is difficult due to unknown insured deposits. NCUA uses a net worth-asset ratio for credit union solvency. The NCUA determines credit union solvency using a net worth-asset ratio. Under-capitalized credit unions are considered insolvent. The NCUA shuts down insolvent credit unions and acts as the receiver, pursuing the least-costly transaction to minimize impact on the NCUSIF. The NCUA employs a P&A process to sell assets of failed credit unions. Total losses to the NCUSIF are not limited to costs of reimbursing insured share deposits. The NCUSIF absorbs administrative costs related to resolving credit union failures, such as repaying FHLB loans and liquidating remaining assets. Insolvency of insurance funds can occur after a systemic risk event, leading to increased risk for U.S. taxpayers. An economic downturn can be devastating for smaller institutions, such as credit unions with members in hard-hit industries like construction. Small banks in areas with large home value declines also face widespread mortgage defaults. This systemic risk, combined with pricing biases in deposit assessments, increases the risk of insurance fund insolvency. The economic downturn poses a risk of insurance fund insolvency for smaller institutions like credit unions and small banks. The DIF became insolvent in 2009, but the FDIC avoided borrowing from the U.S. Treasury. The NCUSIF remained solvent, but losses were placed on an off-balance sheet funded by a line of credit from the U.S. Treasury. Efforts by legislators and regulators to protect the funds and taxpayers are discussed in more detail in Appendix A. The DIF declined in 2008 and became negative in 2009, with the DRR reaching a low of -0.39. Efforts were made to support the DIF, including an increase in FDIC borrowing authority to $100 billion from $30 billion in 2009. The FDIC's borrowing authority was increased to $500 billion until December 31, 2010, and then to $100 billion permanently from the U.S. Treasury. The FDIC implemented a risk-based assessment system in 1993 to charge higher premiums to riskier financial institutions. Well-capitalized institutions with high examination ratings are not charged premiums when the DIF is at a certain level. The FDIC implemented a risk-based assessment system in 1993 to charge higher premiums to riskier financial institutions. High examination ratings shall not be charged premiums when the DIF is at or above the statutorily set DRR. Some economists argue that this limitation creates a procyclical bias in deposit insurance pricing, leading to dramatic premium increases during financial downturns. FDIC Chair Donna Tanoue testified in 2001 that 92% of insured depository institutions in the best-risk category were not paying deposit insurance assessments, rendering the risk-based premium system ineffective. The FDIC requested elimination of statutory restrictions to charge risk-based premiums to all institutions even when the DIF level exceeds its statutory limit. The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 gave the FDIC authority to charge risk-based premiums to individual banks based on riskiness, regardless of DIF level. Despite this, the FDIC was unable to collect assessments when DIF exceeded 1.35%. The Dodd-Frank Act aimed to eliminate procyclical bias in deposit insurance assessments by giving the FDIC sole discretion to suspend assessments. The FDIC has the authority to suspend or limit dividend payments to financial institutions to eliminate procyclical deposit insurance assessments. They aim to maintain a DRR of 2% to prevent the DIF from becoming negative in future crises. Changes to the pricing of deposit insurance were proposed in April 2010 and further revised in November 2010 in line with the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC made revisions to the assessment system in response to the Dodd-Frank Act, with a formal risk analysis approach similar to credit underwriting. The new system has separate structures for large, complex, and small depository institutions based on total assets. Large institutions are those with $10 billion or more in assets for four consecutive quarters, while highly complex institutions have over $50 billion in assets fully owned by a parent. Large depository institutions with over $50 billion in assets, fully owned by a parent company with over $500 billion in assets, or processing banks with over $10 billion in assets are assessed separately. Data is collected during examinations and evaluated using a scorecard with variables including CAMELS ratings, risk-based capital ratios, core deposits to total liabilities ratio, and loss severity score. The scorecard used for assessing large depository institutions includes variables like CAMELS ratings, risk-based capital ratios, core deposits to total liabilities ratio, and loss severity score. This scorecard computes performance and loss severity scores between 0 and 100, which are then used to determine the initial base assessment rate. Adjustments are made for certain liabilities to calculate the final assessment rate, incentivizing institutions to reduce excessive risks. During economic expansions, loan underwriting standards are relaxed, impacting small depository institutions' risk-based deposit insurance assessments based on CAMELS ratings and capitalization levels. Institutions receive CAMELS ratings from 1 to 5 and are classified based on leverage ratios. They are grouped into risk categories based on their capitalization and CAMELS ratings. The assessment rate for risk categories III and IV is determined by a base rate adjusted for the bank's holdings. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the assessment base to average total assets minus tangible equity, impacting deposit insurance assessments for banks. This new structure prevents banks from reducing assessments by choosing non-deposit funding options. The FDIC announced an increase in deposit insurance assessments to restore the DIF to its statutory requirement by the end of 2013. Assessments were raised by seven basis points starting January 1, 2009, with a special assessment fee imposed on all banks to replenish the DIF. The time horizon to accumulate the DRR level was extended to seven years from the initial five. The FDIC imposed special assessment fees on banks to replenish the DIF during the banking crisis. An emergency special assessment was also imposed on member banks in 2009. Additionally, a rule required member institutions to prepay deposit insurance assessments for 2010, 2011, and 2012. The FDIC announced that it would consider requests to be exempted from the prepayment requirement on a case-by-case basis. The FDIC has other options for reducing its liquidity needs, such as imposing additional special assessments or borrowing from the U.S. Treasury. Member institutions would repay borrowings through assessments, either today or in the future. The prepayment option could be less expensive for the industry than borrowing from the Treasury and repaying with additional interest charges. The FDIC created the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) on October 14, 2008, to encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing senior unsecured debt issued before October 31, 2009. A surcharge was imposed on debt issued after April 1, 2009, with a maturity date of one year or more. The Transaction Account Guarantee (TAG) component insured non-interest-bearing deposit accounts, primarily used by businesses. The Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) was created by the FDIC on October 14, 2008, to guarantee senior unsecured debt and insure non-interest-bearing deposit accounts above the $250,000 limit. Eligible financial institutions were automatically registered unless they opted out by November 12, 2008. Insured institutions paid fees after 30 days, with a 75 basis point fee for senior unsecured debt and a 10 basis point surcharge for non-interest-bearing deposit accounts. The FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) included the Transaction Account Guarantee (TAG) program, which provided unlimited insurance for non-interest-bearing deposit accounts above $250,000. Nearly all FDIC-insured institutions participated in TAG, and after the Dodd-Frank Act, participation became mandatory. TAG was extended until December 31, 2012, with losses not significantly impacting the DIF reserve ratio goal. The TAG program, which provided unlimited insurance for non-interest-bearing deposit accounts above $250,000, expired, impacting the DIF reserve ratio requirement of 1.35 by September 30, 2020. Efforts were made to support the NCUSIF, including the establishment of the Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund to absorb losses related to corporate credit union investments. The NCUA can borrow from the Stabilization Fund to cover costs of conservatorship or liquidation of corporate credit unions. HFSTHA increased NCUA's borrowing authority to $6 billion and emergency borrowing to $30 billion. Premium assessments on credit unions will repay the Treasury in seven years. The Central Liquidity Facility provides liquidity for credit unions and is owned by member credit unions. The Central Liquidity Facility (CLF) is owned by member credit unions and should be used as a back-up funding source, similar to the Federal Reserve's discount window. Congress raised the CLF's borrowing cap to $41 billion. The NCUACA of 2010 made statutory changes to reduce losses to the NCUSIF, including changes in accounting definitions and standards. The NCUACA clarified accounting definitions to address the dilution of net worth in credit union mergers. This allowed for more cost-effective options in resolving failed institutions, such as modifying accounting definitions and maintaining the NCUSIF equity ratio. The NCUACA amendment clarified accounting definitions to address net worth dilution in credit union mergers. It ensured that the equity ratio of the NCUSIF is based solely on unconsolidated financial statements to prevent additional premium assessments. This flexibility allows for managing the repayment of the Stabilization Fund without burdening the credit union system. The Stabilization Fund previously had to borrow from the U.S. Treasury to cover losses in the corporate credit union system, delaying premium increases until after incurring debt obligations. The NCUA issued final amendments to its rule governing corporate credit unions on September 24, 2010. Corporate credit unions will now be regulated for safety and soundness under a risk-based capital scheme similar to FDIC insured banks. They must meet three minimum capital ratios and prompt corrective actions will apply to those that fail to meet the capital requirements. The new capital requirements will be phased in over a 10-year period. Prompt corrective actions will now apply to corporates that fail to meet capital requirements, including restrictions on activities, investments, dividends, executive compensation, management changes, and possible conservatorship. The NCUA approved a share deposit premium charge to restore the NCUSIF equity ratio, with a total premium of 26 basis points. The U.S. Central Federal Credit Union received a $1 billion infusion from the NCUA through a NCUSIF capital note. The NCUA injected $1 billion into the U.S. Central Federal Credit Union through a NCUSIF capital note and implemented a temporary guarantee on uninsured shares at corporate credit unions to maintain funding sources and creditor confidence. They also established voluntary guarantee programs like the Temporary Corporate Credit Union Liquidity Guarantee Program (TCCULGP) to provide a 100% guarantee on new unsecured debt obligations. The Temporary Corporate Credit Union Share Guarantee Program (TCCUSGP) guaranteed uninsured shares of corporate credit unions through December 31, 2010, and was extended through December 31, 2012 after the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act."
