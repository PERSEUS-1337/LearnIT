    "content": "Climate change is a global issue, with responses needed at the national level. The US ratified the UNFCCC in 1992, calling for reductions in greenhouse gases. Various actions have been proposed, including monitoring emissions and promoting renewable energy. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, focusing on voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Administration's 2006 Climate Action Report focused on voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Only seven out of roughly 50 programs were regulatory, aimed at achieving energy or environmental goals with concomitant emissions reductions. Indirect regulation and \"no regrets\" policies may be replaced by direct regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, as seen in the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA Supreme Court decision. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA can regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The court also directed the EPA to determine if greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, which could lead to their regulation. In 2008, the Senate considered legislation for an economy-wide cap-and-trade system to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, but it ultimately failed to pass. The report provides background on the evolution of U.S. climate change policy from ratification of the UNFCCC to current major regulatory programs and energy legislation enacted in the 109th and 110th Congresses. U.S. policy evolved from a \"study only\" to a \"study and action\" orientation in 1992 with completion of the UNFCCC in Rio de Janeiro, focusing on energy use to address climate change. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) released a report on global warming during the UNFCCC deliberations, stating that the US could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10-40% of 1990 levels at low cost. The report recommended increasing energy conservation and efficiency, incorporating global warming in energy planning, and implementing \"full social cost pricing\" of energy. However, many recommendations were not applied due to concerns about scientific uncertainty and economic costs. The George H. W. Bush Administration refused to agree to a binding agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by a specific date. The UNFCCC called for voluntary control measures, with concerns raised in the Senate about compliance costs and economic competitiveness. Arguments for emissions controls included job creation and economic health benefits, with a focus on developed countries leading emission reduction efforts. The UNFCCC set a goal for developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. The United States submitted plans in 1992, 1994, 1997, 2002, and 2006, with the Energy Policy Act of 1992 being the basis for their response. Programs like appliance energy efficiency standards and building codes were developed in response to global climate change concerns. In 1992, the George H. W. Bush Administration listed 11 titles of EPACT as crucial for reducing greenhouse gases and addressing global climate change concerns. EPACT included provisions for energy-efficiency standards, national research programs, and DOE evaluation of energy efficiency technologies. Title XVI of EPACT focused on incorporating global warming concerns into energy policy planning. Title XVI of EPACT authorized the DOE to collect, analyze, and report on climate change, including implications of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing a least-cost energy strategy. It aimed to stabilize or reduce emissions at little cost, with the expectation of substantial reductions in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The United States aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through programs demonstrating clean coal and renewable technologies, energy efficiency initiatives, and provisions for electric utilities and alternative fuels. Previous administrations pursued climate change initiatives without requesting regulatory authority from Congress, focusing on governmental actions to achieve emission reduction goals. The Clinton Action Plans, similar to those developed under the George H. W. Bush Administration, aimed to implement governmental actions and incentivize private industry to reduce emissions. These plans focused on conserving energy, increasing efficiency, and encouraging natural gas use, while also strengthening regulatory standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 1994 Clinton plan expanded on previous initiatives by increasing funding and support for emission reductions, and introduced new proposals such as the \"Golden Carrot\" program for industrial efficiency improvements. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol outlined legally binding emissions reductions for developed countries below 1990 levels, with the Clinton Administration committing to a 7% reduction. Critics raised concerns about the protocol's impact on the U.S. commitment. The Kyoto Protocol raised concerns about the cost, competitiveness, and comprehensiveness of the U.S. global climate change policy. The failure to meet emission reduction goals set at Rio in 1992 questioned the feasibility of significant greenhouse gas reductions at low costs. Critics worried about the protocol's potential costs affecting competitiveness and its exclusion of developing countries from mandatory emission reductions. The George W. Bush Administration rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 due to concerns about emission reductions, cost, competitiveness, and comprehensiveness. President Bush criticized the protocol for exempting China and other developing countries from emissions reduction provisions, calling it unrealistic and economically harmful for the U.S. Compliance with Kyoto targets was deemed unfeasible and arbitrary, with potential negative impacts on the economy. President Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, citing concerns about emission reductions, cost, competitiveness, and comprehensiveness. He called for a new approach to address global climate change, focusing on science and market-based incentives. The proposed voluntary greenhouse gas reduction program aimed to improve the economy's carbon intensity and included global participation, especially from developing countries with high emissions. The Administration proposed a plan to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy by lowering emissions to 151 metric tons per million dollars of GDP by 2012. The plan included voluntary initiatives, increased spending, and tax incentives. Three-quarters of the reduction was expected to come from current efforts, with a projected 4.5% decrease in emissions by 2010. However, this would still be 28% higher than the 1990 level defined by the UNFCCC. It is uncertain if the targets will be met without explicit requirements. The key piece of the proposal was Climate VISION, announced in 2003. Climate VISION, created in 2003 in response to President Bush's goal of reducing greenhouse gas intensity, aims to assist energy-intensive sectors in developing plans to reduce emissions. The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate focuses on international efforts to reduce emissions outside of the Kyoto Protocol, with the United States and Australia rejecting Kyoto. The partnership focuses on clean energy technologies and emissions reductions from key sectors. The United States convened a meeting of major economies responsible for greenhouse gas emissions in September 2007. The meeting emphasized the need to integrate such discussions into UNFCCC negotiations. The U.S. focused on aspirational reduction goals, rejecting mandatory targets and emphasizing research, information, and voluntary programs to address greenhouse gases. Climate Action Reports submitted to the UNFCCC include various programs aimed at reducing U.S. emissions. The U.S. has implemented regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for a small portion of overall efforts but a significant share of reductions. These programs, established for reasons other than climate change, have only decreased emissions by about 3% since 2000. Despite these efforts, total U.S. emissions have continued to rise, increasing by 3% between 2000 and 2005 and by 17% since 1990. The federal regulatory programs discussed are primarily from the George W. Bush Administration's 2006 submission to UNFCCC, focusing on mandatory programs with some voluntary initiatives. The submission to UNFCCC highlighted mandatory and voluntary programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Climate Action Report listed seven regulatory programs, with two additional ones not included in the list. These programs aim to control emissions from landfills and electricity generators, with estimated effects on greenhouse gas emissions summarized in Table 1. EPA is required to regulate emissions from large solid waste landfills under Section 305 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Regulations in 1996 require large landfills emitting over 50 metric tons of landfill gases to control emissions of ozone-producing VOCs and air toxics. Landfills were noted as the largest U.S. source of methane emissions (40%), with regulations indirectly reducing methane emissions by 50%. The rule resulted in 8.7 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent methane emissions reductions in 2002, expected to increase to 9.9 million metric tons by 2020. Efforts to protect the environment also target ozone-depleting substances that are greenhouse gases. Efforts to protect the ozone layer also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as some substances are both ozone-depleting and greenhouse gases. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, specifically Title VI, address ozone depletion domestically and fulfill international obligations under the Montreal Protocol. The EPA's program under Section 612 identifies alternatives to banned ozone-depleting substances, considering risks to human health and the environment. In 1994, the EPA recognized the increased global warming risk associated with some alternatives. In 1994, EPA established regulations focusing on global warming potential of substitutes for ozone-depleting chemicals. Restrictions on HFCs and PFCs have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 26 million metric tons in 2002, with a projected total reduction of 223 million metric tons by 2020. The 1987 NAECA set efficiency standards for major appliances. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) expanded efficiency standards for appliances, requiring the Department of Energy to develop and review mandatory standards. The goal is to achieve maximum energy efficiency while reducing carbon emissions. The Clinton Administration estimated significant energy savings and carbon emission reductions through appliance standards. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires updates to state commercial building standards to improve energy efficiency. DOE estimates reductions of carbon dioxide emissions by 17 million metric tons in 2020. States must review and update their commercial building codes based on DOE's determinations. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates updates to state commercial building standards for energy efficiency, with estimated savings of 130 million barrels of oil equivalent over 10 years. The 2006 Climate Action Plan predicts carbon dioxide savings of 0.5 million metric tons in 2012, increasing to 3.1 million metric tons in 2020. Federal fuel economy standards impact greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated updates to state commercial building standards for energy efficiency, aiming to reduce dependence on foreign oil. Increasing CAFE standards for vehicles would lead to fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Concerns include occupant safety and vehicle choice. In 1994, the Clinton Administration considered raising CAFE standards for light trucks, but Congress froze the standards until a study by the National Academy of Sciences in 2001. The National Academy of Sciences study in 2001 found that a 40% improvement in light truck fuel economy over 10-15 years was possible without compromising safety. The Department of Transportation (DOT) increased light truck CAFE standards to 22.2 miles per gallon by 2007 and estimated a savings of 42 million metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2012. Further changes were announced in 2006, with new standards based on vehicle size starting in 2008, estimated to save an additional 4.4 billion gallons of gasoline between 2008 and 2011. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 required a significant increase in vehicle fuel economy, with a target of 35 mpg by 2020. This could lead to a reduction of 18-22 million metric tons of greenhouse gases. The MY2008 standards were remanded back to DOT due to a lack of explicit valuation of greenhouse gas reductions. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 aimed to increase vehicle fuel economy, leading to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The new CAFE standards are estimated to save 400 million metric tons per year and 3,800 million metric tons total by 2030. The regulations for Model Years 2011-2015 could save 521 million metric tons of CO2 over the life of those vehicles. EISA expanded the renewable fuel standard and set requirements for lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of motor fuels. EPA did not estimate emissions reductions from the program in the 2006 Climate Action Report. The Distributed Energy Program at the Department of Energy aims to lower emissions and eliminate regulatory barriers. DOE estimates it saved 12.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2002 and will save 57 million metric tons in 2020. Section 821 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments requires monitoring of carbon dioxide at electric generating facilities. EPA did not estimate emissions reductions from the program. The EPA regulations allow facilities to monitor carbon dioxide emissions through continuous emission monitoring or fuel analysis. This regulation targets global climate change and is a necessary first step towards future greenhouse gas reduction programs. Accurate emissions data is crucial for developing any market-oriented control program. The 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) incentivized the development of renewable energy, particularly biomass, through a mandatory purchase clause for qualifying facilities. This exemption from regulation has led to a substantial increase in renewable energy capacity in the US. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 repealed the Section 210 purchase requirement for new contracts under PURPA, aiming to promote energy security and reduce dependence on fossil fuels, leading to a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions. The Clinton Administration estimated that renewable energy efforts would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 17.6 million metric tons of carbon equivalent by 2010. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 repealed Section 210 for new PURPA contracts to promote energy security and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. President Bush signed the Act with provisions related to greenhouse gas emissions, establishing a voluntary national program for reducing greenhouse gases led by an Interagency Committee with DOE support. Title XVI of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, led by an Interagency Committee with DOE support, aims to reduce U.S. carbon intensity without mandating emission reductions. It includes a program to export carbon intensity-reducing technologies to developing countries. Section 1253 repeals the mandatory purchase requirement under PURPA for new contracts in competitive electricity markets. The final law did not include proposals to increase CAFE standards or establish a renewable portfolio standard. The Senate expressed that human activities are a significant cause of greenhouse gas accumulation, leading to rising temperatures. A bill for a market-based program to limit emissions was debated but defeated. President Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, containing provisions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change issues. The Act expanded the renewable fuel standard to blend renewable fuels into transportation fuels annually. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates an increased level of renewable fuels in transportation fuels, with a focus on advanced biofuels with lower greenhouse gas emissions. It also includes provisions for research on carbon capture and storage technologies, as well as the establishment of an Office for managing geologic carbon sequestration on public lands. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates renewable fuels in transportation with a focus on advanced biofuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions. It also establishes an Office for managing geologic carbon sequestration on public lands and requires research on carbon capture and storage technologies. Additionally, EISA requires the establishment of an Office of Climate Change and Environment in the Department of Transportation to coordinate research on reducing transportation-related energy use and addressing climate change impacts. Energy provisions include more stringent fuel economy standards, higher-efficiency appliances, government buildings, and renewable energy research and development. The 2005 Energy Policy Act and the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act aim to reduce energy consumption to lower emissions. Energy-related activities account for 86% of greenhouse gas emissions and 98% of carbon dioxide emissions in the country. These acts were influenced by climate change discussions during the signing of the UNFCCC in 1992, with federal policies and regulations playing a significant role in reducing greenhouse gases since then. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 were enacted to address energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. While these policies were influenced by climate change discussions, their impact on reducing emissions remains uncertain. Senate Amendment 866 called for a national program to limit greenhouse gases, but specific action on this issue is still pending. The issue depends on efforts to enact the national program called for in Senate Amendment 866. Previous energy laws have had mixed results in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Comprehensive climate change policy should integrate with energy policy to address emissions from energy supply and consumption. This will be a challenge for the 111th Congress and the incoming Administration's efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions."
