    "content": "Two proposals in the 109th Congress aim to regulate .50 caliber rifles more strictly. The Fifty Caliber Sniper Weapons Regulation Act of 2005 (S. 935) by Senator Dianne Feinstein would amend the National Firearms Act to tax and register these firearms. Representative James Moran's 50 Caliber Sniper Rifle Reduction Act (H.R. 654) would freeze the availability of these rifles to private individuals and ban further transfers. The proposal in H.R. 654 would ban the transfer of .50 caliber rifles, leading to their eventual elimination from civilian ownership. Owners would have to destroy or surrender these rifles to the ATF as contraband. There is no compensation provision for rifles handed over under this proposal. The definition of \".50 caliber sniper weapon\" includes rifles capable of firing .50 caliber ammunition. The .50 caliber BMG cartridge, originally developed for heavy machine guns, has gained popularity in long-range rifles since the 1980s. The Fifty Caliber Shooters Association promotes sporting uses of this cartridge through marksmanship matches of 1,000 yards or more. The proposed legislation to ban .50 caliber rifles is criticized for its broad definition, potentially including rifles not typically considered \"sniper rifles.\" The .50 caliber BMG cartridge, adopted by the U.S. Army in 1923, is significantly heavier than the .308 Winchester cartridge. It has a maximum effective range of 2,000 yards, a muzzle velocity of 2,900 feet per second, and a muzzle energy of 12,000 foot-pounds. The .50 caliber BMG round has increased \"knock down\" power and accuracy, capable of hitting targets at long ranges. The M-107 Long Range Sniper Rifle, adopted by the U.S. Army, is a semiautomatic rifle with a 10-round magazine and attached optics/electro-optics scope for all-weather, day/night tactical dominance. The M-107 Long Range Sniper Rifle, adopted by the U.S. Army, supports all weather, day/night tactical dominance. It is capable of delivering various types of fifty caliber BMG ammunition. The primary mission of this rifle is to engage and defeat material targets at extended ranges. The rifle weighs about 32 pounds and the unit price for a single rifle is $14,833. The government contractor for the M-107 is Barrett Firearms Manufacturing Company. The civilian market offers .50 caliber rifles ranging from $2,800 to $6,750. Military surplus .50 caliber ammunition resale is banned unless demilitarized, with exceptions for National Guard and foreign government use. Pre-ban ammunition is available but considered a specialty item. Gun control advocates warn of the potential misuse of long-range .50 caliber rifles. Gun control advocates warn of the potential dangers posed by long-range .50 caliber rifles, citing scenarios where terrorists could use them to bring down aircraft, puncture chemical tanks, or penetrate armored vehicles. Despite these concerns, law enforcement encounters with these weapons have been limited. Congress may consider stricter regulations on these rifles. Congress may consider more strictly regulating firearms under the National Firearms Act, which includes the regulation of machine guns, short-barreled rifles, shotguns, silencers, and other concealable firearms. State laws may be stricter than federal law, with some states prohibiting possession of machine guns and requiring permits for other firearms. Federal law serves as the minimum standard in the United States. The National Firearms Act (NFA) regulates lethal weapons like machine guns, short-barreled rifles, and shotguns, requiring registration and taxes on their manufacture and distribution. The Act was expanded in 1968 to include destructive devices and \"any other weapon.\" The registry is now maintained by the Attorney General. The Gun Control Act (GCA) of 1968 redefined firearms to exclude certain antique firearms and collectors' items, authorized the Attorney General to reclassify firearms as collectors' items, and increased penalties for violating the National Firearms Act (NFA). Additionally, an amnesty provision was included to address registration issues for NFA weapons. In 1986, the Firearms Owners' Protection Act (FOPA) further amended the GCA to prohibit the possession of machine guns. The Firearms Owners' Protection Act (FOPA) amended the Gun Control Act (GCA) in 1986 to freeze the number of legally available machine guns to the public. The National Firearms Act (NFA) requires the Attorney General to maintain a registry of NFA firearms and owners, delegated to the ATF Director. The NFA Branch at ATF manages the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record (NFRTR) database. The National Firearms Act (NFA) requires registration of firearms with biographic and address information. It is illegal to possess an unregistered NFA firearm, punishable by fines and imprisonment. To deal in NFA firearms, one must be a federal firearms licensee (FFL) and a special occupational taxpayer (SOT). NFA firearms are subject to manufacturing and transfer taxes, with Class three dealers handling these transactions. The National Firearms Act (NFA) requires registration of firearms with biographic and address information. To deal in NFA firearms, one must be a federal firearms licensee (FFL) and a special occupational taxpayer (SOT). NFA firearms are subject to manufacturing and transfer taxes. ATF places a tax stamp on the approved transfer document before the transferee can take possession of the firearm. Private individuals can acquire NFA firearms through approved transfers, making and registering an NFA firearm, or inheriting a lawfully registered NFA firearm. Congress could consider options for regulating long-range .50 caliber rifles, including registration under the NFA or banning further production for civilian use. Congress could consider various options for regulating long-range .50 caliber rifles, such as banning their production for civilian use, banning transfers of these firearms, compensating owners for turning them over to the government, recalling existing ammunition, and setting ballistic performance standards for acceptable use in sporting or recreational activities."
