Congress finds that Oliver L. Brown is honored as the lead plaintiff in the Topeka, Kansas case which challenged racial segregation in public education, organized through the NAACP. Oliver L. Brown was part of the NAACP strategy to file suit against school boards for racial segregation. He was a plaintiff in cases from Kansas, Delaware, South Carolina, and Virginia that were combined in Brown v. Board of Education. In Kansas, there were 11 school integration cases. In 1950, the NAACP in Topeka challenged the \"separate but equal\" doctrine in public education by filing the case of Oliver L. Brown et al. v. The Board of Education of Topeka Kansas. The district court ruled in favor of the school. In 1950, the NAACP challenged the \"separate but equal\" doctrine in public education by filing the case of Oliver L. Brown et al. v. The Board of Education of Topeka Kansas. The case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court and combined with other NAACP cases from Delaware, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., becoming known as Oliver L. Brown et al. v. The Board of Education of Topeka, et al. In Virginia, the case of Davis et al. v. Prince Edward County Board of Supervisors involved the inadequate public high school options for African-Americans, including Robert Moton High School in Prince Edward County. In 1943, a school was built that was too small for the student population, leading to a student strike in 1951. The NAACP joined the struggle and challenged the inferior school facilities in court. Despite a court order for equal facilities, access to white schools was denied. In South Carolina, the NAACP attempted legal action in 1947 in the case of Briggs v. R.W. Elliott. In 1947, the NAACP took legal action against the inferior conditions African-American students faced in South Carolina's segregated school system. By 1951, a class action suit was filed in court, revealing grossly inadequate facilities for African-American students compared to white students. Despite a court order to equalize facilities, schools remained unequal. In 1951, Belton v. Gebhart and Bulah v. Gebhart challenged the unequal conditions of African-American schools in Delaware. African-American children were denied access to the local high school in Claymont and forced to attend a dilapidated 1-room schoolhouse in Hockessin without transportation, while white children had better facilities and transportation. Both cases were represented by local NAACP attorneys. In the District of Columbia case of Bolling v. Sharpe, 11 African-American students were denied entry to a white-only school in 1951. The Supreme Court later ruled that segregation in the nation's capital was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education on May 17, 1954, that racial segregation violated the 14th Amendment, leading to the dismantling of segregation nationwide. Oliver L. Brown and other plaintiffs fought for equal access for African-Americans, with credit given to organizations like the NAACP and Howard University Law School. Reverend Oliver L. Brown, the icon for justice and equal rights, passed away in 1961. The Brown v. Board of Education decision, considered by the Supreme Court, outlawed racial segregation in public education, leading to the abolition of legal discrimination.

Brown and his fellow plaintiffs for their contributions to civil rights. The medal will be displayed at the Brown Foundation in Topeka, Kansas.
