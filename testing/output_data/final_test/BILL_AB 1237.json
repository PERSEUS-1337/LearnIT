    "title": "AB 1237",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 1027 of the Penal Code is amended to require the appointment of two or three psychiatrists or licensed psychologists with expertise in mental disorders to evaluate defendants pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. The evaluation panel will examine the defendant's mental status and testify in court when needed. Psychiatrists or psychologists appointed by the court for evaluating defendants pleading not guilty by reason of insanity may receive reasonable fees in addition to expenses. The report on the examination must include the defendant's psychological history and details of the acts leading to the charges. The fees are paid by the county where the indictment was found or where the defendant was held for trial. The evaluation panel, consisting of a psychiatrist or psychologist, examines the defendant's psychological and substance abuse history, as well as the facts of the offense. The panel cannot determine the defendant's sanity at the time of the offense, and the court has discretion in admitting psychiatric evidence regarding the defendant's mental state. The court allows expert witnesses to provide evidence on the defendant's mental status in a criminal action. Psychiatrists or psychologists appointed by the court can be called by either party or the court, subject to objections on competency and bias. The court may question the experts as needed, with both parties having the right to object. In a criminal action, expert witnesses like psychiatrists or psychologists can be appointed by the court to assess the defendant's mental competence. The evaluation panel, along with other forensic experts, can be called to examine the defendant in a specific order as outlined in the Penal Code. The court appoints two psychiatrists or licensed psychologists to examine the defendant in criminal cases where mental incompetence is not sought. One panelist is chosen by the defense and one by the prosecution, with input from the State Department of State Hospitals. The examining psychiatrists or licensed psychologists panelists evaluate the defendant's mental disorder, ability to understand criminal proceedings, assist counsel, and determine if antipsychotic medication is medically appropriate for restoring mental competence. If a psychologist panelist suggests medication, the defendant is referred to a psychiatrist for evaluation. The psychologist panelist informs the court of their opinion and recommendation regarding whether a psychiatrist should examine the defendant. The court shall address the defendant's capacity to make decisions about antipsychotic medication and whether they pose a danger. If a psychiatrist examines the defendant, they must report on the medication's side effects, efficacy, alternative treatments, and appropriateness for administration in jail. If developmental disability is suspected, the court appoints a regional center director to examine the defendant. The court may order the developmentally disabled defendant to be confined for examination in a residential facility or state hospital by the Code or the designee of the director. The regional center director recommends a suitable residential facility or state hospital to the court for a confined individual. The court considers this recommendation before issuing an order. Necessary care and treatment are provided while the person is confined. The defendant's counsel must provide evidence of mental incompetence, and the prosecution can do so if the defense declines. The prosecution presents its case on the defendant's mental competence, and each party can offer rebutting testimony. Other evidence may be permitted by the court for good reason in furtherance of justice. In a court trial, the prosecution and defense present final arguments after the evidence is concluded. In a jury trial, the court charges the jury on all necessary legal matters for a unanimous verdict. Competency in probation or parole proceedings is determined in a court trial. A new section 7233 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code. The State Department of State Hospitals will establish a pool of psychiatrists and psychologists with forensic skills to create evaluation panels for court proceedings."
