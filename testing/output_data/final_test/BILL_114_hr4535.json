    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keep It in the Ground Act of 2016\" and includes findings and a statement of policy. Congress finds that global temperatures have increased by 0.9 degrees Celsius from 1880 to 2014, primarily due to human activities like burning fossil fuels. Greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations continue to rise, leading to a warming trend with significant impacts on the economy and environment. A 2-degree Celsius increase in global temperature will worsen droughts, sea level rise, extinctions, and heat waves. The United States policy aims to manage Federal land and waters for the benefit of its people. To prevent the worsening impacts of climate change, at least 80 percent of carbon from proven fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground. Ending new leases for fossil fuels can prevent the release of 90 percent of potential emissions from Federal fossil fuels. The Federal Government aims to manage Federal land and waters for the benefit of the people of the United States by avoiding the most dangerous impacts of climate change and promoting a rapid transition to a clean energy economy. This includes not issuing any new lease or renewing any nonproducing lease for coal, oil, or natural gas in any Federal land or waters. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"extend\" means extending a lease beyond its existing term, \"nonproducing lease\" refers to a lease where no fossil fuel has been extracted for commercial use, \"reinstate\" means reinstating a lease after a violation, and \"renew\" means renewing a lease for a term not longer than the maximum renewal term. The term \"Secretary\" in this Act refers to the Secretary of the Interior. STOPPING NEW OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASES in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans. Prohibition on new oil and gas leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf, including definitions for terms like \"extend\" and \"nonproducing lease.\" The lease contract allows extraction of oil shale, tar sands, or other fossil fuels.

SEC. 5 of the Act prohibits the Secretary from conducting new lease sales or renewing existing nonproducing leases for onshore fossil fuels on federal land. The Secretary may exempt provisions of the Act for a lease in case of imminent national security threat, with the exemption lasting as long as the threat persists. Nonproducing leases can be renewed or extended under certain conditions. The Secretary may renew or extend nonproducing lease contracts if signed before the Act's enactment and if enforcing the Act may result in a court ruling of breach.
