    "content": "Since September 11, 2001, Congress has passed legislation to address failures in public safety radio communications, including interoperability issues and network robustness. Improving communication performance may involve increasing capacity through various means such as more radio frequencies, better infrastructure utilization, and investment in spectrum-efficient technologies. Sharing networks can also enhance operational capacity. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed an action plan to improve public safety communications by investing in network infrastructure, sharing development costs for efficient radios, and creating a regulatory regime for public safety and commercial users to share infrastructure. This plan would require substantial funding, with some expected to come from the federal government. Three bills introduced to assign additional spectrum for public safety broadband network and ensure construction of interoperable network. Draft discussion bill supports FCC's plans for spectrum use and infrastructure development, funded by auction proceeds including sale of D Block. Bills focus on regulatory adjustments, with Next Generation Public Safety Device Act focusing on radios. FCC links D Block auction to network development. The FCC has tied the auction of the D Block to the creation of public safety features for broadband radios operating on various frequencies. The D Block license-holder(s) would lead and cover costs for developing hardware and software for public safety radios. The Public Safety Device Act would kickstart development and promote innovation through a technology competition. The FCC tied the auction of the D Block to creating public safety features for broadband radios through a technology competition administered by the NTIA. Congress mandated the release of 24 MHz of frequencies for public safety use in the 700 MHz band by transitioning from analog to digital television by 2009. The assignment of the D Block in the 700 MHz band for auction in 2008 has been widely debated. The FCC conducted an auction in 2008 to allocate spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use. 10 MHz was assigned to a Public Safety Broadband Licensee, 12 MHz for mission critical voice communications, and 2 MHz as a guard band. The plan included matching the Public Safety Broadband License with a commercial license known as the D Block for Auction 73. The FCC planned to auction the D Block license in 2008 for a public-private partnership to create a broadband network for public safety and commercial use. After the initial auction failed, new rules were set for a reauction with conditions benefiting public safety users, such as cost assumption for mobile device development and priority access rights. This decision was part of the National Broadband Plan released in 2010. The Broadband for First Responders Act of 2010 aims to allocate the D Block for public safety services and establish rules for a national wireless broadband network. Other related bills, such as the First Responders Protection Act and the Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act, also focus on similar rule-making procedures and requirements. The discussion draft of the Public Safety Broadband Act of 2010 includes provisions for auctioning the D Block to fund public safety broadband networks. It allows for spectrum sharing and flexible use of frequencies in the 700 MHz band. Various bills and initiatives address planning, building, and funding a national network for first responders. The FCC is working on initiatives to plan, build, and fund a national network for public safety communications, focusing on the 700 MHz airwaves. Public safety representatives argue for a customized wireless network due to shortcomings in current commercial services. Broadband applications are needed for emergency response, including data and video, covering all areas of the United States. The national network for public safety communications should cover all areas of the United States and provide broadband services with voice communications as a backup. It should prioritize service, ensure interoperability, and support mobile broadband applications designed for public safety. Radio chipsets for wireless devices connecting to an LTE network, encryption, authentication, and strengthened cell towers with backup power supplies are essential. The FCC recommends strengthening public safety wireless broadband communications by ensuring robust backhaul, creating an administrative system for capacity access, promoting interoperability, establishing funding mechanisms, and leveraging existing programs. The FCC recommends leveraging commercial technologies for public safety broadband networks through partnerships and agreements with commercial operators. The Emergency Response Interoperability Center (ERIC) was established within the FCC to develop and test technological solutions for public safety communications, working closely with the Public Safety Communications Research program. The Department of Homeland Security participates in public safety outreach and technical assistance. The Emergency Response Interoperability Center (ERIC) is responsible for implementing standards for national interoperability and developing procedures for the public safety wireless broadband network in the 700 MHz band. ERIC may also work on similar functions for other public safety communications systems. Within the 700 MHz band, ERIC could use FCC regulatory powers to ensure cooperation of commercial wireless operators for roaming rights and access rules between public safety and other networks in the same frequency. The FCC has adopted an order to provide a framework for nationwide interoperability and mobile broadband, granting waivers to public safety entities that meet its requirements. Some states and localities have petitioned to use frequencies from the 10 MHz assigned to the PSBL for their own public safety networks, with plans developed based on local and regional needs and funding anticipated from various sources. Fifteen recipients of conditional waivers had submitted Interoperability Showings by August. The FCC granted waivers to public safety entities for nationwide interoperability and mobile broadband. Fifteen recipients submitted Interoperability Showings by August 17, 2010, with only one accepted for review. ERIC will coordinate technical aspects of the waiver requests, including system architecture, applications, network operations, and device specifications. Plans must support interoperability, roaming, priority access, QoS, and security. The FCC is required to establish rules for a wireless public safety broadband network, covering interoperability, roaming, priority access, network survivability, and cybersecurity. Standards must consider commercial availability, adaptability, security, and other factors. The Public Safety Broadband Act of 2010 eliminates roaming requirements but maintains similar provisions. The Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act of 2010 eliminates roaming requirements for a nationwide public safety interoperable broadband network. It directs the FCC to develop technical standards and rules for user authentication, encryption, and infrastructure sharing. The Act also addresses the FCC's authority to mandate interoperability, taking into account factors like technology availability, licensing terms, adaptability, transmission priority, and security. The First Responders Protection Act of 2010 does not mandate commercial networks to provide access for roaming or make accommodations for public safety users. Provisions for priority access will be part of separate agreements between public safety and commercial network owners. Funding mechanisms for the wireless broadband network construction and operation are included in the Act, the Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act, and a discussion draft. Eligible projects may involve constructing a new public safety interoperable broadband network using commercial infrastructure. The Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act includes provisions for the development of a new public safety broadband network in the 700 MHz band, improving existing commercial networks, and ensuring equality in planning for rural areas. However, there is no funding provision for the development and testing of new radio technologies for public safety broadband radios. Additional work is needed to advance from planning to testing and deployment of mobile devices. The Next Generation Public Safety Device Act of 2010 aims to develop mobile devices for broadband communications on designated frequencies, including LTE technology. The term profile refers to technical specifications for LTE devices to operate on the network. Four profiles have been established for commercial bands in the 700 MHz band. LTE has established four profiles for commercial bands in the 700 MHz band: Band 12, Band 13, Band 14, and Band 17. Band 14 includes the D Block and public safety frequencies. The LTE profile for Band 14 needs modification to support public safety requirements. ERIC and network developers face the challenge of establishing a profile for public safety needs in conjunction with Band 14. The FCC anticipates the D Block owner or owners to lead and fund the development costs of the air interface for the Public Safety Broadband License and the D Block. FCC has specified LTE as the network technology for this band. The FCC has specified LTE as the network technology for the Broadband License and the D Block at 700 MHz. ERIC is expected to guide the development of standards for radio components, aiming to lower the cost of public safety radios to $500, compared to $3,000 for interoperable radios on narrowband networks. Commercial carriers are anticipated to participate in developing a common radio interface. The FCC provided a summary of findings on market competition for narrowband radios, highlighting issues with proprietary technologies hindering development and interoperability. The Next Generation Public Safety Device Act of 2010 aims to establish requirements for Radio over Internet Protocol Devices (RoIP) and award grants for their development. Competition stages include identifying communication needs, ensuring interoperable communications, and submitting a plan for commercial production. Commercial carriers are expected to participate in developing a common radio interface. The NTIA is required to consider factors like competition, cost, and public safety use when selecting winners in the auction process. The estimated cost of building a mobile broadband network under a public-private partnership was $18 billion to $40 billion, excluding radios. The FCC recommended establishing a grant program for infrastructure deployment, administered by a single agency and compliant with ERIC requirements. Grants would be used for constructing a public safety network and other specified projects. The National Broadband Plan (NBP) outlined uses of grants for public safety network construction, rural coverage, network hardening, and deployable capabilities. Estimated costs included $6.5 billion for capital expenditures over ten years and $1.3 billion annually for operating costs. A report later projected $15.7 billion for a dedicated public safety broadband network, with savings from using commercial towers. Sustainable funding for operation, maintenance, and upgrades was deemed essential. The National Broadband Plan recommended a \"minimal public safety fee\" on U.S. broadband users to fund the operation, maintenance, and upgrade of the public safety broadband network. Legislation like the Broadband for First Responders Act of 2010 and the Interoperable Emergency Communications Grant program provided appropriations for network construction and operation. The First Responders Protection Act of 2010 and other related acts also aimed to fund the network with necessary resources. The draft of the Public Safety Broadband Act of 2010 proposes funding network construction and operation through future spectrum auctions. It designates spectrum bands for auction revenue, including the D Block. Two funds would be created to receive auction proceeds: a Construction Fund and a Maintenance and Operation Fund. The NTIA would oversee grants programs for eligible construction projects and reimbursement of maintenance costs for a public safety broadband network in the 700 MHz band. The Next Generation Public Safety Device Act of 2010 proposes funding RoIP development with $70 million from future auctions. It would establish a Public Safety Devices Communications Fund and authorize the NTIA to borrow necessary funds. Congress has created special funds for specific auction revenues, deviating from the usual practice of crediting proceeds to the Treasury. The Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund was established to receive auction revenue from broadcasters for analog transmissions. The Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act created a Spectrum Relocation Fund to reimburse federal entities for moving to new frequency assignments. The Public Safety Interoperable Communications grant program, now under the Department of Homeland Security, was funded by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 to support effective communications for homeland security. The safety community relies on effective radio communications for homeland security. Public safety services are crucial in daily life and responding to natural disasters. The FCC and DHS have different perspectives on radio technology. DHS policies focus on reliability and familiarity, while the FCC promotes spectrum efficiency and competition. Congress has given authority to both agencies to act on behalf of public safety. The FCC and DHS have different roles in public safety communications. While DHS focuses on coordination and support for specific goals, the FCC is mandated to promote safety through radio communication and assign frequencies. The FCC proposed to take a leadership role in the National Broadband Plan, with bills increasing its powers over the public safety network, placing DHS in an advisory role. The FCC and DHS have different roles in public safety communications. The governance of the public safety network relies heavily on the FCC's regulations. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee Board of Governors and ERIC's Technical Advisory Committee are key in presenting public safety views to the FCC. Congress has passed laws empowering DHS to respond to technological developments in wireless and IP communications for a nationwide network. The Department's focus on interim solutions may have missed the opportunity for needed leadership. The Department missed the opportunity to lead in developing a next-generation communications network for public safety. Both DHS and FCC lack the experience and resources for timely deployment. A well-grounded governance structure is crucial for national, interoperable, and cost-effective public safety communications. The cost of radios for public safety is a concern, with multi-band radios priced at $4,000 to $6,000 and narrowband radios starting at $3,000. Communities may face tough choices between investing in radios or essential services like education and public amenities. Federal funds are being used to build a state-of-the-art wireless network that may not be compatible with existing first responder equipment. States and urban areas are submitting plans to the FCC for broadband networks, emphasizing the need for sufficient funding and efficient coverage in densely populated areas. Several critical technologies and standards need to be developed for efficient public safety networks. A governing structure is necessary for uniform core operations and collaboration with commercial partners is important. Congressional efforts have provided guidelines for public safety communications but a governance structure meeting all needs does not currently exist. Congress has allocated funds for public safety communications, leaving decisions on implementation to federal agencies and state officials. Grants administered through the Department of Homeland Security have been used for equipment, planning, and training. An Office of Emergency Communications was created to prepare a National Emergency Communications Plan, setting goals for improving emergency communications and interoperability. The Department of Homeland Security sponsored an Emergency Response Council (ERC) to address emergency communications interoperability. The ERC published guiding principles and a Nationwide Plan for Interoperable Communications in 2007. The council's role has been to advocate for partnerships, design interoperable systems, educate policymakers, and allocate resources among public safety agencies and associations. Congress addressed emergency communications interoperability in various acts, including the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. These laws laid the foundation for the Department of Homeland Security to develop a national public safety communications capability as required by the Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007. The 21st Century Emergency Communications Act of 2006 and the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 placed new requirements on DHS. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 directed the FCC to allocate frequencies in the 700 MHz band for public safety, leading to the creation of the Public Safety National Coordination Committee. The NCC developed technical and operational recommendations for the 700 MHz band, focusing on interoperable channels managed by Regional Planning Committees (RPCs) coordinated by the FCC. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 instructed DHS to address public safety communications issues, emphasizing technology for first responders' interoperability. The DHS focused on technology for interoperability within the Directorate for Science and Technology, taking over coordination from Project SAFECOM. The Office of Interoperability was tasked with preparing a national strategy for communications interoperability. The Office of Interoperability and Compatibility (OIC) within DHS created a national strategy for communications interoperability, later ratified by Congress in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. This Act included improvements in communications capacity based on recommendations from the 9/11 Commission, such as expedited assignment of radio spectrum for public safety purposes. High-risk urban areas like New York City and Washington, D.C., should establish signal corps units for communications connectivity among civilian authorities, first responders, and the National Guard. Congress prioritized federal funding for these units, with the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act amending the Homeland Security Act to specify the rapid establishment of interoperable capacity in high-risk areas. The Secretary of Homeland Security, along with the FCC, Secretary of Defense, and state/local authorities, were tasked with providing technical guidance and training for these units. The Homeland Security Act required the establishment of minimum capabilities for government agencies, first responders, and others to communicate effectively. The Secretary of Homeland Security was mandated to create trial programs in high-threat areas to improve interagency communications. Congress also set performance goals for the Department of Homeland Security. The Homeland Security Act set program goals for the Department of Homeland Security, including establishing a national approach for interoperability, coordinating with federal agencies, developing minimum capabilities, accelerating standards development, and providing technical assistance. Funding requests for interoperable communications required an approved Interoperable Communications Plan. The act also emphasized the need for Congress to pass legislation in the future. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171) supported the Commission's recommendation to expedite spectrum release. The destruction caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 highlighted the need for interoperable communications systems for public safety. Testimony following the hurricanes indicated minimal response from DHS to congressional mandates, leading to proposed bills in Congress to strengthen emergency communications leadership. The Senate proposed strengthening emergency communications leadership and expanding efforts for improvement, included in Title VI of the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 reorganized FEMA, gave new powers, and clarified functions within DHS. It also created the Office of Emergency Communications and Director position to coordinate emergency communications planning at state and regional levels. The Director of the Office of Emergency Communications was tasked with coordinating emergency communications planning at state and regional levels, including working with Regional Administrators and establishing Regional Emergency Communications Coordination Working Groups. Other responsibilities included conducting outreach programs, providing technical assistance, promoting standard operating procedures, developing a national communications plan, and ensuring operability and interoperability of communications systems for emergency response. The feasibility study for developing a mobile communications capability modeled on the Army Signal Corps was to be conducted by DHS alone or in cooperation with the Department of Defense. Congress also required assessments of emergency communications capabilities, including an inventory of radio frequencies used by federal departments and agencies. The OEC was initially envisioned to perform these functions, but they were later taken over by the Command, Control, and Interoperability Division. Additionally, the OEC was directed to coordinate with Regional Emergency Communication Coordination Working Groups established by FEMA to facilitate emergency communications planning among states and various sectors responsible for public safety and security. Plans for forming these groups were in progress. Plans for forming Regional Emergency Communication Coordination Working Groups (RECCs) were announced in December 2007. Organization charts were developed in 2008 to show the structure of the RECCs within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). A National RECC Coordinator was appointed, and administrators for each region were planned to be appointed. The RECCs aim to serve as a central coordination point for federal interaction with state, local, and tribal governments in emergency communications. It is uncertain whether the RECCs will focus on developing policies and shared infrastructure or serve as a platform for FEMA's Disaster Operations Directorate to relay guidelines and orders. Congress emphasized supporting first responders in the goals for the RECCs. The RECCs will focus on assisting first responders in disaster response, with leadership provided by FEMA and governance through agency directorates. Regional working groups include first responders, state and local officials, emergency managers, and 911 call centers. They will also coordinate with communications providers, hospitals, and utilities. The National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP) was issued in July 2008 to improve interoperability among various communication providers and emergency services. The plan aims to achieve specific goals by certain deadlines, such as ensuring response-level emergency communications within one hour for routine events involving multiple jurisdictions and agencies by 2010. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 included provisions for the release of spectrum by February 18, 2009, creating a fund for spectrum auction proceeds to be disbursed for public safety agencies, administered by the NTIA. This was part of efforts to improve emergency communications for first responders through FEMA's Regional Emergency Communications Coordination Working Group. The NTIA was tasked with administering a fund for public safety agencies, with disbursements totaling $1 billion. The grants program was transferred to DHS in February 2007, with changes required by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The Public Safety Interoperable Communications (PSIC) Grant Program, administered by the NTIA and later transferred to DHS, aimed to fund needs identified through Tactical Interoperable Communications Plans and Statewide Interoperable Plans. $968,385,000 in funding was allocated to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Territories. States had until FY2012 to submit detailed requests for funding. The PSIC grant program deadline was extended through FY2012. All states, territories, and the District of Columbia had filed Statewide Communication Interoperability Plans. A spectrum chart shows public safety allocations and the D Block in relation to other spectrum holdings. The 11-MHz allocation in the 700 MHz band is divided into two assignments at 746-757 MHz and 776-787 MHz. The D Block consists of two 5 MHz assignments, adjacent to the Public Safety Broadband License assignments. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversees public safety communications planning, while the FCC established a Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau in 2006. Both agencies have different approaches to achieving communications interoperability. The section discusses network design concepts applied by the FCC, focusing on Internet-based networks and spectrum management. Evolution of emergency communications management from the 1990s to current network-oriented proposals by various organizations is highlighted. DHS advocates for a \"system of systems\" approach to communication solutions, emphasizing interoperability through connecting independent systems. The ubiquity of the Internet is leading to new methods of managing spectrum and network resources. The \"system of systems\" approach advocated by DHS emphasizes interoperability by connecting independent systems through bridges and gateways. This approach maximizes the value of past investments but may not be the most resource-efficient. Backward-compatible radio equipment is more expensive than equipment designed for newer technologies, leading to inefficient spectrum usage. The concept starts with the radio user and adds different levels of command and control to respond to specific situations. The DHS is promoting interoperability through the expansion of Project 25 standards, which advocate backward compatibility with legacy systems. P25-compliant technologies connect radio channels and are being tested by the Command, Control, and Interoperability Division. The FCC is also working on a national network at 700 MHz for interoperability. The FCC is working on a national network at 700 MHz for interoperability, aiming to reach every community with the same technology and connectivity. The network-centric solutions involve a common standard for traffic to use, managed from the top down with centralized control. The Emergency Response Interoperability Center (ERIC) is leading the decision-making process for implementing a nationwide public safety network. The Public Safety Broadband License (PSBL) was assigned to the PSST as part of the FCC's plans for a public-private partnership. The PSST plans for a new broadband network to complement existing public safety voice systems. Recommendations from NPSTC aim to achieve interoperability among public safety networks operating in the 700 MHz band. The framework focuses on connecting independent networks to facilitate interoperability. The task force recommendations aim to facilitate interoperability among regional public safety broadband networks operating in the 700 MHz band. The Nationwide Broadband Data System (NBDS) will use LTE technology, with minimum requirements defined for national interoperability. An advisory council will govern individual operators and allow public-private partnerships. Regional operators can deploy systems before final requirements are established. Regional operators will have the right to deploy systems in advance of final requirements and select applications beyond what is required for their 700 MHz broadband objectives. Technical requirements will be specified for roaming and interoperability. The PSST asked the FCC to authorize the establishment of technology standards for the nationwide public safety broadband network at 700 MHz. APCO intends to develop standards for broadband networks at 700 MHz, identifying gaps and setting necessary standards. The APCO will establish standards for interoperability on LTE networks for public safety broadband at 700 MHz frequencies. LTE technology is required for the network infrastructure, ensuring high interoperability with other IP-based technologies. Developing standards for public safety interfaces on LTE networks represents a shift to IP-based platforms and network-level communications management. Some states are deploying IP-enabled fiber optic networks to support communication needs, including public safety, without linking to the Internet. Congress recognizes the value of IP-based networks for 911 communications and is requiring recommendations for transitioning outdated systems to IP-based technologies. Congress has not previously considered giving the same attention to the adoption of IP-based technologies for public safety radio communications. The concept of channel management for radio interference dates back to the Radio Act of 1912, prompted by Marconi's testimony on the sinking of the Titanic. The Radio Act of 1912 was prompted by Marconi's testimony on the sinking of the Titanic, establishing the principle of channel management. However, in the age of the Internet, network-centric spectrum management is seen as a more efficient way to provide spectrum capacity for mobile broadband. This approach, similar to how the Internet organizes transmission of data, is likely to become the dominant principle for spectrum management in the future. The future of wireless communications will be shaped by new generations of iPhones and Android-based devices using Internet protocols. These devices require spectrum capacity to operate efficiently. Integrating adaptive networking technologies like dynamic spectrum access with IP-based networks can lead to more efficient spectrum use. Adaptive networking technologies like dynamic spectrum access (DSA) can improve radio communication by managing interference and congestion more effectively than current channel management techniques. DSA allows individual communication nodes to continue operating and compensate for failed links, making the network more resilient. This approach aims to maximize spectrum resources by pooling licenses and prioritizing common goals over channel ownership. The construction of a new network for public safety communications focuses on maximizing network performance through shared infrastructure and pooled spectrum, utilizing network-centric operations."
