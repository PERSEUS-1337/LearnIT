Guardians in the State must file annual reports with the court overseeing the ward's affairs. Each guardian in the State must provide a report on the ward's finances and health annually, along with a recommendation on the continuation, modification, or termination of the guardianship.

The court must be informed of the ward's whereabouts and be notified when the ward is moved to a new residence. State laws require that if a ward is moved to another state, the court must notify the appropriate court there about the guardianship. Conversely, if a ward from another state is moved into the state, the local court must assume jurisdiction over the guardianship. The State court assumes jurisdiction over guardianship cases and may require additional information. Each court must conduct an annual review of guardianship orders to assess the guardian's performance. Private professional guardians must be bonded and licensed. Definitions related to guardianship are provided in this section, including the terms 'guardian', 'guardianship', and 'ward'. A guardian is someone legally responsible for caring for a person incapable of managing their own affairs, a ward is the individual under guardianship, and guardianship refers to the legal relationship between them.
