    "content": "The \"Handgun Purchaser Licensing Act\" is the short title of the Act. It includes findings related to handgun purchasing. Congress finds that in 2013, over 33,000 Americans were killed by guns, with handguns being used in almost 90% of these deaths. Research shows that Missouri's repeal of its handgun purchaser licensing law led to a 25% increase in firearm homicide rates, while Connecticut's adoption of such a law resulted in a 40% decrease. States with longstanding handgun purchaser licensing laws have seen the majority of crime guns traced back to other states, highlighting the importance of implementing these laws nationwide. The Act defines terms such as \"Attorney General,\" \"handgun,\" and \"Indian tribe\" according to specific sections of the United States Code. Additionally, a grant program for handgun licensing is authorized under the Act. The Attorney General can award grants to States, local governments, and Indian tribes for handgun purchaser licensing requirements. Grants are awarded on a competitive basis to assist in implementing and improving handgun purchaser licensing programs. Eligible applicants must submit an application with required information, including a description of the enacted law. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, an applicant must have handgun purchaser licensing laws that require individuals to be at least 21 years old and a national or lawful permanent resident of the United States. Applicants must also describe the law they have enacted for handgun purchase licensing and how the grant will be used to improve their program. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, applicants must meet certain criteria, including being at least 21 years old, a US national or lawful permanent resident, and residing in the state where the law enforcement agency is located. Additionally, individuals must reapply for a handgun license every 5 years, undergo background checks, submit fingerprints and photographs, and provide proof of legal status. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, applicants must provide proof of legal presence in the US, including a birth certificate or valid passport, alien registration number and 90-day proof of residency for lawful permanent residents, or proof of citizenship for naturalized citizens. The Act also prohibits individuals prohibited from possessing firearms under section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code, from receiving a license or permit. Grant funds must be used to improve handgun purchaser licensing programs. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Attorney General for the implementation of this Act."
