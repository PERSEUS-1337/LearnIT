FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that the National Environmental Research Parks are unique outdoor laboratories established by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1972 to conduct research and education activities on environmental effects associated with energy and weapons use. The National Environmental Research Parks were established in 1972 by the Atomic Energy Commission to research environmental effects of energy and weapons. The parks are located in six major ecological regions of the United States and provide secure settings for long-term research on plant succession, biomass production, population ecology, and radioecology. The National Environmental Research Parks were established in 1972 by the Atomic Energy Commission for research on environmental effects of energy and weapons. The parks cover various ecological regions and focus on plant succession, biomass production, population ecology, radioecology, ecological restoration, and thermal effects on freshwater ecosystems. They maintain unique long-term data sets on amphibian and bird populations, soil moisture, and plant water stress for detecting climate shifts. The Department of Energy's maintenance of these parks aligns with environmental stewardship obligations and safeguards cultural and archaeological resources. Public education and outreach activities on these sites offer valuable learning opportunities. The National Environmental Research Parks, established in 1972 by the Atomic Energy Commission, focus on research related to environmental effects of energy and weapons. These sites offer unique learning opportunities, promote a stronger connection with surrounding communities, and enhance public confidence in the Department of Energy's environmental stewardship responsibilities. The National Environmental Research Parks were established in 1972 by the Atomic Energy Commission to focus on research related to environmental effects of energy and weapons. The Secretary of Energy designates six National Environmental Research Parks as protected outdoor research reserves for long-term environmental research on human impacts on the natural environment. The parks include Savannah River, Idaho, Los Alamos, Fermi Lab, Oak Ridge, and Nevada. Each site supports environmental research and monitoring activities to characterize and monitor site conditions. The National Environmental Research Parks serve as control areas for comparison with environmental impacts of Department of Energy activities. Research and monitoring areas include ecology, population biology, radioecology, climate effects on ecosystems, pollution fate, modeling, and environmental impacts of energy technologies. The National Environmental Research Parks serve as control areas for comparison with environmental impacts of Department of Energy activities. Research and monitoring areas include ecology, population biology, radioecology, climate effects on ecosystems, pollution fate, modeling, and environmental impacts of energy technologies. The Secretary shall enter into a cooperative agreement with a university, community college, or consortium of institutions of higher education with expertise in ecology and environmental science of the region in which the National Environmental Research Park is located to ensure independence of research, monitoring, public education, and outreach activities. Each site shall support an outreach program to inform the public of the diverse ecological activities conducted at the park and to educate students at various levels in environmental science. Program activities may include on-site and in-classroom education programs. The National Environmental Research Parks offer education programs for students, presentations to various groups, exhibits at events, and internships. The Secretary of Energy appoints a Coordinator to oversee research activities and share best practices among the parks. The National Environmental Research Parks share education and outreach activities, serve as liaisons to Federal agencies, and are authorized $30,000,000 for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. The National Environmental Research Parks can continue their activities without limitations. They can also offer educational opportunities through the Summer Institutes program."
