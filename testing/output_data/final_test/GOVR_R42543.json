    "content": "The First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) is a federal agency created by Congress to deploy a nationwide broadband network for public safety communications. It operates as an independent authority within the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and received $7 billion in funding for network deployment. The First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) was created by Congress to deploy a nationwide broadband network for public safety communications. The act allows for public-private partnerships to ensure FirstNet becomes self-sustaining through auctioning licenses for radio frequency spectrum. FirstNet holds a license for 20 MHz of broadband spectrum and can offer access to its assets to attract private sector partners. States meeting specified requirements can lease spectrum from FirstNet and negotiate partnerships for Radio Area Networks. FirstNet, created by Congress, deploys a nationwide broadband network for public safety communications through public-private partnerships. LTE technology is used for network deployment, with potential for 5G expansion. Challenges include establishing a nationwide network that meets diverse emergency communication needs and navigating state-specific laws and procedures for infrastructure management and funding. FirstNet faces challenges in establishing a governance model for its communications infrastructure. There is pressure to create a functional network quickly to ensure adequate public safety communications during emergencies. The winning bidder must achieve 95% geographical coverage within six months, likely requiring involvement from major carriers like Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, or T-Mobile. Rural carriers may also be involved to meet coverage goals. The winning contractor for FirstNet must guarantee priority access to public safety on 20 MHz of spectrum capacity. Buildout requirements for FirstNet spectrum include 20% population coverage in the first year and 60% coverage within two years. The contractor must submit deployment plans to 56 states and territories within six months and indicate costs for each state's buildout. States meeting criteria can receive a share of $6.5 billion in grants for their own network within FirstNet. The winning contractor for FirstNet must guarantee priority access to public safety on 20 MHz of spectrum capacity. Buildout requirements include 20% population coverage in the first year and 60% coverage within two years. States meeting criteria can receive a share of $6.5 billion in grants for their own network within FirstNet. AT&T is the remaining bidder after two others were eliminated, leading to a lawsuit by Rivada Mercury against the U.S. government. The lawsuit is expected to delay the FirstNet contract award until March 1, 2017, with achievements since the FirstNet board first met in September 2012 including Requests for Information for a comprehensive broadband network solution. The Department of Commerce issued a Second Notice for comment on allowing states to build their own networks. The Second Notice supplemented the Public Notice on Statutory Interpretations in September 2014, addressing key issues like defining \"public safety\" and \"rural.\" A third notice on \"public safety\" was released after a FirstNet board meeting on April 24, 2015. The draft Request for Proposal(s) was discussed in a closed meeting on the same day, building on previous proposals. FirstNet planned to award contracts through the Federal Acquisition Regulation process to meet public safety needs and provide extensive coverage. FirstNet's network coverage includes deployable units and local area networks for incident commanders to have local control. The strategy focuses on controlling national and regional core network infrastructure to maximize value for public safety while meeting financial sustainability obligations. Many details of the acquisition strategy have not been made public yet. The general architecture of FirstNet's broadband network, known as a heterogeneous network (HetNet), includes both macro and micro networks. The macro network provides coverage over distance, while the micro network offers capacity and local coverage. The evolution of network coverage trends towards the micro network as the primary provider of mobile communications coverage and capacity. The small cell network has become the main provider of mobile communications coverage and capacity, connecting to other small cell networks or cellular towers when needed. FirstNet's network strategy aims to shift public safety mobile communications onto shared spectrum in small cell networks, freeing up spectrum for commercial carriers. In an LTE network, the eNodeB macro coverage infrastructure requires significant spectrum. The Spectrum Act assumed high-site towers with eNodeB base stations for Radio Area Networks, but technology has evolved. States opting out may receive a 20 MHz license for eNodeB towers. Micro networks can operate within 20 MHz, requiring less spectrum. If FirstNet only offers micro network capacity, states may need to adjust their plans. The state-operated Radio Area Network will have limited spectrum capacity, which may be challenging to utilize in a public-private partnership. Investments have been made in improving Land Mobile Radio networks for first responders, as highlighted in the 2014 National Emergency Communications Plan. These networks are crucial for providing communication during emergencies when access to FirstNet is unavailable. FirstNet must consult with regional, state, tribal, and local authorities on decisions regarding policies, costs, network infrastructure, and priority access for local users. Each state appoints a Single Point of Contact (SPOC) to be eligible for grants from the Department of Homeland Security. States also establish a Statewide Interoperability Coordinator (SWIC) to administer communication grants. The Statewide Interoperability Coordinator (SWIC) administers the Statewide Communication Interoperability Plan (SCIP) in accordance with federal guidelines. Each state appoints a Single Point of Contact (SPOC) to work directly with FirstNet and manage activities related to broadband communications. FirstNet notifies the governor when proposals for a nationwide network are completed, providing details and funding information to the state. The act presents two options for states: join FirstNet or build a statewide Radio Access Network. It does not address states building their own network while still utilizing FirstNet's infrastructure. The act is unclear on whether states can opt out of the broadband network entirely. Some states may focus on improving voice networks instead of acquiring broadband access. FirstNet, through its partners, aims to provide service in all states, even if a state chooses not to participate. States have the option to build their own Radio Access Network, but must submit an alternative plan for approval. The state must demonstrate compliance with technical requirements and interoperability with FirstNet. If approved, the state can deploy its own part of the network. Approval of a state's plan for its own Radio Access Network makes it eligible for a grant from the NTIA, funded by the Network Construction Fund. The grant is contingent on meeting NTIA's requirements for sustainability, timeliness, cost-effectiveness, security, coverage, and comparable services to FirstNet. The state must pay a user fee for access to FirstNet's core network and can only enter commercial markets or lease network access through a public-private partnership. Any revenue from the partnership must be used accordingly. FirstNet requires any revenue from a partnership with a state to be used for costs related to its participation. States can opt out of FirstNet by meeting FCC and NTIA requirements, with the NTIA potentially granting lease authority for spectrum use. The NTIA has specific criteria for state plans, similar to contractor requirements, including technical and financial aspects. The State Alternative Plan Proposal and spectrum lease request are treated as a single grant request. The forthcoming Federal Funding Opportunity announcement will provide details on technical requirements for state network plans, including staffing and budget information. States must submit their application to the NTIA within 60 days of FCC approval of the alternative plan. NTIA may require surety bonds for network construction completion. FirstNet's network construction is completed, and state plan deadlines must align with FirstNet's plan. A state plan relying on new network buildouts may not be cost-effective. NTIA will consider cross-border economies of scale in evaluating cost-effectiveness. FirstNet's deployment strategy includes state-based eNodeBs to control the entire 20 MHz spectrum license. This represents a change from earlier plans. The proposal includes incorporating the eNode B into the Radio Area Network to provide local area network capacity as an extension of FirstNet. State authority is limited to providing fill-in capacity for underserved areas. FirstNet contractors will be responsible for identifying additional partners or subcontractors, negotiating agreements with local power companies for infrastructure access. The goal is to extend coverage to rural areas with little commercial service through federally funded build-outs. The network design aims to maximize spectrum value nationwide. The network design aims to maximize spectrum value nationwide to provide funding for rural coverage. FirstNet believes that states building their own RANs could divert funds from the FirstNet network. Costs for states include operating and expanding LMR networks, integrating LMR and broadband infrastructure, forfeiting economies of scale, and losing opportunities for competition and innovation in wireless services. The winning contractor for FirstNet deployment remains to be determined. FirstNet is making decisions about network design based on evolving information. It argues that a federalized network is the best solution for nationwide coverage, interoperability, and assured access. The Second Notice suggests that allowing populous states to opt out and build their own networks could harm rural areas. This presumption of market failure lacks support from public information and contradicts positive analyses of small cell networks. The economic value of small cell networks, community broadband, and the Internet of Things is recognized for economies of scale in wireless network operations. FCC policies support wireless companies' expansion for scale economies. FirstNet focuses on macro network coverage for geographic reach, while small cell networks enable profitability through economies of scope for various services in a small area. Small cell networks with dense deployments in a small area can increase efficiency and reduce costs while accommodating various technology needs. This approach is not focused on macro network coverage but on micro network capacity. The benefits of small cell services extend beyond urban areas to rural or remote areas, supporting public safety, transportation improvements, education, job search, and economic growth. Economies of scale can also be achieved in states with low population density. FirstNet emphasizes the need to monetize spectrum holdings for expanding coverage based on existing LTE commercial footprint, rather than focusing on statewide or local public safety networks. It aims to capture most of the value of spectrum used for coverage and capacity, potentially surpassing the value of small cell networks and community broadband wireless components. FirstNet aims to monetize spectrum holdings for expanding coverage through existing LTE infrastructure, potentially surpassing the value of small cell networks. The excess value of spectrum and access to local markets may benefit FirstNet's partners more than the intended states and communities. This could be seen as a monopoly surplus. The advantages of a federalized network include swift execution and extending LTE service to rural areas without broadband access. FirstNet offers streamlined access for federal partners, national reach in emergencies, economies of scale, and sustainability through control of assets and small cell networks. These advantages could be applicable to other governance or business models. The advantages of a federalized network include streamlined access for federal partners, national reach in emergencies, economies of scale, and sustainability through control of assets and small cell networks. However, some disadvantages may include loss of state autonomy, control of spectrum assets, and devaluation of state and federally funded investments in existing public safety. Loss of market power for state public safety customers due to the displacement of local competitors and partners in broadband development by the FirstNet contractor. Smaller communities may be limited to using the incumbent provider for financially viable programs. Desired partners, like rural utilities, may not be available for local projects due to contractual obligations to FirstNet. FirstNet's revenue stream relies on fees from state and local public safety agencies, impacting states' bargaining power. Risks include operational, financial, and competitive risks, as well as the potential for limited state participation. The NTIA oversees grant programs for network implementation and construction. The State and Local Implementation Fund received $135 million from the Public Safety Trust Fund for grants to all 56 states and territories to develop plans for a nationwide public safety broadband network. The NTIA administers the State and Local Implementation Grant Program in consultation with FirstNet, providing federal grants not exceeding 80% of the state's projected costs. Grants were awarded in two phases, totaling over $116 million, with 54 states and territories receiving funding in the initial phase in FY2013. The initial phase of State and Local Implementation Fund grants in FY2013 were awarded to 54 states and territories, excluding Mississippi and the Northern Mariana Islands. The funding, totaling about $58 million, helped states assess their public safety wireless broadband needs and prepare for consultations with FirstNet. Second phase grants can be used for data collection on broadband coverage needs, user capacity, current providers, and procurement mechanisms. NTIA has restricted the use of federal grant money to only \"opt in\" options, prompting FirstNet to request a review of their interpretations of the law. The NTIA's interpretations of the law restrict states from exploring options to build their own networks, despite the potential benefits. A second phase of grants, totaling $58 million, was announced in 2015 to help states identify coverage needs and facilitate network deployment. The Spectrum Act mandates a $7 billion Network Construction Fund, with $6.5 billion allocated by FirstNet and the NTIA. The Spectrum Act mandates a $6.5 billion Network Construction Fund allocated by FirstNet and the NTIA. The fund will be used for expenditures on construction, maintenance, and related expenses for the nationwide network. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) will recommend actions regarding the ending of FirstNet's authority by 2027. Additionally, GAO has evaluated FirstNet's organization and business decisions. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluated FirstNet's organization, business decisions, and network deployment progress. GAO highlighted gaps in risk assessment, Standards of Conduct, and evaluation of early builder projects. The full report provides a detailed timeline and additional information. The full report on FirstNet includes a timeline and details about the development of the network, the \"early builder\" program, and FirstNet's planning process. GAO's comments noted that FirstNet developed a cost estimate for its public safety network that met most best practices, but the estimate and its assumptions are not public due to sensitive information. GAO did not assess the credibility or accuracy of FirstNet's cost estimate. The Office of Inspector General reviewed practices at FirstNet in response to criticism about lack of transparency and other issues. The review focused on ensuring proper financial disclosures, identifying conflicts of interest, and using appropriate contracting processes. The Office of Inspector General reviewed practices at FirstNet, finding inadequate monitoring procedures and $11 million inappropriately spent on consulting work. The review focused on financial disclosures, conflicts of interest, and contracting processes. The Office of Inspector General found that nearly $11 million was inappropriately spent on consulting work at FirstNet, which did not meet contractual definitions of deliverables. The DOC defended its contracting activities, stating that the work produced valuable research and services. The OIG made recommendations to improve procedures and responsibilities, which were partially accepted by FirstNet, NTIA, and the General Counsel. The OIG review highlighted lapses in oversight procedures at FirstNet, including delays in decision-making and incomplete business and network plans. Most issues occurred in the year following the first official board meeting in September 2012. The OIG has initiated an audit team to evaluate FirstNet. The OIG has established a team to audit and evaluate FirstNet activities, including a fraud, waste, and abuse hotline. Testimony at a Senate hearing highlighted ongoing improvements in internal controls and risk assessment at FirstNet. Major provisions in the act focus on public safety communications and improving the nation's 911 emergency call system. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) are designated to improve the nation's 911 emergency call system. They manage spectrum resources for wireless communications, converting electromagnetic spectrum into signals for voice, text, and images. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 directed the FCC to allocate 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use. The Spectrum Act re-designated existing public safety licenses in the 700 MHz band and an additional license for commercial use for a federal license for paired spectrum at 758-768 MHz and 788-798 MHz, with guard bands at 768-769 MHz and 798-799 MHz to mitigate interference. The initial 10-year license was assigned to FirstNet by the FCC, renewable for an additional 10 years. FirstNet was assigned a 10-year license by the FCC, renewable for another 10 years if obligations are met. 34 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band is available for public safety networks, with 22 MHz for broadband and 12 MHz for narrowband communications. There are three distinct public safety network technologies in use or planned within the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands. Older narrowband networks at 800 MHz are not easily integrated with newer systems. The FCC has the authority to allow flexible use of narrowband spectrum for public safety broadband communications. States may convert existing narrowband networks to broadband use and return frequencies known as the T-Band. Public safety agencies are considering moving to new networks at 700 MHz due to interference on current frequency assignments. The FCC has the authority to allow flexible use of narrowband spectrum for public safety broadband communications. States may convert existing narrowband networks to broadband use and return frequencies known as the T-Band. Public safety agencies are considering moving to new networks at 700 MHz. The act requires the FCC to establish a relocation plan by February 2021 to free up the T-Band for reassignment through competitive bidding. Proceeds from the auctions of T-Band frequencies will cover relocation costs. Technical complications may arise due to adjacent commercial assignments not included in the rebanding. Public safety and other license-holders in designated channels below 512 MHz are required to reband. Public safety and other license-holders below 512 MHz must reband to improve spectrum efficiency by reducing channel width. The deadline for narrowbanding was January 1, 2013, but T-Band license holders are exempt. The law establishes a Public Safety Trust Fund for auction proceeds, available through FY2022 for deficit reduction. Auction proceeds from the Public Safety Trust Fund are to be distributed in various priorities, including reimbursing the Treasury for establishing FirstNet, funding state and local implementation programs, network construction costs, public safety research, and deficit reduction. The FCC conducted two auctions in 2014-2015 generating revenue to meet funding requirements of the act. FirstNet's administrative expenses are capped at $100 million over 10 years. FirstNet can obtain grants, collect network user fees, and form public-private partnerships for network construction and operation. The Spectrum Act created FirstNet as an independent entity within the NTIA to establish an interoperable broadband network for public safety. State and local agencies, as well as tribal authorities, have a consulting role in the network's development, deployment, and operation. Fees collected from secondary users must cover FirstNet's annual expenses, with any surplus going towards network construction and maintenance. There is a prohibition on providing direct service to consumers, but leasing agreements and fee collection from secondary users are allowed. The Spectrum Act created FirstNet as an independent entity within the NTIA to establish a nationwide broadband network for public safety. FirstNet is required to be self-funding and consult with federal, state, tribal, and local public safety entities for network development and operation. The authority expires in 2027 unless renewed. FirstNet is an autonomous organization with broad powers to establish a nationwide broadband network for public safety. It is headed by a board of 15 members, 12 appointed by the Secretary of Commerce, and must follow federal agency requirements in hiring and procurement. FirstNet is managed by a board of 15 members, with three members designated by key government officials. The Secretary of Commerce appoints a chairman for a two-year term. FirstNet is responsible for establishing network policies, consulting with states on expenditures, and utilizing existing communication infrastructure economically. FirstNet is responsible for the construction, maintenance, and improvement of the broadband network, representing users' interests before standards-setting boards, and creating a public safety advisory committee. The committee members are chosen from the Advisory Committee to SAFECOM, within the Department of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, announced the organizations represented on the FirstNet committee. Membership on the FirstNet board is chosen by the Secretary of Commerce, with specific members from DHS, the Attorney General, and the Office of Management and Budget. The Secretary of Commerce appoints a chairman for an initial two-year term. Grant programs for planning are administered by the NTIA in consultation with FirstNet. The NTIA administers grant programs for state networks to build their own Radio Access Networks in consultation with FirstNet. Funding for FirstNet and states is determined by the NTIA through the Network Construction Fund. States qualifying to build their networks must sublease spectrum through FirstNet. The FCC reviews the initial 10-year license assigned to FirstNet. The FCC is required to review the initial 10-year license assigned to FirstNet for renewal based on performance criteria. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) will provide recommendations on Congress's action regarding FirstNet's authority termination in 2027. The NTIA approves the fee schedule for access to FirstNet's resources. The Secretary of Commerce contracts for an annual audit of FirstNet's finances. FirstNet must submit annual reports to Congress on its operations and accomplishments. The Spectrum Act requires the FCC to review FirstNet's performance by 2022 and decide on license renewal for the public safety broadband network. Deadlines for building the network are flexible, with some milestones like rural coverage mandated but not specified. GAO must assess FirstNet's performance and report to Congress by 2022. The State and Local Implementation Fund and Network Construction Fund expire in 2022, with any remaining balances reverting to the Treasury. The Spectrum Act mandates certain requirements for FirstNet, such as rural coverage, without specified deadlines. States have deadlines to choose participation in FirstNet deployment or opt for their own network. No deadline is set for FCC approval of state proposals. The FCC approves state proposals for their portion of the broadband network without specified deadlines. States must demonstrate the ability to complete their Radio Access Network project within comparable deadlines to be eligible for a grant. The current 911 system's analog infrastructure lacks necessary features, leading to potential failures in emergency response. The 911 system needs modernization to meet user expectations, requiring investment in Next Generation 911 (NG9-1-1) technologies. These new technologies, based on Internet Protocol standards, will improve system resilience, interoperability, capacity, and call management. Additionally, an IP-enabled emergency communications network can support wireless broadband. The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 established 911 as the emergency number and gave the FCC authority to regulate the service. The NET 911 Improvement Act of 2008 required a National Plan for migrating to an IP-enabled emergency network, overseen by the E-911 Implementation Coordination Office. The Spectrum Act provisions re-establish the federal 9-1-1 Implementation Coordination Office (ICO) to advance planning for next-generation systems and administer a grant program. ICO provides matching grants for the implementation, operation, and migration of 911 and IP-enabled emergency services, and for public safety personnel training. States diverting fees collected for 911 services are ineligible for grants. GAO is required to study how states assess and use 911 service fees. The FCC is tasked with assessing fees on 911 services and their usage, improving 911 capabilities for multi-line telephone systems, and creating a specialized Do-Not-Call registry for public safety answering points. The ICO, in consultation with NHTSA and DHS, is required to report on costs and specifications for NG9-1-1 services. Immunity and liability protections are provided in accordance with specified regulations. The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 provides immunity and liability protections for users and providers of Next Generation 911 services, including the release of subscriber information. FirstNet is required to integrate the nationwide public safety broadband network with PSAPs. The Spectrum Act gives the FCC authority to improve public safety networks' roaming capabilities on commercial space and gain priority access. FirstNet can enter agreements with commercial providers for public safety network users to roam on partnering networks. The Spectrum Act allows for roaming agreements between public safety network users and commercial providers, including priority access during high demand. FCC's authority requires technical compatibility, reasonable compensation for commercial networks, and no degradation of access. The FCC has leeway to support public safety in negotiations with partners, but cannot mandate ruthless pre-emption. Full-spectrum roaming benefits public safety by providing more network capacity for emergency communications. Legislation in the 115th Congress addresses public safety communications issues, including H.R. 588 (Pallone) - Securing Access to Networks in Disasters Act. This bill directs the FCC to study network resiliency during emergencies and explore making WiFi access points available for 9-1-1 services without login credentials. The legislation in the 115th Congress addresses public safety communications issues, including the Securing Access to Networks in Disasters Act of 2017. This bill aims to provide alternative access to 9-1-1 services during emergencies when mobile service is unavailable, including through WiFi access points. It also designates all communications providers as essential service providers during federally declared emergencies. The legislation aims to provide alternative access to 9-1-1 services during emergencies when mobile service is unavailable, including through WiFi access points. It also directs a study on ensuring essential communications services remain operational during emergencies and considers legislative measures to promote their resiliency. The legislation focuses on ensuring the resiliency of essential communications services during emergencies and proposes a nationwide directory of contact points for providers. It also amends the Stafford Act to include all communications providers as essential service providers during federally declared emergencies. Additionally, it introduces the Kari's Law Act of 2017, which requires multi-line telephone systems to allow direct calls to 9-1-1 without additional digits. S. 123 (Klobuchar) known as Kari's Law Act of 2017, passed by House (408-0) on January 23, 2017. It amends the Communications Act of 1934 to mandate multi-line telephone systems to enable direct 9-1-1 calls without extra digits. Reported favorably by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on January 24, 2017."
