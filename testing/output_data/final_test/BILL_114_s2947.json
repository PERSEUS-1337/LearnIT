    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Food Date Labeling Act of 2016\". Congress finds that current date labeling practices on food packaging cause confusion, leading to significant food waste and consumer spending. Standardized date labeling and consumer education are identified as cost-effective strategies to reduce food waste and its associated costs. The current date labeling practices on food packaging in the United States lead to confusion, resulting in significant food waste and consumer spending. This missed opportunity to feed food insecure households could be addressed through standardized date labeling and consumer education. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"administering Secretaries\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for certain products and the Secretary of Health and Human Services for others. A \"food labeler\" is the entity that puts a date label on food packaging. A \"quality date\" is a date on packaging indicating when the product's quality may start to decline but is still safe to consume. A \"ready-to-eat product\" is defined as... The term \"ready-to-eat product\" refers to food that is edible without additional preparation for safety, but may be further prepared for taste or presentation purposes. This includes poultry and meat products under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture. The term \"ready-to-eat product\" includes food that can be consumed without additional preparation for safety, such as poultry and meat products regulated by the Secretary of Agriculture, or an egg product under the Egg Products Inspection Act. For foods under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, it includes raw foods or processed foods that are likely to be consumed without further processing. The term \"safety date\" on food packaging of ready-to-eat products indicates the end of the shelf life, after which the product may pose health risks. SEC. 4. QUALITY DATES AND SAFETY DATES. Quality Dates: Food labelers must use the uniform phrase \"best if used by\" unless specified otherwise. The decision to include a quality date is at the labeler's discretion.\n\nSafety Dates: Ready-to-eat products must have a safety date preceded by a uniform safety date label phrase. The uniform safety date label phrase for ready-to-eat products is 'expires on' unless specified otherwise by the administering Secretaries. Criteria for high-risk ready-to-eat products are determined by the administering Secretaries jointly. The administering Secretaries may list additional high-risk ready-to-eat products or exempt specific products that do not pose a high level of risk associated with consumption. The administering Secretaries review and update criteria for high-risk products every 4 years. Quality date and safety date labeling must be clear and easy to read. Quality date and safety date labeling on food packaging must be clear, with letters no smaller than 8 point size and located conspicuously. Dates should be in day, month, and year format. Guidance will be provided on determining these dates, and after the quality date has passed, products can still be sold, donated, or used. Consumer education on quality and safety dates will be provided by the administering Secretaries within a year of the Act's enactment. The section allows states to enforce laws prohibiting the sale of food based on quality or safety dates, but they cannot impose requirements different from those outlined in the Act. The administering Secretaries, in coordination with the Federal Trade Commission, will standardize quality and safety date labels on food products. The Act does not preempt any State or Federal laws regarding civil relief or criminal penalties. Time-temperature indicator labels are not restricted by this section. Delayed Applicability: This section applies to food products labeled two years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. MISBRANDING VIOLATION FOR QUALITY DATES AND SAFETY DATES IN FOOD LABELING. The FDA violations related to food labeling under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, and the Federal Meat Inspection Act are amended to include compliance with the Food Date Labeling Act of 2016. The amendments to the Egg Products Inspection Act now require compliance with the Food Date Labeling Act of 2016, specifically regarding labeling requirements. The administering Secretaries must report to Congress within 5 years on the progress of reducing food waste due to standardized food date labeling and consumer education as required by the Act."
