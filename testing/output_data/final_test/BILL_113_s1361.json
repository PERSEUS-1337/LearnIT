President Roosevelt established the War Shipping Administration in 1942 to manage civilian shipping for the war effort. US merchant mariners played a crucial role in transporting goods during World War II. During World War II, US merchant mariners transported millions of Armed Forces members back to the United States. The GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 allowed service by civilian groups to be considered \"active service\" for benefits. In 1987, three merchant mariners sued the Secretary of the Air Force for denying their veterans application. In Schumacher v. Aldridge (665 F. Supp. 41 (D.D.C. 1987)), the Court found that Secretary Aldridge did not provide clear criteria for the veterans application process. Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 (April 1992) lists acceptable documentation for eligibility under the GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 and Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998. This includes Certificate of shipping and discharge forms. The Coast Guard Commandant Order of 20 March, 1944 relieved masters of tugs, towboats, and seagoing barges from submitting reports of seamen shipped or discharged on forms, making certificates of shipping and discharge forms unavailable to eligible individuals. Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 (April 1992) mentions that deck logs were traditionally owned by ship owners, but after World War II, the logbooks of vessels were considered property of the owners. During World War II, the War Shipping Administration destroyed deck and engine logbooks of vessels, making it difficult for eligible individuals to document their eligibility for benefits. Some logbooks from that period do not name ports visited due to security restrictions, further complicating the documentation process. SEC. 3. METHODS FOR VALIDATING CERTAIN SERVICE CONSIDERED TO BE ACTIVE SERVICE BY THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.

The Secretary of Homeland Security will accept official documentation as proof of service for coastwise merchant seamen seeking recognition under the GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977. Masters of seagoing vessels or officers in command of organized groups are recognized as agents of the United States for documenting individuals for service in the merchant marine. Other documentation accepted by the Secretary will satisfy eligibility requirements for service during the specified period. During the period from December 7, 1941, to December 31, 1946, individuals with active duty service are eligible for burial benefits and military decorations. Recognized veterans are honored but not entitled to additional benefits. The Act honors recognized veterans but does not entitle them to additional benefits. The Secretary of Homeland Security verifies service conditions for coastwise merchant seamen without regard to sex, age, or disability. The term \"primary next of kin\" refers to the closest living relative during the period of service. The Act will take effect 90 days after enactment."
