    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United Nations Population Fund Women's Health and Dignity Act\". The findings and sense of Congress are also included in the Act. Congress finds that sexual and reproductive health issues contribute significantly to the global burden of disease, especially among women of reproductive age. Lack of access to skilled care during childbirth results in a high number of maternal deaths, with the majority occurring in Africa and Asia. Maternal mortality leaves over a million children motherless each year, increasing their risk of death within two years. Approximately 201 million women in low-income countries lack access to safe contraceptive methods, leading to 52 million unplanned pregnancies annually. This results in 23 million unplanned births, 22 million induced abortions, 7 million spontaneous abortions, 1.4 million infant deaths, 142,000 pregnancy-related deaths, and 505,000 children losing their mothers each year. Additionally, 14,000 people are infected with HIV daily, with half of new infections occurring in women. Access to voluntary family planning services, including contraception, is crucial in reducing unintended pregnancies and abortion rates. Government funds can be saved by investing in family planning programs, as seen in studies from Mexico and Thailand. The voluntary family planning program in Thailand saved the government over $16 and is crucial in reducing unintended pregnancies and abortion rates. The global population growth and consumption patterns have significant environmental impacts, threatening sustainability and human quality of life worldwide. Demographic factors, such as the proportion of young adults in a population, are linked to an increased likelihood of civil conflict outbreaks. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) was established in 1969 with US support. It is the largest funder of family planning, safe delivery, maternal health, and HIV/AIDS prevention programs globally. UNFPA also promotes women's rights, education, and livelihoods in developing countries, operating in about 140 nations. The UNFPA operates in about 140 countries globally and receives financial contributions from 180 countries, with the United States being the only developed nation not contributing since 2002. UNFPA's pilot programs in China promote voluntary family planning and have led to positive outcomes in various countries, including decreased maternal deaths and increased knowledge of contraceptives. The US should release $34,000,000 in funding to UNFPA. Abortion rates have dropped significantly, home-based childbirths have decreased, and the choice of contraception by clients has increased. Congress believes the US should resume annual contributions to UNFPA to support its mission of improving lives in foreign countries. The United States policy is to support the United Nations Population Fund in activities to save women's lives, reduce abortion rates, promote family planning, and improve lives in developing countries through financial assistance. The US authorizes voluntary contributions to UNFPA. The President is authorized to make voluntary contributions to the United Nations Population Fund for activities such as providing medical supplies, contraceptives, and reducing abortion rates and maternal mortality related to unsafe abortion. The President is authorized to make voluntary contributions to the United Nations Population Fund to reduce coercive family planning practices, sex selection, obstetric fistula cases, harmful traditional practices, and promote maternal health services in disaster-stricken areas. Additionally, the fund aims to provide vital services to unaccompanied women and vulnerable individuals in emergency situations. The President can provide grant-based support to UNFPA for emergency response activities to save lives or alleviate human suffering. The President is required to report annually to Congress on the implementation of the Act, focusing on the activities of the United Nations Population Fund, including the number of lives saved and abortions prevented. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Authorization of appropriations for the President to carry out the Act is set at $50,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2008 through 2012."
