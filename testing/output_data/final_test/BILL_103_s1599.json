    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Missing and Exploited Children Task Force Act of 1993\". The Congress acknowledges the widespread victimization of children in the nation, with alarming statistics on child abductions and runaways. Local law enforcement agencies often lack the necessary resources to address these crimes effectively, especially considering that a majority of police departments have limited personnel. Locating missing children requires a coordinated law enforcement effort. Supplementing local agencies with a team of assigned Federal agents will allow pooling of resources and expertise to assist in investigating difficult cases involving missing children. The Act aims to establish a task force of law enforcement officers to collaborate with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in assisting State and local authorities with investigating challenging cases of missing and exploited children. This task force will be created under Title IV of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. The Missing and Exploited Children's Task Force is established under Title IV of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. It includes members from various law enforcement agencies and is led by a representative from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
