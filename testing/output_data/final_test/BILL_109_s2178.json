    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006\" and includes findings related to consumer telephone records. Congress finds that telephone records contain a wealth of personal data, including information on doctors, relationships, and business associates. Access to these records without authorization poses a risk, such as through pretexting or employees selling data. Unauthorized access to telephone records can occur through pretexting, where a person pretends to be the owner of the phone to convince the telephone company to release the data. Additionally, unauthorized access can also happen through online account breaches, as many customers have their online accounts set up in advance but never access them. If someone activates the account before the customer, they can gain unfettered access to the telephone records and call logs. SEC. 3. FRAUD AND RELATED ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION WITH OBTAINING CONFIDENTIAL PHONE RECORDS INFORMATION FROM A COVERED ENTITY. This section amends Chapter 47 of title 18, United States Code, by adding a new section 1039 that addresses fraud and related activities in obtaining confidential phone records information from a covered entity. The new section 1039 addresses obtaining confidential phone records information fraudulently, with penalties including fines and imprisonment for up to 5 years. It prohibits the sale of such information without authorization. Selling confidential phone records without authorization can result in fines, imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both. Enhanced penalties apply for aggravated cases involving violations of other laws or illegal activities exceeding $100,000 or affecting more than 50 customers in a 12-month period. In this section, selling confidential phone records without authorization can lead to fines, imprisonment for up to 10 years, or both. Law enforcement agencies are not restricted from obtaining confidential phone records information from covered entities for official duties. The definition of confidential phone records information includes details about the service used by customers of a covered entity. The term 'covered entity' refers to telecommunications carriers and providers of IP-enabled voice services. A 'customer' is defined as any person or authorized representative of a covered entity. The term 'document' refers to any form of information. 'IP-enabled voice service' is defined as real-time 2-way voice communications transmitted through customer premises equipment using TCP/IP protocol for a fee with 2-way interconnection capability to the public switched telephone network."
