Ethics agencies in the government may make exceptions to the general restriction on receiving gifts from prohibited sources. The Office of Government Ethics sets guidelines for gift acceptance in the executive branch, prohibiting gifts from prohibited sources or given because of an official's position. Under government regulations, officials are prohibited from accepting gifts from individuals seeking official action, doing business with the agency, or whose interests may be affected by the official's duties. Exceptions allow gifts based on personal relationships rather than official positions. The executive branch gift regulations allow exceptions for accepting gifts of \"minimal value,\" incidental food or drinks, awards, loans, prizes, pensions, discounts, and free attendance at certain events. Spouses of federal officials are not directly covered by these regulations, but gifts to them may be imputed to the official, subject to the same restrictions. The OGE regulations apply to gifts accepted or solicited directly or indirectly, including gifts given with the employee's knowledge and acquiescence to family members. The President and Vice President are generally exempt from gift restrictions, allowing them to accept gifts from the general public or prohibited sources. The President and Vice President are generally exempt from gift restrictions, allowing them to accept gifts from the general public or prohibited sources, as long as certain conditions are met. The regulations exempt the President from gift restrictions, allowing acceptance of gifts from the general public. Prohibitions still apply to gifts given in return for influence or solicited. Gifts intended for the White House can be retained by the President upon leaving office. Personal gifts given to the President or First Lady are not kept by them but are instead intended for the White House or the government of the United States. These gifts are catalogued, distributed, or disposed of by the United States, with different types of gifts being accepted by various agencies such as the National Park Service or the Archivist for the Archives or Presidential Libraries. Domestic or private gifts are screened and evaluated by aides in the White House Gift Office before being distributed accordingly. If personal gifts are not retained by the President or First Lady, they are recorded, tracked, and sent to the National Archives and Records Administration. Personal gifts given to the President or First Lady are catalogued, distributed, or disposed of by the United States. The Gift Unit handles most gifts from the general public, with some items transferred to the National Archives for possible display at a presidential library. Foreign gifts are restricted by the Constitution, requiring consent from Congress. The Congress has consented to the acceptance of gifts from foreign governments under certain conditions, such as minimal value or to avoid offense. Tangible gifts of more than minimal value are considered property of the United States. Presidents and federal officials have been allowed to accept awards like the Nobel Prize. The Nobel Prize is funded and managed by a private foundation, not considered a gift from a foreign government. Federal officials are subject to bribery laws prohibiting acceptance of anything of value in return for official acts. The President is required to publicly disclose personal financial information, including gifts over minimal amounts, received by him and his immediate family. These public disclosure reports are required each May 15th and upon leaving office. Despite the permissibility of receiving gifts, the President and First Lady have faced criticism for accepting lavish or excessive gifts, which can have political and public relations consequences."
