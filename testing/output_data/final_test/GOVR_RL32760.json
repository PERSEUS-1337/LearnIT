    "content": "This report provides a quick reference on the TANF block grant, including state-level data. Legislation was signed to fund TANF through June 30, 2019, allowing states to receive grants for the 2nd and 3rd quarters of FY2019. Additional legislation is needed for the final quarter funding. In FY2018, TANF programs were funded through federal and state funds, with a basic block grant totaling $16.5 billion to states. States must also meet a maintenance of effort requirement by spending at least 75% of what they spent in FY1994 on TANF's predecessor programs. The TANF basic block grant amount was established in the 1996 welfare reform law at $16.6 billion for states, territories, and tribes. From FY1997 to FY2016, the grant amount remained the same, leading to a 33.1% decline in real value. In FY2017, the grant was reduced by 0.33% for TANF-related research and technical assistance, resulting in a $16.5 billion block grant. The FY2018 block grant amount is $16.5 billion, 36% lower than in FY1997 in real terms. In FY2017, $31.1 billion of federal TANF and state MOE funds were used, with $7.1 billion for basic assistance and $5 billion for child care. TANF is a significant source of child care funding. TANF work-related activities, state refundable tax credits, child welfare system, prekindergarten programs, emergency benefits, and other social services are funded by TANF and MOE expenditures. Total spending in FY2017 for these categories amounted to $3.3 billion, $2.8 billion, $2.2 billion, and $2.5 billion respectively. At the end of FY2017, states had $5.1 billion in unspent federal TANF funding, with $1.8 billion already committed to spend later and $3.3 billion available for new spending commitments. At the end of FY2017, states had $5.1 billion in unspent federal TANF funding, with $1.8 billion already committed to spend later and $3.3 billion available for new spending commitments. Table B-3 shows unspent TANF funds by state, with incomplete reporting on families receiving TANF benefits and services beyond ongoing assistance. Assistance includes cash benefits and earnings supplements for working parents, as well as food assistance for immigrants in certain states. In September 2018, 1.2 million families, totaling 3.1 million recipients, received TANF- or MOE-funded assistance, with the majority being children. Historical data from July 1959 to September 2017 shows trends in families receiving assistance, influenced by the national economy's health. The cash assistance caseload trend is influenced by factors other than the national economy's health, such as demographic trends and policy changes. There were two periods of sustained caseload increases in the past, with the number of families receiving assistance peaking in March 1994 at 5.1 million families. After the 1996 welfare reform law, the caseload fell rapidly in the late 1990s before leveling off in 2001. The caseload began declining again in 2004, albeit at a slower pace, but rose during the 2007-2009 recession and its aftermath. The cash assistance caseload rose during the 2007-2009 recession, peaking in December 2010 at close to 2.0 million families. By September 2018, it had declined to 1.2 million families. The composition of the assistance caseload has shifted over the past 20 years, with a decrease in families headed by an unemployed adult recipient from 84% in FY1988 to 32% in FY2016. The composition of the cash assistance caseload has shifted over the years, with a decline in families headed by unemployed adult recipients. In FY2016, 32% of all cash assistance families had an unemployed adult recipient, compared to 84% in FY1988. In FY2017, families with all adult recipients unemployed and families with employed adult recipients each represented 31% of all assistance families. In FY2017, the composition of TANF cash assistance families included child-only families (38%), families with nonparent relatives (14%), families with ineligible noncitizen adults (9%), and families with a parent on SSI and children on TANF (9%). There are no federal rules determining TANF benefit amounts, but all states provide cash benefits. The TANF program provides cash benefits to families, with benefit amounts determined by each state based on family size. Larger families receive higher benefits. Families with other income may receive reduced benefits, and some may face financial sanctions for not meeting program requirements. The maximum monthly cash benefit for a single mother with two children varied by state in July 2016. The TANF program provides cash benefits to families based on family size, with varying maximum monthly benefits by state. New Hampshire had the highest benefit amount for a family of three in July 2017. States set work requirements for recipients, with 50% of caseloads needing to meet participation standards. The TANF program sets work participation standards for two-parent families, with a 90% requirement that can be reduced by a caseload reduction credit. States may receive extra credit for caseload reduction if they exceed spending requirements. Failure to meet the standard can result in penalties, but these can be forgiven with reasonable cause. The 50% and 90% work standards for states can be forgiven with \"reasonable cause\" or by entering into corrective compliance plans. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 made changes to work participation rules, including measuring caseload reduction from FY2005. Separate state programs, funded by states but countable towards TANF MOE, are now included in work participation standards. HHS was tasked with defining allowable TANF work activities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) allowed states to \"freeze\" caseload reduction credits at pre-recession levels through FY2011 to meet TANF work standards. HHS computes two work participation rates for each state to determine compliance. The national average all-families work participation rate increased from around 30% in FY2002-2011 to over 50% in FY2016. However, the increase is mainly due to states creating new \"earnings supplement\" programs rather than an increase in recipients in regular TANF assistance programs participating in work or job preparation activities. In FY2007, 15 jurisdictions did not meet TANF all-families work participation standards, decreasing to 9 in FY2008 and 8 in FY2009. In FY2012, 16 states did not meet the standard, the highest number since TANF enactment. In FY2017, two jurisdictions, Nevada and Guam, did not meet the all-family participation standard under TANF. States also have a 90% work participation standard for the two-parent portion of cash assistance caseload, which can be lowered by caseload reduction. Some states reported no two-parent families subject to the work participation standard. Before the changes made by the DRA were effective, some states had two-parent families in separate state programs not included in work participation calculations. When DRA brought these families into calculations, some states moved them to solely state-funded programs outside of TANF rules. Of the 28 jurisdictions with two-parent families in FY2017 TANF work participation calculations, 19 met the two-parent standard. Out of the 28 jurisdictions with two-parent families included in their FY2017 TANF work participation calculation, 19 met the standard while 9 did not. Appendix A. Supplementary Tables Appendix B.
