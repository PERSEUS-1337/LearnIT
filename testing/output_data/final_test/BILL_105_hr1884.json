It may include a document prepared by the auditor, an analysis of the evaluation, conclusions, and recommendations. The curr_chunk defines terms related to civil proceedings, entities, and persons under environmental laws. The curr_chunk defines the term \"State\" as including various territories and entities. The curr_chunk establishes a nondisclosure privilege. The curr_chunk establishes a privilege of nondisclosure for voluntary environmental self-evaluation reports in federal and state proceedings, except for information required by law or intentional violations. The privilege can be waived with a written statement. The curr_chunk discusses the process of requesting disclosure of privileged information in administrative or judicial proceedings. If a party refuses to disclose information based on privilege, an in camera hearing can be requested to determine the application of the privilege. In civil proceedings, the privilege under subsection (a) may not apply if noncompliance with an environmental law is indicated and the entity did not take steps to comply with the law. The burden of asserting the privilege lies with the entity, while the burden of persuasion falls on the party seeking disclosure. The privilege under subsection (a) may not apply if noncompliance with an environmental law is indicated and the entity did not take steps to comply with the law. The entity must initiate efforts to achieve compliance within a reasonable period of time in a manner consistent with applicable provisions of law. The privilege may not be asserted for a fraudulent purpose or to avoid disclosure in a pending investigation or proceeding. Appeals can be made to the appropriate United States district court regarding rulings on the privilege. The privilege under subsection (a) does not apply in criminal proceedings if a court determines so in an in camera hearing. Law enforcement officials can access environmental self-evaluation reports if there is probable cause of a criminal offense. The court must review and issue a decision on the appeal within 30 days. Upon seizure of the report, law enforcement officials must immediately seal it and refrain from reviewing or disclosing its contents unless authorized by the entity or court. The court may allow the agency to review the report in an in camera hearing but not disclose or use the information for any investigation or proceeding. SEC. 4. IMMUNITY FOR CERTAIN VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURES. Entities disclosing violations through voluntary self-evaluation or compliance systems are immune from prosecution in Federal or State proceedings, except for specific intent violations. Disclosure must be prompt to qualify for immunity. Entities disclosing violations through voluntary self-evaluation or compliance systems are immune from prosecution in Federal or State proceedings, except for specific intent violations. Disclosure must be prompt to qualify for immunity, as long as the entity initiates efforts to achieve compliance in accordance with the law, does not assert immunity for fraudulent purposes, does not disclose information to avoid penalties in ongoing proceedings, and provides additional requested information related to the violation. Entities disclosing violations through voluntary self-evaluation or compliance systems are immune from prosecution in Federal or State proceedings, except for specific intent violations. The immunity does not apply if the violation is part of a pattern of significant violations within the past 3 years at the same or different facilities under common control, where senior management had actual knowledge and failed to take corrective action. A violation is any violation of an environmental law identified in a judicial or administrative order, consent agreement, conviction, or plea agreement. Entities disclosing violations through voluntary self-evaluation or compliance systems are immune from prosecution in Federal or State proceedings, except for specific intent violations. The entity is presumed to be entitled to immunity if it provides supporting information at the time of disclosure, and this presumption is conclusive unless challenged by the agency within 60 days. An entity can request a judicial determination regarding the applicability of immunity to any violation. SEC. 5. SAVINGS CLAUSE. This Act does not affect the authority of Federal or State agencies to issue orders for environmental law violations. State privileges and immunities under State law are not limited by this Act. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act applies to civil and criminal proceedings starting after its enactment."
