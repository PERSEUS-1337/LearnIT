    "content": "The EPA Administrator signed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone on March 12, 2008. These revisions have significant implications for public health and pollution control measures. Congressional interest has been sparked, with hearings held by various committees. This report provides background on NAAQS, the ozone standard, EPA's revisions, and their potential effects. The Clean Air Act defines NAAQS as standards for outdoor air quality set by the EPA to protect public health and welfare. These standards do not directly regulate emissions but define what the EPA considers clean air. Areas exceeding the standards must reduce pollutant concentrations to meet them. The Clean Air Act defines NAAQS as standards set by the EPA to protect public health. Nonattainment areas must reduce pollutant concentrations to meet the standards, with state and local governments producing plans to achieve this. Implementation involves controlling pollutants from various sources, impacting public health, economic sectors, and governments. The Clean Air Act defines NAAQS as standards set by the EPA to protect public health by regulating criteria pollutants like ozone, particulates, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and lead. The EPA Administrator can update the list of criteria pollutants based on public health risks. The act requires a review of NAAQS every five years, often leading to lawsuits for non-compliance. The American Lung Association sued the EPA over a review delay in 2003, leading to a consent decree for a revised schedule. The review process for ozone involves EPA scientists summarizing 1,700 scientific studies on various topics in a Criteria Document, followed by a Staff Paper summarizing the compiled information. The EPA prepares the Staff Paper, which summarizes information from the Criteria Document and provides options for NAAQS indicators, averaging times, statistical form, and numerical levels. The Clean Air Act requires the Administrator to appoint an independent CASAC with seven members, supplemented by expert panels for NAAQS reviews. Panels can be large, like the 23-member ozone review panel. CASAC and the public suggest panel members, with final selections made by EPA. The ozone standard affects a large percentage of the U.S. population, with nearly half currently living in nonattainment areas. The recent review strengthened the standard, leading to more areas being affected and potentially requiring stricter emission controls. The previous standard set in 1997 was at 0.08 parts per million, with evidence of health effects found at levels below this threshold. The EPA and CASAC recommended strengthening the ozone standard due to evidence of health effects at levels below 0.08 ppm. The panel suggested a range of 0.060 to 0.070 ppm for the standard, while EPA staff proposed a level within the range of 0.070-0.075 ppm. The EPA proposed to tighten the primary ozone standard to 0.075 ppm in June 2007, which would result in more counties showing nonattainment. Data from 2004-2006 indicated that 85 counties violated the current 0.08 ppm standard, but under the new 0.075 ppm standard, 345 counties would be in violation. Nonattainment designations will not be made until 2010 at the earliest, using data from 2006-2008. The EPA expects fewer counties to exceed the standard due to cleaner air trends and upcoming regulations on mobile and stationary sources. The EPA proposed tightening the primary ozone standard to 0.075 ppm, leading to more counties in nonattainment. Industry groups challenged the scientific conclusions, and EPA also reviewed the secondary standard for ozone. EPA staff recommended a new seasonal average to protect against ozone's adverse impacts on tree growth and crop yields. The EPA staff recommended a new secondary standard for ozone, with a range of 7-21 parts per million-hours. The Administrator ultimately set the standard at 0.075 ppm averaged over 8 hours, going against the advice of CASAC and staff. The secondary standard has no deadline for attainment and has not been enforced with penalties. The EPA staff recommended a new secondary standard for ozone, but there was disagreement with the White House over the form of the standard. The CASAC agreed that a different standard was needed to protect vegetation from ozone effects. The National Park Service also supported the use of a seasonal, cumulative metric like the W126 index. The EPA staff recommended a new secondary standard for ozone to protect vegetation, with disagreement from the White House. The White House favored the W126 index metric for added protection, which the EPA agreed with. The President concluded that the secondary ozone standard should be strengthened to provide increased protection to public welfare. The policy recognizes the Administrator's judgment on adjusting the standard. The formation of ozone is complex, as it is not directly emitted but forms in the atmosphere from VOCs reacting with NOx in sunlight. Ozone levels are influenced by temperature and sunlight, making it a summertime pollutant. Lower VOC emissions generally lead to less ozone, but higher NOx emissions can sometimes reduce ozone readings. This complexity makes modeling ozone air quality more challenging than other pollutants. Modeling ozone pollution is more difficult and contentious than other air pollutants due to the numerous sources of VOCs and nitrogen oxides. Motor vehicles, industrial processes, and various other activities contribute to VOC emissions, while nitrogen oxides primarily come from vehicles and fuel combustion. The EPA must consider a wide array of control measures to address these pollutants, despite not being able to factor in costs when setting NAAQS. Regulatory Impact Analysis is typically conducted to comply with executive orders. The EPA released a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for new NAAQS standards, showing a wide range of benefits and costs. Benefits range from $2 billion to $19 billion annually, while costs range from $7.6 billion to $8.8 billion annually in 2020. It is challenging to determine if benefits exceed costs due to the broad benefit range. The public health benefits of a stricter ozone standard include fewer premature deaths, hospital admissions, asthma attacks, and emergency room visits. The EPA Fact Sheet accompanying the new NAAQS standards highlights the benefits of a stricter ozone standard, including fewer premature deaths, hospital admissions, asthma attacks, and emergency room visits. The benefits of an 0.075 ppm primary standard could potentially avoid 260 to 2,300 premature deaths annually in 2020, along with preventing various health issues and reducing missed work and school days. The agency acknowledges significant uncertainties in cost and benefit estimates, including unquantified benefits like the effects of reduced ozone on forest health and agricultural productivity. The benefits of a stricter ozone standard include fewer premature deaths, hospital admissions, asthma attacks, and emergency room visits. Uncertainties exist in cost and benefit estimates, with unquantified benefits like the effects of reduced ozone on forest health and agricultural productivity. Costs may not be as great as projected due to technological advances over time. The new standards for ozone exposure raise concerns about the Administrator's choices, particularly regarding the primary and secondary standards. The primary standard chosen is weaker than recommended by CASAC, citing uncertainty at lower exposure levels. The secondary standard deviates from CASAC's unanimous recommendation. The Administrator's decision on ozone exposure standards is based on epidemiological studies, which do not establish a clear threshold for effects. The choice of 0.070 to 0.075 ppm is seen as a policy judgment due to uncertainties in the evidence. Lowering the standard below 0.075 ppm may not significantly benefit public health but could require more reductions in ambient concentrations. The Administrator's decision on ozone exposure standards is based on epidemiological studies, with a standard set at 0.075 ppm. CASAC disagrees, citing evidence from clinical studies showing adverse lung effects at 0.08 ppm and 0.06 ppm. This suggests the current standard is not sufficiently health-protective. The Administrator's decision on ozone exposure standards is based on epidemiological studies, with a standard set at 0.075 ppm. CASAC disagrees, citing evidence from clinical studies showing adverse lung effects at 0.08 ppm and 0.06 ppm. People with asthma, especially children, are more sensitive to ozone exposure. The new ozone standard may be challenged, similar to the particulate matter standard. EPA disregarded advice from CASAC and its staff in setting the secondary standard. The EPA has received both opposing and supporting statements regarding the final form of the standard, with involvement from the White House Office of Management and Budget. Various stakeholders will review the new standards, including potential impacts on public health and the economy. The EPA projected air quality up to 2020, considering emissions reductions from federal regulations like the Clean Air Interstate Rule and Tier 2 auto standards. Despite these controls, the agency projected air quality issues in 28 counties across 10 states. The EPA projected that 28 counties in 10 states would violate the 0.075 standard in 2020. Most nonattainment areas will not have until 2020 to meet the standards, with deadlines set for 2013 or 2016 based on pollutant concentrations. There is a mismatch between federal regulations on emission sources and local areas demonstrating attainment, raising the need for stronger federal controls. Concerns also arise about the adequacy of the current monitoring network to detect violations of a more stringent standard. The EPA projected violations of the new air quality standard in 345 monitors, raising concerns about the adequacy of the current monitoring network. The President's budget has proposed cuts in grants for air quality management, shifting the responsibility to state and local governments. Ozone precursor emissions are mainly in urban areas, but ozone forms downwind, leading to high concentrations in rural areas as well. High ozone concentrations in rural areas may have potential health impacts, leading to a need for additional monitoring."
