    "content": "In this work, a novel RND-based OOD detector, SVD-RND, is introduced to address the vulnerability of conventional OOD detection schemes to blurred images. The detector utilizes blurred images during training, leading to improved target distribution representation and outperforming baseline detectors in various domains. SVD-RND combined with geometric transform achieves near-perfect detection accuracy in the CelebA domain, showcasing its simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness in distinguishing samples from unseen distributions. Novelty detection methods focus on noise filtering and representation learning, using autoencoders and deep generative models. However, deep generative models have been criticized for assigning higher likelihood to out-of-distribution data. Adversarial examples are used to train classifiers against attacks, showing effectiveness in detecting unknown adversarial attacks. In this work, blurred data is proposed as an adversarial example to prevent overfitting in novelty detection models. A new OOD detection model, SVD-RND, is introduced, trained using Random Network Distillation to discriminate training data from blurred images. SVD-RND shows significant performance gain in detecting out-of-distribution data compared to conventional baselines. SVD-RND demonstrates a substantial performance improvement in OOD detection compared to traditional methods, with gains ranging from 50% to over 90% in various domains. The goal is to determine if data is from the target distribution D, using a scalar function trained on D train \u2282 D to express data confidence. OOD detection methods often rely on reconstruction error and representation learning, with SVD-RND outperforming baselines in domains like CIFAR-10 to LSUN. Deep generative models like VAE and GLOW struggle to detect simple OOD from the training distribution, as discovered by Nalisnick et al. (2019). Adversarially trained generative models, such as GAN or AAE, also face challenges in OOD detection, as shown in GPND experiments. In GPND experiments, models like VAE and GLOW struggle to detect simple OODs. Various methods, such as appending additional data or labels, employing semi-supervised learning, and designing geometrically transformed data, have been used to improve OOD detection. However, the focus is on compensating the deep model's vulnerability to OOD data with a lower effective rank through self-generated blurred images. The deep model's vulnerability to OOD data is addressed through methods like adversarial examples and OOD detection on labeled data. Different approaches, such as using the Fast Sign Gradient Method (FSGM) for adversarial examples and employing Mahalanobis distance for uncertainty measurement, have been effective in improving OOD detection and adversarial defense. Bayesian Uncertainty Calibration is also widely used for better calibration. In this section, the use of blurred data as adversarial examples for conventional deep OOD detection methods is motivated. The proposed algorithm, SVD-RND, utilizes the SVD on the data matrix of a single image in the training data to construct a blurred image by forcing the bottom non-zero singular values to zero. The SVD-RND algorithm uses the SVD on training data to create blurred images by setting bottom non-zero singular values to zero. Channels are represented as weighted sums of orthonormal vectors, and conventional novelty detection methods are tested on these blurred images using VQ-VAE and RND models on CIFAR-10 dataset. The loss of VQ-VAE on blurred test data is higher than on original data, indicating a potential for using blurred data as adversarial examples in OOD detection. The SVD-RND algorithm uses SVD on training data to create blurred images for novelty detection. Multiple skip connections in residual blocks do not prevent information leakage. The model assigns lower uncertainty to blurred data during training, similar to the CIFAR-10: SVHN phenomenon. Various blurring techniques like SVD, DCT, or Gaussian Blurring can be used, but DCT increases the hyperparameter search space. The SVD-RND algorithm uses SVD to create blurred datasets for training the predictor network f to discriminate between original and blurred data. Blurred datasets are generated by zeroing non-zero singular values, with a randomly initialized target network assigned to each. The predictor network is trained to minimize l2 loss against the target network on each dataset, with SVD-RND outputting f(x) - g0(x) for new samples. Target networks are not updated during training. SVD-RND uses multiple target networks to discriminate original data from blurred images during training. It directly regularizes on blurred images to improve out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. While RND struggles with OODs generated by blurring, it performs better with OODs generated by adding noise orthogonal to the data. SVD-RND utilizes multiple target networks to distinguish between original and blurred data, enhancing out-of-distribution detection. It focuses on discriminating low-rank projections to improve performance in OOD scenarios, particularly in domains where deep generative models exhibit higher likelihood for OOD data. SVD-RND outperforms conventional OOD detection methods by a large margin. CIFAR-10, LSUN, TinyImageNet, SVHN, CIFAR-100, and CelebA datasets were studied to examine tradeoffs. Images were resized to 32\u00d732 for consistency. The number of blurred non-zero singular values was optimized for different datasets. DCT and Gaussian blurring were applied to images for testing. In DCT-RND, the blurred image is generated using inverse DCT. GB-RND optimizes the Gaussian kernel shape for blurring. Comparison is made with SVD-RND and GPND for novelty detection. Geometric transforms like flip, rotation, and translations are also evaluated in the RND framework. In the RND framework, the effects of various transformations like pixel inversion, contrast reduction, and shearing are investigated. The effectiveness of the regularizer is demonstrated using RND. A typicality test is conducted by employing the test error of RND as a negative log likelihood in generative models. Five metrics are used to evaluate OOD detectors, including AUROC, AUPR, detection accuracy, and TNR at 95% TPR. In the study, various metrics such as AUPR, detection accuracy, and TNR at 95% TPR are used to evaluate OOD detection performance. Results show that SVD-RND outperforms other baselines in most target : OOD domains, especially in CIFAR-10 : (LSUN, TinyImageNet) and CelebA: (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) domains. Visualizations of CIFAR-10 data before and after blurring are provided in the appendix, and the performance of SVD-RND over different K 1 is plotted in Figure 3. Increasing the number of seeds to 4 confirms the stability of the results. In the study, SVD-RND shows narrow confidence intervals for the best performing parameter in OOD data. It further discriminates OOD from the target distribution, outperforming GPND and RND in various domains. SVD-RND assigns higher uncertainty to blurry or hardly recognizable images compared to RND, as shown in Figure 4. In OOD detection, geometric transformations show improved results against GPND and RND, especially in the CelebA domain. However, in the CIFAR-10 target domain, these schemes exhibit degraded performance on LSUN and TinyImageNet data. Limited training data analysis with SVD-RND and RND in CIFAR-10 domains reveals varying results. In OOD detection, SVD-RND outperforms RND with limited training data. SVD-RND consistently performs better than RND with only 20% of training data available. The study further analyzes SVD-RND's performance and introduces a novel heuristic for training without validation OOD data. Additionally, incorporating geometric transformations improves the performance of SVD-RND. Fine-tuning a classifier over the activation map shows that SVD-RND learns superior target distribution representation compared to RND. Fine-tuning a classifier over the activation map of SVD-RND and RND in CIFAR-10 datasets shows that SVD-RND consistently outperforms RND. The appended network is fine-tuned for the CIFAR-10 classification task using the SGD optimizer with learning rate annealed over 100 epochs. Results in Table 3 demonstrate the superior learning of target distribution-specific knowledge by SVD-RND. In the study, SVD-RND shows better learning of target distribution-specific knowledge compared to RND when fine-tuned over a 7-layer neural network. A novel rank-based design of SVD-RND is proposed that does not require OOD validation data, with the effective rank of image data determined by the entropy of normalized singular values. In SVD-RND, the selection of each K i is based on regularization against out-of-distribution (OOD) data with similar effective rank. The criterion is tested on CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet datasets with different training batch sizes. Results show that SVD-RND with uniform spacing of log effective rank outperforms other methods. In SVD-RND, the selection of K i is based on regularization against OOD data with similar effective rank. Results show that uniform SVD-RND outperforms other methods in OOD detection performance. Combining SVD-RND with geometric transform-based methods like rotation and vertical translation further enhances performance in CelebA dataset. In this work, SVD-ROT-RND and SVD-VER-RND outperform their counterparts and SVD-RND in CelebA dataset. A blurred image is used as an adversarial example for deep OOD detection, with SVD-RND employed for defense against blurred images. SVD-RND achieves significant performance gains in all target anomaly domains without external data or additional regularization techniques. The neural network shows potential in learning OOD detection but tends to overfit to blurred data. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for improving performance. The RND model, consisting of predictor network f and target network g, is used for OOD detection. RND reduces distance between f and g on target distribution, distinguishing between target and OOD data. RND is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in novelty detection on MNIST dataset. In RND, the predictor network f is generated by adding two fully connected layers to the network of g, which consists of 3 convolution layers and a fully connected layer. The architecture includes the first 33 layers of ResNet34 for g without ReLU activation at the end. To make the OOD detection task more challenging, the CelebA, TinyImageNet, and LSUN datasets are reduced to 50000 training data. For TinyImageNet, half of the images in each class are discarded, resulting in 250 training samples per class. LSUN dataset is reduced to 5000 data for each 10 class. The first 1000 images of the test OOD data are used for validation. For RND based OOD detection methods, the structure for f and g is consistent. The Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-4 is used, annealed to 10^-5 during training. Results are averaged across two random seeds. Different blurred data sets are used for different experiments. Parameters are optimized for various datasets. In DCT-RND, K i represents the number of unpruned signals in the frequency domain. In optimizing parameters for various datasets, K values are adjusted for different datasets. Gaussian blurring parameters are optimized for the shape of the Gaussian kernel. Training epochs vary for different methods and datasets. Reconstruction and adversarial loss parameters are optimized for discriminator Dz. Geometric transforms are optimized for magnitude of shift, shear, and translation methods. The study optimized translation magnitude for different transformations and trained the detector for a specific number of epochs. Test uncertainty of RND on OOD CIFAR-10 data was evaluated using a specific metric. The main weakness identified was data in the blurred direction. The study focused on the weakness of conventional novelty detection methods related to data in the blurred direction. They presented results on OODs by adding orthogonal vectors to the data, showing an increase in test uncertainty for RND. The average uncertainty of RND was reduced by blurring, but increased by adding orthogonal vectors. Visualization of CIFAR-10 images and their blurred versions processed by different methods was also provided. In Figure 5, images processed by SVD-RND, DCT-RND, and GB-RND are shown. The best performing parameters for SVHN OOD data are in columns (b), (d), (e), and for TinyImageNet OOD data in columns (c), (e), (f). Figure 6 analyzes SVD-RND behavior when discarding a small number of singular values. Test metrics are used to evaluate the results, showing TNR(at 95% TPR) of 0.07/0.04/0.06."
