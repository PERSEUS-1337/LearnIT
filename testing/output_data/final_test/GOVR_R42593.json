    "content": "Federal and state officials are addressing the opioid epidemic by focusing on the prescribing of opioids. Prescription opioid-related overdose deaths have increased significantly, with deaths involving prescription opioids five times higher in 2016 than in 1999. Various initiatives at the federal, state, and private sector levels have been implemented to combat prescription drug abuse, including legislation like the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. In 2016, an estimated 11.8 million individuals aged 12 or older misused opioids, including pain reliever misusers and heroin users. Prescription painkillers like oxycodone are involved in more overdose deaths than any other opioid. Over half of non-medical prescription painkiller users obtained the drugs from friends or relatives. The crackdown on prescription drug abuse and the high cost of prescription pain relievers on the black market may be linked to the increase in heroin abuse. The number of individuals using heroin has tripled since 2002. Heroin is a Schedule I controlled substance with no accepted medical use in the US. Prescription drug monitoring programs help identify abuse patterns. The federal government has supported state-level Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) to analyze data on controlled substance prescriptions. Congress established grants like the Harold Rogers PDMP grant and the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act of 2005 (NASPER) to improve PDMPs. In 2016, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) authorized PDMP activity under grant programs administered by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Policymakers aim to enhance state-level databases and promote interoperability among PDMPs. The report provides an overview of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs), including their operation, enforcement mechanisms, costs, and financing. It also examines the effectiveness of PDMPs, outlines federal grants supporting PDMPs, and discusses related issues such as protecting personally identifiable information and ensuring access to prescriptions for patients with legitimate medical needs. Congress may oversee the role of PDMPs in combating the prescription drug epidemic and assess the steps taken by relevant departments and agencies to achieve PDMP-related goals. This report discusses the effectiveness of PDMPs, federal grants supporting PDMPs, interstate data sharing, protection of health information, and the possible link between prescription drug abuse crackdown and rise in heroin abuse. PDMPs maintain electronic databases of prescription drug information for authorized individuals or organizations. Possible uses include identifying drug abuse, facilitating intervention, outlining trends for public health initiatives, and educating individuals on prescription drug use. PDMPs aim to educate individuals about prescription drug use, abuse, and diversion while also supporting access to controlled substances for legitimate medical use. Earlier paper-based programs like multiple-copy prescription programs had limitations, such as prescribers not ordering required forms, hindering the prescription of controlled substances when medically necessary. The PDMPs aim to educate individuals about prescription drug use, abuse, and diversion while supporting access to controlled substances for legitimate medical use. As of February 2018, 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two territories had operational PDMPs. The entity responsible for administering the PDMP varies by state and may be a pharmacy board, department of health, professional licensing agency, law enforcement agency, substance abuse agency, or consumer protection agency. Most state PDMPs are administered by pharmacy boards or health departments. State laws determine which schedules of controlled substances are monitored under each program. Each state determines the entities required to submit data to the PDMP, including retail pharmacies, dispensing practitioners, out-of-state, mail order, and Internet pharmacies. For example, if a patient in Alabama receives a prescription from an out-of-state mail order pharmacy, the pharmacy must report it to the Alabama PDMP. Access to information in the PDMP database is determined by state law, with most states allowing pharmacists and practitioners to access patient information. Some states also permit access for entities like law enforcement, licensing boards, and research organizations under specific circumstances. Federal regulations protect patient privacy for medications dispensed at federally assisted drug treatment programs. State laws govern access to PDMP information, which can be reactive or proactive in identifying prescription drug diversion. States vary in sharing data with other states, with some having specific policies for interstate information exchange based on reciprocity. Interstate data sharing policies are based on reciprocity and investigation needs. States are guided in creating MOUs for data exchange, considering reporting methods, data usage, retention guidelines, breach responsibilities, conflict resolution, and consequences of misuse. The Council of State Governments emphasizes education as crucial for successful interstate compacts on PDMPs and data sharing. The success of interstate compacts on PDMPs and data sharing relies on education, funding, security, access, and technology. Efforts are ongoing to facilitate information sharing using the PMIX program, which aims to enable effective data sharing among various partners. The PMIX program facilitates interstate exchange of PDMP information to identify prescription drug abuse. States can participate if they have legislation allowing real-time patient information sharing, established partnerships, and use the NIEM infrastructure. The PMIX program, based on the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM), facilitates secure interstate exchange of PDMP data through encrypted hubs. With support from the pharmaceutical industry, NABP developed InterConnect for interstate sharing, compliant with PMIX architecture. Federal legislation authorizes HHS Secretary to develop interoperability standards for PDMP information sharing. The HHS Secretary was required to develop recommendations on interoperability standards for interstate information exchange by states with federal grants for PDMPs. The report recommended that states ensure access to PDMP data for healthcare providers and increase the use of PDMPs. It also suggested implementing interoperability standards to enhance information exchange. The HHS report recommended that state PDMPs implement interoperability standards to support information exchange. Federal grant funds have been used to improve interstate information sharing between states, with successful projects in nine states from FY2012 to FY2016. One key concern for pharmacies and dispensaries is ensuring they report prescription data to the program. Consequences for failure to report data vary by state, including disciplinary action or referral to law enforcement. PDMP expenses cover startup costs, operational funds, and enhancing program interoperability with hardware and software. The costs associated with establishing and maintaining Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) vary widely, with program startup costs ranging from $450,000 to over $1.5 million. Annual operating costs range from $125,000 to nearly $1.0 million, with an average annual cost of about $500,000. Cost variations are influenced by factors such as the frequency of data collection, the use of third-party vendors, and the number of operational PDMPs. The costs of establishing and maintaining Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) vary widely, with program startup costs ranging from $450,000 to over $1.5 million. Annual operating costs range from $125,000 to nearly $1.0 million, with an average annual cost of about $500,000. Factors influencing cost variations include the frequency of data collection, use of third-party vendors, and the number of operational PDMPs. A 2002 Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluation of PDMP costs in Kentucky, Nevada, and Utah revealed findings similar to those presented by the Maryland Advisory Council, highlighting differences in PDMP systems, pharmacies reporting data, and practitioners seeking information. States finance PDMPs through various channels, including the state general fund, prescriber, and pharmacy contributions. PDMP financing involves monies from various sources such as state general funds, licensing fees, controlled substance registration fees, health insurers' fees, grants, and donations. Each state's PDMP authorizing legislation outlines guidelines for funding. For example, Oregon's PDMP receives funds from medical provider fees and other sources. Some states have restrictions on funding sources. The Florida PDMP receives funding from the Florida PDMP Foundation, federal grants, and private grants. Research suggests PDMPs are effective for law enforcement and healthcare, but more research is needed. Experts believe PDMPs have the potential to be more effective. The implementation of PDMPs led to significant decreases in investigation time for alleged doctor shoppers in Kentucky, Nevada, and Utah. While this decrease in time does not necessarily mean less prescription drug abuse, research shows that PDMPs can reduce \"doctor shopping,\" change prescribing behavior, and decrease prescription drug abuse. The study found that PDMPs can change prescriber behavior, reduce the supply of prescription pain relievers and stimulants, and decrease the likelihood of abuse. Evidence suggests that PDMPs are effective in improving clinical decision-making, reducing doctor shopping, and curbing prescription drug abuse. The University of Kentucky Institute for Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy studied the effectiveness of mandatory enrollment in PDMPs in Kentucky, noting closures of non-physician-owned pain management facilities and a decrease in doctor shopping. Recent articles also support PDMPs, showing a reduction in opioid-related overdose deaths and a decrease in Schedule II opioid prescriptions and Medicaid spending in states with monitoring mandates. Research shows that PDMPs may have positive effects beyond their intended purpose, such as identifying patients at risk of harmful drug interactions and enabling monitoring of DEA numbers for prescription forgery. Limited research on PDMP effectiveness is hindered by challenges in conducting high-quality studies. Challenges in researching PDMP effectiveness include defining effectiveness, accounting for program differences, and considering confounding factors. Researchers measure outcomes like controlled substance shipments, benzodiazepine use, opioid consumption, substance abuse treatment admissions, and drug overdose mortality. Opioid consumption as an outcome measure has limitations due to including both medical and nonmedical use. Studies comparing states with and without PDMPs or before and after PDMP implementation vary in accounting for program differences, such as proactive versus reactive PDMPs and the drugs required to be reported. Research focuses on controlled substances with high abuse potential. Research on the effectiveness of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) focuses on controlled substances included in all PDMPs. Differences in PDMPs over time, such as transitioning from paper-based to electronic systems, may impact effectiveness. Studies need to account for these differences to understand factors influencing effectiveness. Researchers also face challenges in comparing outcomes across states and over time, such as variations in baseline rates of prescription drug abuse. The effectiveness of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) is difficult to assess due to various factors that can influence outcomes. Research suggests that while PDMPs may not directly reduce prescription drug abuse, proactive PDMPs can inhibit its rate of increase. However, other initiatives and external factors can also impact outcomes, making it challenging for researchers to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of PDMPs. Additionally, PDMPs may have unintended consequences, such as prescribers being hesitant to prescribe monitored medications due to concerns about scrutiny from authorities. Patients and prescribers may have concerns about using medications monitored by PDMPs, fearing scrutiny from authorities and potential limitations on access to needed medications. Patients may also worry about increased costs and changes in prescribing behavior. Patients and prescribers may have concerns about using medications monitored by PDMPs, fearing scrutiny from authorities and potential limitations on access to needed medications. State PDMPs may inadvertently push drug diversion activities across state lines, leading to the prioritization of interstate data sharing and interoperability. Additionally, there is a risk of an increase in the abuse of nonprescription opioids like heroin and illicit fentanyl due to state PDMP activities. Some experts link the rise in heroin abuse to the cost of prescription drugs and efforts to combat prescription drug abuse. PDMPs can help identify patients at risk of harmful drug interactions and detect prescription fraud. The PDMP Center of Excellence at Brandeis University has published best practices for PDMPs. The effectiveness of a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) depends on the quality of information and how it is used. Recommendations to enhance data quality include collecting real-time data at the point of sale, monitoring all prescribed controlled substances, and integrating electronic prescribing technology. To improve the effectiveness of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP), recommendations include collecting real-time data at the point of sale, monitoring all prescribed controlled substances, integrating electronic prescribing technology, sharing data between states, standardizing content, identifying the person picking up the prescription, and linking prescription records for individuals. Accessibility is crucial for PDMP information to be well-utilized. A survey found that prescribers cited time constraints, difficulty navigating web portals, and forgetting passwords as barriers to accessing PDMP information. Despite this, research suggests that PDMP information can influence prescribing practices. Experts recommend enhancing PDMP data use by providing easy online access, issuing automated reports, and increasing participation through education. They also suggest making PDMP information available for research and public health purposes, allowing access by designated nonprescribers. Washington state used PDMP information to select Medicaid enrollees for a program, resulting in decreased healthcare utilization and cost savings. The federal government supports state Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) through programs at the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Health and Human Services (HHS). DOJ administers the Harold Rogers Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, incorporated into the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Program in FY2017. HHS programs include NASPER, State Demonstration Grants for Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Response, Opioid Prevention in States grants, and various initiatives under the Office of. The Harold Rogers PDMP was a grant program administered by the DOJ to help analyze data on prescriptions for controlled substances. In FY2017, it was incorporated into the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program under CARA, assisting states in enhancing their PDMPs. The Harold Rogers PDMP, now part of the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program, assists states in improving their PDMPs by promoting collaboration among various stakeholders and offering training and technical assistance grants. Funding for the program began in FY2002 through federal appropriations. In FY2017, the Harold Rogers PDMP was incorporated into the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program with $14 million in funding. In FY2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $30 million for prescription drug monitoring. NASPER grants were last funded in FY2010 under the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act of 2005. The National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act of 2005 (NASPER) amended the Public Health Service Act to establish or improve Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) in states. NASPER aims to identify patients at risk for addiction and provide interventions. Funding for NASPER was authorized for FY2006-FY2010 but has not been specifically appropriated since FY2010. The resolution for FY2011 prohibited funding for NASPER, and no funds have been appropriated for the program since FY2010. In FY2018, Congress directed the CDC to promote the use of PDMPs for opioid overdose prevention. States must meet requirements to be eligible for NASPER grant funding, with grants awarded noncompetitively based on a two-part formula. The NASPER program provided funding to states for PDMPs, with a base amount of 1% of total funding and the rest distributed based on the number of pharmacies. Thirteen states received grants in FY2010, but NASPER is no longer funded. HHS now supports state PDMPs through other programs, like CDC funding for PDO prevention activities. The CDC administers grants for opioid prevention activities, including PDMPs, through programs like Prevention for States (PfS) and Data-Driven Prevention Initiative (DDPI). These grants aim to improve access to PDMPs and the timeliness of PDMP data. The CDC administers grants for opioid prevention activities, including PfS and DDPI, to improve access to PDMPs and data timeliness. CDC has awarded DDPI funding to states and DC for opioid-related data collection, behavior change strategies, and overdose prevention programs. These grant programs are not explicitly authorized in statute, but fall under CDC's authority to provide assistance for injury prevention and control. Funding for PfS and DDPI grants was $72 million in FY2017 and FY2018. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) has been working on integrating PDMPs with health IT and improving clinician access to PDMP information through health IT. This includes pilot programs with SAMHSA from 2011 to 2013 and developing standards for sharing PDMP data with electronic health records and health information exchanges. Funding for these efforts has been directed since 2011 under general statutory authorities for ONC in Title XXX of the PHSA. The FY2016 and FY2017 ONC Congressional Budget Justifications requested $5 million each year for PDMP and Health IT integration efforts. Activities included technical assistance for state PDMPs, challenge awards for HIT access to PDMPs, and adoption of electronic prescribing of controlled substances. FY2018 and FY2019 budget justifications did not mention PDMP efforts specifically. State Demonstration Grants for Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Response were authorized in FY2017 by CARA. The HHS Secretary is required to award grants to states for an integrated opioid abuse response initiative, including improving PDMPs and other prevention and treatment efforts. Priority is given to states that meet certain conditions, such as sharing PDMP data. $5 million is authorized for state demonstration grants for FY2017-FY2021, but they were not funded in FY2017 and FY2018. State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis Grants were newly authorized by the 21st Century Cures Act. In response to the prescription drug abuse epidemic, the Obama Administration released an action plan in 2011. The plan focused on educating individuals on safe drug use, implementing PDMPs, developing drug disposal programs, and providing law enforcement with tools to enforce proper prescribing practices. $1 billion was allocated to SAMHSA in FY2018 for improving state prescription drug monitoring programs. The Obama Administration released an action plan in 2011 to address prescription drug abuse, focusing on education, PDMP implementation, drug disposal programs, and law enforcement tools. Specific actions to improve PDMP effectiveness include supporting NASPER reauthorization, enabling VA and DOD to share patient information with state PDMPs, and exploring reimbursement for prescribers checking PDMPs before writing controlled substance prescriptions. The Obama Administration released an action plan in 2011 to address prescription drug abuse, focusing on education, PDMP implementation, drug disposal programs, and law enforcement tools. Specific actions included using one doctor and one pharmacy, evaluating state PDMPs to reduce fraud, issuing a final rule on electronic prescribing, increasing use of \"Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment\" programs, and assessing the usefulness of various surveillance systems. The Obama Administration released a fact sheet in October 2015 outlining efforts to combat prescription drug abuse and heroin use, including prescriber training and improving access to treatment. Private sector efforts included enhancing access to PDMP data for physicians and pharmacists in several states. President Trump established the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis in 2017. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis issued recommendations to combat the opioid crisis, including supporting the Prescription Drug Monitoring Act to mandate states to comply with PDMP requirements and federal agencies to mandate PDMP checks. The Act would establish a data-sharing hub and potentially amend requirements under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The Act of 2017 (H.R. 1854; S. 778) would require states receiving PDMP grant funds to share their data with other states or face grant fund withholding. It also directs DOJ to establish an interstate data-sharing hub under the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program. Research shows PDMPs may reduce doctor shopping and prescription drug abuse, but effectiveness varies. Policymakers should assess federal efforts to reduce illicit prescribing activities. The Administration's efforts to reduce illicit prescribing activities and prescription drug abuse have been successful. Some stakeholders have concerns about the use of PDMP data for law enforcement purposes, with the American Medical Association recommending that PDMPs be housed in health-related agencies. Research has shown that PDMPs save time for law enforcement officials in investigations. The American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) express concerns about the use of PDMP data for non-healthcare purposes, emphasizing the need to protect privacy and data security. They recommend that PDMP information be treated with the same standards as other patient records. The DEA has demanded access to certain PDMP data without a court order or search warrant, causing controversy and court challenges. The CSA allows the DEA to issue administrative subpoenas to obtain relevant documents for investigations involving controlled substances. In 2012, the Oregon Department of Justice sued the DEA, arguing that a valid court order is required to access patient and physician records in the Oregon PDMP. The DEA has used administrative subpoenas to access PDMP data, leading to legal challenges. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the CSA preempts state laws requiring court orders for access. Utah also faced a similar situation where the DEA's subpoena power was upheld despite state laws requiring search warrants. Utah argued that the DEA's actions were not a valid exercise of national power under the Fourth Amendment. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the DEA's subpoena authority to access PDMP data is valid under the Fourth Amendment, despite state laws requiring search warrants. Concerns about patient privacy and timely access to medication remain regarding PDMPs. The potential deterrent effect on timely access to medication due to fears of sensitive health information being shared with PDMPs, which have varying security requirements regulated by state and federal laws. PDMPs receive protected health information from pharmacists and healthcare providers subject to HIPAA, with stricter privacy requirements for information from substance abuse facilities. The HIPAA Privacy Rule governs the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities and their business associates. The HIPAA Privacy Rule governs the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities and their business associates, allowing sharing for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations without individual authorization. Other uses and disclosures, like sharing with family members, require individual consent. Additionally, the rule recognizes national priority purposes for utilizing PHI beyond healthcare. The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows covered entities to disclose PHI for national priority purposes without individual authorization. PDMPs can receive PHI under certain exceptions, such as disclosures required by state laws or for public health activities. While PDMPs are not HIPAA covered entities, they are still subject to state privacy laws. The \"Part 2\" rule applies at the federal level to patient information in federally assisted substance abuse programs, allowing disclosure with consent but prohibiting re-disclosure without consent, which may deter submission to PDMPs. This restriction hinders sharing information about controlled substances for opioid addiction treatment, as programs fear unauthorized re-disclosures. The Obama Administration's 2011 action plan aimed to improve state PDMPs and enhance interstate information sharing. In 2013, HHS published a report on PDMP interoperability standards. In 2017, a presidential commission recommended DOJ funding for a \"data-sharing hub\" to share PDMP data. Attorney General Holder highlighted the link between prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse in 2014. The rise in heroin abuse may be linked to increased monitoring of prescription opioids, leading users to seek the cheaper and more accessible alternative. Policymakers are debating whether government actions unintentionally contributed to this issue and how to address it."
