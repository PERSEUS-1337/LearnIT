    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Indian Civil Rights Enforcement Act\". The Indian Civil Rights Enforcement Act was enacted to protect individuals interacting with tribal governments from civil rights abuses, including unfair dismissals, election irregularities, and misuse of law enforcement authority. However, enforcement of these rights has been hindered by tribal reluctance to waive immunity. Congress has considered the impediments to enforcing the Indian Civil Rights Act for over 10 years, and individuals have the opportunity to seek action in a US district court after exhausting remedies in tribal courts. Tribal immunity should be waived to provide this opportunity. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Defines key terms related to Indian tribes and tribal organizations. SEC. 4. INDIAN CIVIL RIGHTS ACT ENFORCEMENT. Amends Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 to include enforcement provisions. The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction over civil rights actions related to non-compliance with rights secured by the Indian Civil Rights Act. After exhausting tribal court remedies, an individual can sue an Indian tribe in a US district court for declaratory or equitable relief to enforce their rights under the Act. In civil actions related to non-compliance with rights secured by the Indian Civil Rights Act, district courts must consider findings of tribal courts unless certain conditions are met. The Indian Civil Rights Act requires district courts to consider tribal court findings in civil actions, unless specific conditions are met for de novo review. These conditions include failure to resolve factual disputes, inadequate factfinding procedures, lack of material facts development, or unfair factual determinations. The district court shall conduct a de novo review of the allegations in the complaint if subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), or (H) applies. Waiver of tribal immunity is allowed to enforce the Indian Civil Rights Act."
