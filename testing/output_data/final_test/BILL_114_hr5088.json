    "content": "The Act titled \"Promoting Integrity in Medicare Act of 2016\" or \"PIMA of 2016\" aims to promote integrity in Medicare. The \"Promoting Integrity in Medicare Act of 2016\" found that financial incentives led to increased self-referrals in advanced diagnostic imaging and anatomic pathology, costing Medicare millions in 2010. The GAO found that self-referral in radiation oncology led to a 356 percent increase in intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) utilization, resulting in higher costs for Medicare and beneficiaries. In physical therapy, self-referring providers increased referrals at a higher rate compared to non-self-referring providers. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) highlighted concerns about physician self-referral of ancillary services, leading to increased volume and financial burden on Medicare. The President's Fiscal Year 2017 Budget proposed removing certain services from the in-office ancillary services exception to the Stark Law, aiming to save $4.98 billion over 10 years. The President's Fiscal Year 2017 Budget proposed changes to the in-office ancillary services exception to the Stark Law, aiming to save $4.98 billion over 10 years. The IOAS exception allows physicians to provide ancillary services in their offices for better diagnosis and treatment decisions during the initial office visit. It is important to differentiate between services covered by the exception, such as routine clinical laboratory services, and other health care services. According to studies, a small percentage of imaging scans are done on the same day as the initial office visit. Urologists' self-referrals for pathology services have led to increased volume billed and lower prostate cancer detection rates. An increase in pathology specimen units billed to Medicare has been observed, specifically for CPT Code 88305. According to a 2013 American Academy of Dermatology Pathology Billing paper, arrangements involving the split of anatomic pathology services among different providers may endanger patient safety. In November 2012, Bloomberg News reported on California prostate cancer patients treated by a urology clinic that owns radiation therapy equipment, highlighting the detrimental impact of physician self-referral on patient care and healthcare costs. The Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and the Baltimore Sun have published investigations showing that urology groups owning radiation therapy machines have high utilization rates for prostate cancer treatment. A 2010 MedPAC report revealed low rates of outpatient physical therapy services provided in conjunction with office visits, indicating a lack of patient convenience and unnecessary costs. Services covered under the IOAS are intended to be included. The legislation does not affect services covered under the IOAS exception or the ownership exception for rural providers in the \"Stark\" rule. The Act aims to maintain the in-office ancillary services exception by removing certain complex services, protect patients from financial incentives, save Medicare resources, and achieve its purposes without altering existing regulations.
