    "content": "The Act titled \"Investing in Neighborhood-focused, Vital, Evidence-based Strategies and Trust to Prevent Crime Act of 2016\" or the \"INVEST to Prevent Crime Act\" establishes a Demonstration Grant Program under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. This program includes definitions for key terms. The \"INVEST to Prevent Crime Act\" defines key terms such as 'crime hot spot' as a high-crime area, 'eligible entity' as a member of a community consortium, and 'evidence-based practice' as a proven program. The term 'evidence-based practice' is defined as a program, strategy, or procedure proven effective through outcome evaluations. Other key terms defined include 'Indian tribe', 'tribal organization', 'institution of higher education', 'State', and 'target neighborhood'. The term 'unit of local government' is defined as a general government entity below the State level, while 'target neighborhood' refers to a specific geographic area focused on in a project funded by a grant. \"SEC. 3032. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\" The Attorney General can provide grants for local and tribal communities to enhance their crime-fighting capacity through collaborative approaches. Projects funded should target neighborhoods with crime challenges, use evidence-based practices, and involve residents and stakeholders. The Attorney General offers grants to local and tribal communities to improve crime-fighting efforts in targeted neighborhoods. Eligible entities must submit applications for planning or implementation grants, and can apply for both simultaneously. Collaboration with residents, stakeholders, and cross-sector partnerships is encouraged to address crime problems comprehensively. An applicant for a grant under this section must identify a research partner, such as an institution of higher education or research center, to conduct a detailed crime analysis and assist in selecting evidence-based practices. The research partner must remain engaged throughout the grant duration. The grant recipient must use a planning grant for up to 12 months and an implementation grant for up to 36 months, with the possibility of extensions upon request to the Attorney General. The Attorney General determines the length of time for a grant extension and may not award additional funds if an extension is allowed. Planning grants can be used to identify crime hot spots, build community partnerships, collaborate with law enforcement, and assess community needs and resources. Implementation grants for a project can be used to convene meetings, assess project implementation, modify strategies, support personnel and program costs, engage the community, and develop a sustainable strategy. The project's implementation grants can be used to develop a long-term sustainable strategy for achieving goals beyond the implementation period. The Attorney General must submit an annual report to Congress on the outcomes of funded demonstration projects. Grant accountability measures are also outlined. The Attorney General's grants are subject to strict accountability provisions, including audit requirements by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to address unresolved audit findings related to unauthorized expenditures or unallowable costs. The Inspector General of the Department of Justice conducts audits of grant recipients to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of funds. Recipients with unresolved audit findings are ineligible for grant funds for the first 2 fiscal years. Priority is given to eligible applicants without unresolved issues. Eligible applicants must not have unresolved audit findings in the 3 fiscal years before applying for a grant. If an entity is awarded funds while barred from receiving grants, the Attorney General will deposit the improperly awarded amount into the Treasury and seek repayment from the grant recipient. Nonprofit organizations awarded grant funds must meet specific requirements, including being described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and not holding money in offshore accounts to avoid taxes. Nonprofit organizations awarded grants must disclose compensation details for officers, directors, trustees, and key employees to the Attorney General. The information must include the process for determining compensation, independent reviewers, comparability data, and deliberation substantiation. The Attorney General can make this information available for public inspection upon request. The Department of Justice prohibits the use of funds exceeding $20,000 for conferences without prior written approval. Approval must include a cost estimate for all conference expenses. The Deputy Attorney General must report annually to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on approved conference expenditures, including food, beverages, equipment, speakers' honoraria, and entertainment. The Attorney General must also provide annual certification to the Senate and House Judiciary and Appropriations Committees regarding conference expenses. The Attorney General must provide annual certification to the Senate and House Judiciary and Appropriations Committees, indicating completion of audits, issuance of mandatory exclusions, reimbursements made, and listing grant recipients excluded from the previous year before awarding grants. The Attorney General must compare potential grant awards to avoid duplicate grants for the same purpose. If duplicate grants are awarded, a report must be submitted to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees listing the grants and the reasons for awarding them. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to authorize $20,000,000 for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 for activities under part MM."
