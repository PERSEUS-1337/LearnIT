Certified rehabilitation is defined as per section 47(c)(2)(C) and includes certifications from State Historic Preservation Officers or approved local governments.

Expenditures related to the exterior of buildings containing cooperative or condominium units are allocated based on percentages. The rehabilitation tax credit applies to certified historic structures used as the taxpayer's principal residence. Expenditures for the exterior of buildings with cooperative or condominium units are allocated proportionately to each unit. Excess credit can be carried back or forward to other taxable years. The unused credit from preceding or succeeding taxable years can be added to the credit allowable for the current year, subject to limitations. The amount carried over each year is subject to rules similar to section 39(a)(2). The unused credit taken into account for any taxable year cannot exceed the difference between the tax limit for that year and the sum of the credit allowable for that year without considering this provision.

Regulations under paragraph (2) shall include a rule similar to section 50(a)(2) regarding recapture if property no longer qualifies for progress expenditures. The taxpayer can receive a credit for the purchase of a rehabilitated historic home, treating the seller's expenditures as their own if they would qualify as rehabilitation expenditures.

The taxpayer must also be provided with necessary information to determine the credit. If the taxpayer disposes of the rehabilitated building or it ceases to be their primary residence or a certified historic structure within 5 years, the tax for that year will increase by a recapture percentage of the credit allowed for prior years. The recapture percentage for disposing of a rehabilitated building or ceasing to use it as a primary residence within 5 years is determined according to specific criteria outlined in the tax code. Transfer between spouses or incident to divorce is also subject to certain provisions. Transfer between spouses or incident to divorce exempts certain provisions under the tax code.
