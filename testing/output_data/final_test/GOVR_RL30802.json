Their purpose is to provide trained units and personnel for active duty during war or national emergencies. The National Guard also has a state role in responding to domestic emergencies. The Reserve Component (RC) includes seven reserve components of the Armed Forces: Army National Guard, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. Their purpose is to provide trained units and personnel for active duty during war or national emergencies. All individual reservists, whether members of the Reserve or the National Guard, are assigned to one of three major reserve categories: the Ready Reserve, the Standby Reserve, or the Retired Reserve. Reservists in the Ready Reserve may be called to active duty before those in the Standby Reserve or Retired Reserve. The Ready Reserve consists of the Selected Reserve, the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), and the Inactive National Guard (ING). The Selected Reserve within the National Guard and Ready Reserve is essential for initial wartime missions, requiring members to train one weekend a month and two weeks a year. They can be involuntarily called to active duty under various activation authorities. The Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) is a manpower pool of individuals with military training who may be required to perform regular training but are not currently mandated to do so. They can volunteer for training or active duty and may be involuntarily ordered to active duty under different activation authorities. There is also a category within the IRR that can be activated during a Presidential Reserve Call-up, although no one is currently assigned to this category. The Inactive National Guard (ING) is the National Guard equivalent of the IRR, comprising inactive Army National Guard members who are attached to a specific unit and required to meet once a year. They can be called to active duty during a Partial Mobilization or Full Mobilization but not under a Presidential Reserve Call-up. The Standby Reserve includes individuals with temporary disabilities or key defense positions in civilian jobs. Reservists in this category are not required to participate in military training and may only be involuntarily activated in the case of a full mobilization. The Retired Reserve consists of reserve officers and enlisted personnel receiving retired pay, with some transferring before age 60 to qualify for retirement benefits. Regular officers and enlisted personnel receiving retired pay are not part of the Retired Reserve. As of July 31, 2018, the total reported personnel strength of the Ready Reserve was 1,036,644, with breakdown by service and category. There are about 13,000 members in the Standby Reserve and 780,000 in the Retired Reserve, who are less likely to be mobilized. A substantial percentage of the Retired Reserve may be unable to mobilize due to age and fitness. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserve declined by about 6% between 2001 and 2018, with the largest reduction in the Navy Reserve. Reserve units are primarily filled by traditional reservists who work one weekend a month and two weeks a year, but also have full-time support personnel. FTS personnel, including Active Guard & Reserve, Military Technicians, Non-Dual Status Technicians, Active Component, and Civilian, are responsible for various functions to support operational missions. The mix of FTS personnel in reserve components aims to enhance mission readiness. Table 2 outlines FTS personnel strength by service and category. Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) personnel are on active duty or full-time National Guard duty orders for 180 consecutive days or more. They perform various duties related to organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, and training reserve components. AGR personnel are considered members of the Selected Reserve and are required to attend weekend drills and annual training with their assigned unit. They may also provide training to active component personnel, DOD contractors, DOD civilians, and foreign military personnel. Depending on their branch of service, AGR personnel are referred to by different names such as AGRs in the Army National Guard, Army Reserve, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve, and TARs in the Navy Reserve. Military technicians (MTs) are federal civilian employees who support reserve units by organizing, administering, instructing, and maintaining equipment. They may also provide training to various personnel and are required to maintain membership in the Selected Reserve, attending weekend drills and annual training with their unit. Military technicians (MTs) are federal civilian employees who support reserve units by organizing, administering, instructing, and maintaining equipment. They are required to attend weekend drills and annual training with their reserve unit. Non-dual status technicians (NDSTs) are civilian employees serving in military technician positions but do not have a dual military/civilian status like MTs and cannot be ordered to active duty. The number of NDSTs in the Army Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and National Guard is capped by law. Active Component (AC) personnel are active-duty members of the military who provide support to Reserve Component units. Civilians are federal employees who support the Reserve Component but are not required to be members of the Selected Reserve. They cannot be involuntarily ordered to active duty unless they are part of the reserve component. The Reserves consist of five purely federal entities, while the National Guard includes two reserve components that are both federal and state entities. The Reserves were established in the 20th century under Congress's authority to raise and support Armies and maintain a Navy. The National Guard, with a longer historical background, is both a state and federal organization, consisting of 54 separate entities. Unlike the Reserves, which are solely federal, the National Guard operates as state or territorial organizations most of the time. The National Guard consists of 54 separate state or territorial organizations, each controlled by its governor. National Guardsmen can be called to duty in various ways, affecting their pay, benefits, and legal protections. Charles Cragin noted the evolving role of reserve forces in the US. During the Cold War era, reserve components were rarely activated, with reservists being involuntarily activated for federal service only four times from 1945 to 1989. These activations occurred during wartime and national emergencies, such as the Korean War, the Berlin Crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Vietnam War/USS Pueblo Crisis. Since September 11th, reserve mobilization has increased significantly, with reservists now playing a vital role on a day-to-day basis around the world. Since the end of the Cold War, the nation has relied more heavily on reserve components. Reservists have been involuntarily activated for federal service six times over the past 28 years, with the largest activation since World War II initiated shortly after the 9/11 attacks. Activations have been related to war or armed conflict, such as the Persian Gulf War, conflict with Iraq, and military operations post-9/11. Other activations have been in support of primarily peacekeeping missions. Since the end of the Cold War, reservists have been involuntarily activated for federal service six times, with the largest activation post-9/11. Activations have been related to war, armed conflict, and peacekeeping missions, such as in Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo. The tally only includes instances of involuntary activation, not voluntary or state-authorized service. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (OASD/M&RA) data shows the increasing contribution of reservists to federal missions. Reservists provided about 1 million duty-days per year between 1986 and 1989, which rose to 13 million duty-days per year between 1996 and 2001. After 9/11, reservists contributed 41.3 million days in FY2002, peaking at 68.3 million days in FY2005. This number decreased to 17.3 million days by FY2014, still significantly higher than before. The Reserve Component has seen a significant increase in activity since the Cold War era, with reservists playing a more integrated role in military operations. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the military for civilian law enforcement without proper authorization. The Posse Comitatus Act restricts military involvement in law enforcement, but there are exceptions. Congress has authorized the President to use military forces to suppress insurrections and domestic violence. The Coast Guard has broad law enforcement authority, allowing the Coast Guard Reserve to participate in enforcing federal laws. The National Guard, when acting as the organized militia of a state, is not covered by the Posse Comitatus Act. It can be used by state authorities for law enforcement purposes, such as riot control and counter-drug activities. The National Guard has been utilized for security measures after 9/11 and disaster relief missions after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Selected Reserve members receive pay and benefits similar to active duty personnel when on federal active duty for over 30 days. For shorter periods, they receive most but not all of the same benefits. Reservists in other categories and National Guard members have different pay and benefits. Selected Reserve members typically work one weekend a month for training. Reservists work one weekend a month and two weeks per year for training. They are paid based on rank and years of service, receiving one day of basic pay for each day of duty during annual training. During inactive duty for training, they receive one day of basic pay for each unit training assembly attended. Reservists receive the equivalent of four days of basic pay for each two-day drill weekend, totaling 62 days of pay for 38 days of work in a typical year. They may also be eligible for special and incentive pays for hazardous duty, certain assignments, or specific skills, with pro-rated amounts during annual training. Reservists may receive special and incentive pays during Inactive Duty Training (IDT) and Annual Training (AT), including a clothing allowance and housing and subsistence allowances. Reserve officers receive a $400 clothing allowance at the start of their service, with an additional $200 if called to active duty for over 90 days. Reserve enlisted personnel are issued uniforms and may receive a clothing allowance if called to active duty. Reserve enlisted personnel are typically issued uniforms, shoes, boots, and insignia and may be eligible for a clothing allowance if required items are not provided. Non-activated reservists had limited access to TRICARE until 2004. Family members of reservists were not eligible for military medical care during IDT or AT, but became eligible if the reservist was ordered to active duty for more than 30 days. The 108th and 109th Congresses passed provisions for premium-based access to TRICARE for non-activated reservists and their families. Members of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve can enroll in the TRICARE Dental Program with an annual premium of $137 for Selected Reserve and $342 for Individual Ready Reserve, providing coverage for basic dental care procedures and orthodontic services. Members of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve can enroll in the TRICARE Dental Program with an annual premium. The program provides coverage for basic dental care procedures, orthodontic services, and oral surgery. Additionally, Selected Reserve members are eligible for life insurance under the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance program, with benefits including low cost, combat action coverage, and coverage for spouses and children. Selected Reserve members and their families also have access to subsidized military grocery stores. Reservists in the Selected Reserve earn retirement points through various activities like drills, annual training, and active duty. They become eligible for retirement after accumulating 20 years of qualifying service, with each year requiring at least 50 retirement points. Points can also be earned through military courses and funeral honors duty. After accumulating 77 retirement points from weekend drills and annual training, reservists can apply for retirement after 20 years of service. They are entitled to benefits such as military exchange access, commissary use, and space-available travel upon retirement. The retired pay eligibility age ranges from 50 to 60 years old. The retired reservist becomes eligible for retired pay between ages 50 and 60 based on the number of days of duty performed. At age 60, they receive benefits similar to active duty retirees, including space-available travel and military health care. Retired pay is calculated by totaling points earned over the years of service, then multiplied by a retirement benefit multiplier based on rank and years of service. The retired reservist becomes eligible for retired pay between ages 50 and 60 based on the number of days of duty performed. Retired pay is calculated by totaling points earned over the years of service, then multiplied by a retirement benefit multiplier based on rank and years of service. Reservists can be involuntarily ordered to active duty by the federal government for extended periods or for short periods to respond to disasters or emergencies. In times of war or national emergency, Title 10 U.S.C. allows for the involuntary activation of reserve components. Five authorities exist for calling up reservists, including Full Mobilization, Partial Mobilization, Presidential Reserve Call-up, Combatant Command Support Activation, and Disaster Response Activation. Each authority has specific requirements and durations for utilization. During national emergencies or wars, Title 10 U.S.C. allows for the involuntary activation of reserve components. Service Secretaries can authorize the activation of reservists for up to 24 consecutive months, with a limit of 1 million Ready Reserve members on active duty at any one time. This authority was used by President George H.W. Bush during the Persian Gulf War in 1991. During national emergencies or wars, Title 10 U.S.C. allows for the involuntary activation of reserve components. President George W. Bush invoked this authority after the September 11th attacks to mobilize reservists for various operations. Section 12304 permits the President to activate up to 200,000 members of the Selected Reserve and the Individual Ready Reserve for up to 365 consecutive days. The President can activate reservists under Title 10 U.S.C. Section 12304 without Congress approval, notifying them within 24 hours. This authority has been used during various conflicts and peacekeeping missions, but activated reservists cannot enforce federal authority or provide disaster response unless it involves weapons of mass destruction or terrorism. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 allows involuntary activations of Selected Reserve units for up to 365 days in support of a combatant command. The authority to activate reservists under this provision rests with the Service Secretary for preplanned missions, not for emergent operational or humanitarian missions. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 allows involuntary activations of Selected Reserve units for up to 365 days in support of a combatant command. This provision aims to enhance the use of reserve component units to support operational mission requirements to the same standards as active component units. The Services currently utilize this authority for various missions, including Kosovo, Multinational Force and Observers (Sinai), and air defense of the national capital region. Another provision in the Act allows the Secretary of Defense to order units and individuals of the Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, and Air Force Reserve to active duty for up to 120 days in response to a governor's request for federal assistance in major disasters or emergencies. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 allows involuntary activations of Selected Reserve units for up to 365 days in support of a combatant command. This provision enhances the use of reserve component units to support operational mission requirements. The Act also allows the Secretary of Defense to order units and individuals of the Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, and Air Force Reserve to active duty for up to 120 days in response to a governor's request for federal assistance in major disasters or emergencies. National Guard forces are not included in this authority, as state and territorial governors already have the ability to activate their National Guard forces and request support from other state and territorial National Guards under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact. The Coast Guard Reserve also has a short-term, disaster response activation authority. The provision specifies the appointment of a dual status commander when federal armed forces and the National Guard are employed simultaneously in support of civil authorities within the United States. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 allows involuntary activations of Selected Reserve units for up to 365 days in support of a combatant command. This provision enhances the use of reserve component units to support operational mission requirements. The Act also allows the Secretary of Defense to order units and individuals of the Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, and Air Force Reserve to active duty for up to 120 days in response to a governor's request for federal assistance in major disasters or emergencies. Members of the Retired Reserve can be involuntarily ordered to active duty in the case of a Full Mobilization. There is no limit on the number of retired reservists who can be called to active duty, and they may be kept on active duty for the duration of the war or emergency. Members of the Retired Reserve with at least 20 years of active duty can be involuntarily ordered to active duty by the Secretary of each military department. There are limits on the time they can serve and the number of officers recalled, except during times of war or national emergency. Reservists in certain operations are entitled to pay, benefits, and legal protections similar to active duty servicemembers. Reservists are entitled to various pays and allowances similar to active duty servicemembers, including Hazardous Duty Pay, Basic Allowance for Housing, and medical coverage for orders over 30 days. They can also access legal assistance, child care centers, and other support services. Reservists are entitled to various pays and allowances similar to active duty servicemembers, including Hazardous Duty Pay, Basic Allowance for Housing, and medical coverage for orders over 30 days. They can also access legal assistance, child care centers, and other support services. Reservists are protected by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act (SCRA), and the Military Lending Act (MLA). The status of reservists supporting Operation Noble Eagle varies, with some receiving federal pay, benefits, and legal protections identical to those serving in Operation Enduring Freedom, while others receive a different set of pay, benefits, and protections depending on their activation status. National Guard members can be called to active duty in federal or state status, with federal pay and benefits. When in federal service, they receive the same pay, benefits, and legal protections as other reservists. National Guard personnel can be called up by their governor for full-time duty in state active duty. They are state employees, not federal employees, and their pay and benefits are determined by state law. They are not eligible for federal protections but may be covered by state laws. State active duty missions include responding to disasters and civil disorders, as well as protecting critical infrastructure from potential terrorist attacks. National Guard personnel can be called up by their governor for full-time duty in state active duty, where they are state employees with pay and benefits determined by state law. They may also serve under Title 32 status, receiving federal pay and benefits for duties such as training and security missions. National Guard personnel can be called up by their governor for full-time duty in state active duty, where they are state employees with pay and benefits determined by state law. They may also serve under Title 32 status, receiving federal pay and benefits for duties such as training and security missions. Guardsmen called up under federal authority receive federal pay and benefits, with legal protections similar to federal service, but operate in a manner similar to state duty. Reservists become eligible for legal protections like the SCRA, USERRA, and MLA when called into active federal service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) of 1940 provides protections against evictions, foreclosures, insurance cancellations, and property seizures for those called to active duty. It also limits interest rates on pre-activation loans to 6%. National Guardsmen on Title 32 duty are covered by the SCRA in certain circumstances. Reservists' employment rights are protected under USERRA. USERRA protects reservists, including National Guard personnel on Title 32 duty, from discrimination in hiring, retention, and promotion. Employers must provide time off for military service without using vacation or annual leave. Reservists generally have the right to be reemployed after military service. Upon completion of military service, reservists are entitled to be reinstated by their civilian employer to a job comparable to the one they held before, with similar pay, status, and seniority. They also retain any additional seniority and benefits they would have earned if continuously employed. USERRA provides protection to reservists returning from military service, granting them seniority and benefits with their civilian employer. Reservists must notify their employer of upcoming military service and report back to work promptly after active duty. Failure to do so may jeopardize their right to reemployment. Reservists can address violations of their rights under USERRA by contacting their commanding officer for assistance. Reservists can address violations of their rights under USERRA by contacting their commanding officer, the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (NCESGR), or the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) for assistance. VETS has the power to investigate complaints and attempt to resolve them through negotiation or mediation, and may refer the case to the Department of Justice or the Office of Special Counsel if necessary. The Military Lending Act (MLA) was enacted to protect servicemembers from predatory lending practices by limiting terms for consumer credit, including a 36% Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR) cap. Servicemembers can seek assistance from the Office of Special Counsel or hire a private attorney to pursue claims in court or before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). Congress has implemented changes in Reserve Component pay and benefits post-9/11 attacks, including TRICARE benefits for non-activated reservists, new educational benefits for mobilized reservists, additional compensation for activated reservists, and reduced retirement age eligibility. National Guard and Reserves members on federal active duty for over 30 days are entitled to TRICARE medical benefits. Prior to 2004, non-activated reservists had limited access to TRICARE for themselves and no access for their families. In the 108th and 109th Congresses, provisions were passed to expand TRICARE access for non-activated reservists and their families. The TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) program was authorized in 2004, allowing most Selected Reserve members not on active duty to obtain coverage similar to TRICARE Standard and Extra by paying a premium. Premiums for TRS coverage are $46.09 per month for an individual reservist and $221.38 per month for the reservist and family members. Enhanced GI Bill-type educational benefits were also provided for reservists who have served in support roles. The Enhanced GI Bill-type educational benefits for reservists who have served in support of a contingency operation since September 11, 2001, include the Montgomery G.I. Bill-Active Duty (MGIB-AD) and the Montgomery G.I. Bill-Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR) programs. MGIB-AD requires three years of active duty and a $1,200 deduction, providing $1,994 per month for up to 36 months. MGIB-SR requires a six-year commitment with no contributions, providing $384 per month for up to 36 months. The MGIB-SR program offers $384 per month for up to 36 months, with no contribution required. Reservists who served less than 24 consecutive months were generally eligible for MGIB-SR until 2004 when the Reserve Educational Assistance Program was established. This program provides enhanced educational benefits to reservists called to active service in response to a war or national emergency. The Post\u20109/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act offers more generous educational benefits than REAP. REAP was limited by the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act and will terminate in 2019. Eligible reservists under REAP receive educational benefits based on their length of service. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides higher educational benefits than REAP, with varying benefit percentages based on service length. Reservists activated since September 11, 2001, receive greater benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill compared to MGIB-SR, MGIB-AD, or REAP programs. The Post-9/11 GI Bill calculates benefits based on individual educational costs, while REAP did not require reservists to contribute. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides higher educational benefits than REAP, with varying benefit percentages based on service length. Individuals eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill include those who have served at least 36 aggregate months on active duty after September 10, 2001, individuals with service-connected disabilities, and Purple Heart recipients. Reserve component personnel must meet specific activation authorities to qualify for benefits. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides educational benefits for individuals who have served at least 90 days but less than 36 months on active duty. The benefit includes payment for in-State tuition and fees, a housing stipend, and a $1,000 academic payment. The Post-9/11 GI Bill offers educational benefits including payment for in-State tuition, housing stipend, and a $1,000 academic payment. Additional benefits include coverage for books, supplies, equipment, tutorial assistance, relocation and travel assistance, licensure and certification tests, and transferability of benefits to spouse and children. Enhanced benefits are available for servicemembers with critical skills or additional service, and for those attending schools in the Yellow Ribbon G.I. Education Enhancement Program. The VA allows servicemembers to transfer benefits to spouse and children. Reservists mobilized after 9/11 face financial losses due to pay differences and expenses. Congressional interest has been sparked by complaints from mobilized reservists. The 109th Congress enacted a provision to provide special payments of up to $3,000 to certain reservists who experience income loss while involuntarily mobilized. Eligibility criteria include completing specific periods of active duty under an involuntary mobilization order. The compensation is based on the reservist's average monthly civilian income minus total monthly military compensation. The 111th Congress enacted a provision, codified at 5 U.S.C. 5538, to provide differential pay to federal government employees involuntarily ordered to active duty or retained on active duty. This payment equals the difference between a reservist's military pay and allowances and their civilian basic pay, with specific eligibility criteria outlined by the Office of Personnel Management. The provision for federal government employees on active duty entitles them to receive differential pay, which covers the difference between military pay and civilian basic pay. Qualifying service of 20 years allows reservists to apply for retirement, with recent legislative proposals aiming to lower the age for receiving retired pay and benefits. During the 110th Congress, a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 allowed certain reservists to receive retired pay at age 50, while access to military health care remained at age 60. The age for retired pay eligibility could be reduced by three months for every 90 days of specified duty performed after January 28, 2008. Specified duty includes various types of active duty. The minimum age for retired pay eligibility is 50, while retiree health care benefits eligibility remains at age 60. The law reduces the retirement age for reservists who perform qualifying duty after January 28, 2008, while retiree health care benefits eligibility remains at age 60 for certain reservists."
