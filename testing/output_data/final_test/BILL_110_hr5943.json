    "content": "The \"Nuclear Used Fuel Prize Act of 2008\" establishes definitions for terms like \"administering entity,\" \"Department,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Act also includes findings related to nuclear used fuel. The Congress finds that high energy costs hinder American economic progress and burden families. Nuclear energy is a safe, efficient, and affordable source of renewable energy for long-term independence. Despite safe storage of nuclear waste, the U.S. will have 70,000 tons by 2015. Building new nuclear reactors is essential for meeting electricity needs. The development of new nuclear reactors on existing sites can lead to more efficient management of used fuel and lower costs. Alternative storage facilities like Yucca Mountain could facilitate the cleanup of decommissioned reactor sites. Citizens and communities interested in these alternatives should be incentivized to move forward with their plans. Prize legislation has been successful in promoting these initiatives. Prize legislation has been successful in promoting initiatives to solve difficult problems in the United States, including space travel and super-efficient vehicles. There is a need to establish a program of prize incentives for developing used nuclear fuel management plans. Prize legislation has been successful in promoting initiatives to solve difficult problems in the United States, including space travel and super-efficient vehicles. A program of prize incentives for developing used nuclear fuel management plans needs to be established. SEC. 4. PRIZE AUTHORITY. The Secretary will award cash prizes to advance nuclear used fuel storage research, development, and commercial application. Competitions will be advertised widely to encourage broad participation, with announcements made through the Federal Register. The Secretary will award cash prizes for nuclear used fuel storage research. A private entity may administer the competition, raising funds for prizes and advertising the competition. Criteria for selecting winners will focus on safe and effective fuel storage. The Secretary will determine the appropriate amount of awards for safe nuclear used fuel storage research, protect against unauthorized use of intellectual property, and develop rules with input from industry and citizens. Funding for prizes may come from Federal sources. The Secretary may use Federal funds, funds from the administering entity, grants, or donations for prizes under this Act. Special consideration cannot be given to private entities in exchange for donations. Prizes cannot be announced until all necessary funds are secured. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY.

To be eligible for the prize, entities must not represent a foreign government or a current proposal for a nuclear fuel storage facility. They must also propose the removal of used nuclear fuel until advanced fuel cycle facilities and a final repository are developed for disposal. SEC. 6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. The Federal Government will not claim intellectual property rights from participants in prize competitions authorized by this Act. However, it can negotiate licenses for the use of developed intellectual property. The Government may ensure that technologies awarded prizes are available for commercialization if recipients do not take steps for practical application. SEC. 7. WAIVER OF LIABILITY. SEC. 7. WAIVER OF LIABILITY.
