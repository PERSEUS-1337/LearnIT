    "content": "The \"Smaller Schools, Stronger Communities Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 by adding a new part focused on smaller schools. The \"Smaller Schools, Stronger Communities Act\" acknowledges a shift in educational thinking towards smaller, more personalized high schools that focus on student-centered programs and support services. The National Association of Secondary School Principals recommends a more student-centered approach for the 21st Century high school. The NAASP recommends restructuring high schools to limit enrollments to 600 students or less, creating a more intimate setting where students are not anonymous and their presence is acknowledged. This includes constructing new buildings or implementing \"school-within-school\" units to enhance the relationship between teachers and students by reducing the number of class changes students make each day. Research shows that smaller schools with fewer class changes and more teacher-student interaction lead to better educational outcomes and reduced inequities in student achievement. Smaller schools have higher attendance rates, better performance in core subjects, and increased student engagement. Research shows that smaller schools have higher attendance rates and greater participation in school activities. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds show the most achievement gains in smaller schools due to more equitable distribution of achievement levels. \"SEC. 10996. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\" The Secretary can provide challenge grants to local educational agencies to create smaller schools, considering student numbers and equitable distribution among urban and rural areas. Priority is given to agencies with a target attendance of not more than 600 students per high school. The Secretary may award up to $2,000,000 to local educational agencies for creating smaller schools with a limit of 600 students for high schools and 400 students for elementary or middle schools. Local educational agencies must apply to the Secretary for a grant to implement smaller school plans. The application must include a 5-year plan to reduce school sizes by creating 'schools within schools' or building new schools. The grant can be used for creating smaller schools with a limit of 600 students for high schools and 400 students for elementary or middle schools. Funds received under this part can be used for hiring staff, feasibility studies, and architectural fees for school facility design or remodeling. Other reasonable expenses are allowed, excluding costs directly related to renovating existing facilities or building new ones. Local educational agencies must report annually on fund usage. Authorization of appropriations includes $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, and $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2003."
