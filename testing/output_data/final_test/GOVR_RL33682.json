    "content": "The city of Sacramento is vulnerable to flooding due to its location at the confluence of the American and Sacramento Rivers. Flood damage reduction infrastructure like dams and levees have been built to mitigate risks. Efforts are ongoing to improve the reliability and capacity of existing infrastructure and to construct new flood damage reduction structures. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been studying flood damage reduction measures since 1987, including dam and levee improvements. Congress has funded specific measures, with a focus on Folsom Dam in Sacramento, a historically flood-prone area. The American River flows from the Sierra Nevada crest to Sacramento, where it meets the Sacramento River. Heavy rain can cause high flows on the American River, increasing flood risk in the area. To mitigate flood damage, levees and dams were built along both rivers. Levees line the American River for 17 miles, surrounding the Natomas Basin. Folsom Dam, authorized by Congress in 1944, regulates floodwaters by capturing inflows from the upper American River watershed. The dam was completed in 1956 and is now part of the Central Valley Project. A dam at the Auburn site on the American River was authorized in 1965 for water supply and flood control purposes. Construction began in 1965 but was halted in 1975 due to safety concerns. Some stakeholders still advocate for the construction of a dam at the Auburn site for flood management on the American River. Efforts to authorize construction of a dam on the American River for flood management have been unsuccessful in 1992, 1996, and 1999. Sacramento is updating flood hazard maps to meet the 1% threshold for the National Flood Insurance Program, facing a problem common to communities nationwide. Sacramento's flood risk is periodically reevaluated as factors change. Flood risk is evaluated periodically based on threat, consequence, and vulnerability factors. Engineers used various data and tools to design Folsom Dam to reduce Sacramento's vulnerability to flooding. The initial design was based on historic records but was adjusted to protect against a higher threat. In 1862, the design of Folsom Dam was adjusted to protect against a higher flood threat. Subsequent large storms in 1955, 1964, 1986, and 1996 exceeded previous rainfall records. The dam's protection level was lowered in 1961 to a 120-year event. In 1986 and 1996, floodwaters nearly reached the dam's capacity, leading to record outflows into the American River. The city narrowly avoided a major flood disaster in 1986 as the American River almost overtopped the levees. Operational errors during the flood were attributed to dam operation carelessness. Recent studies show the city's flood protection is below the 100-year level, indicating a greater than 1% annual flood probability. This revised estimate considers the vulnerability of levees and dams, with decreased confidence in levee reliability contributing to higher flood risk. Decreased confidence in levee reliability contributes to higher flood vulnerability estimates in Sacramento. Concerns raised about storm variability, climate change, and land use patterns increasing flood threat. Potential catastrophic impact from large storms. Previous estimate indicates $16 million in damages from a 400-year flood event. The 400-year flood in Sacramento could cause $16 billion in damages to various properties and infrastructure, leading to loss of lives. Efforts have been made since 1986 to reduce flood vulnerability, with projects authorized by Congress to improve flood protection around Sacramento and Folsom Dam. The Folsom Dam Raise project aims to increase flood protection for Sacramento to a 1 in 233-year flood. It involves construction of common features, dam modifications, and a permanent bridge. Non-federal partners include the State of California and the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency. Congress has authorized operational changes to Folsom Dam, such as forecast-based operations and variable storage. The Folsom Dam Raise project aims to enhance flood protection for Sacramento to a 1 in 233-year flood. It involves common features, dam modifications, and a permanent bridge. Operational changes to Folsom Dam, like forecast-based operations and variable storage, have been authorized by Congress. The Defense Appropriations Act of FY1993 and the Water Resources and Development Act of 1996 allow for the release of waters from Folsom Dam in anticipation of floodwaters. Structural modifications to flood control structures are the focus, with potential re-operation requiring congressional action. A feasibility study was authorized in 1987 after a reconnaissance study identified the need for additional flood protection in Sacramento. The feasibility study authorized in 1987 aimed to define flood risks and develop flood protection projects in the American River watershed. The 1991 Feasibility Report recommended a 508-foot dry dam at Auburn, CA, but Congress instead authorized levee improvements in the Natomas Basin in 1993. The Corps' 1996 Supplemental Report identified three flood prevention plans. The Corps' 1996 Supplemental Report identified three flood prevention plans for greater flood protection in the Sacramento region: the Folsom Modification Plan, the Stepped Release Plan, and the Detention Dam Plan at the Auburn site. The Folsom and Stepped Release Plans modified Folsom Dam's capacity, while the Auburn site plan called for a dry dam. The Auburn site plan offered the highest flood protection level, estimated at 400-year protection. The 1996 and 1999 WRDA levee improvements, known as the Common Features Project, included constructing cut-off walls to enhance flood protection in the Sacramento area and increase the river channel's conveyance capacity for larger releases from Folsom Dam during floods. The Folsom Dam Modification Project, authorized in WRDA 1999, aims to increase the dam's safe releases and storage capacity by expanding outlets and replacing gates. This project is expected to raise flood protection levels significantly. Additional studies were authorized to improve flood storage capacity, leading to the recommendation of the Folsom Dam Raise Plan in 2002. The Folsom Dam Raise Plan, authorized in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of FY2004, aims to raise the concrete part of Folsom Dam by approximately seven feet and raise the surrounding dikes. It also includes ecosystem restoration measures and construction of a permanent bridge below the dam. Construction has begun on some Common Features improvements but not on other authorized projects as of May 2006. The Corps has not started construction on some authorized projects, including the Natomas Basin levee improvements and the Dam Modification Project. The Folsom Dam Raise project, authorized in FY2004, aims to raise the concrete part of Folsom Dam by seven feet and includes ecosystem restoration measures. Private sector estimates for the Dam Modification Project were higher than expected, leading to a reevaluation by the Corps. The Folsom Dam Raise project is in the pre-construction stage, with the design scheduled until 2011 and construction from 2011 to 2017. The Folsom Bridge component is on an expedited schedule due to traffic congestion, aiming for completion by December 2008. Other options for flood control in Sacramento are being considered, but it is uncertain if Congress will authorize them. The Corps and Bureau of Reclamation are jointly evaluating alternatives for dam modifications to avoid delays in construction. The first report identified a 1,700-foot concrete auxiliary. The first PASS report identified a 1,700-foot concrete auxiliary spillway as the most promising option, with a lower cost and earlier completion date compared to other options. The Corps will determine whether to adopt this option when it issues its Post-Authorization Change Report in May 2007. The congressional debate over Sacramento flood protection includes discussions on Auburn Dam. Congress approved additional appropriations for an updated study on Auburn Dam in FY2006. The debate continues on whether to pursue a dry dam or a multi-purpose storage facility at the Auburn site. The current issue is finding a non-federal sponsor to share the project's cost. The debate over continuing construction on Auburn Dam or authorizing another dam at the Auburn site remains controversial due to its size, cost, environmental effects, and seismic history. Flood risk reduction in developed areas is a nationwide issue receiving increased attention post-Hurricane Katrina. The Folsom Dam plays a crucial role in protecting Sacramento from flooding, with recent federal authorization for major flood protection projects in the area. The Folsom Dam plays a crucial role in protecting Sacramento from flooding. Major flood protection projects include improvements to the American and Sacramento Rivers, Natomas Basin levees, and modifications to Folsom Dam's flood gates. Some projects are under construction or completed, while others are in the pre-construction stage with cost estimate setbacks. A plan for an auxiliary spillway to the south of Folsom Dam is being considered for faster implementation and reduced costs, pending official endorsement by the Corps. The Corps will suggest a revised course of action in their PAC Report due in December 2006. Congressional authorization may be needed for the auxiliary spillway alternative at Folsom Dam. Congress faces decisions on modifying authorization and appropriations for flood management improvements in the American River Basin. Options include considering cheaper alternatives like the auxiliary spillway or conducting a full review of Sacramento flood control policy, including unauthorized options like Auburn Dam."
