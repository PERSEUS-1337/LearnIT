The Act titled the \"Southern Utah Open OHV Areas Act\" defines key terms such as County (Washington County, Utah), Federal land (Bureau of Land Management-managed land in the County), Map (prepared by State of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration), Non-federal land (State land proposed for transfer to Federal), Public water agency (Washington County Water Conservancy District), and Secretary. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and \"State\" refers to the State of Utah. SEC. 3. EXCHANGE OF FEDERAL LAND AND NON-FEDERAL LAND. The Secretary must accept a State's offer to convey non-Federal land to the United States and then convey Federal land to the State. The exchange is subject to valid existing rights, and the title approval must be acceptable to both parties. Appraisals by independent appraisers determine the value of the lands to be exchanged. The appraisals for land exchange must be conducted by independent appraisers according to national standards. The appraisals need approval from the Secretary and the State. The State will be reimbursed 50% of the appraisal costs by the Secretary. The value of Federal and non-Federal land exchanged must be equal. In land exchanges, the value of Federal and non-Federal land must be equalized through various methods such as adjusting acreage, adding State land, or making a cash payment. (B) Surplus of non-federal land must be equalized in value with Federal land through acreage reduction or cash payment to the State. Non-Federal land conveyed to the Secretary is designated for off-highway vehicle use or other recreational activities that do not significantly impact off-highway vehicle use. SEC. 4. CONVEYANCE OF LAND TO WASHINGTON COUNTY, UTAH. The Secretary will convey land managed by the Bureau of Land Management to Washington County, Utah, depicted as \"Open OHV Areas\" on a map, without consideration and subject to valid existing rights. The legal description of the land will be finalized by the Secretary, who can correct minor errors in the map or legal description. The land conveyed to Washington County by the Secretary of the Bureau of Land Management will be available for public inspection and primarily used for off-highway vehicles or specific facilities. The County is responsible for survey and administrative costs related to the land transfer. The County must agree to pay administrative costs for the conveyance, release the United States from any liabilities related to past land use, and accept terms set by the Secretary. The Secretary will also establish water conveyance, recharge, and renewable energy corridor in accordance with laws. Prior to conveying the land, the applicable laws require issuing a 250-foot right-of-way for a water conveyance pipeline and a 150-foot right-of-way for solar and hydroelectric facilities. The Secretary will convey land for water storage facilities and renewable energy projects, following best management practices to minimize impacts on off-highway vehicle activities. The land will be used for the construction of a water storage facility named \"Hurricane Cliffs Afterbay\" and associated facilities. Additionally, a regional pipeline corridor named \"Sand Hollow Regional Pipeline Corridor\" will be established in accordance with environmental laws. Prior to conveying land for water storage facilities and renewable energy projects, the Secretary will issue a 200-foot right-of-way for a buried water conveyance pipeline to the public water agency. If the conveyed land ceases to be used for a public purpose, it may revert to the United States at the Secretary's discretion."
