Concerns arise over Sinclair's reach through shared services agreements, raising questions about its influence on advertising rates, information flow, and fees paid by cable companies. Sinclair Broadcast Group's proposed acquisition of Tribune Media Company for $6.6 billion is under review by the FCC and DOJ. The report includes details on the U.S. television industry, Sinclair's current status as one of the largest broadcast television groups, and key FCC actions related to broadcast station ownership. Sinclair Broadcast Group generated over $2.7 billion in revenues in 2016 and owns 173 television stations in 81 local markets, along with radio stations, broadcast networks, and the Tennis Channel. They are the largest producer of local news in the country and recently acquired 14 stations from Bonten Media Group. Sinclair Broadcast Group, a major media company, is awaiting approval for the Bonten transaction which would give them ownership of 187 television broadcast stations in 89 local markets. Tribune Media, on the other hand, owns 42 broadcast television stations, WGN America cable network, WGN radio station, and Tribune Studios. Both companies generate revenue through advertising and fees from cable and satellite operators. Television broadcasters earn revenue from advertising and retransmission consent fees. They seek greater scale through mergers and acquisitions to have leverage in the industry. Control of multiple stations can lead to higher advertising rates. In the broadcasting industry, owning multiple stations can lead to higher advertising rates and bargaining power with program owners. Consolidation among cable and satellite operators has also prompted broadcasters to merge for leverage in negotiations with MVPDs. For example, Sinclair briefly withheld permission for DISH to retransmit its broadcast signals during negotiations in 2015. Sinclair briefly withheld permission for DISH to retransmit its broadcast signals in 79 markets, putting DISH at a disadvantage. Broadcasters are losing viewers to online services like Netflix, impacting advertising and retransmission consent revenue. In the months before Sinclair's agreement to buy Tribune, the FCC reversed policies that could have blocked the merger. One policy change was procedural, while the other two related to how the FCC attributes broadcast TV station ownership. The FCC conducted an auction in 2016 where station licensees could bid to modify their spectrum usage rights. Starting January 12, 2016, stations were in a \"quiet period\" where they couldn't discuss bidding strategies. After an auction in 2016, the FCC imposed a quiet period on broadcast stations to prevent them from communicating bidding strategies. The FCC lifted the quiet period in March 2017, allowing stations to negotiate mergers and acquisitions. The FCC closely scrutinized transactions involving \"sidecar\" agreements, but rescinded this guidance in February 2017, reducing the level of scrutiny. The FCC rescinded guidance in February 2017, reducing scrutiny on transactions like Sinclair's purchases of Bonten and Tribune Media. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, capped a single company's TV station reach at 39% of US households. Congress exempted this cap from FCC's media ownership rules review every four years. An FCC rule discounted UHF band station reach by half due to signal limitations. The FCC eliminated the UHF discount in November 2016, which had previously discounted UHF band station reach by half due to signal limitations. This decision came after the transition from analog to digital broadcasting, giving UHF stations a technological advantage over VHF stations. After the FCC reinstated the UHF discount in April 2017, Sinclair's proposed purchase of Tribune Media would violate the ownership cap without it. Both the FCC and an antitrust agency must approve the purchase before it can close, with reports indicating that the DOJ is reviewing the transaction under the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914. The DOJ has the burden of proof to show anticompetitive concerns in media transactions. Options include allowing the deal, negotiating a consent agreement, or seeking a court injunction. Information gathered in reviews may be shared with Congress but not the public. FCC approval is required for broadcast station license transfers. The FCC's commissioners review transactions that raise complex legal or public interest issues. Routine transactions are handled by FCC staff, while novel matters are referred to the full commission. Recent multibillion-dollar deals were reviewed by the FCC's Media Bureau staff. Three FCC commissioners expressed their views on these transactions. The FCC commissioners review complex transactions, while routine ones are handled by staff. Three commissioners expressed desire for more input in decisions made by agency staff. The Media Bureau may review Sinclair's acquisition of Tribune Media. The FCC conducts a three-part test for broadcast license transfers to assess compliance with laws and public interest benefits. The FCC reviews complex transactions to ensure public interest benefits, such as promoting competition and diversity in information sources. The FCC's review process differs from that of the DOJ, with a focus on enhancing competition and requiring applicants to prove the transaction serves the public. The FCC reviews transactions to ensure public interest benefits like promoting competition and diversity in information sources. The FCC examines if the Sinclair-Tribune Media transaction complies with local media ownership rules to promote diversity, localism, and competition. The U.S. Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of diverse and antagonistic sources for the welfare of the public. The FCC considers diverse information sources essential for public welfare and promoting First Amendment values. Localism ensures broadcast stations serve their communities with diverse news programming. Competition analysis by the FCC focuses on commercial incentives for diverse programming, unlike antitrust authorities who consider advertising prices. Section 202(h) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 guides these evaluations. The FCC reviews media ownership rules every four years to determine public interest and competition. Local radio ownership rules limit ownership within a single market defined by Nielsen. Radio markets, called \"Metros,\" correspond to metropolitan statistical areas but may have exceptions. Sinclair's ownership of radio stations in the Seattle and Chicago markets falls within FCC limits. The acquisition of Tribune Media would give Sinclair control of WGN-AM in Chicago, but it would not affect the Seattle radio market. The radio/television cross-ownership rules limit ownership of broadcast stations in the same geographic area. The FCC's cross-ownership rules allow entities to own up to four radio stations and two television stations in a market, as long as 10 independently owned media outlets remain. Sinclair's potential purchase of Tribune's stations in Chicago and Seattle complies with these rules, promoting diversity of viewpoints. The FCC's review of Sinclair's acquisition of Tribune's stations may lead to different conclusions on the need to divest or swap stations, based on media ownership rules and competition concerns. The FCC's local television ownership rules allow an entity to own or control two TV stations in the same market as long as signal overlap is limited and it doesn't violate the \"top four/eight voices test\". Sinclair's acquisition of Tribune's stations in Washington, DC, and Milwaukee would comply with duopoly rules. Tribune's WDCW station in DC is not among the top four in the market. Sinclair already owns two stations in Milwaukee. Sinclair's acquisition of Tribune's stations in Washington, DC, and Milwaukee would comply with FCC duopoly rules. Sinclair already owns two television stations in Milwaukee, one of which, WCGV-TV, will go off the air. Sinclair is seeking a temporary waiver of the duopoly rules until WCGV ceases broadcasting. In the Seattle-Tacoma market, Sinclair and Tribune each own two stations, requiring Sinclair to divest two stations to comply with ownership regulations. In 10 markets where Sinclair owns stations, FCC rules would prevent the purchase of Tribune stations without divestitures. Sinclair's proposed acquisition of Tribune's stations would result in ownership of multiple stations in various markets. Sinclair would own a total of four stations in Seattle-Tacoma, WA; Salt Lake City, UT; and Oklahoma City, OK after the merger. In St. Louis, MO; Portland, OR; and Greensboro-High Point-Winston Salem, NC, Sinclair would own three stations. Additionally, Sinclair would own two stations in Harrisburg-Lancaster-Lebanon-York, PA; Grand Rapids-Kalamazoo-Battle Creek, MI; Richmond-Petersburg, VA; and Des Moines-Ames, IA. Sinclair's acquisition of Tribune would result in ownership of multiple stations in various markets. Sinclair would own two stations in Grand Rapids-Kalamazoo-Battle Creek, MI; Richmond-Petersburg, VA; and Des Moines-Ames, IA. Sinclair would have both CBS and FOX affiliates in three markets, and NBC and FOX affiliates in Des Moines-Ames. The FCC has attribution rules to identify relationships that could influence programming decisions, including Joint Sales Agreements (JSAs) allowing sales staff to sell advertising time on a separate station in the same market. In 2014, the FCC set rules for television Joint Sales Agreements (JSAs) limiting the sale of advertising time on a competing local station to 15%. Congress extended the compliance deadline to September 30, 2025. In August 2016, the FCC introduced new disclosure requirements for Shared Services Agreements (SSAs) among broadcast TV stations. SSAs would need to be filed in the online public inspection file, with the possibility of being deemed attributable in the future. The FCC introduced new disclosure requirements for Shared Services Agreements (SSAs) among broadcast TV stations in August 2016. While initially considering making SSAs attributable, the FCC later withdrew this request in January 2017. As part of Sinclair's acquisition of Tribune Media, Tribune's sidecar stations would become Sinclair's sidecar stations, allowing Sinclair to increase the number of stations it controls in certain television markets. Sinclair would assume agreements from Tribune in Norfolk-Portsmouth-Newport News, VA, and Wilkes Barre-Scranton-Hazleton, PA, for stations licensed to Dreamcatcher Broadcasting. Sinclair could operate Dreamcatcher's stations without violating FCC rules. In Salt Lake City, Sinclair would purchase a FOX affiliate from Tribune and could continue operating KENV-DT, an NBC affiliate, without FCC ownership regulation issues. The DOJ and FCC have different standards for reviewing broadcast television station transactions, especially regarding sidecars. The DOJ recommended scrutinizing agreements on a case-by-case basis to ensure they serve the public interest. In the case of Gannett Company Inc.'s acquisition of Belo Corporation, the FCC allowed Gannett to transfer stations to sidecar companies due to local media ownership rules. The DOJ and FCC have different standards for reviewing broadcast television station transactions, especially regarding sidecars. In the case of Nexstar Media Group Inc.'s acquisition of Media General Inc., local FCC media ownership rules precluded Nexstar from acquiring Media General's stations in seven television markets. The DOJ prohibited Nexstar from transferring the stations in those markets to sidecar stations. In the Sinclair-Tribune transaction, both the FCC and DOJ would likely review the impact of Sinclair's acquisition of Tribune's stations. The FCC and DOJ would review Sinclair's acquisition of Tribune's stations in 12 markets. FCC rules require Sinclair to divest stations in 10 markets, while DOJ will consider if divestitures to sidecar companies are permitted. FCC rules allow Sinclair to assume Tribune's sharing agreements in two markets. DOJ must determine if Sinclair's operational relationships with these stations would be anticompetitive. If divestitures are required, they would likely be in Salt Lake City, St. Louis, and Wilkes-Barre. Sinclair's acquisition of Tribune's stations in 12 markets is under review by the FCC and DOJ. Sinclair may need to divest stations in Salt Lake City, St. Louis, and Wilkes-Barre. Sinclair aims to broaden the definition of the advertising market to lower its post-transaction market share estimate and reduce the likelihood of divestitures. The FCC and DOJ also consider national media ownership rules in their evaluation. The FCC's reinstatement of the UHF discount allowed Sinclair to acquire Bonten Media and Tribune, giving them a national reach of 23.94% of U.S. television households. Including stations in Gainesville, FL, and Wilkes Barre-Scranton, Sinclair's reach exceeds the national ownership cap at 39.4%. With the UHF discount, Sinclair's national reach is 25.68%. Sinclair's national reach of 25.68% of U.S. television households would increase to 71.59% if it acquires Tribune's stations without divestitures. However, with the UHF discount, Sinclair's owned stations would have a reach of 45.29%, exceeding the 39% cap. Sinclair stated it would comply with FCC rules to obtain approval. If the rules change, Sinclair would amend its application. Including operated but not owned stations in Wilkes Barre-Scranton, PA, and owned but not operated station in Gainesville, FL, Sinclair's reach would be 72.1% without the UHF discount. Sinclair's reach without the UHF discount would be 72.1% of U.S. television households, and with the discount, it would be 47.04%. In a presentation to investors, Sinclair mentioned that the Bonten and Tribune transactions would give it \"72% household coverage across 108 markets.\" The FCC might consider various issues regarding Sinclair's proposed merger with Tribune, including potential changes to the national ownership cap. If the FCC were to revise the cap or attribute sidecar stations, Sinclair might need to sell its stations to third parties without prior business relationships. If the FCC chooses not to attribute sidecar stations, Sinclair could operate but not own stations. Sinclair's national ownership caps may allow operation but not ownership in additional markets. The DOJ could assess if Sinclair's broadcast operations could limit competition in advertising and negotiations, potentially requiring further divestitures. The FCC considers promoting diversity of information sources and localism in mergers. Sinclair presents benefits of the merger to the FCC, stating it would enhance their capabilities. Sinclair's application to the FCC highlights the potential increase in local news programming with the acquisition of stations. Critics argue that owning multiple stations in a market leads to repetitive news content, while broadcasters claim it allows for more local news coverage. The FCC will consider how Sinclair's ownership of stations aligns with goals of localism and diversity. Sinclair's internal policy requires stations to air centrally produced video segments, known as \"must runs,\" potentially limiting local news programming. Critics argue this hinders stations from addressing local community needs, while others believe Sinclair's national presence provides a different perspective from other media outlets. The DOJ and FCC will assess the impact of Sinclair's news operations post-merger, considering the unique role of broadcast television in delivering local news. The potential scale and scope of Sinclair's news operations post-merger will require a public interest review by the FCC, with the timing of the FCC's review of media ownership rules impacting any conditions imposed on Sinclair to complete the transaction."
