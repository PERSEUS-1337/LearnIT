    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Endangered Species Criminal and Civil Penalties Liability Reform Act\" and references the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Specific intent is required for penalties related to the taking of species. The Endangered Species Criminal and Civil Penalties Liability Reform Act amends Section 9 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to require specific intent for penalties related to the taking of species. It defines \"take\" as knowingly and intentionally performing acts that harm individual species or attempting to engage in such conduct. Additionally, the Act includes a requirement to provide notice and an opportunity to correct violations. Section 10 (16 U.S.C. 1540) is amended to include a provision for Notice and Opportunity To Correct Violation. A person will not be penalized for a violation of the Endangered Species Act if the activity was lawful and not intended to harm species, as long as they are given notice and have 30 days to correct the violation through mitigation or other means. The amended Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act allows for a Notice and Opportunity To Correct Violation, where individuals can avoid penalties for unintentional violations by taking corrective actions within 30 days, such as mitigation to restore the species to its previous status. The amended Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act now includes provisions in conservation plans where individuals in compliance with the plan cannot be required to undertake additional mitigation measures that involve payment or land use restrictions without their consent. SEC. 5 amends Section 11 of the Endangered Species Act to require knowledge of endangered or threatened status for enforcement actions. SEC. 6 introduces safe harbor agreements. Section 10 (16 U.S.C. 1539) is amended to allow the Secretary to enter into agreements with non-Federal persons for the conservation of endangered or threatened species by creating, restoring, or improving habitat. The agreements may permit the taking of species incidental to lawful activities. The Secretary can enter agreements with non-Federal persons to conserve endangered species by creating, restoring, or improving habitat. These agreements may allow incidental take of species as long as it does not fall below the baseline requirement mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the Secretary. The baseline maintains existing conditions for the species on the lands and waters covered by the agreement. The Secretary can provide financial assistance of up to $10,000 to private landowners for safe harbor agreements to conserve endangered species. Private landowners can receive grants under this paragraph for actions required by a permit issued under this Act or other Federal laws. These grants are additional to payments from programs like the Conservation Reserve Program, Wetlands Reserve Program, or Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program."
