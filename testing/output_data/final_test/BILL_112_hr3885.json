    "content": "The \"Farm Risk Abatement and Mitigation Election Act of 2012\" or the \"FRAME Act of 2012\" is introduced. It amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include Farm Risk Management Accounts under section 224. The \"FRAME Act of 2012\" allows qualified farmers to deduct cash payments made to a Farm Risk Management Account. The deduction is limited to the taxpayer's farming income, $50,000, or $500,000 minus previous contributions. A qualified farmer is defined as someone actively engaged in farming or ranching. The \"FRAME Act of 2012\" allows qualified farmers to deduct cash payments made to a Farm Risk Management Account, limited to farming income. A FRAME account is a trust created for qualified distributions, with specific requirements for contributions and trustee qualifications. The trust administrator must comply with the section's requirements, assets cannot be mixed with other property except in a common fund, and individual account balances are nonforfeitable. Qualified distributions from a FRAME account are defined as payments made to the account beneficiary when farm income falls below a certain threshold. The FRAME account allows qualified distributions to protect the solvency of the farm, procure revenue or crop insurance, and is limited to 4 accounts per farm. The account beneficiary is the individual for whom the account was established. The Secretary of Agriculture regulates the number of FRAME accounts per farm to prevent abuse through various means. Tax treatment rules similar to other sections apply, and the account beneficiary is the individual for whom it was established. Tax Treatment of FRAME accounts exempts them from taxation unless they cease to be FRAME accounts. If the account beneficiary stops farming or ranching, the accounts are terminated, and the balance is treated as distributed to the individual. Any distribution from a FRAME account, excluding rollover contributions, is taxable. Non-qualified distributions incur a 20% additional tax on the beneficiary. Exceptions apply for disability or death. Excess contributions to a FRAME account can be returned before the due date of the tax return if they exceed the limit for a taxable year. This exception does not apply if the beneficiary becomes disabled or dies. Individuals can return excess contributions to a retirement account before the tax return deadline, along with any net income earned from the excess contribution. The excess contribution refers to any non-deductible contribution. A rollover contribution from a FRAME account must meet specific requirements, including being paid into the beneficiary's account within 60 days. This rule does not apply if the amount was received by an individual from a FRAME account within the last year. During the 1-year period ending on the day of receipt, an individual must not have received any other amount from a FRAME account that was not included in their gross income. The transfer of an individual's interest in a FRAME account to their spouse or former spouse under a divorce or separation instrument is not taxable. After such a transfer, the interest will be treated as a FRAME account with the spouse as the beneficiary. Treatment after death of account beneficiary: If an individual becomes the designated beneficiary of a FRAME account upon the death of the account beneficiary, the account will be treated as if that individual were the beneficiary. In cases where someone else acquires the account beneficiary's interest due to death, the account will cease to exist. Upon the death of the account beneficiary, the FRAME account will cease to exist, and the fair market value of the assets will be included in the gross income of the beneficiary or estate. The trustee of a FRAME account may be required to report to the Secretary and the beneficiary on contributions, distributions, and other relevant matters. The reports must be filed and furnished as specified by the Secretary. A deduction for estate taxes is allowed for amounts included in gross income from the account. The deduction allowed by section 224 for FRAME accounts is included in the tax code, with specific provisions for excess contributions to these accounts. The term 'excess contribution' for FRAME accounts refers to the total amount contributed to the account that is not deductible under section 224, minus distributions and any excess over the maximum deductible amount. For FRAME accounts, any contribution distributed from the account under section 224(f)(3) is not considered contributed. An individual with a FRAME account is exempt from tax on prohibited transactions if the account ceases to exist. The text discusses amendments to the Internal Revenue Code related to FRAME accounts.
