    "content": "Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX) provides income support to former military personnel recently released from active duty. They are eligible for benefits similar to other unemployed workers, including Extended Benefit (EB) payments if available. The EUC08 program provided additional weeks of benefits until its termination in December 2013. Unlike regular unemployment compensation (UC) benefits, UCX benefits and EB are available for ex-servicemembers. UCX benefits and EB payments for ex-servicemembers are funded by the military service they were previously employed by, not state unemployment taxes. The military service reimburses the state for UCX benefits out of their operating budget, with funds flowing through the Unemployment Trust Fund. Former servicemembers may receive combined unemployment benefits (UC and UCX) based on military service and other employment. Only the portion of benefits attributable to military service is charged to the agency. In FY2015, $474 billion in benefits were distributed to former military personnel, all for UCX and EB benefits. Former servicemembers can apply for UCX benefits in any state, typically where they are seeking employment. Former servicemembers must meet the same criteria as civilian workers for UC benefit eligibility, with benefits varying by state. Military measurement of wages and time in service determine eligibility and benefit levels. Active military personnel cannot qualify for UCX or state UC benefits. Former servicemembers must have left military service under honorable conditions to qualify for benefits. Former servicemembers must meet civilian worker criteria for UC benefit eligibility, with benefits varying by state. UCX benefits are not payable if eligible for certain allowances or educational assistance. Student status may limit UC benefit eligibility in most states, including those receiving UCX benefits. Self-employed or sole-proprietor former servicemembers may qualify for UCX benefits. Table 1 shows total unemployment benefit expenditures for former military servicemembers from FY2000 to FY2015. Expenditures increased during the recession from 2009 to 2011. Most states require job search for UC benefits, excluding self-employed individuals. In 2007, $462 million in UCX benefits were paid to former servicemembers. By 2011, almost $1.9 billion of unemployment benefits were spent on former servicemembers, with over half ($948 million) on UCX and EB. In 2012, unemployment benefit expenditures for former servicemembers began to decline, partially due to changes in the EUC08 program. By FY2015, total UCX expenditures had dropped to $474 million. Treatment of civilian spouses who quit their employment due to a military transfer varies among states, with some states allowing UC benefits for the newly unemployed worker. Some state UC programs may not award benefits to workers who quit due to a spouse's transfer, deeming it a \"voluntary quit.\" Disqualifications may apply until the claimant returns to work or earns a specified amount. States recognize economic conditions may impact job availability, leading to time-limited disqualifications for quitting. Some states disqualify workers who quit due to a spouse's transfer as a \"voluntary quit,\" but market conditions can make them eligible for benefits. States have exceptions for workers following a transferred military spouse, impacting state unemployment taxes based on employer history with the UC system. Military service of business owners or employees can affect the tax rate certain employers face, potentially leading to higher state unemployment taxes. If workers quit to join a transferred military spouse and receive UC benefits, this could impact the overall state unemployment tax burden for all employers. For example, a business owner called up for active military service may need to lay off workers, leading to a potential increase in the business's state unemployment tax rate upon their return. Additionally, if a servicemember serves for less than two years, their UCX benefit may be based on nonmilitary work, potentially resulting in a state unemployment tax increase for their former civilian employers in some states. Former civilian employers may face a state unemployment tax increase if workers quit to accompany their military spouse and receive UC benefits. These benefits are charged to the state's account within the UTF, leading to a socialized cost passed on to employers. Some states have provisions to limit these tax increases, such as in Illinois where business owners called to active duty are not charged. Business owners called to active duty from the reserves and had to close their firms are not charged for increases in state unemployment tax rates. Senator Ron Johnson sponsored a law that altered conditions for individuals to receive UCX, including prohibiting concurrent receipt of UCX and Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 proposed changes to unemployment compensation for former servicemembers, including prohibiting concurrent receipt of benefits and doubling the required active duty days for reserve members to qualify for benefits. Senator John McCain sponsored a similar bill with identical provisions."
