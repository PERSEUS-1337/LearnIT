    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Elder Fall Prevention Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among people over 65, with a significant increase in the elderly population expected by 2030 and 2050. Falls among the elderly resulted in 10,200 deaths and 1,600,000 emergency department visits in 2000. Sixty percent of fall-related deaths occur in persons 75 and older, with a 25% mortality rate for elderly persons who sustain a hip fracture. Hospital admissions for hip fractures among the elderly have been increasing, with expectations to exceed 500,000 by 2040. The rate of fall-induced traumatic brain injuries for individuals aged 80 or older increased by 60% from 1989 to 1998. Annually, over 64,000 individuals over 65 sustain traumatic brain injuries from falls, with 40,000 visiting emergency departments, 16,000 hospitalized, and 4,000 dying. The estimated cost for non-fatal traumatic brain injury-related hospitalizations for falls in individuals over 65 is over $3.25 billion, with two-thirds of costs among those 75 or older. The costs of falls among elderly individuals, especially those 75 years and older, are increasing rapidly. Direct costs are projected to exceed $32 billion in 2020. The Federal Government should allocate more resources for research on fall prevention and treatment. A national approach involving various organizations and individuals is needed to reduce elder falls in different settings. Reducing preventable adverse events, such as elder falls, is crucial for improving patient safety among workers, architects, employers, and others. The Act aims to reduce elder falls through public education, expand services, and evaluate the impact on Medicare and Medicaid costs. Title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new part focused on the prevention of elder falls, specifically addressing public and professional education. The Secretary will oversee a national education campaign on reducing elder falls, provide grants for State-level coalitions, and fund organizations for elder fall prevention. The curr_chunk focuses on providing continued education to health and allied health professionals for geriatric fall prevention. The term 'allied health professionals' is defined in section 799B. The curr_chunk focuses on research related to geriatric fall prevention for health and allied health professionals. The Secretary shall conduct research to improve identification of elders at high risk of falls, data collection for fall risk factors, effective strategies to reduce falls, interventions to prevent elder falls, diagnosis and treatment of fall victims, and assess fall risk in different settings. The Secretary shall evaluate community programs for preventing assisted living and nursing home falls by elders, conduct research on elder fall prevention in healthcare settings, and ensure coordination of related activities. The Secretary will award grants to organizations for professional education in elder fall prevention, prioritizing self-sustaining projects. \"SEC. 399AA-2. DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.\" The Secretary will oversee and support demonstration and research projects in areas such as targeted elder-falls risk screening, referral programs, and fall prevention for high-risk individuals. The Secretary will oversee and support projects for fall prevention in multifamily housing, technology development, home remodeling partnerships, hospital-based centers, and community projects sponsored by Medicaid. The Secretary will provide grants to expand comprehensive geriatric fall prevention programs in multiple states and hospitals, with a focus on Medicaid-sponsored projects. The Secretary will prioritize self-supporting fall prevention projects and provide grants for elder falls prevention programs in residential and institutional settings, including multi-State demonstration projects. The project aims to implement elder falls prevention programs in multi-family residential settings with high concentrations of elders. This includes identifying high-risk populations, evaluating residential facilities, conducting screenings, providing counseling, coordinating services with healthcare and social service providers, and offering post-fall counseling, treatment, and rehabilitation. Grants will be provided to evaluate the effectiveness of these demonstration projects. \"Authorization of appropriations for elder falls prevention programs in multi-family residential settings with high concentrations of elders.\" Authorized appropriations for various public education, research, and demonstration projects related to elder falls prevention for fiscal years 2004 through 2006. Authorized appropriations for elder falls prevention projects for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 include $11,000,000 for demonstration and research projects and $8,000,000 for grants or contracts to private entities, with a requirement to reserve at least 30 percent for awards. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will review the impact of elder falls on Medicare and Medicaid programs to explore cost reduction through expanded services. This includes assessing reimbursement policies for potential coverage of fall-related education and prevention services. A report on the findings must be submitted to Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment."
