    "content": "The Al Qaeda movement has evolved with new affiliates, leaders, and recruits, while maintaining core strategic objectives. Affiliated groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb pose a distributed and diverse threat to global security interests. The U.S. intelligence community assessed that Al Qaeda's threat against the West has become more complex, with core Al Qaeda under pressure in Pakistan. Military and intelligence operations have degraded their capacity for large catastrophic attacks, leading to questions about the group's relevancy and capabilities. During the 2010 Annual Threat Assessment hearing, Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair highlighted the persistent terrorist threat from Al Qaeda and others with similar ideologies. He emphasized that until counterterrorism efforts outpace the group's ability to recover, Al Qaeda retains the capability to launch attacks. Al Qaeda continues to attract recruits and support global organizations with similar goals. The jihadi movement is a growing concern for U.S. national security, with regional affiliates showing intent to attack the homeland. Some regional nodes and allies have strengthened and begun to carry out attacks outside their regions, indicating a shift in Al Qaeda's capabilities. Analysts debate whether recent attacks show desperation or a more selective and sophisticated approach by the organization. The organization may be becoming more selective and sophisticated in its operations, encouraging affiliates to undertake smaller-scale acts to divert attention from larger attacks. Cooperation among terrorist groups has increased, posing a greater threat to the homeland. The Secretary of Homeland Security highlighted the evolving terrorist threat, with a shift towards smaller groups making it harder to detect plots. Despite challenges in assessing various entities, some believe core Al Qaeda's capabilities have been significantly degraded. The organization Al Qaeda has shown signs of decline, losing key leaders and facing ideological challenges. Observations suggest it is not closer to achieving its goals than before 9/11. The national security community believes Al Qaeda may be losing its appeal to potential followers. The organization Al Qaeda is on the decline and at risk of losing appeal to potential followers. Four key strategic issues contributing to its demise include indiscriminate killing of Muslims, lack of political representation, growing list of enemies, and lack of a desirable vision. Counterterrorism observers suggest assessments of its demise may be premature, as its infrastructure and ideology are resilient. The primary founder of Al Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, was born in July 1957, the 17th of 20 sons of a Saudi construction magnate of Yemeni origin. Bin Laden adopted militant Islamist views while studying at King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, influenced by key ideologues of the Muslim Brotherhood. Osama Bin Laden, influenced by the Muslim Brotherhood, played a key role in the jihad against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. He established the Maktab al Khidamat network with Abdullah Azzam to recruit and fundraise for the Afghan mujahedin, laying the groundwork for Al Qaeda. Osama Bin Laden utilized the Maktab al Khidamat network to recruit for the anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan. He participated in battles against Soviet forces and was reportedly injured in a 1987 assault. U.S. officials viewed the foreign volunteers positively and made no effort to stop their recruitment for the war. The United States covertly financed and armed Afghan mujahedin factions during the war in Afghanistan, but denied direct support for non-Afghan volunteers. Bin Laden, Azzam, and Abd al Rahman did not openly plan attacks on the U.S. despite criticizing its support for Israel. In 1988, they began considering the goals of their Islamist volunteer network. Azzam and Bin Laden had differing views on the use of their Islamist volunteer network, Al Qaeda. Azzam wanted it to be a rapid reaction force to protect Muslims, while Bin Laden aimed to overthrow secular Arab leaders like Mubarak and the Saudi royal family. This disagreement was influenced by Bin Laden's Egyptian advisors who wanted to establish an Islamic state in Egypt. Abd al Rahman and Ayman al-Zawahiri, close Egyptian confidants of Bin Laden, aimed to establish an Islamic state in Egypt. Zawahiri, with a background in Al Jihad in Egypt, provided medical aid to fighters in the Afghanistan conflict. After Azzam's assassination in 1989, Bin Laden gained control of funds and organizational mechanisms. Abd al Rahman was convicted in 1995 for terrorist plots related to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. In 1995, Zawahiri was convicted for terrorist plots related to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Bin Laden turned against the U.S. after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. He lobbied against U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, leading to a falling out with the royal family. U.S. forces were deployed in \"Operation Desert Storm\" to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 1991. In 1991, Bin Laden relocated to Sudan to train Al Qaeda militants for operations against the United States and its interests, as well as for jihad in various regions. He also funded Saudi Islamist dissidents in London during the early 1990s. Bin Laden was expelled from Sudan in May 1996 and returned to Afghanistan to help the Taliban gain control. He believed in ousting the United States to bring Islamic regimes to power. By the 1990s, Al Qaeda had become a global threat, with factions operating in over 70 countries. The group orchestrated the September 11, 2001 attacks. The pre-September 11 attacks attributed to Al Qaeda included bombing a hotel in Yemen in 1992, arming Somali factions in 1993, aiding in an assassination attempt in Ethiopia in 1995. Abd al Rahman was convicted for plots related to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The Islamic Group was involved in an assassination attempt against Mubarak. Saudi nationals inspired by bin Laden confessed to a 1995 bombing in Riyadh. Al Qaeda may have been involved in the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing. Al Qaeda was responsible for the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. The United States launched a cruise missile strike against bin Laden in 1998. In August 1998, the United States launched a cruise missile strike against bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan, narrowly missing him. In December 1999, thwarted Al Qaeda plots in Jordan and against Los Angeles airport were foiled. In October 2000, Al Qaeda attacked the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, killing 17 sailors. Afghanistan served as Al Qaeda's main base during bin Laden's residence from 1996-2001. Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001 drove out Al Qaeda operatives and Taliban protectors from Afghanistan. The U.S. mission in Afghanistan is to deny Al Qaeda safe haven and prevent the Taliban from overthrowing the Afghan government. Al Qaeda militants are seen as facilitators rather than active fighters in the Afghan insurgency. Small numbers of Al Qaeda members have been captured or killed in battles in Afghanistan, including affiliates like the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. Director of Central Intelligence Leon Panetta stated that Al Qaeda fighters are present in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan may number 50-100, with cells possibly moving back into remote areas of Kunar and Nuristan provinces. Despite efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Al Qaeda's top leadership has evaded capture. U.S. forces previously narrowed Osama bin Laden's location to the Tora Bora mountains in Nangarhar Province but failed to prevent his escape. Some military and intelligence officers have questioned the decision-making process. Some experts question the U.S. decision to rely on Afghan forces in the battle, suggesting that Afghan factions may have allowed Al Qaeda leaders to escape. Bin Laden and Zawahiri are believed to be in a settled area near the Afghan border. Despite previous missed opportunities, there has been occasional actionable intelligence on their movements. Some Al Qaeda leaders continue to inspire attacks on the U.S. homeland and allies. Efforts to target senior Al Qaeda figures have been successful, including the killing of Abu Laith al-Libi and Abu Khabab al-Masri. Al Qaeda operatives involved in embassy bombings were killed by a Predator strike in 2009. Reports suggest former spokesman Abu Ghaith may have been released from house arrest. Drone strikes have increased under President Obama to prevent attacks. Concerns remain about Al Qaeda's presence in Pakistan and its influence in the region. Al Qaeda forces, including leaders like Osama Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, are active in Pakistan, with links to local terrorist groups. They encourage attacks against Western and Indian targets, such as the 2008 Mumbai assault. Al Qaeda members are believed to be hiding in northwestern Pakistan, issuing statements against American presence in the region. Recent assessments indicate over 300 Al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan's tribal areas, with camps in western Pakistan training foreign extremists. Around 150 Westerners have attended these camps since 2008. As military pressure increases, the camps may have become smaller and more mobile. Analysts view Al Qaeda's sanctuary in Pakistan's FATA as a significant threat, with attention also on Yemen-based Al Qaeda elements receiving support from Pakistan-based allies. The U.S. homeland has identified Al Qaeda's key elements in Pakistan, including a safe haven in FATA, operational lieutenants, and top leadership. The Obama Administration's core goal is to disrupt and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan, as it remains the most formidable terrorist organization targeting the U.S. homeland. Al Qaeda's South Asia strategy now focuses on combating Pakistani enemies. Al Qaeda has utilized its media prowess and ideological authority to discredit the Pakistani state, promote cooperation among Pakistani militants, challenge the state's authority, and undermine support for U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed concerns about official Pakistan sympathizing with Islamist terrorists. Al Qaeda has found safe haven in Pakistan since 2002, raising suspicions about the government's willingness to apprehend them. Pakistani officials have handed over 500 Al Qaeda fugitives to the U.S. since 2001. Despite U.S. praise for Pakistani military operations against militants, there are concerns about the reasons for Al Qaeda's presence in the country. The Obama Administration has increased drone strikes in western Pakistan, disrupting Al Qaeda activities and causing heavy losses. Western intelligence agencies have been successful in infiltrating Al Qaeda despite some moles being executed. The Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan has allied itself closely with Al Qaeda in recent years. The Obama Administration has increased drone strikes in western Pakistan, disrupting Al Qaeda activities and causing heavy losses. The Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan has closely allied itself with Al Qaeda. Despite successful U.S. strikes targeting key leaders, new Al Qaeda-allied militant leaders like Ilyas Kashmiri pose major threats beyond the region. Al Qaeda fighters are being driven into Pakistani cities due to successful drone operations, raising concerns about anti-American sentiments. Senior Al Qaeda figures are active in Karachi and Lahore, possibly aiming to provoke conflict and establish safe havens. Despite disruptions, the organization is resurgent, benefiting from a perceived Pakistani policy of appeasement in tribal areas near the Afghan border. The Pakistan Army's poor counterinsurgency capabilities and the central government's eroded legitimacy have allowed Al Qaeda forces to operate in tribal areas near the Afghan border. The Pakistan Army is hesitant to expand ground offensive operations into western tribal agencies, potentially allowing Al Qaeda to continue using the region as a base. President Bush launched military operations in South and Southwest Asia post-9/11, with Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan seeing success with Pakistan's assistance. President Obama has increased U.S. military presence in Afghanistan to combat the Al Qaeda threat with the help of Pakistan. Evidence shows that 9/11 hijackers were based in western Pakistan, and Al Qaeda has been involved in many terrorist plots against Western countries. Tensions between Pakistan and India persist, with Al Qaeda's Pakistan affiliates seeking to destabilize South Asia. Al Qaeda is actively seeking to destabilize South Asia, potentially through a major terrorist attack in India to incite war with Pakistan. US policy options are limited due to some Pakistani support for Al Qaeda and anti-American sentiment fueled by perceived violations of sovereignty. Favorable views of Al Qaeda in Pakistan doubled from 9% in 2009 to 18% in 2010. The poll revealed a significant increase in favorable views of Al Qaeda in Pakistan, doubling from 9% in 2009 to 18% in 2010. Additionally, only 17% of Pakistanis held a favorable view of the United States, with three in five considering the US as an enemy. Despite efforts to reduce the trust deficit, the US provided significant economic and development aid to Pakistan, along with resources for counterterrorism capabilities. The challenging security environment in Pakistan hinders effective U.S. operations there. U.S. strategy relies on economic aid, military capacity building, drone attacks on militants, and urging Pakistani leaders to maintain pressure on Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda in Yemen merged with Saudi militants to form AQAP. The emergence of Yemen as a safe haven for a reconstituted Al Qaeda threat has left Saudi officials working to prevent \"inspiration and re-infiltration\" by the new incarnation of AQAP. Continuing terrorism arrests have sustained concerns, particularly because of an apparent shift in attackers' objectives toward targeting critical energy infrastructure and Saudi government officials. The arrest in Saudi Arabia of over 110 terrorist suspects in March 2010, along with reports that some of the suspects planned to target energy installations, highlighted these concerns. The emergence of Yemen as a safe haven for a reconstituted Al Qaeda threat has raised concerns for Saudi officials. The attempted assassination of Prince Mohammed bin Nayef underscored the threat to the royal family. AQAP leaders called for attacks on government officials and royal family members. The recruitment of Saudis from the terrorist rehabilitation program has raised questions about its effectiveness. Yemen's poor, rural population makes it an attractive base for AQAP operations. President Ali Abdullah Saleh has ruled Yemen since its unification in 1990, with a history of allying with Sunni Islamist militants. The government's inability to control certain governorates without tribal support has led to a complacent attitude towards Al Qaeda sympathizers. As Yemen faces challenges like dropping oil production, rising population, and dwindling resources, it becomes more susceptible to instability and extremist activity. AQAP operates within the country, posing a threat to stability. AQAP, operating within Yemen and internationally, is expanding ties with Al Shabaab in Somalia and possibly other AQ affiliates. Recent reports indicate collaboration with France to thwart terrorist attacks. AQAP is actively seeking to attack the U.S. homeland, with analysts considering it the most active Al Qaeda affiliate in this regard. Their efforts include radicalizing American citizens and sophisticated bomb-making capabilities. AQAP aims to radicalize U.S. citizens and execute a high-profile terrorist bombing on U.S. soil, utilizing sophisticated bomb-making techniques. They plan to launch multiple small-scale attacks against the United States as part of a long-term strategy outlined in their Inspire magazine. The group's approach involves carrying out smaller, more frequent operations to instill fear and keep the enemy on edge, bypassing security measures in place. AQAP has targeted U.S. and Western interests in Yemen, including embassies, oil companies, and tourists. Attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Sana'a in 2008 killed 17 people. In 2010, an unsuccessful assassination attempt was made on the British Ambassador. AQAP also attacked a vehicle carrying British embassy workers, injuring one British worker. AQAP's activities in Yemen aim to destabilize the government by inciting popular insurgency in Southern Yemen. The group targets the central government to fuel chaos and violence in provinces like Abyan and Shabwah. Despite some success, doubts remain about AQAP's ability to become a mass movement like the Taliban. AQAP's top leaders, Saudi veterans, target the Saudi royal family in retaliation for their expulsion from the kingdom. They use AQAP as a tool to settle scores and seek revenge against the government. In 2009, there were allegations against Assistant Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdelaziz Al Saud, the director of Saudi Arabia's counterterrorism campaign. Saudi intelligence agencies, GIP and GSS, collaborated with Yemen's military and special forces. Bin Nayef provided critical information on a failed air cargo bombing plot in October 2010. The Obama Administration is considering increasing security measures. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to combat AQAP without militarizing the U.S. presence. They are pursuing a short-term decapitation strategy to target AQAP leaders and implementing long-term policies to address instability in Yemen. Reports suggest the CIA may use drones or military units to target AQAP leaders hiding in Yemen. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to combat AQAP without militarizing the U.S. presence. A major buildup of U.S. assets is occurring in Yemen with additional CIA teams and Special Operations force trainers. The White House is pushing for more collaboration and intelligence sharing with the Yemeni government. U.S. economic and military aid to Yemen has significantly increased. In FY2010, the United States is providing an estimated $290 million in total aid to Yemen, with plans to increase aid in FY2011. The Defense Department has proposed increasing security assistance to Yemen to $1.2 billion over a five- or six-year period. Yemeni forces have launched campaigns against suspected AQAP strongholds. The sustainability of U.S.-Yemeni security cooperation is a key concern for lawmakers and policymakers. Disagreements may arise over Yemen's release of alleged terrorists to placate tribal leaders and domestic Islamist groups. The United States is providing significant aid to Yemen, with plans to increase it in the future. There have been disagreements over Yemen's release of alleged terrorists to appease tribal leaders and domestic Islamist politicians who oppose U.S. involvement in the region. U.S. officials have shown evidence of Al Qaeda targeting President Saleh, leading to a change in his attitude. Trust between the U.S. and Yemen fluctuates, with Yemen adjusting its cooperation based on U.S. interests. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) is the main terrorist threat in North Africa and the Sahel, moving operations out of Algeria's capital under pressure. Algeria's neighbors, Tunisia and Morocco, have prevented AQIM from entering their territories. Both countries fear AQIM transferring capabilities to indigenous groups. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) has not carried out a major terrorism attack in several years, but both Algeria and Mauritania continue to uncover alleged AQIM cells. AQIM's \"unity\" with Al Qaeda is more of a symbolic link, benefiting both groups. Since aligning with Al Qaeda in 2006, AQIM's anti-Western rhetoric has increased, but its operations are mainly limited to Algeria and the Sahel region. There is no direct AQIM threat to the U.S. homeland, but France has declared itself \"at war with Al Qaeda.\" AQIM, originating in the 1990s, seeks to establish an Islamic state by opposing the Algerian regime. The group split from the GIA in 1998 and has been linked to Al Qaeda since 2006. France declared itself \"at war with Al Qaeda\" in response to AQIM threats. AQIM, under new leader Abdelmalik Droukdel, declared allegiance to Al Qaeda in 2003 and changed its name to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in 2006. The group raises funds through kidnapping, trafficking, and receives funding from cells in Europe. AQIM increased attacks against the government, security forces, and foreign workers in Algeria, using suicide attacks and bombings in 2006 and 2007. In 2008, terrorist attacks on security forces in Algeria escalated, with suicide bombers causing over 40 deaths at a police academy. In 2009, AQIM carried out attacks in the Kabylie region and other areas, targeting gendarmes and military convoys. In 2010, AQIM continued attacks on police in various regions. Algerians have been involved in international terrorist plots, such as Ahmed Ressam in 1999. Algerians have been involved in various international terrorist plots, including the Millennium Plot in 1999 and the ricin plot in London in 2003. Algerians linked to groups like GIA and Al Qaeda have been arrested in different countries for suspected terrorist activities. Algeria remains a significant source of international terrorists, with individuals arrested in Europe for connections to AQIM. AQIM is active in the West African Sahel region, demonstrating its ability to conduct attacks against foreign nationals. The group operates training camps along the Algeria-Mali border, engages in smuggling operations, and targets military and police in Mauritania and Mali. They have kidnapped and assassinated individuals in the region, attacked foreign embassies, and clashed with security forces. AQIM has carried out kidnappings, assassinations, and attacks in the West African Sahel region, targeting foreign nationals and security forces. Notable incidents include the murder of French tourists, the kidnapping of a U.N. envoy and Canadian colleague, and the beheading of a British hostage. They have also claimed responsibility for the murder of a U.S. aid worker and a suicide bombing near the French embassy in Mauritania. In response to AQIM activities in the Sahel region, Malian forces, with Algerian and French support, declared an \"all-out war\" on AQIM. Concerns over kidnapping operations grew, with failed attempts targeting U.S. embassy employees and warnings issued to U.S. citizens. Rescue attempts resulted in AQIM fatalities but failed to secure hostages, leading to deaths. Despite some successful releases, AQIM continued its attacks, including a thwarted suicide bombing in Mauritania and the kidnapping of French uranium mine workers. In mid-September 2010, seven French uranium mine workers were kidnapped in Niger and moved into Mali. Mauritania launched air raids in Mali, killing AQIM combatants and civilians. AQIM in the Sahel is led by Yahia Djouadi and Mokhtar Belmokhtar, with members from various countries. Hostages were executed due to political demands, while others were released for ransom. MBM's group focuses on criminal activities and terrorist attacks. MBM's group, responsible for terrorist attacks, engages in criminal income-earning operations like kidnappings for ransom. It has a regional network of contacts, including state officials, making it relatively pragmatic within AQIM. U.S. policy makers assisting North African and Sahelian governments against AQIM threats must consider colonial history and regional power dynamics. Algeria, Mauritania, Niger, and Mali, former French colonies, resist foreign involvement in their affairs. Algeria, with a strong military and oil wealth, sees itself as a dominant regional power and opposes foreign interference. Relations between Algeria and other AQIM-affected Sahelian countries can be complex. Algeria's regional aspirations sometimes strain relations with other Sahelian countries affected by AQIM. Efforts to enhance regional counterterrorism capabilities are ongoing through U.S. and European security cooperation programs. Algeria hosts counterterrorism meetings, provides air cover for operations, and offers military aid to Mali and Niger. The Tamanrasset Plan involves Algeria, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger establishing a joint military center to combat terrorism, kidnappings, and trafficking. The U.S. government also conducts initiatives to counter violent extremism. The U.S. government has implemented initiatives to counter violent extremism in the Sahel region, including the Pan-Sahel Initiative (PSI) in 2002 and the Trans Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) in 2005. TSCTP integrates counterterrorism and military training with development assistance to improve regional capabilities in defeating terrorist organizations. The Trans Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) is a U.S. government-led program that involves agencies like the State Department, U.S. Agency for International Development, and Department of Defense. It includes Operation Enduring Freedom\u2014Trans-Sahara (OEF-TS) where U.S. military works with African partners to enhance intelligence, logistics, and conduct joint operations against terrorist groups in the Sahel region. This region faces various security threats beyond terrorism, such as armed insurrection, banditry, and illegal trafficking, raising questions about the balance between countering extremism and addressing governance and development challenges. The East Africa region faces governance, security, and human development challenges, contributing to the rise of extremism. Questions arise about the U.S. response and the balance between civilian and military resources. Africa's porous borders and weak security measures create a conducive environment for terrorist groups to operate. African security services lack technology and trained manpower to effectively address terrorist threats in the region. The NIF government in Sudan facilitated international terrorist groups, including providing a safe haven for Osama Bin Laden. Bin Laden used Sudan as a base for Al Qaeda before moving to Afghanistan in 1996. During his five-year stay in Sudan, Osama Bin Laden laid the foundation for Al Qaeda. The NIF government's support to international terrorist organizations in East Africa led to dramatic attacks in the 1990s, including the U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. Al Qaeda's presence in the region resulted in further attacks, such as the 2002 bombings in Mombasa, Kenya. On July 11, 2010, Al Shabaab carried out suicide bombings in Kampala, Uganda during the World Cup final, killing 76 people. The attacks targeted a rugby club and Ethiopian restaurant. Al Shabaab warned Uganda and Burundi to withdraw troops from Somalia to avoid further blasts. Concerns over Islamic fundamentalism in Somalia have been raised by the United States and neighboring countries. Islamic courts emerged in Mogadishu in the mid-1990s. In the 1990s, Islamic courts in Mogadishu enforced decisions using their militia, with Al Ittihad Al Islami providing security. The absence of central authority in Somalia led to the proliferation of armed factions. The Bush Administration accused Al Ittihad of links to Al Qaeda and froze its assets in 2001. Sheikh Hassan Aweys, a leader in Al Ittihad, was on the U.S. terrorist list. In the late 1990s, Al Ittihad Al Islami was attacked by Ethiopia and its Somali allies, leading to the formation of a new political front by the older leadership. However, young members disagreed and formed their own movement, Harakat Al Shabaab Al Mujahedeen, now known as Al Shabaab, with leaders like Ahmed Abdi Godane and Aden Hashi Ayrow. The group's main goal was irredentism and establishing a \"Greater\" entity. The emergence of Al Shabaab as a resistance movement in Somalia began after the Ethiopian invasion in 2006, leading to the group gaining control and forming ties with Al-Qaeda by mid-2007. In 2008, Al Shabaab was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Al Shabaab and Ras Kamboni group merged under the name Al Shabaab Mujahidin Movement in 2010, coordinating attacks against Somalia's Transitional Federal Government and working with Al Qaeda leaders. The merger was triggered by defections and the illness of Ras Kamboni leader Hassan Al Turki, designated a terrorist by the U.S. in 2004. Hizbul Islam also merged with Al Shabaab in December 2010, seen as a surrender after defeats on the ground. Al Qaeda poses a direct threat to U.S. interests in East Africa. Al Shabaab, Al Qaeda, and their threat to U.S. interests in East Africa. Al Shabaab focuses on attacks in Somalia, while Al Qaeda presents a broader terrorist threat. There is concern about Westerners training in Somalia potentially redirecting their focus to the Homeland. Several Somali youth from Minneapolis and other parts of the United States have reportedly left to join the insurgency in Somalia. U.S. officials are concerned that some individuals could be recruited by Al Qaeda for attacks in Somalia or the United States, although there is no clear evidence of specific plans targeting the U.S. homeland. The worries stem from the involvement of a Somali-American from Minneapolis in a 2008 suicide bombing in Puntland and Somaliland, raising broader concerns about U.S. citizens participating in Al Shabaab activities. Several Somali-Americans have been indicted for providing support to Al Shabaab, with two individuals accused of raising funds for the terrorist group through money transfers in 2008 and 2009. Attorney General Eric Holder highlighted the deadly pipeline that has facilitated funding and fighters to Al Shabaab from the U.S. The United States and Indonesia share a common interest in addressing the threat of militant Islamists in Southeast Asia. Indonesia's syncretic Islam, influenced by animist, Buddhist, and Hindu traditions, is more moderate compared to the Middle East. Radical Islamists pose a threat to Indonesia's secular state and moderate Muslim society. Terrorist activity extends beyond targeting Western interests in the country. Terrorist activity in Indonesia is not limited to attacking Western targets. Views on the threat from militant Islamists have evolved over time, with local groups like Jemaah Islamiya seen as direct threats to the Indonesian government and people after the 2002 Bali bombing. Islamists were suppressed under the New Order regime but gained space during the reformasi period. Key terrorist attacks in Indonesia include the Bali bombing of 2002, the 2003 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, the 2004 bombing of the Australian Embassy, and bombing attacks against Western hotels in Jakarta in 2009. Jemaah Islamiya (JI) was the key terrorist organization in Indonesia for most of the 2000s, but now militant Islamists can be identified with JI, the network of Noordin Top, and a new alliance of Jihadists in Aceh. JI is focused on rebuilding its organization and establishing an Islamist state. The new alliance of Jihadists in Aceh, formed in 2010, consists of radicals from various militant groups frustrated with the lack of action. The group is seen as Indonesia's version of Al Qaeda. A raid in Aceh led to the killing of Dulmatin, a planner of the 2002 Bali bombing, with Saptono taking over before being killed in a subsequent raid in May 2010. In May 2010, a plot to assassinate President Yudhoyono and other national leaders in Indonesia was disrupted. Abdullah Sunata, a leader of the Aceh cell involved in the plot, was captured in June 2010. The government's response to militant Islamists has been effective, despite some challenges. The Indonesian government's response to militant Islamists faces challenges due to lax standards in prisons allowing communication with organizations. Deradicalization programs have been criticized for allowing militants to rejoin after release. General Ansyaad Mbai heads the National Counter Terrorism Agency (BNPT) formed in 2010 to coordinate counterterrorism efforts. Some concerns exist about the BNPT's potential actions. In 2010, Indonesia's counter-terror operations faced challenges with fears of BNPT acting like Suharto's regime. Coordination issues were raised among police, TNI, and BIN. Security Minister emphasized vigilance at a BNPT conference. TNI troops, including Kopassus, were used in counter-terror operations. Low-level terrorism activities aimed at funding terrorist groups increased in 2010, with robberies linked to radical organizations. Three policemen were killed after arresting robbers at Hamparan Perak police station. Three policemen were killed at the Hamparan Perak police station after arresting bank robbers in Medan. Indonesian police suspect Abu Bakar Ba'asyir's sermons in Medan inspired the attacks. Indonesia has strengthened its counter-terror partnership with the US, marked by a Comprehensive Partnership agreement signed by Presidents Obama and Yudhoyono in 2010. Al Qaeda's leaders view themselves as the armed vanguard of an international Islamist movement, but some experts believe their quest for influence has been in vain. They advocate for expelling US and foreign military forces from Islamic lands and reshaping Muslim societies based on early Sunni Islam practices. Al Qaeda's goal is to expel U.S. and foreign military forces from Islamic lands and overthrow corrupt regional leaders to establish governments ruled by Islamic law. They also advocate for the reestablishment of an Islamic caliphate, promote military confrontation with Israel, and conflict with Shiite Muslims. Al Qaeda leaders appeal for support by manipulating local grievances and nationalist sentiment to further their agendas. Al Qaeda's varying priorities and approaches create challenges in constructing a unified narrative or strategy. The jihadi movement's operational units struggle to coordinate closely, limiting their ability to achieve policy goals. Osama Bin Laden aimed to incite and mobilize support, but strategic variation and lack of coordination complicate efforts to combat the movement. Osama Bin Laden's goal is to incite and mobilize the Islamic nation, but Al Qaeda's attacks have not gained broad support among Muslims. Dissatisfaction with U.S. foreign policy has increased in some Muslim societies, but Al Qaeda's sectarian rhetoric and terrorist attacks have undermined its appeal. Experts argue that Al Qaeda's uncompromising tone and anti-democratic statements limit its appeal among Muslim groups. Experts suggest that Al Qaeda's uncompromising and anti-democratic tone in their statements may alienate Muslims who support secular or religious representative government. The group believes that framing their actions as defensive responses to external threats will garner support for their ideological program. Al Qaeda and its affiliates aim to appeal to a broader audience by emphasizing limited political objectives rather than their religious agenda. Al Qaeda and its affiliates pursue various objectives, from reestablishing the caliphate to personal religious salvation. Despite identifying the conflict in Iraq as a strategic opportunity, their actions have often undermined their portrayal as defenders of Muslims with limited goals. Al Qaeda affiliates in Iraq and Saudi Arabia undermined their support by stoking sectarian conflict, enforcing religious doctrine, and targeting Sunni Muslim communities. This led to significant attrition from 2007 onwards at the hands of Iraqi security forces, government allies, and the US military. Saudi affiliates initially attacked foreign interests but shifted focus to local security forces, creating an opportunity for the government. The government engaged and eliminated Al Qaeda by launching security operations and using nationalist sentiment to undermine support for the group. Deradicalization programs have demobilized some supporters, but others have returned to militancy. Al Shabaab fighters in Somalia affiliated with Al Qaeda have rallied support against external intervention and the Transitional Federal Government. Threats against aid agencies have disrupted humanitarian aid efforts. Several aid agencies, including the World Food Program, have halted humanitarian aid delivery in southern Somalia, impacting nearly half of WFP's intended beneficiaries in 2010. Terror attacks in Somalia have alienated many locals, while Al Shabaab has downplayed the presence of foreign fighters within its ranks. In Southeast Asia, the Indonesian government intensified efforts to combat terrorism following the 2002 Bali bombing by the Jemaah Islamiyah network. The Indonesian government has made a concerted effort to track, arrest, and degrade JI leaders, increasing anti-terrorist cooperation with the United States and Australia. JI's capabilities have been degraded, with a shift towards more \"bureaucratic\" elements opposing violent tactics. Success in counterterrorism efforts depends on regional decisions about combating Al Qaeda within their societies. U.S. and allied policies can be successful by capitalizing on Al Qaeda actions that alienate supporters. Counterterrorism efforts against Al Qaeda affiliates can shape the global appeal of violent Islamism. Approaches must be tailored to each regional context to be effective, as actions that alienate supporters can impact the group's fortunes. The presence of foreign military forces in Muslim countries and military operations resulting in civilian casualties are key factors in Al Qaeda's messaging strategy."
