    "content": "The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" may require cellulose biofuel production based on actual production levels. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" amends the Clean Air Act to provide estimates of cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the following year. The Energy Information Administration is tasked with determining these estimates. The Energy Information Administration determines estimates of cellulosic biofuel production volumes for the upcoming year. The Energy Information Administration determines the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by a facility based on actual production during a specific period. The Energy Information Administration determines the estimated annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for a facility based on the average monthly production volume. The Energy Information Administration estimates the annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for a facility based on monthly production volumes. For each cellulosic biofuel production facility starting production after January 1 of the current year, specific requirements apply. The Energy Information Administration estimates the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by a facility based on actual production from the date of initial production to October 31. The Energy Information Administration estimates the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by a facility based on actual production from the date of initial production to October 31 of the current calendar year. The Energy Information Administration estimates the annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for a facility based on the average monthly production from the date of initial production to October 31 of the current calendar year. The Energy Information Administration estimates the annual volume of cellulosic biofuel production for a facility based on monthly production until October 31 of the current year. This estimation is used to calculate the total production for the following calendar year. Amendments to the Clean Air Act specify the method for determining the applicable volume. Amendments to the Clean Air Act specify the method for determining the applicable volume by using the exact monthly production until October 31 of the current year to calculate the total production for the following calendar year, with changes including replacing \"may\" with \"shall\" and \"same or a lesser volume\" with \"same volume\"."
