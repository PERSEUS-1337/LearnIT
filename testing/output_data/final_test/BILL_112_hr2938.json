    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Gila Bend Indian Reservation Lands Replacement Clarification Act\" and includes findings. Since 1986, Congress passed the Gila Bend Indian Reservation Lands Replacement Act to allow the Tohono O'odham Nation to purchase replacement lands due to flooding from Federal dam projects. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 limited gaming activities on newly acquired lands by Indian tribes. The Tohono O'odham Nation has purchased over 16,000 acres of land since 1986. They are now seeking trust status for approximately 134.88 acres near 91st and Northern Avenue in Maricopa County for gaming purposes. The Tohono O'odham Nation is seeking trust status for approximately 53.54 acres of land to conduct Las Vegas style gaming, despite opposition from the State of Arizona, City of Glendale, and 12 other Indian tribes. Their proposed casino violates existing Tribal-State gaming compacts and State law limiting tribal gaming facilities in the Phoenix metropolitan area to seven. The Tohono O'odham Nation operates three gaming facilities, with a proposed casino near existing neighborhoods and a school, raising concerns about taxes, transportation projects, and community investments. The Tohono O'odham Nation operates three gaming facilities in the Tucson metropolitan area and Why, Arizona. The Gila Bend Indian Reservation Lands Replacement Act clarifies that lands purchased under this act cannot be used for Class II and Class III gaming, but can be utilized for other forms of economic development by the Nation. The amendment to Public Law 99-503 clarifies that no Class II or Class III gaming activities can be conducted on land north of latitude 33 degrees, 4 minutes north. This limitation does not affect the interpretation of whether lands south of this latitude taken into trust qualify as part of a settlement of a land claim. The House of Representatives passed the bill on June 19, 2012, as attested by Karen L. Haas, Clerk."
