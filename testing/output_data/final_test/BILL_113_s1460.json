    "content": "The \"FISA Judge Selection Reform Act of 2013\" establishes definitions for the FISA Court and FISA Court of Review under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. It includes reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The \"FISA Judge Selection Reform Act of 2013\" establishes a FISA Court with 13 judges designated from each judicial circuit by the Chief Justice of the United States. The FISA Court judges' names are made public. When a vacancy occurs, the chief judge of the circuit proposes a district judge for the position. If the Chief Justice doesn't designate a judge, the chief judge proposes two other district judges, and the Chief Justice selects one. Judges of the FISA Court cannot hear the same denied surveillance application. The FISA Court judges' names are public. If a judge denies surveillance, they must provide written reasons. District judges serving before a certain date are affected by the amendments. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allows district judges serving before a certain date to continue in their position until the end of the term. The Chief Justice of the United States must appoint a district court judge within the District of Columbia circuit within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allows district judges to continue serving until the end of their term. The Chief Justice must appoint judges from the District of Columbia circuit to the FISA Court for specific terms. The Court of Review provisions are also amended. The Chief Justice can appoint a district or circuit court judge to the court established under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act only if at least 5 associate justices approve the appointment. The Committee on Intercircuit Assignments will conduct a study on appointing diverse judges to the FISA Courts and submit a report to Congress within a year."
