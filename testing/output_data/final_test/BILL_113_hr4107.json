    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Reduce Expenditures in Nuclear Infrastructure Now Act\" or the \"REIN-IN Act\". Congress acknowledges the changed national security landscape post-Cold War, with the US maintaining a large nuclear arsenal. This arsenal includes around 5,000 warheads, with 2,000 deployed across bomber aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The United States maintains a large nuclear arsenal, including 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 14 Ohio-class submarines armed with up to 96 nuclear warheads each. However, the significant cost of maintaining and upgrading this arsenal over the next decade raises concerns. It is suggested that reducing the number of deployed nuclear warheads and delivery systems would serve both budgetary and national security interests. The Department of Defense's nuclear policy guidance states that the United States can reduce its nuclear arsenal by up to 1/3 below levels under the New START Treaty to 1,000 to 1,100 warheads, saving tens of billions. The United States can save billions by deploying strategic warheads more efficiently on delivery systems and deferring production of new systems. Economic and national security are linked, with Admiral Mike Mullen warning about the national debt as a major security threat. The Government Accountability Office found significant waste in constructing nuclear facilities. SEC. 3. REDUCTION IN NUCLEAR FORCES. Prohibition on new long-range penetrating bomber aircraft, F-35 nuclear mission, and reduction in the B61 life extension program for fiscal years 2014 through 2023. The total cost of the B61 life extension program must be reduced to $5 billion before funds can be used. The W78 life extension program is terminated, and the Navy's ballistic-missile submarines will be reduced to eight by fiscal year 2020. The Navy is limited to eight ballistic-missile submarines for deployment. No funds can be used for the procurement of SSBN-X submarines for fiscal years 2014 through 2023, and no more than eight such submarines can be procured for fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Additionally, funds cannot be used for the procurement of submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The Department of Defense is restricted from maintaining more than 250 submarine-launched ballistic missiles and from developing a new intercontinental ballistic missile. Additionally, the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles on high alert status is limited to 150. The Department of Defense is limited to maintaining 150 intercontinental ballistic missiles on high alert status. No funds can be used for the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility project or the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building Replacement Project. The Department of Defense and Department of Energy are restricted from using funds to replace the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building at Los Alamos National Laboratory and for the Uranium Processing Facility at Y-12 National Security Complex. Additionally, funds cannot be used for the medium extended air defense system. SEC. 4. REPORTS REQUIRED. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy must submit an initial report within 180 days of the Act's enactment outlining their plans for section 3. They must also submit annual reports by March 1, 2015, and annually thereafter, detailing their plans for section 3. Additionally, the President must provide an annual report by September 30, 2015, and annually thereafter, on the amounts spent by the Federal Government for nuclear weapons. The Federal Government must report the amounts obligated and expended for each nuclear weapon and related program annually to the appropriate committees of Congress."
