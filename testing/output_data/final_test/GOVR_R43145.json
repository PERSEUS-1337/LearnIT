    "content": "The United States immigration policy emphasizes family reunification, skilled immigrants, refugee protection, and country-of-origin diversity. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 outlines categories for family-based immigrants, including immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and family preference categories based on individual characteristics. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) limits family preference immigration to 7% per country and family-based immigration makes up two-thirds of all legal permanent immigration. There is a visa queue of roughly 4 million family-based immigrants waiting for numerically limited visas. Concerns over \"chain migration\" have increased. The report reviews family-based immigration policy, including a brief history, current laws, recommendations from previous commissions, data on legal immigrants, and policy issues. Family-based immigration makes up two-thirds of all legal permanent immigration, with concerns over \"chain migration\" and a visa queue of 4 million immigrants waiting for numerically limited visas. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 established family-based preferences in U.S. immigration policy, prioritizing spouses and minor children. The Immigration Act Amendments of 1965 eliminated the national origins quota system, giving priority to immigrants with relatives in the U.S. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens were admitted without numerical restriction, while other relatives faced caps. The Immigration Act of 1990 increased total immigration with a flexible cap of 675,000 immigrants and raised the annual limit for family-based immigrants to 480,000. This act retained key elements of previous immigration reforms from 1952 and 1965. The Immigration Act of 1990 increased total immigration to 675,000 immigrants annually, with 480,000 slots allocated for family-based immigrants. Key reform proposals from congressionally mandated commissions are still relevant, addressing issues like the visa queue and high proportion of family-based immigrants. The Immigration Act of 1990 increased total immigration to 675,000 immigrants annually, with 480,000 slots allocated for family-based immigrants. Family-sponsored immigrants include immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and family preference immigrants, which are numerically limited. The Immigration Act of 1990 increased total immigration to 675,000 immigrants annually, with 480,000 slots allocated for family-based immigrants. Family-sponsored immigrants include immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and family preference immigrants, which are numerically limited. The family preference immigrants are divided into subgroups based on the relationship to the sponsor, with annual levels determined by subtracting visas issued to immediate relatives and adding unused employment preference immigrant numbers. Unused visas in each category roll down to the next preference category, with a minimum annual level of family preference immigrants set at 226,000 under the INA. Since FY1996, annual immediate relative immigrants have consistently exceeded 254,000 each year, with family preference immigrants remaining at a limit of 226,000 for the past two decades. Family-based immigration dominates actual legal immigration to the United States, with family-based immigrants making up over two-thirds of all new LPRs in FY2016. Immediate relatives accounted for over two-thirds of all family-based immigration in FY2016. In FY2016, immediate relatives accounted for over two-thirds (70%) of all family-based immigration and nearly half (48%) of all legal permanent immigration. The INA limits LPRs from any single country to 7% of the total annual limit of family preference and employment-based preference immigrants. Waiting times for family-based visas can extend for years due to the annual visa limit exceeding the number of eligible foreign nationals, especially for countries with high petition rates like India. Becoming a lawful permanent resident (LPR) based on a family relationship can take years, especially for individuals from countries with high petition rates like India. The process involves the sponsor filing Form I-130 with USCIS to establish the relationship, followed by the prospective LPR filing Form I-485. Immediate relatives can file both petitions concurrently. The adjustment of status process for prospective LPRs is handled by USCIS, whether they reside in the US or abroad. USCIS reviews and approves the petition before forwarding it to the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs. The officer must ensure the alien is eligible for LPR status, and DOS determines visa availability for the immigrant category. The Department of State determines visa availability based on the priority date of the permanent residence petition. The public charge ground is significant for family-sponsored immigration, requiring sponsors to prove financial support at 125% of the federal poverty level. Joint sponsors can also share this responsibility. The federal government requires sponsors to provide financial support for sponsored aliens at 125% of the federal poverty level for 10 years or until the alien becomes a U.S. citizen. Laws for adjusting status vary depending on how the foreign national entered the U.S., with different treatment for those who marry U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. Unauthorized aliens who entered illegally must leave the country and are barred from re-entering for 3 or 10 years. Spouses and children accompanying or following qualifying immigrants are considered derivative immigrants and have the same status and consideration as the principal immigrants. Derivative immigrants count equally within the numerical limits of each immigration category. In FY2016, derivative immigrants, including siblings, spouses, and children of U.S. citizens, represented 9% of all family-based immigration, 43% of other immigrant categories, and 20% of total immigration. Principal immigrants made up 76% of total LPRs and 91% of all family-based LPRs in that year. Differences in derivative numbers were seen in 3rd and 4th preference immigrants. The INA governs child immigrants based on age, marital status, and the citizenship status of sponsoring U.S. relatives. Family-sponsored categories prioritize minor over adult children, unmarried over married children, and children of U.S. citizens over children of LPRs. Principal immigrants outnumber derivative immigrants in some categories, while in others, they are more evenly divided. Under current law, only adult U.S. citizens may sponsor their foreign-born parents as immediate relatives and their foreign-born siblings as 4th family preference immigrants. Foreign-born children under age 18 become naturalized U.S. citizens automatically upon admission to the United States if at least one parent is a U.S. citizen by birth or naturalization. Orphans adopted abroad by U.S. citizens must have been. Foreign national spouses of U.S. citizens and LPRs must undergo a two-year evaluation period for marriages of short duration to acquire conditional permanent residence status. USCIS monitors the marriage to determine its legitimacy and may terminate the status if the marriage is found to be fraudulent. During the two-year conditional period, the foreign national and their U.S.-based spouse must jointly petition to have the conditional status removed. Failure to do so within 90 days requires a waiver to avoid legal status loss. If conditions are met and no marriage fraud is detected during an interview, the conditional status converts to lawful permanent resident status. USCIS may waive requirements in cases of extreme hardship or good faith marriage termination. The USCIS reviews the legitimacy of marriages before removing or waiving conditions for lawful permanent resident status. The terms \"spouse,\" \"wife,\" or \"husband\" are not defined in the INA. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) previously excluded same-sex marriages in federal enactments, but this provision was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013. The Supreme Court's 2013 decision in United States v. Windsor invalidated DOMA's definition of \"marriage\" and \"spouse\" for federal purposes. DHS approved the first immigrant visa for a same-sex spouse of a U.S. citizen, and USCIS was directed to treat immigration visa petitions for same-sex spouses the same as those for opposite-sex spouses. Immigration statistics from FY1996 to FY2016 show an increase in total lawful permanent residents and immediate relatives, with family-sponsored preference immigrants capped at 226,000 annually. Increasing numbers of immigrants in other LPR categories explain why the proportion of family-based immigration to total immigration has remained constant at about two thirds over two decades (66%). Immediate relatives, not numerically limited, accounted for the entire increase in total family-based immigration. Individuals can become LPRs by adjusting status if they reside in the US or by applying for LPR status from abroad. Figure 2 shows the percentage of LPRs who adjusted status by immigration category. Issues regularly raised in debates on family-based immigration policy include supply-demand imbalance for U.S. lawful permanent residence, per-country ceilings, limitations on foreign nationals visiting U.S.-based relatives, impetus to violate U.S. immigration laws, aging out of legal status categories, marriage timing of immigrant children, and policies toward unaccompanied alien children. Foreign nationals petition for LPR status through family-sponsored each year. Each year, the number of foreign nationals petitioning for LPR status through family-sponsored preferences exceeds the number of immigrants that can be admitted to the United States. A \"visa queue\" has accumulated of persons who qualify as immigrants but must wait for a visa due to numerical limits. The visa queue for family-preference immigrant petitions as of November 1, 2017, was 3.95 million applications, a 7% decrease from the previous year. The visa queue for family-preference immigrant petitions as of November 1, 2017, totaled 3.95 million applications, with waiting periods varying significantly based on preference category. The statutory limits on visas create most of the waiting period, with annual immigration under family-sponsored categories capped at 226,000. The 7% per-country ceiling further impacts waiting times for over-subscribed countries like Mexico and China. The Visa Bulletin, published by DOS, shows how visa queues lead to waiting times for immigrants. Cut-off dates are adjusted monthly based on various factors. All family-preference category visas were oversubscribed as of February 1, 2018. LPR petitions filed under the 1st family preference category for certain countries have long waiting times, with some cases exceeding 12 years. The Visa Bulletin does not provide specific wait times but indicates potential delays due to processing conditions. Visa retrogression can occur if processing conditions change, leading to longer wait times for petitioners. Visa retrogression can occur when more people apply for a visa than there are available, leading to longer wait times. Visa progression happens when fewer people apply, resulting in quicker processing. Priority date progression or retrogression may occur at the end of each fiscal year to stay within visa limitations. Increased family-based LPR petitions have extended waiting times. Cut-off dates are rough estimates of waiting times but may not always be accurate. The visa queue reflects excess demand for permanent immigration to the United States, leading to family separation and unauthorized means to subvert immigration policy. The INA sets a per-country ceiling for legal immigration, with exceptions for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and certain preference categories. The per-country ceiling for legal immigration in the United States restrains immigrants from countries with large numbers of LPR petitioners, leading to longer waiting times for visas. Proponents argue that the Immigration Amendments of 1965 made U.S. immigration policy more equitable by imposing worldwide and per-country limits, with exceptions for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and certain preference categories. Advocates of immigration reform argue for prioritizing family reunification over per-country ceilings, especially for oversubscribed countries like Mexico, India, and China. They believe the current per-country ceilings are arbitrary and should be increased to allow families from all countries to reunite. Additionally, aliens with pending LPR petitions and foreign nationals with U.S. citizen or LPR relatives must demonstrate intent to return to their home countries if they wish to visit the United States. Nonimmigrant visa applicants with U.S. citizen and LPR relatives face challenges in demonstrating ties to their home countries to prevent immigration intent. The most common basis for rejection is the presumption of intention to immigrate, as stated in Section 214(b) of the INA. For example, a Mexican daughter of U.S. citizens may be denied a tourist visa and face a 21-year wait for LPR status, preventing her from visiting her parents in the U.S. Many foreign nationals with approved petitions for permanent residency in the United States face long waiting times for visas, leading to family separation. This has led some individuals to either overstay their visas or enter the country illegally. The exact number of unauthorized aliens in this situation is unknown. The 3.95 million family-based visa queue includes unauthorized aliens with pending petitions. \"Aging out\" affects eligibility for immigration benefits as foreign nationals get older, especially for minor children of LPRs in the 2(A) family preference category. Minor children of U.S. citizens are protected from aging out by the Child Status Protection Act of 2002. Children of LPRs in the 2(A) family preference category age out and must be sponsored under the 2(B) category, leading to longer waiting times for LPR status. Reclassification extends the visa cut-off date, causing family separation for at least five years. Differential treatment between unmarried and married children in different preference categories may influence LPR petitioners to delay. Children under 3rd family preference categories may delay marriage to receive better immigration treatment under the INA, prioritizing unmarried children for faster visa processing. The increase in unaccompanied alien children from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras entering the US has been significant, with over 68,500 apprehensions in FY2014. In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in unaccompanied alien children (UAC) apprehensions, with a peak of over 68,500 in FY2014. The majority of these children are from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Family reunification is a key factor motivating migration to the United States, as many children in these countries have at least one parent living in the US. Upon apprehension, unaccompanied children are immediately put into removal proceedings. In FY2017, 84% of unaccompanied children apprehended by Customs and Border Protection were placed with family members in the United States while awaiting their removal hearing. The desire for family reunification is a key factor driving migration, as children can reside with relatives for extended periods. The considerable wait time for unaccompanied minors' removal hearings incentivizes migration, especially since a significant percentage of their family members are unauthorized aliens. Debates over family-based immigration and its proportion of total lawful permanent immigration have sparked discussions on immigration policy reform proposals. Reform proposals on immigration policy challenges were made by two congressionally mandated commissions: the 1981 Hesburgh Commission and the 1995 Jordan Commission. The Hesburgh Commission acknowledged demographic trends could help formulate immigration policies around optimal population sizes. Arguments for increasing or decreasing immigration levels were considered due to fiscal, cultural, environmental, and economic pressures. The Hesburgh and Jordan Commissions emphasized family reunification as the primary goal of U.S. immigration policy. They rejected point systems for immigrant criteria and favored U.S.-based relatives sponsoring immigration. Both commissions considered reconfiguring family-based categories to prioritize spouses and minor children. The Hesburgh Commission warned against raising false hopes for immigration, which could lead to unauthorized immigration and dissatisfaction with U.S. immigration laws. The Hesburgh and Jordan Commissions recommended prioritizing spouses, minor children, and parents of U.S. citizens as family-sponsored preference immigrants to reunify families and reduce visa wait times. They also suggested eliminating certain family preference categories to improve the credibility of the immigration system and manage expectations for U.S. permanent resident status. The Hesburgh Commission recommended flexible family-based immigration limits, suggesting annual and longer-term numerical targets to accommodate varying immigration needs. Dr. Michael Teitelbaum testified on the American immigration system in 2013, followed by Dr. Susan Martin's testimony on comprehensive immigration. During a hearing on comprehensive immigration reform, the executive director of the Jordan Commission reiterated recommendations from the commission's past reports. The INA allows sponsorship of spouses, unmarried children, parents, married adult children, and siblings, but not other relatives like grandparents, grandchildren, cousins, aunts, and uncles. Supporters argue for considering parents and children immediate family regardless of age or marital status. Advocates argue for expanding family-based immigration to include siblings as immediate family members to reduce the visa queue and prevent long separations. Critics of broadening family reunification claim the U.S. has no obligation to reunite extended family members beyond immediate relatives. Critics argue that U.S. immigration policy should limit family-based preference immigration to immediate family members to optimize labor market benefits and reduce demand for taxpayer-funded social services. They believe the current policy is too generous and does not consider economic conditions. Family-based immigration policies are criticized for not adjusting to changing labor market requirements, but studies show they have a positive impact on long-term employment needs. Immigrants entering the U.S. match future workforce skills accurately, especially in high-growth sectors like healthcare. Critics argue for limiting family-based preference immigration to optimize labor market benefits. The foreign-born population has contributed to the growth in the working age population. Family reunification in the U.S. helps immigrants contribute more to the economy through improved productivity and entrepreneurial endeavors. \"Chain migration\" describes the self-perpetuating flow of family-based immigration. Family-based immigration can lead to self-perpetuating migration flows as immigrants sponsor relatives, creating a chain of new immigrants. Critics argue this could result in significant population growth from a single lawful permanent resident. Family-based immigration can lead to self-perpetuating migration flows as immigrants sponsor relatives, creating a chain of new immigrants. Theodore Hesburgh illustrated in 1981 how a single foreign-born married couple could potentially lead to 84 eligible visa applicants through family sponsorship. Empirical studies suggest more modest effects in terms of immigrant multipliers. Carr and Tienda's analyses estimate multipliers for recent cohorts of immigrants who acquired LPR status from 1980 to 2000. In a study on chain migration, Tienda estimated immigration multipliers for different countries, with the highest being 6.38 for the Philippines. This analysis is relevant for current discussions on chain migration. Recent studies show that not all eligible LPRs choose to naturalize for U.S. citizenship, impacting family-sponsored immigration. Individual and macro-level factors influence decisions to emigrate or naturalize. Long visa wait times hinder family-based immigration, with estimates of multipliers varying by country and period. Legislative options are being considered to address policy issues related to family-based immigration. Policy issues surrounding family-based immigration have been debated by scholars and policymakers, including supply-demand imbalance, per-country ceilings, limitations on foreign nationals visiting U.S.-based relatives, and policies towards unaccompanied alien children. The broader policy question is whether to expand, contract, or revise legal immigration levels, focusing on family categories as numerically limited or unlimited, and adjusting numerical limits and preference categories. Recent legislative proposals have focused on altering permanent immigration levels, including reclassifying spouses and minor unmarried children of LPRs as immediate relatives to exempt them from numerical limits. S. 744 and S. 1720 are examples of bills introduced in Congress to reform immigration policies. The RAISE Act aims to reduce family-sponsored immigration and eliminate the immigrant visa queue, while another proposal seeks to provide additional visas for pending immigrants to receive LPR status within seven years. These proposals reflect different perspectives on U.S. immigration policy goals."
