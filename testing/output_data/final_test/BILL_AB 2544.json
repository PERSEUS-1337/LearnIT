    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Access to Angel Investors Act aims to improve access to capital by amending the Revenue and Taxation Code to require limited liability companies in California to pay an annual tax for the privilege of doing business in the state. Limited liability companies in California must pay an annual tax if articles of organization have been accepted by the Secretary of State, until a certificate of cancellation is filed. If a taxpayer files a final return with the Franchise Tax Board, they will be notified that the annual tax continues until a certificate of dissolution or cancellation is filed with the Secretary of State. The tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month of the taxable year for limited liability companies not taxed as corporations in California. A limited liability company is exempt from tax if it meets certain criteria, such as being classified as a partnership for California income tax purposes and having at least 90% of its total assets consist of qualifying investment securities. A qualified investment partnership must meet specific criteria to be exempt from tax, including having 90% of its gross income from interest, dividends, and gains from qualifying investment securities. The partnership must file a partnership return for the taxable year as required by the Internal Revenue Code. A qualified investment partnership exempt from federal tax must file an information return with the Franchise Tax Board. If a limited liability company is canceled, it will be treated as a corporation for tax purposes, with no reimbursement for taxes or fees already paid. A small business LLC owned by a deployed member of the US Armed Forces is exempt from tax if it operates at a loss or ceases operation during deployment. The Franchise Tax Board can define \"ceases operation\" and \"deployed\" excludes training or permanent change of station. The text explains that a small business LLC owned by a deployed member of the US Armed Forces is exempt from tax if it operates at a loss or ceases operation during deployment. The definition of \"ceases operation\" excludes training or a permanent change of station. The act also specifies that a small business is defined as a limited liability company with total income of $250,000 or less. This provision will become inoperative for taxable years starting on or after January 1, 2018. The act provides for a tax levy in California and will take immediate effect."
