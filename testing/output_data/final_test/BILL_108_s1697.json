    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Elderly Housing Plus Health Support Demonstration Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. Congress finds that there is a significant and growing elderly population in the United States, with projections showing a doubling to 70,000,000 persons by 2030. Vulnerable groups such as women, minorities, and those over 85 are at risk due to housing and economic challenges. The elderly population in public housing is older, poorer, frailer, and more racially diverse than those in other assisted housing. Two-thirds of public housing developments for the elderly were built before 1970 and require major rehabilitation for new roofs, energy-efficient systems, and safety features. Many public housing units for elderly and disabled individuals are undersized, lack accessibility features, and do not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. A study found that over $5.7 billion is needed for basic modernization of public housing for this demographic. The lack of supportive services and assisted living facilities in residences is leading to unnecessary institutionalization for many elderly and disabled individuals. Many elderly and disabled individuals prefer independent living in non-institutional settings to costly institutionalization. Congregate housing with supportive services is a cost-effective way to help them stay independent. Redesigning public housing units is necessary for effective provision of congregate services and assisted living. Most elderly in public housing are eligible for Medicaid to cover their costs. The Act aims to establish a program for competitive grants to provide health-supportive housing with assisted living options for elderly and disabled individuals. It also aims to fund the enhancement and accessibility of public housing for this purpose. This initiative could potentially save Medicaid costs and allow seniors to age in place. The Act aims to improve public housing for the elderly and disabled by increasing accessibility to supportive services, providing living arrangement choices, incorporating congregate housing programs, and utilizing existing provisions of law for funding. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, an assisted living facility is defined as a public housing project for the elderly or elderly and disabled individuals, providing services such as meal service, housekeeping aid, personal assistance, transportation, health-related services, and other services for independent living. Elderly and disabled families are those with at least one elderly person or person with disabilities. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the elderly and persons with disabilities in the context of public housing, including the definitions of elderly person, person with disabilities, public housing agency, and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The Secretary will establish an elderly housing plus health support program to provide coordinated funding for public housing projects for elderly and disabled families. This includes rehabilitation, provision of space for supportive services and health facilities, service coordinators, and congregate services programs. The Secretary will establish a program for elderly housing and health support, including funding for public housing projects, rehabilitation, supportive services, health facilities, service coordinators, and congregate services programs. To be eligible for the demonstration program, a public housing agency must submit an application and plan to the Secretary. The plan must identify public housing projects for elderly or disabled families and include provisions for health-related services. The Secretary selects public housing agencies based on competition and criteria like rehabilitation needs and past performance in serving residents. The selection criteria for public housing agencies include past performance in serving elderly and disabled residents, obtaining resources, and effectiveness in creating services. SEC. 6. CONFIGURATION AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. The Secretary will provide grants to public housing agencies for capital improvements, supportive services, and acquisition of assisted living facilities for elderly housing conversion. Grants for capital improvements, supportive services, and acquisition of assisted living facilities for elderly housing conversion will be allocated among public housing agencies based on established criteria. The Secretary will determine the amounts and terms of the grants, funded from available demonstration program funds. Section 9(c)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 does not apply to grants under this section. The demonstration program will receive $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and additional funds as needed for fiscal year 2005 onwards. SEC. 7. SERVICE COORDINATORS. The Secretary will provide grants to public housing agencies for elderly and disabled families, specifically for public housing projects and service coordinators. Grants will be funded from the demonstration program. The Secretary will provide grants to public housing agencies for elderly and disabled families for public housing projects and service coordinators. Grants will not exceed $100,000 per agency and are authorized appropriations of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding for subsequent years. SEC. 8. CONGREGATE HOUSING SERVICES PROGRAMS. The Secretary will provide grants to public housing agencies for elderly and disabled families in connection with public housing projects. The grants will also support congregate housing service programs as outlined in the agency's plan. Funding for the grants will come from the demonstration program funds.
