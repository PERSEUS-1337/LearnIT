    "content": "The Act titled \"High-Need Physician Workforce Incentives Act of 2007\" amends the Public Health Service Act to include a Scholarship Program for High-Need Physician Specialty Workforce Incentives. The section aims to address physician shortages in key medical fields through grants for scholarship programs at critical shortage health facilities. Recipients of the grants must provide scholarships to eligible individuals enrolled in medical schools for up to four years. The scholarship program requires recipients to maintain academic standing, complete a residency in specific medical fields, and serve as a physician at a designated facility for a period based on the years of scholarship received. The amount of scholarship paid to individuals is determined by the health facility. The scholarship amount for an individual is capped at $30,000 per school year. The health facility considers financial need, geographic differences, and educational costs when determining the scholarship amount. Any scholarship received is excluded from gross income. The program established under this section follows certain provisions similar to the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program. The National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program defines critical shortage health facilities and eligible individuals. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. \"SEC. 776. LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.\" The purpose of this section is to address physician shortages in specific fields by establishing a loan repayment program for individuals who agree to serve in areas with critical physician shortages.

The care management model described in paragraph (5) targets underserved, special needs, or high-risk patients who lack health insurance or are eligible for medical assistance under title XIX or child health assistance under title XXI of the Social Security Act. The care management model in paragraph (3)(B) utilizes health information technology and physician-practice innovations to enhance patient care coordination.

Patients actively participate in decision-making, take personal responsibility for their health, utilize information technology for optimal care, and engage in quality improvement activities. States must determine the amount of care management fees for grants. The Secretary will issue guidance for determining care management fees under the grant, considering implementation costs, physician time, and training for compliance. This includes recognizing the value of non-face-to-face patient care activities like educating caregivers and arranging follow-up services.
