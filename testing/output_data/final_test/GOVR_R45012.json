    "content": "Division A of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act extends funding for various public health programs, with details available in CRS reports. Most programs had funding until FY2017, except for two. Funding for FY2017 was the last year of appropriated funding, with exceptions for the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Payment Program and the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. The Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 provided funding for these programs through December 31, 2017. Division A of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act includes provisions for offsets, such as changes to the qualified health plan grace period requirement and reductions to the Prevention and Public Health Fund. The health center program, authorized by Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, provides grants to operate outpatient health centers in medically underserved areas. Grants are awarded competitively, with preference for rural sites. The program includes grants for health center operations, expanding services, and quality improvement activities, supporting community health centers. The center program supports four types of health centers: community health centers, health centers for the homeless, health centers for residents of public housing, and migrant health centers. Community health centers are the most numerous and serve an underserved population. All four types of health centers provide primary health services, preventive and emergency health services, including diagnostic laboratory and radiology services. Preventive health services offered include well-child care, prenatal and postpartum care, immunization, family planning, health education. Health centers provide primary health services, preventive and emergency health services, including diagnostic laboratory and radiology services. They also offer well-child care, prenatal and postpartum care, immunization, family planning, health education, preventive dental care, behavioral health services, and environmental health services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act created the Community Health Center Fund, providing mandatory funding for the program. The ACA allocated $9.5 billion to the Community Health Center Fund from FY2011 to FY2015, with subsequent funding extensions through FY2017. This fund comprises a significant portion of health center programs' appropriations and also supports the National Health Service Corps, offering scholarships and loan repayments to health professionals in underserved areas. The ACA created the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program (THCGME) with funding allocated for FY2011 through FY2017. This program provides GME payments to support medical and dental residents training at qualified teaching health centers. The Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program (THCGME) was funded through FY2017 for direct and indirect GME payments. MACRA funds supported existing teaching health center programs, with no new centers added. Funding was extended for the first quarter of FY2018. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) administers these programs. The provision extended funding for health centers in FY2018 and FY2019, providing $3.6 billion each year and making changes to the program. The provision in the health center program would make changes to grants and references related to substance use disorders. It would delete authorizations for certain grant programs, eliminate a loan guarantee program, and allow the Secretary to provide supplemental funding for existing centers to implement evidence-based models for improving access. The provision authorizes supplemental funding awards for existing health centers to implement evidence-based models for improving access to high-quality primary care services, including care delivery improvements, workforce changes, cost reduction, care coordination, telehealth utilization, and integration of primary care and behavioral health services. The Secretary may consider applicants' plans for continuing quality improvement activities after funding ends and give special consideration to addressing access barriers in underserved areas. The provision aims to address barriers to access to care in areas with provider shortages by making changes to the operating grant program. This includes shortening the award period to one year for noncompliant entities and allowing grant funds to be used for data systems, training, and cost reduction activities. The provision aims to address barriers to access to care in areas with provider shortages by making changes to the operating grant program. This includes grants for \"New Access Points and Expanded Services\" to establish new delivery sites in underserved areas, with special consideration for rural populations. The provision aims to address barriers to access to care in underserved areas by making changes to the operating grant program. It would authorize the Secretary to consider grant applications for new delivery sites based on population needs and to approve grants for expanding health center capacity to provide primary and additional services, with special consideration for addressing emerging public health issues. The provision aims to address barriers to accessing care in underserved areas by increasing the availability of health services. It specifies a ratio for awards to health centers serving rural and urban populations and includes homeless veterans in grants for Health Centers for the Homeless. Applicants must describe unmet health service needs and consult with government agencies and healthcare providers. The provision aims to increase collaboration between health centers and other healthcare providers in the catchment area to reduce non-urgent use of hospital emergency departments. It also specifies requirements for approving the health center director and emphasizes the need for direct employment by the center. The provision would require health center employees to be directly employed by the center and implement written policies for federal fund use. It limits funds for technical assistance and operational support to 3% of the appropriation. The Secretary's authority to waive auditing requirements would be restricted to one year. The provision also amends the health center funding report to specify recipients and include funding distribution details. The provision includes funding for health centers to participate in the \"All of Us Research Program\" and extends funding for the NHSC. It also makes changes to the Teaching Health Center GME Program. The provision for the Teaching Health Center GME Program includes funding to support current and new residents in existing and new programs, with a preference for programs in underserved areas. Funding would increase to $126.5 million for FY2018 and FY2019, with restrictions on administrative costs. Reporting requirements would be amended to include data on care volume and graduated residents. The provision for the Teaching Health Center GME Program includes funding to support current and new residents in existing and new programs, with a preference for underserved areas. It requires reporting on graduated residents entering primary care practice, including those in HPSAs, MUAs, or rural areas. The HHS Secretary must submit a report on expenses related to teaching residents at health centers by March 31, 2019. The provision also applies restrictions on abortion funding to health centers, the NHSC, and qualified teaching health centers for FY2018. The Special Diabetes Program provides funding for research into Type I diabetes prevention and treatment. Created in 1997, the program's funding has been extended and increased over the years, with recent funding of $150 million for each program in FY2016 and FY2017. The Special Diabetes Program for Indians received $37.5 million in funding for the first quarter of FY2018. The provision extends funding for Type I Diabetes and Indians at $150 million annually for FY2018 and FY2019. The Family-to-Family Health Information Centers program funds centers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to support families of children with special health care needs. The Family-to-Family Health Information Centers program provides support to families of children with special health care needs and health professionals. It was established in 2005 under the Deficit Reduction Act and receives annual appropriations. The program's funding was extended in MACRA, with $6 million allocated for FY2018 and FY2019. The provision also mandates the development of centers in territories and at least one center in each. The 1996 welfare reform law established the Title V Abstinence Education Grant program to fund states and territories in providing abstinence education. The program focuses on groups most likely to bear children out-of-wedlock and is funded through mandatory spending, receiving $50 million per year for five years. The Title V Abstinence Education Grant program was established in 1996 to fund states and territories in providing abstinence education. The program received $50 million per year for five years and was later increased to $75 million per year for FY2016 and FY2017 through MACRA. Funds must be used exclusively for teaching abstinence and promoting the benefits of abstaining from sexual activity. The Title V Abstinence Education Grant program funds states and territories to promote abstinence education within marriage as the standard for sexual activity. It emphasizes the harmful effects of sexual activity outside of marriage, bearing children out-of-wedlock, and the importance of self-sufficiency before engaging in sex. States can request funds by applying for Maternal and Child Health Block Grant funds. In FY2017, 37 states and two territories applied for Abstinence Education funding through the Title V Abstinence Education Grant program. Funds are allocated based on the proportion of low-income children in each jurisdiction, and states can make sub-awards to local organizations focusing on youth in specific areas. The FY2015 appropriations law allowed for reallocation of funds to states that did not apply for the grants. The FY2015 education funds were available only to states that applied for implementing \"abstinence education.\" MACRA extended this language to program funding for FY2016 and FY2017. Title V of the Social Security Act specifies that certain sections apply to Abstinence Education allotments, with the HHS Secretary determining the applicability of other sections. Evaluation activities for the Abstinence Education program are not addressed in Title V. Title V of the Social Security Act does not address evaluation activities for the Abstinence Education Grant program. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 directed HHS to conduct evaluation activities for the Title V Abstinence Education program. Section 104 proposes renaming the program as the Youth Empowerment program and includes new provisions for funding, financial allotments, educational elements, research, data, and evaluation. The bill would provide $75 million in mandatory spending for each of FY2018 and FY2019, with up to 20% reserved for program administration. Effective date for changes would be retroactive to October 1, 2017. Section 104 of the bill proposes renaming the Abstinence Education Grant program to the Youth Empowerment program. It includes provisions for funding, financial allotments, and evaluation. HHS would conduct a national evaluation of the program and provide technical assistance to states. Funding would be based on the amount appropriated minus administrative costs, with funds allocated based on states' proportion of low-income children. HHS could competitively award funds to entities in states that did not apply for funding. The Youth Empowerment program funds would be available for states or entities to implement sexual risk avoidance education, which must be medically accurate, age-appropriate, and based on adolescent learning theories. Sexual risk avoidance education for youth should focus on promoting optimal health behavior by avoiding nonmarital sexual activity. Topics include personal responsibility, goal setting, refraining from sexual activity to improve future prospects, avoiding poverty, healthy relationships, and the impact on forming healthy marriages and families. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of sexual risk avoidance education for youth, emphasizing the impact on forming healthy marriages and families. It also addresses the connection between other risky behaviors like drug and alcohol use and teen sex. The chunk specifies that any contraception information included in the education must be medically accurate and highlights the limitations of contraception in reducing physical risk. Additionally, it mentions the allocation of funding for research on sexual risk avoidance. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for rigorous research and evaluations in the Youth Empowerment program, with reports to be submitted to HHS. The evaluation would involve consultation with state and local agencies, and a report would be submitted to Congress. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) under Title V of the Social Security Act, which aims to educate adolescents on abstinence and contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and STIs. ACA provided $75 million annually for five fiscal years, and PREP funding is available to all states, the District of Columbia, and territories. The Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) funding is available to all states, the District of Columbia, and territories based on a formula allocation. States or territories that did not apply for funding in previous years can still have local organizations competitively apply for grants. HHS provides three-year grants for programs that would have been carried out by the state, known as Competitive PREP grants. Additionally, HHS offers PREP grants to Indian tribes and tribal organizations (Tribal PREP) and grants for innovative strategies (PREIS). The PREIS grants support projects educating American Indian and Alaska Native youth on abstinence and contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and STIs. It aims to build evidence on teen pregnancy prevention programs for high-risk and vulnerable youth populations, including those in foster care, homeless youth, youth with HIV/AIDS, pregnant and parenting women under 21, and youth in high birth rate areas. Section 104 allocates $75 million for PREP in FY2018 and FY2019, extends Competitive PREP grants to FY2019, and includes victims of human trafficking as high-risk individuals. Section 104 of the ACA specifies that victims of human trafficking are considered high-risk, vulnerable, and culturally underrepresented youth for the PREIS program. The amendments are retroactively effective as of October 1, 2017. ACA Section 1412(c)(2)(B)(iv)(II) eliminates the three-month grace period for qualified health plan issuers to discontinue coverage for nonpayment of premiums, replacing it with a new grace period provision. The grace period is three months for plan years before January 1, 2018, and for plan years on or after. The Comptroller General would be required to submit a report to Congress on the effects of aligning grace periods under Medicaid, Medicare, and the exchanges, and the extent to which such alignment may reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicaid program. ACA Section 4002 established the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF), to be administered by the HHS Secretary, and provided it with a permanent annual appropriation to support prevention and public health programs. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was established under ACA Section 4002 with a permanent annual appropriation to support prevention and public health programs. The PPHF's annual appropriation increased from $500 million for FY2010 to $2 billion for FY2015 and subsequent years. Congress has amended the provision multiple times, with appropriations ranging from $500 million to $2 billion for various fiscal years. Section 202 would repeal $7.4 billion in appropriations from FY2019 through FY2027. Amend ACA Section 4002(b) to decrease appropriations by $7.4 billion from FY2019 to FY2027, without affecting FY2018 funds already distributed."
