    "title": "AB 1978",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Part 4.2 of the Labor Code, Section 1420, introduces Property Service Workers Protection. A \"covered worker\" is defined as a janitor, excluding those involved in final cleanup of construction projects. A \"current and valid registration\" refers to an active registration under this part. The Department of Industrial Relations is referred to as the \"department.\" The Department of Industrial Relations is defined as the Department, and the Director is defined as the Director of Industrial Relations. An Employer is any person or entity that employs at least one employee and one or more covered workers for janitorial services. Covered successor employer is an employer meeting specific criteria. A covered successor employer is defined as an employer who uses substantially the same equipment, supervisors, and workforce to offer the same services to the same clients as a predecessor employer, with exceptions for workforce maintained under specific regulations. An employer with a current and valid registration for at least three years is not considered a covered successor employer if certain conditions are met. The successor employer must not have had any connection with the predecessor employer's business in the past three years. Immediate family members of individuals with a financial interest in the predecessor employer are also included. The definitions of \"Commissioner\" and \"Supervisor\" are provided. Every employer must maintain accurate records for three years, including employee names, addresses, hours worked, wages, age of minor employees, and other employment conditions. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement enforces these regulations, and employers must register annually with the commissioner starting July 1, 2018. Effective July 1, 2018, employers must register annually with the commissioner. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement will provide information on business administration and labor laws when issuing or renewing registration. Employers covered by this regulation must give all workers a copy of the DFEH-185 pamphlet on sexual harassment until the training requirement is established. Proof of registration is required with an official form from the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement sends renewal notices to registrants 60 days before registration expiration. Failure to receive the notice does not excuse timely renewal. An initial nonrefundable application fee of $500 and an annual fee of $500 are required from each employer. The fees may be adjusted to cover administrative costs. An employer must comply with registration requirements to conduct business. The commissioner can revoke registration for non-compliance. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement must approve registration after certain conditions are met, including submitting a written application with business details. The required information for business registration includes the date of incorporation, state of incorporation, filing date with the California Secretary of State for foreign corporations, good standing status with the California Secretary of State, employer identification numbers, business address and contact details, type of registration, prior registration number for renewals, and personal details of corporate officers and management personnel. The required information for business registration includes details of financial interests, workers' compensation coverage, unpaid wages, outstanding judgments, pending liens or suits, and tax obligations for the employer and relevant persons. Applicants must provide additional information on unpaid amounts and penalties assessed for violations of the code by the employer or relevant persons. This includes details such as the name and address of the party owed, amount owed, payment arrangements, date and nature of citations, penalties assessed, and disposition of citations. Any appeals filed and payment status of penalties must also be disclosed. Effective January 1, 2020, new registration applications must complete sexual violence and harassment prevention training as required by the division. A registration fee must be paid to the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement. Violation of this requirement is not a criminal offense. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement will establish a biennial in-person sexual violence and harassment prevention training requirement for employees and employers by January 1, 2019. An advisory committee will be convened to recommend training program requirements, composed of various representatives including those from labor-management groups, sexual assault victims advocacy groups, and other subject matter experts. The committee will be convened by July 1, 2017. The advisory committee will develop recommended standards by July 1, 2017, considering the requirements of Section 12950.1 of the Government Code. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement will propose the sexual violence and harassment prevention training requirements by January 1, 2018. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement will not register or renew an employer if they have unpaid wages, failed to remit required contributions, or failed to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes. The commissioner maintains a public database of property service employers with registration details on the department's website. Employers who fail to register are subject to a civil fine of $100 per day, up to $10,000. Any person or entity contracting with an employer without a valid registration for janitorial services faces fines ranging from $2,000 to $25,000. Enforcement is solely under the commissioner's authority, following procedures outlined in Section 1197.1. All registration fees and fines collected are deposited in the Labor Enforcement and Compliance Fund for specific purposes related to administering janitorial contractor registrations and enforcing labor standards. The annual renewal fee is set to cover direct and indirect costs of administration. A successor employer is responsible for unpaid wages and penalties owed by a predecessor employer to former employees if the successor employer meets specific criteria related to workforce, ownership, management, or family ties."
