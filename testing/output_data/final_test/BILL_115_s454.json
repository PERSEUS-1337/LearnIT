    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commonsense Legislative Exceptional Events Reforms Act of 2017\" and pertains to the Clean Air Act exceptional events. Section 319(b) of the Clean Air Act is amended to include criteria for determination of exceptional event demonstration. The Clean Air Act's Section 319(b) is amended to include specific criteria for exceptional event demonstration approval or disapproval, minimizing the Administrator's discretion. Criteria development involves input from States to accommodate varying technical expertise and resources at State and local agencies. The Administrator shall consider expedited approval processes and conditions for exceptional event demonstrations, with a deadline of 90 days for determination after submission. After 90 days, the Administrator must approve, disapprove, or request more information on an exceptional event demonstration from a State. If no action is taken within this period, the demonstration is automatically approved. The Administrator must approve or disapprove an exceptional event demonstration within 90 days of receiving additional information from a State. If no action is taken within this period, the demonstration is automatically approved. If the Administrator does not approve or disapprove a demonstration within 90 days of receiving additional information, it will be considered approved. The regulations require the Administrator to base their decision on a preponderance of evidence for exceptional event demonstrations. The Administrator gives substantial deference to State findings in exceptional event demonstrations. The EPA can use additional analyses and evidence not provided in the demonstration, as long as it is developed by the EPA. Disapproval by the Administrator of a demonstration is final unless specified otherwise. Approval by the Administrator of an exceptional event demonstration is final and not subject to appeal or judicial action. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must revise regulations under the Clean Air Act within 180 days of this Act's enactment."
