The Act, titled the \"Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act,\" includes sections on modifications of foreign tax credit rules, limitations on deductions for oil and gas-related expenses, repeal of royalty relief on the outer Continental Shelf, and miscellaneous provisions for deficit reduction and budgetary effects. Congress finds that gas prices have risen significantly due to unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, leading to speculation and increased oil futures prices. High gas prices are negatively impacting the quality of life in the United States, affecting savings, jobs, and the economic recovery. Regulatory reforms to prevent energy market manipulation have been delayed, and the US is currently producing more oil than ever before. The United States is producing record amounts of oil, with companies holding abundant inventories. Despite this, the US still imports over 11 million barrels of oil per day. Domestic refining capacity exceeds demand, leading to increased idle refinery capacity. Oil companies are sitting on vast leased Federal lands with significant oil and natural gas reserves. The United States consumes 25% of the world's oil production despite having less than 2% of the world's proven oil reserves. The growing trade deficit in energy results in significant job and productivity losses. World oil prices are projected to remain high due to increasing global demand, especially from industrializing countries like China and India. OPEC's oil production policies also play a role in influencing prices. The United States economy is impacted by OPEC decisions as long as it relies on oil for energy consumption. Major oil companies have made significant profits and received tax breaks but have not invested much in clean and renewable fuel research. Congress increased fuel economy in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. In the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Congress increased fuel economy standards for the first time in 30 years and established requirements for domestic biofuels, reducing oil consumption and gas prices. The Senate expresses concern about high gas prices. The Senate commends the President for addressing high gas prices by taking actions such as promoting domestic production, investigating price gouging, setting a national oil savings goal, increasing electric vehicles, and harmonizing fuel standards. The Senate supports the President's efforts to address high gas prices by setting national oil savings goals, promoting electric vehicles, and expanding the use of alternative fuels like natural gas. Congress should also enact provisions to encourage responsible actions. The Senate aims to encourage responsible development of domestic oil and gas resources, eliminate subsidies for major oil companies, promote research on alternative fuels, provide more choices at the pump, and implement energy consumer protection requirements. The Consumer Protection Act emphasizes the need for OPEC to stabilize oil markets and reduce gasoline prices for US consumers. It also highlights the importance of reducing US dependency on oil for economic, environmental, and national security reasons. SEC. 101.
