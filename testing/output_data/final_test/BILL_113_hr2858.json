The duties of the new Wildland Firefighter occupational series include significant wildfire preparedness and suppression activities, as well as activities for other emergency incidents. Congress encourages consultation with employee organizations representing Federal wildland firefighters. This does not affect the Hazardous Duty Differential for employees in the wildland firefighting occupational series. Employees currently in the 401 series who are wildland firefighters have the option to remain in the current series or be included in the new wildland firefighter series established by the Office. The new wildland firefighter series established by the Office includes pay and benefits. The new wildland firefighter series established by the Office includes a Portal-to-Portal Compensation Pilot Program for overtime work during emergency incidents. The portal-to-portal compensation pilot program for wildland firefighters during emergency incidents includes amending title 5 of the United States Code and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide overtime pay at one and a half times the hourly rate as premium pay. The pilot program for wildland firefighters under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 allows for premium pay and exempts violations if program requirements are met. The program will be conducted by the Department of the Interior and Agriculture for a maximum of 3 years starting from the 2014 wildfire season.

In amendments to the code, subparagraphs were adjusted and a new subparagraph (I) was added regarding pay differentials for wildland firefighters. Additionally, a conforming amendment was made to section 8331(3). In the administration of hazardous duty differentials under section 5545(d), certain provisions apply. In the administration of section 5545(d) of title 5, United States Code, the Office of Personnel Management ensures a 25 percent pay differential for individuals serving on wildland firefighting crews, including ground and airborne personnel. Any individual subject to the Federal Employees' Retirement System as a firefighter on the date of the enactment of this Act is entitled to have qualifying firefighter service treated as creditable service. Qualifying firefighter service refers to service performed as a wildland firefighter after 1989 and before the date of the enactment of this Act. Any firefighter under the Federal Employees' Retirement System can receive credit for qualifying firefighter service performed after 1989. To receive credit, the individual must make a deposit equal to employee contributions required for that period. The Office of Personnel Management will accept certification from the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture regarding qualifying firefighter service. The length of the period of qualifying firefighter service performed by an individual is important for determining eligibility."
