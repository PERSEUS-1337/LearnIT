The United States Army Command and General Staff College, established in 1881, has been instrumental in educating and training officers for 127 years. It has significantly impacted battlefields by equipping officers with essential skills for effective command and staff actions, contributing to the nation's success in conflicts and preserving its freedoms. The United States Army Command and General Staff College, the oldest military staff college in the nation, lacks a commemorative coin to celebrate its history and the service of its graduates in war and peace. Located in the American heartland, it continues to educate officers from all branches of the military, as well as members of the civil government and allied nations. The Command and General Staff College Foundation is dedicated to promoting excellence in the faculty and students of the United States Army Command and General Staff College. They seek to educate citizens about the selfless service of military officers and instill pride in military leadership. The Command and General Staff College Foundation is a nongovernmental organization that supports the United States Army Command and General Staff College through funding from members, donations, and grants. They aim to provide the Margin of Excellence to the College's programs and activities for the educational needs of the Nation's field grade officer corps. The Foundation is currently in the initial stages of its first capital campaign to support the College.

He entered the Army from the Virginia Military Institute in 1902 and was regarded as one of the most talented staff officers in the United States Army during World War I. During World War II, General George C. Marshall was recognized as one of America's greatest military leaders and played a key role in directing the Allied Powers to victory. He later served as Secretary of State for the United States and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his European Recovery Program. General Henry H. Arnold, known as \"Hap,\" was the only officer in U.S. history to hold the ranks of General of the Army and General of the Air Force. He graduated from West Point in 1907 and received pilot training from the Wright brothers in 1911. General Henry H. Arnold, also known as \"Hap,\" was a strong advocate for air power and held numerous flying records, including the first delivery of United States mail by air. His contributions heavily influenced accomplishments in World Wars, particularly in World War II, where massed air power played a crucial role in battles and denied the enemy mobility on the ground. One of his citations praised his leadership in guiding the mightiest air force in history. General Arnold's leadership guided the mightiest air force in history. General Dwight D. Eisenhower had a distinguished career in military and civil leadership, leading the invasion of North Africa during World War II and later becoming the Supreme Allied Commander for the invasion of Europe.

He was instrumental in the development of NATO and later became the 34th President of the United States. Eisenhower also served as a tactical instructor officer and student at Ft. Leavenworth. General Omar N. Bradley, a distinguished military leader, was recognized for his exceptional leadership and tactical skills. He developed the officer candidate program at the Infantry School, commissioning over 45,000 combat leaders in World War II. Bradley successfully commanded various military units and played a crucial role in defeating German forces in North Africa and Sicily. General Omar N. Bradley's successful career as a field commander peaked when he greatly assisted in the liberation of Europe as commander of the 12th Army Group, which had the largest number of American soldiers under one commander. He later became the Army Chief of Staff in 1948 and the first Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1949. Additionally, he attended the Command and General Staff College at Ft.
