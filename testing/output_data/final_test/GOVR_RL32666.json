    "content": "Technological advancements and investments by major oil companies indicate that the gas to liquids industry (GTL) is expected to grow significantly in the next decade, potentially becoming a major consumer of natural gas. This growth may lead to competition with the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry for natural gas supply, potentially resulting in higher prices for consumers. The United States is projected to increase its natural gas consumption by 18.6% to 26.1 trillion cubic feet per year by 2030, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects a significant increase in LNG imports to the United States to meet the rising demand for natural gas. Despite drawbacks such as high capital costs and political instability in some producing nations, the expansion of LNG consumption is expected to continue. The belief in large untapped natural gas reserves globally provides optimism for stable supply in the future. The report analyzes the GTL industry as a potential competitor to LNG for natural gas supplies. While GTL may reduce natural gas availability, leading to higher prices in U.S. markets, it mainly produces liquid petroleum products. This could pose challenges for the projected increase in LNG dependency. The GTL industry is seen as an alternative to oil refining, with technology dating back to 1923. It converts natural gas to a hydrocarbon mixture that can be upgraded into petroleum products. This process was used during World War II by Germany and Japan, and in the 1960s by South Africa using coal. The GTL industry, dating back to 1923, converts natural gas to petroleum products. South Africa used coal in the 1960s for GTL production at the Mossel Bay facility. The plant has a capacity of 22,500 barrels per day. Various companies explored and developed FT technology for synthetic fuels from the 1960s to the 1990s, achieving improvements in cost, efficiency, and plant scale. Today, enhanced catalyst design is a key focus. Enhanced catalyst design is a key factor in improving GTL production processes and reducing capital costs per barrel of product. Major oil companies like Shell, ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, ConnocoPhillips, and Marathon are investing in GTL technology, with potential capital cost reductions from $50,000 to $20,000 per barrel. This could result in approximately $2 billion for a new GTL facility. The capital costs for a GTL plant with a capacity of 100,000 bpd are around $2 billion, comparable to a new oil refinery in the US. Chevron estimates the cost of a 17,000 bpd GTL plant at $25,000 per bpd, with potential costs as low as $20,000 per bpd. Economies of scale could further reduce costs, but rising construction costs may offset this. Chevron also suggests that with natural gas at 50 cents per thousand cubic feet, cash costs of GTL production could be around $10 per barrel. The low price of natural gas used in Chevron's calculations highlights the importance of a large, economically stranded source of natural gas for GTL production. GTL is an attractive option for nations with large natural gas holdings, offering an alternative to traditional methods of gas distribution. GTL offers producing nations a third alternative to traditional gas distribution methods, allowing them to diversify their resources beyond natural gas markets. This diversification enables nations to compare rates of return from GTL and LNG before deciding on an investment strategy. The GTL industry's products, such as ultra-clean diesel fuel, do not compete with LNG in the natural gas market but rather with petroleum products. The GTL industry produces a desirable product mix of middle distillates, including ultra clean diesel fuel, which is in high demand due to the increasing market share of diesel vehicles and stricter air pollution regulations. GTL diesel fuel meets sulfur emission standards without additional processing, unlike crude oil-derived diesel. As global demand for ultra clean fuels rises, GTL investments are likely to be profitable with premium pricing. The GTL industry produces premium diesel fuel that meets environmental regulations, commanding high prices. However, the pricing of GTL-processed natural gas is more influenced by market fluctuations compared to pipeline natural gas or LNG. This market-induced price volatility poses a long-term risk for producing nations pursuing a GTL-based investment strategy. The value of diversification offered by the GTL industry lies in providing countries with undeveloped natural gas reserves expanded economic choices. The choice between LNG and GTL for utilizing natural gas reserves can impact profit margins. GTL offers a balanced return for both industries, but only large reserve holders can successfully develop both. Malaysia, Nigeria, and Qatar are currently involved in all three natural gas industries. Qatar has large reserves of natural gas and may become the key nation in both the GTL and LNG industries. The GTL industry is poised for a boom in investment, with high oil prices, technical advances, and environmental regulations driving growth. Investment projects are increasing, with major players like ExxonMobil, Shell, and Chevron announcing projects in Qatar. Several major companies, including Chevron and Qatar Petroleum, announced projects in Qatar to increase liquid petroleum product capacity to 750,000 bpd by 2011. Proprietary technologies were planned to be used for these projects, offering advantages over the basic FT process. The total capacity could reach 1 million bpd by 2010 with existing and planned projects in South Africa, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Australia. Large investments, such as ExxonMobil's $7 billion GTL plant and Shell's $5 billion GTL plant in Qatar, were reported. In 2003, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil planned to invest in GTL plants in Qatar with capacities of 180,000 bpd and 140,000 bpd respectively. Other projects with U.S. and foreign oil companies were also in progress. However, investment in GTL began to slow down in 2007, leading to the cancellation of ExxonMobil's and Algeria's GTL projects. Algeria announced the cancellation of its GTL project, Tinrhert, due to increasing construction costs in the petroleum industry. Cambridge Energy Associates reported a 50% cost increase in production projects since 2005, attributed to rising labor, equipment, facilities, and materials costs. Technological issues at the Oryx GTL joint venture in Qatar led to production below design capacity, requiring additional investment to reach target output of 34,000 barrels per day. The petroleum industry projects need to operate at design capacity to be profitable. Overactivity from 2001 to 2005 may have slowed down investment. Competition in the industry drives investment, and a balance between demand and supply evolves over time. The GTL industry competes with the LNG and petroleum refining industries, with economic feasibility dependent on oil prices not collapsing. A key price for GTL viability is estimated at around $20 per barrel. In 2001, refiners' acquisition cost for crude oil was approximately $24 per barrel, with uncertainty surrounding the $4 per barrel premium above the $20 per barrel minimum price for GTL feasibility. By August 2007, with crude oil trading at over $70 per barrel, the $20 per barrel minimum requirement for GTL feasibility seems less of an impediment. Comparative returns to LNG development also impact GTL economics, with LNG returns still adequate despite limited new project development in 2007. In 2007, few new LNG projects have started in producing nations, possibly indicating a shift towards GTL as an alternative. The feasibility of GTL is influenced by natural gas prices, which are negotiated between producing nations and investors. GTL investments are often funded by major energy companies in partnership with national oil companies or governments, allowing for preferential prices. The price difference between natural gas and diesel fuel in consuming nations also plays a role in GTL feasibility. The choice between GTL and LNG investment is influenced by the differential between natural gas and diesel fuel prices in consuming nations. Qatar is a preferred location for GTL projects due to its significant natural gas reserves and strategic shipping distances to major LNG markets in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Qatar is a preferred location for GTL projects due to its significant natural gas reserves. Nigeria and Australia, with large reserves as well, are not likely to support an industry as large as Qatar's. GTL facilities, like LNG facilities, require large natural gas reserves to operate at full capacity for economic feasibility. ExxonMobil's project in Qatar was expected to consume 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to produce petroleum products. The Royal Dutch/Shell facility in Qatar is expected to consume 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to produce 140,000 barrels of petroleum products. Extrapolating this to an industry producing 1 million barrels per day would require over 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas daily. This consumption rate is significantly higher than U.S. LNG import totals, equaling approximately 15% of total U.S. natural gas consumption in 2007. The GTL industry, consuming 15% of total U.S. natural gas in 2007, produces 1 million barrels per day of middle distillates. This output represents less than 3% of global middle distillates consumption in 2006. The industry's growth will impact energy markets, with prices potentially increasing or decreasing for consumers. GTL is an alternative to LNG for nations with stranded natural gas reserves, leading to competition and expansion in both industries. Producing nations will choose investments based on returns, leading to equalized risk-adjusted returns. The GTL industry's growth impacts energy markets by potentially increasing prices for consumers. Competition between GTL and LNG industries may lead to equalized risk-adjusted returns, with GTL potentially stabilizing natural gas prices at a higher level. LNG industry may not expand enough to drive prices down to production costs, and GTL investments could prevent over-supply of LNG in the U.S. market. The limited number of investing companies, mainly major oil firms, suggests that coordination rather than direct competition will result from GTL and LNG projects. GTL-based fuel may help encourage the shift from gasoline to diesel in the vehicle fleet, but GTL will still be a minor part of the world distillate market. The global crude oil market is tight, with even marginal supply affecting prices. Technological advancements in GTL products could lead to a strong market due to low sulfur content. A substantial GTL industry could reduce the need for investing in petroleum refining. The US refining market has been tight, with no new refineries built in decades. Importing liquid petroleum fuels from GTL facilities could meet growing demand, but at the cost of increased dependency on imports. The GTL industry is likely to attract large energy companies due to significant investment requirements. Competition for funding may lead to certain areas receiving less emphasis. Despite recent cancellations, technological advancements and favorable economics are driving increased investment activity in the industry. Producing nations have an interest in developing the GTL industry to reduce dependency on imports. The GTL industry is attracting major oil companies for multi-billion dollar investments in GTL and LNG facilities. The growth of the industry is likely due to forecasted rates of return and a receptive business environment, especially in Qatar. This rapid growth may have mixed implications for consuming nations, offering benefits like ultra clean diesel fuel. The availability of ultra clean diesel fuel from GTL industry is beneficial for relieving supply worries and moderating price increases. However, increased GTL production may lead to less LNG available on the world market, resulting in higher prices and less supply of natural gas. Consuming countries should consider developing other sources of natural gas to ensure supply and price stability."
