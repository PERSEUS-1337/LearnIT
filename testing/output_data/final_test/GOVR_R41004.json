They may evolve, converge, or alter their motivations and composition. The potential confluence of criminal and terrorist actors is a cause for concern, as it can prolong insurgencies, strengthen organizations, and challenge fragile governments' control. Some analysts have observed disturbing patterns accelerating the relationships between terrorist and transnational crime groups. Criminal syndicates are expanding in size, scope, and ambition, with a transnational reach and adaptability to new market niches. Terrorist organizations, especially those posing a threat to U.S. global interests, have also evolved in nature and activities. Terrorist groups today are motivated by religious imperatives, making them more resilient and expanding into criminal activities. This trend suggests increased geographic overlap where criminals and terrorists interact, blurring distinctions between the two and evolving objectives based on security challenges. Key interaction nodes include prisons and cyberspace. Key interaction nodes for criminals and terrorists include prisons, cyberspace, and ungoverned or difficult-to-govern spaces like regions with corruption, conflict, or post-conflict zones. Negligent or hostile governments and kleptocratic states may support criminal or terrorist activities. The U.S. government recognizes the significant interaction between terrorism, insurgency, and crime, impacting national security interests. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) reported to Congress that transnational organized crime and its links to international terrorism are major national security concerns. Areas of concern include nuclear proliferation, kidnapping for ransom, human smuggling, and illicit finance. Criminals and terrorists interact in various ways, including through prisons, cyberspace, and ungoverned regions. Negligent governments and kleptocratic states may support criminal or terrorist activities, impacting national security interests. Illicit finance is a major concern for national security as terrorists and insurgents are turning to crime for funding and logistics. The U.S. intelligence community has noted a significant increase in the size and influence of illicit networks internationally, with a crime-terror nexus identified as a key threat to U.S. national security. Terrorists and insurgents are increasingly relying on criminal activities for funding and logistical support, including drug trafficking and kidnapping for ransom. Some criminals may have the capability to provide weapons of mass destruction material to terrorist groups like Hizballah and al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb. The U.S. intelligence community is monitoring the expanding scope of facilitation networks that provide support services to criminal and terrorist groups. Over 40 foreign terrorist organizations have links to the drug trade, with some criminal organizations resorting to extreme violence to intimidate governments. The confluence of transnational organized crime and international terrorism is seen as a growing phenomenon. The U.S. intelligence community is observing the increasing connection between international organized crime and terrorism. Recent investigations show that criminals are providing support to terrorists, with a significant number of foreign terrorist organizations having confirmed links to the drug trade. DOJ and DEA reports indicate a high percentage of terrorist organizations involved in illicit narcotics activities. The State Department's 2012 Country Reports on Terrorism lists over 20 Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) that financially profit from criminal activities to sustain their operations. Some of these FTOs include Al Shabaab, AQAP, AQI, ASG, FARC, Hamas, Hezbollah, and PKK. Government studies have shown an increase in crime-terrorism interactions since the late 1990s, with terrorist groups, religious extremists, and global criminals forming new cooperative links. The end of the Cold War led some insurgent and extremist groups to turn to crime for funding as state sponsors diminished. The assessment found that crime-terrorism interactions have increased since the late 1990s, with some groups using criminal activity for funding and political objectives. The Obama Administration issued strategic documents to address this connection from national security, counterterrorism, anti-crime, and intelligence perspectives. In August 2009, the Obama Administration issued its National Intelligence Strategy with a focus on disrupting terrorist organizations and their criminal connections. The 2010 National Security Strategy emphasized combating transnational criminal threats and strengthening governance. The U.S. Department of Defense's 2011 Counternarcotics and Global Threats Strategy outlined efforts to address the crime-terror nexus internationally. The DOD strategy outlines an international security environment characterized by global networks of criminals and terrorists receiving support from corrupt government officials. It aims to disrupt trafficking, insurgency, corruption, threat finance, terrorism, and drug distribution in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Mexico, Central America, Colombia, and Peru. The Obama Administration's National Strategy for Counterterrorism aimed to deprive terrorists of their enabling means by blocking financial resources and preventing the movement of recruits and supplies across borders through sanctions, prosecutions, international cooperation, and diplomatic pressure. The Obama Administration's Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime in July 2011 aimed to defeat criminal networks threatening national security by targeting their infrastructures, preventing terrorist activities, enhancing intelligence collection, exposing financial system vulnerabilities, and establishing a plan to combat kidnapping for ransom. The Obama Administration's Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime in July 2011 focused on defeating criminal networks threatening national security by targeting their infrastructures and preventing terrorist activities. It aimed to establish a \"whole-of-government plan\" to combat kidnapping for ransom as a means to finance terrorists and develop a \"comprehensive approach\" to dismantling drug trafficking organizations with connections to terrorist groups. The strategy also emphasized enhancing foreign capabilities through counterterrorism capacity building, foreign law enforcement cooperation, military cooperation, and strengthening justice and interior ministries. Limited unclassified anecdotal evidence forms the basis for understanding criminal-terrorist connections, which can vary significantly and change over time. The text discusses common patterns of crime-terrorism links, highlighting how collaboration can strengthen both criminal and terrorist groups. It also mentions the potential risks of partnering, such as distrust and competition among illicit actors. The primary motivation for terrorist organizations to adopt criminal tactics is to sustain and grow the organization for their objectives. The organization may partner with criminal syndicates to sustain and grow for ideological activities, facing disincentives like government attention and internal security risks. Criminal syndicates cooperate for financial gain, but also fear authorities and infiltration. The risk of collaboration between criminal groups and terrorist organizations is influenced by factors such as the potential disruption of relationships with corrupt government officials, lack of in-house capabilities, and cultural or religious barriers. Other considerations include the operational environment, presence of competitors, and strength of relations between terrorist and criminal elements. Motivations for collaboration between terrorist and criminal groups may include greed, organizational viability, and ideological differences. Groups may transition along a crime-terrorism continuum, with some becoming attracted to lucrative criminal activities. Collaboration may also involve individuals not following leadership directives to avoid interactions with the other group. Some analysts suggest that collaboration between criminal organizations and terrorist groups is increasing due to decentralized structures. They share tactics such as terrorism, criminal activities for profit, money laundering, and illegal weapons acquisition. Changes in tactics may indicate organizational strength or ideological shifts. Under pressure, criminal groups may resort to violent attacks to intimidate, while terrorist groups without state sponsorship may seek new alliances. The loss of state sponsorship can lead terrorist groups to seek illicit funding and support. Both criminal and terrorist groups use violence for political impact, profit-driven crimes, and illicit activities. Examples include the Brazilian prison gang PCC using terrorist-style violence in 2006 and the Medellin cartel's violent attacks in response to counternarcotics pressure. The Colombian government and civilian targets were attacked, including a commercial airliner and a truck bomb. The Italian mafia targeted landmarks, politicians, and officials in response to law enforcement pressure. Drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico has surged due to increased counternarcotics pressure and DTO competition, resembling terrorist-style attacks with tactics of intimidation. Mexican government officials have been targeted by traffickers, sometimes in reprisal for cartel arrests. In May 2008, Edgar Millan Gomez, a high-ranking law enforcement official in Mexico, was assassinated by DTO-affiliated gunmen. Drug traffickers have used small IEDs against law enforcement officials suspected of working for rival gangs. Observers debate whether Mexican DTOs should be labeled as terrorist organizations due to their use of political violence. Most instances of violence by Mexican DTOs are not driven by ideology or a desire to overthrow the government, but rather to maintain impunity for their criminal activities. However, there have been exceptions, such as a deadly attack on Mexico's Independence Day in 2008, where drug traffickers were suspected to be involved. Some Mexican drug traffickers distance themselves from violent attacks, raising questions about their motives. Criminal activities, including a casino fire in 2011, may be used to fund terrorist organizations. Heightened international counterterrorism measures have pushed groups to generate funds through crime. Terrorist groups resort to criminal activities for funding, such as theft, extortion, and illicit trafficking. They may also tax other groups for allowing illegal activities in their controlled regions. Despite engaging in criminal acts, these groups do not always lose their ideological motivations. The universe of potential crime-for-profit activities is vast, including drug trafficking, cigarette smuggling, and kidnapping-for-ransom. Criminal and terrorist groups rely on illicit support activities, sometimes requiring cooperation with external specialists and facilitators. Some terrorist groups view links to criminal networks as short-term alliances for support. Criminal networks and terrorist groups form short-term alliances for support, with interactions ranging from transactional to synergistic. While criminals are driven by profit, terrorists are motivated by ideology, but their motivations can evolve over time. Some groups may shift towards criminality or adopt political goals. Some terrorist groups prioritize criminal activities over ideological operations, influenced by leadership changes and membership composition. ASG in the Philippines is an example of this shift towards crime. Other frequently cited terrorist organizations involved in criminal activity include Al Qaeda's affiliates, D-Company, PKK, FARC, Haqqani Network, and Hezbollah. ASG in the Philippines has seen changes in leadership and membership composition, leading to a shift towards criminal activities such as kidnappings, piracy, and arms trafficking. The group's focus on generating illicit profits has attracted new recruits more interested in financial gain than ideological beliefs. ASG has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) since 1997 and a specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) by President George W. Bush in 2001. There is no direct evidence linking senior Al Qaeda members to organized crime, possibly due to the group's strict ideological beliefs. Al Qaeda's affiliates and franchises, such as AQIM and AQI, are involved in organized crime activities despite Al Qaeda's aversion to direct involvement. Al Qaeda cooperates with insurgent groups like the Haqqani Network and the Taliban, which are more entrenched in criminal activities. The State Department designated Al Qaeda as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in 1999, and President George W. Bush designated it as a specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) in 2001. Several affiliates of Al Qaeda, including AQI, AQIM, and AQAP, have been designated as FTOs. Dawood Ibrahim, leader of D-Company, is wanted for the 1993 Mumbai bombing and is listed as a global terrorist. D-Company is a criminal syndicate aligned with terrorist groups like LeT in South Asia. D-Company, a criminal syndicate led by Dawood Ibrahim, originated as a smuggling operation in the 1970s and evolved into an organized crime group involved in insurgent activities. By the 1990s, it began supporting militant and terrorist groups by smuggling weapons and participating in terrorist attacks, including the 1993 Bombay bombing. The group's criminal activities include extortion, smuggling, narcotics trafficking, and contract killings, highlighting the risks of criminal and terrorist threats converging. The PKK, a group with Marxist-Leninist leanings, turned to crime after losing state sponsors. In the late 1990s, especially after leader Abdullah Ocalan's capture in 1999, the PKK heavily invested in transnational organized crime activities like drug trafficking, arms smuggling, and money laundering. Some parts of the PKK behave more like a criminal organization than a terrorist or guerrilla group, with activities centered in Europe due to a significant Kurdish diaspora population. The U.S. government designated the PKK as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in 1997 and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) in 2001. The FARC, a prominent terrorist organization in Latin America, has been involved in drug trafficking since the 1980s, initially through levying protection fees and later directly participating in drug production and distribution. This criminal activity has provided significant profits for the FARC, contributing to its longevity and strength. The FARC took a direct role in drug production and distribution, becoming the world's largest cocaine supplier by the 2000s. They also generate revenue from extortion, kidnapping, and illegal mining. Peace talks with the Colombian government since 2012 may impact their criminal activities. The Haqqani Network, based in Pakistan, is known for major attacks against NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, operating as both an insurgent group and a criminal organization. The Haqqani Network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani, has a history of involvement in both legitimate and illegal activities. Initially allied with the U.S. against the Soviet Union, they later joined the Taliban in Afghanistan. The group maintains connections with Al Qaeda, other militant groups, and allegedly benefits from a relationship with Pakistan's ISI. They fund their operations through extortion, robbery, kidnapping for ransom, and smuggling activities. The Haqqani Network, involved in illegal activities like kidnapping for ransom and smuggling, also controls legitimate businesses for money laundering. Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, has global cells and is funded by Iran and a network of businesses. Hezbollah, funded by Iran and involved in various illicit activities, has become integrated into transnational organized crime. This includes drug trafficking, counterfeit goods sales, diamond smuggling, and other criminal enterprises. Designated as a terrorist organization by the US, Hezbollah has ties to legitimate businesses and private donors. The response to crime-terrorism threats involves considering various policy options and key questions for policymakers. These include determining the leading agency for addressing such threats, allocating resources effectively, and avoiding duplication. Foreign policy responses to the crime-terrorism nexus are outlined for Congress to consider. The response to crime-terrorism threats involves various policy options and considerations for Congress. U.S. diplomatic efforts are led by the Department of State through bilateral, regional, and multilateral mechanisms. Relevant U.N. treaties include conventions against hostage-taking, terrorist bombings, financing of terrorism, transnational organized crime, and nuclear terrorism. The U.N. Security Council plays a role in addressing these threats. The United States participates in the Security Council Sanctions Committee to enforce sanctions against terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The U.S. government also maintains legal assistance treaties and extradition agreements with foreign countries for transnational investigations. Additionally, the State Department can designate entities as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and restrict entry of foreign terrorists into the U.S. The U.S. government utilizes various measures to combat terrorism, including participating in international bodies like the FATF and enforcing sanctions through the Security Council. Diplomacy plays a crucial role in addressing transnational crime-terrorism challenges. Diplomacy is crucial in combating crime-terrorism threats, but effectiveness is limited by delays in consensus agreements and gaps in foreign political will. U.S. departments and agencies train foreign law enforcement officials, develop legal frameworks, and support capacity building for security forces. Foreign assistance efforts to combat terrorism and crime can have mutual benefits, but caution is advised due to blurred lines between counterterrorism and anti-crime assistance. Foreign aid transparency challenges arise from assistance, potentially funding illicit groups in regions like Afghanistan. U.S. foreign police assistance is mainly through State and Defense Departments, supporting efforts against crime-terrorism threats like FARC in Colombia and Taliban in Afghanistan. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) are involved in developing justice sector and rule of law assistance programs in Afghanistan. DOJ maintains expertise through OPDAT and ICITAP to support foreign countries in investigating and prosecuting cases involving transnational crime and terrorism. U.S. federal prosecutors may serve as Resident Legal Advisors (RLAs) overseas to provide justice sector training and institution building. Congress determines the scope and amount of U.S. assistance for counterterrorism and anti-crime efforts. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, Title 10 of the U.S. Code, and National Defense Authorization Acts outline specific authorities for counterterrorism and anti-crime efforts. Unilateral and multilateral policy mechanisms, including financial sanctions by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, are used to block transactions and freeze assets of terrorist or criminal entities. Additional conditions may be included in appropriations acts for agencies administering foreign assistance. Eastern terrorist organizations, transnational criminal organizations, and narcotics traffickers threaten Middle East peace efforts. OFAC has authority to designate such entities under various laws, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the USA PATRIOT ACT. Special measures can be applied against designated jurisdictions and financial institutions. At the multilateral level, the United Nations administers sanctions programs to freeze funds related to terrorism, including Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Following money trails and applying financial sanctions to vulnerable sectors is crucial in combating crime and terrorism. Critics argue about the effectiveness of these tools in countering illicit financial activities. Critics question the effectiveness of tools used to counter illicit financial transactions, citing their laborious implementation and limited impact on dismantling crime or terrorism networks. Criminals and terrorists exploit various methods to move funds and conceal their financial activities, including traditional techniques like cash smuggling and modern technologies such as mobile banking and prepaid cards. The intelligence community's role in combating crime-terrorism threats remains largely undisclosed, but intelligence can aid in strategic analysis and operational efforts to address national security concerns. The 2009 National Intelligence Strategy prioritized addressing the nexus between terrorism and criminal activities. There have been concerns about gaps in intelligence collection related to transnational organized crime, leading to an incomplete understanding of relationships between terrorists and criminal actors. The Obama Administration's 2011 Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime acknowledged the need to enhance U.S. intelligence collection in this area. The 2011 Strategy emphasized enhancing U.S. intelligence on transnational organized crime and its connection to terrorism. Congressional hearings have also focused on these issues, potentially influencing the executive branch's approach. The U.S. military has been involved in joint counternarcotics and counterterrorism efforts in challenging security environments. The U.S. military has been involved in joint counternarcotics and counterterrorism efforts, with expanded operations in Colombia and Afghanistan targeting drug traffickers and terrorist organizations like FARC, ELN, AUC, and the Taliban. The U.S. military provides support in counternarcotics and counterterrorism operations, including rescuing hostages and engaging in lethal action. However, direct involvement is not always warranted due to political sensitivities and rules of engagement. Militarized anti-crime policies may risk escalating suppression tactics and human rights violations. Various U.S. departments are involved in these efforts. The U.S. Departments of Justice and Homeland Security investigate cases related to international terrorism and transnational crime. Agencies like the FBI, DEA, IOC-2, and ICE are involved in these efforts. Rewards programs are publicized for citizen tips leading to the apprehension of high-profile criminals. The nexus between crime and terrorism is seen as beneficial for detection and law enforcement. Prosecutors may use other criminal charges if there is insufficient evidence for terrorism-related charges. Drug trafficking violations can result in similar penalties to terrorism charges. The effectiveness of these law enforcement strategies in combating terrorism is unclear due to inconsistent tracking of cases with crime-terrorism connections. Congress may need to assess how existing statutes support investigations and prosecutions of entities suspected of terrorism-crime activities. The prosecution and sentencing data collected since 9/11 can inform Congress on effective statutes for addressing crime-terrorism partnerships. Policy issues on international crime and terrorism interactions are complex, with questions on handling these threats across multiple U.S. agencies. Efforts to combat transnational crime can impact counterterrorism policies, raising questions on prioritizing crime or terrorism aspects in cases with both elements present. Questions also remain on the links between crime and terrorism. Since 9/11, Congress has enacted landmark bills like the USA PATRIOT Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act to strengthen the U.S. government's ability to counter the convergence of organized crime and terrorism. The integration of links between terrorist-criminal activity and related U.S. policies across agencies remains a key issue. Since 9/11, Congress has passed laws like the USA PATRIOT Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act to combat organized crime and terrorism. Recent assessments show a connection between transnational crime and terrorism, impacting U.S. national interests. Congress may need to review current strategies, hold hearings, and adjust legislative authorities to address this issue. Key questions for Congress include evaluating the crime-terrorism nexus and potential policy responses. Key questions for Congress regarding the crime-terrorism nexus include the scope of the issue, types of crimes involved, threat posed by different groups, factors facilitating interaction between crime and terrorism, success in exploiting partnerships, lessons learned, challenges in disrupting threats, lead roles of government entities, and allocation of funds for addressing the issue. The State Department's descriptions of how foreign terrorist organizations raise funds and their involvement in criminal activities as a revenue source are summarized in a table. Among the 51 FTOs described, funding sources vary, including state sponsors, private donors, other terrorist groups, legitimate business activity, and proceeds of crime. Popular forms of criminal financing are also highlighted. Among the 51 foreign terrorist organizations, funding sources include state sponsors, private donors, legitimate business activity, and proceeds of crime. Criminal financing methods range from extortion to money laundering, with some groups having unknown funding sources."
