    "content": "The curr_chunk is a section header titled \"SHORT TITLE.\" The Act titled \"American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments of 1994\" recognizes the traditional ceremonial use of peyote by Indian tribes as a religious sacrament, which has been protected by Federal regulation since 1965. This practice is integral to Indian tribes' way of life and culture. The lack of uniformity in state laws regarding the ceremonial use of peyote by Indian religious practitioners has created hardship. The Supreme Court's decision in Employment Division v. Smith raised uncertainty about the protection of this religious practice. The inadequate legal protection for the religious use of peyote may stigmatize and marginalize Indian tribes and cultures. The use, possession, or transportation of peyote by Indians for traditional ceremonial purposes is lawful and protected from prohibition or discrimination. Regulation by the DEA is allowed, and certain state laws may still apply. The cultivation, harvest, and distribution of peyote are regulated for traditional ceremonial purposes. Federal departments can establish limitations on peyote use for law enforcement or safety-sensitive positions after consulting with representatives of traditional Indian religions. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act allows for a balancing test regarding access to peyote for Native Americans in prison. States can enforce traffic safety laws and the Secretary of Defense can establish limitations on peyote use in the military, all subject to the provisions of the Act. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act allows for regulations on the use of peyote in the military for safety and compliance with international law. Consultation with representatives of traditional Indian religions is required before adopting such regulations. The Act defines terms like 'Indian' as a member of an Indian tribe and 'Indian tribe' as any organized group of Indians eligible for special programs and services. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act defines 'Indian religion' as any religion practiced by Indians with origins in traditional Indian culture. It also clarifies that the Act does not affect the inherent rights of Indian tribes or the rights of Indians to practice their religions under federal or state law. The curr_chunk is about the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States, who also serves as the President of the Senate."
