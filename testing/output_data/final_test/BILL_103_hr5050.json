    "content": "The \"Paskenta Band Restoration Act\" defines key terms such as Tribe, Secretary, Interim Council, member, State, reservation, and service area for the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians of the Paskenta Rancheria of California. The \"Paskenta Band Restoration Act\" defines key terms for the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians of the Paskenta Rancheria of California, including the restoration of federal recognition, rights, and privileges. Federal recognition is extended to the Tribe, restoring all rights and privileges that were diminished or lost under previous laws. The Tribe and its members are eligible for federal services and benefits regardless of reservation status. The Tribe and its members are eligible for all Federal services and benefits available to federally recognized Indian tribes. Hunting, fishing, trapping, and water rights of the Tribe and its members are not affected by this Act. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 applies to the Tribe and its members, and property rights are not altered except as specified in the Act. The Act does not change any property rights, contractual obligations, or tax responsibilities. The Secretary is required to negotiate with the Tribe to establish an economic development plan, develop the plan within two years of the tribal constitution adoption, and submit it to Congress upon approval. Any real property transfer in the plan must comply with section 5 regarding land held in trust. The Secretary can accept real property in Tehama County, California for the Tribe if there are no legal claims, and it will be part of the Tribe's reservation. The property must be held in trust by the United States and be non-taxable. Real property conveyed to the Secretary for the benefit of the Tribe under this section is exempt from all local, State, and Federal taxation as of the date of such transfer. SEC. 6. MEMBERSHIP ROLLS. Within one year of the Act's enactment, the Secretary will compile a membership roll for the Tribe based on specific criteria including Nomlaki Indian ancestry and not being a member of another federally recognized tribe. After adoption of a tribal constitution, membership in the Paskenta Indian Tribe is governed by specific criteria, including being listed on the Paskenta Indian Rancheria distribution list or being identified as an Indian from Paskenta in official rolls. The Secretary will accept any available evidence establishing Paskenta Indian ancestry for membership purposes. The Paskenta Indian Tribe membership criteria include being listed on official rolls or the distribution list compiled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. SEC. 7. INTERIM GOVERNMENT. The Interim Council will govern the Tribe until a new tribal constitution is adopted. The initial members will be from the Tribal Council on the enactment date, and new members must meet membership criteria and be elected in the same manner as Tribal Council members. Upon completion of the tribal membership roll, the Secretary will conduct a secret ballot election for adopting a constitution and bylaws for the Tribe. Absentee balloting is allowed regardless of voter residence. Within 120 days of adopting the constitution, the Secretary will conduct a secret ballot election to elect tribal officials according to the tribal constitution. The Secretary has the authority to create regulations necessary for implementing the provisions of this Act."
