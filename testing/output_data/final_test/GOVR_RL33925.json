    "content": "Members of Congress and the public are increasingly concerned about the FDA's ability to ensure drug safety and effectiveness. Questions have been raised about the agency's collection and release of safety data, as well as its authority and resources for adequate research. Public debates on drug safety intensified in 2004 with reports of cardiovascular risks from Vioxx and increased suicidal thoughts in children taking certain antidepressants. Congress questioned if manufacturers knew of these risks while continuing to market the drugs. The FDA faced scrutiny over drug safety concerns, leading to questions about manufacturers' knowledge of risks and FDA's role in protecting the public. The Institute of Medicine conducted an assessment in response to public and Congressional attention, with FDA issuing a response and planning activities to improve drug safety. Congress introduced bills to address drug safety and FDA's responsibilities. The report compares recommendations from the Institute of Medicine with actions taken by the Food and Drug Administration and legislative bills introduced to address drug safety issues. The bills and the IOM report cover similar issues with some differences in approach. The IOM report focused on drugs, not biological products, in line with FDA's directive. FDA's response pertains to drugs but emphasizes relevance to all medical products. Proposed bills would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, with S. 484 also amending the Public Health Service Act for biologics regulation. S. 468 / H.R. 788 would establish a new Center for Postmarket Evaluation and Research for Drugs and Biologics, separate from CDER. The IOM report and bills aim to enhance FDA's postmarket activities. The bills and IOM recommendations aim to strengthen FDA's ability to ensure drug manufacturers conduct postmarket studies and disclose results. S. 468 / H.R. 788 outline requirements for a new Center for Postmarket Evaluation and Research, S. 484 proposes a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, and H.R. 1165 allows the Secretary to require studies. The bills and IOM report address the need for FDA authority to mandate pre- and postmarket studies, with penalties for sponsors who do not comply. The bills aim to strengthen FDA's ability to ensure drug manufacturers conduct postmarket studies and disclose results. S. 468 / H.R. 788 would authorize appropriations for drug safety activities, S. 484 would rely on user fees, and H.R. 1165 does not address funding. The IOM recommended increased resources for FDA to implement their recommendations for drug safety activities. The five categories of organizational culture, science and expertise, regulation, communication, and resources are important for strengthening FDA's ability to ensure drug safety activities."
