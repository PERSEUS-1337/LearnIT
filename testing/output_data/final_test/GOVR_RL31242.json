    "content": "For FY2007, Congress allocated over $7.6 billion in funding for child welfare, with the majority going to state agencies. This funding supports various child welfare activities such as foster care, adoption assistance, child abuse investigations, family support services, adoption promotion, and independent living services for foster care youths. Some funds are also allocated to state courts to improve handling of child welfare-related court proceedings. Child welfare funds are distributed to states by the Children's Bureau under the Administration for Children and Families. States must meet program requirements to receive federal child welfare dollars. Compliance is checked through the Child and Family Services Review, designed to meet conformity review requirements mandated by Congress. The 109th Congress enacted six bills amending federal child welfare policies in Title IV-B or Title IV-E. The 109th Congress enacted six bills amending federal child welfare policies in Title IV-B or Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. These bills included changes to state plan requirements and clarified eligibility for federal foster care and adoption assistance support. One bill allowed states to claim Title IV-E foster care support for foster children whose maintenance payments are made through for-profit foster care placement agencies. The 109th Congress enacted legislation amending federal child welfare policies in Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. The bill clarified eligibility for federal foster care and adoption assistance support, placed limitations on state claims for federal reimbursement, and raised funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program. Additionally, it authorized grants to improve court handling of child welfare proceedings and encouraged expedited placement of foster children. The 109th Congress amended Title IV-B and Title IV-E to expedite foster children placement across state lines. It sets federal deadlines for interstate home studies and authorizes incentive payments to states for timely completion. The law prohibits states from restricting state agencies from contracting with private agencies for interstate home studies and encourages consideration of in-state and out-of-state placement options for children in foster care. It also requires courts to notify foster parents, pre-adoptive parents, and relative caregivers of proceedings regarding the child and emphasizes their right to be heard. Additionally, youth leaving foster care custody must be given a free copy of their health and education record. This omnibus bill (H.R. 4472, P.L. 109-248) establishes federal requirements for criminal background checks of prospective foster and adoptive parents. States must check child abuse and neglect registries for information about these parents, including a check of national crime databases before placement approval. The bill expands on prior laws by specifying the type of criminal record check required and extends the federal requirement to all foster children, not just those for whom federal assistance claims are made. Prior law prohibited states from claiming Title IV-E foster care or adoption assistance for a foster child placed with a prospective parent with certain felony convictions revealed in a criminal record check. States could opt out of federal criminal records check procedures, with eight states doing so. The new requirements for criminal background checks of foster and adoptive parents became effective in FY2007, with opt-out states given until FY2009 to comply. As of FY2007, P.L. 109-248 mandates states to check their child abuse and neglect registries before approving foster or adoptive placements. States must also request information from other states' registries where the prospective parent has lived in the past five years. Federal law requires the creation of a national registry by HHS in consultation with the Justice Department. P.L. 109-248 mandates the creation of a national registry of substantiated cases of child abuse or neglect by HHS in consultation with the Justice Department. The registry is accessible only to public entities for child protection purposes. Additionally, HHS is required to conduct a study on data collection standards for the registry, with $500,000 authorized for this purpose. No funds have been specifically appropriated for the study as of August 2007. The bill (S. 3525, P.L. 109-288) extends annual funding authorization of $545 million for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program through FY2011. It allocates no less than $40 million for monthly caseworker visits and improving outcomes for children affected by substance abuse. States must report on fund usage, increase funding for tribal child services, and allow more tribes access to funds. Additionally, the bill amends the Child Welfare Services program. The bill (S. 3525, P.L. 109-288) extends funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program through FY2011, with new requirements for caseworker visits and disaster response in the Child Welfare Services program. The bill (H.R. 6111, P.L. 109-432) extends funding for child welfare services and includes provisions for consulting with medical professionals, mentoring children of prisoners, and grants for state highest courts to improve handling of child welfare proceedings. It also makes changes related to foster care and Medicaid, building on provisions from the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. P.L. 109-432 exempts foster children from the Medicaid documentation requirement and requires states to verify citizenship or immigration status of children in foster care. Compliance with this new federal requirement will be checked during periodic reviews. The state plan requirements, effective as of June 20, 2007, are part of periodic conformity reviews like the Child and Family Services Review. These requirements vary in scope and are grouped by program divisions to better understand federal child welfare policy. The curr_chunk discusses requirements for federally funded child welfare programs, including administration, data collection, placement options, child protections, and services to be provided. These requirements ensure proper program administration, data reporting, diverse placement options, child protections, and necessary services. This report outlines state eligibility requirements for federally funded child welfare programs, including programs under CAPTA and the Social Security Act. State plans must meet various requirements such as describing services offered and ensuring federal funds are not used improperly. Federal funds for child welfare programs under the Social Security Act and CAPTA are administered by the Children's Bureau within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. State plans seeking grants under CAPTA must meet specific requirements listed in tables, while state plan requirements for child welfare programs under the Social Security Act are outlined in separate tables. State plan requirements for child welfare programs under the Social Security Act include having a \"case plan\" for each child and operating a \"case review system.\" Definitions for these terms and others are detailed in Table 8. The information serves as a reference guide to state requirements, not a legal interpretation. Requirements are current through changes made by the 109th Congress. Table 1 lists state plan requirements for receiving CAPTA's Basic State Grants, which provide funding for improvements to public child protective services. CAPTA provides grants to states for improvements to public child protective services, with funding authorized on a discretionary basis. Grants aim to help states improve handling, investigation, and prosecution of child abuse and neglect cases, particularly those involving child sexual abuse and exploitation. Funding for the grants is made available via a set-aside from the Crime Victims' Fund. No matching funds are required. FY2007 funding was $20 million. Title II of CAPTA authorizes grants to support community-based efforts for the prevention of child abuse and neglect. States must designate a lead entity to administer the funds and match at least 20% of the federal allotment with non-federal dollars. Funding is discretionary and based on leveraging non-federal funds. The Child Welfare Services program provides matching grants to states for various purposes, including protecting children, preventing neglect and abuse, supporting at-risk families, promoting safety and well-being of children in foster care, and providing training for child welfare workforce. Funding is determined based on leveraging non-federal funds, with FY2007 funding at $42 million. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program under Title IV-B, Subpart 2 of the Social Security Act authorizes matching grants to states for family preservation, support, reunification, and adoption promotion. Funding is set at $325 million annually through FY2011, with $287 million allocated in FY2007. Additionally, funds are reserved for tribal child and family services, state court improvements, and research and technical assistance. The Title IV-E of the Social Security Act authorizes funds for formula grants to states for monthly caseworker visits of children in foster care and grants for responding to child welfare issues related to substance abuse. Program funds are available on a discretionary basis and as a capped entitlement through FY2011. FY2007 funding was $434 million. FY2007 appropriations for foster care and adoption assistance totaled $6.5 billion, with $4.5 billion allocated for foster care and $2.0 billion for adoption assistance. Funding under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act includes services to help youth transition from foster care to independent living, with funds provided on a matching basis. In FY2007, the government allocated funds for foster care and adoption assistance, with $6.5 billion total, $4.5 billion for foster care, and $2.0 billion for adoption assistance. Funds are provided on a matching basis (80% federal share) for programs like CFCIP and vouchers. Definitions critical to state responsibilities for children in care are outlined in Section 475 of the Social Security Act, including requirements for case review systems and individual case plans. These terms are detailed in the statute for clarity and reference."
