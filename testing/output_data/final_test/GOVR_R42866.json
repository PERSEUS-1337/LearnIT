    "content": "The U.S. policy on legal permanent immigration is based on four principles: family reunification, skilled immigrants, refugee protection, and diversity by country of origin. These principles are enshrined in the Immigration and Nationality Act. The system was last significantly revised in 1990, but there is no consensus on how to reform it. Some advocate for changes, while others support the current provisions. Legal permanent immigration in the United States is categorized into three main types: immigrants, nonimmigrants, and refugees. Immigrants, also known as lawful permanent residents, come to live permanently in the U.S. Nonimmigrants, such as tourists and students, are admitted for a specific purpose and time period. Refugees and asylees are individuals fleeing their countries. This information can help inform discussions on immigration policy options as Congress considers reform proposals. Refugees and asylees fleeing persecution can apply for LPR status in the U.S. after one year. Immigrants face stricter admission conditions than nonimmigrants, but once admitted, they have few restrictions and can pursue citizenship through naturalization after five years. Naturalization is voluntary, and immigrants can remain as LPRs indefinitely as long as they abide by the law. Immigrants must navigate a multi-step process through federal departments and agencies to obtain LPR status. Petitions are filed with USCIS in DHS by the prospective immigrant, sponsoring relative, or employer in the U.S. If the immigrant is abroad, the petition goes to DOS in the alien's home country. If already in the U.S., USCIS handles the process, known as \"adjustment of status.\" Roughly half of all persons granted LPR status in FY2016 did so by adjusting status, either through Consular Affairs officer or USCIS adjudicator review. Immigrant admissions and adjustments are subject to numerical limits and preference categories based on family relationships, skills, and geographic diversity. Immigrants entering through family-sponsored and employment-based categories are subject to a 7% per-country cap. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) sets numerical limits on immigration, creating a visa queue for foreign nationals. The annual worldwide level for Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) is 675,000, divided into family-sponsored immigrants, employment-based preference immigrants, and diversity immigrants. Despite the limits, certain LPR categories can exceed the cap. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) sets numerical limits on immigration, creating a visa queue for foreign nationals. The annual worldwide level for Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) is 675,000, divided into family-sponsored immigrants, employment-based preference immigrants, and diversity immigrants. Some LPR categories can exceed the limits, such as immediate relatives of U.S. citizens who are not numerically limited. The annual level of family-sponsored preference immigrants is determined by subtracting immediate relatives granted LPR status, aliens paroled into the U.S., and adding unused employment preference immigrant visas from the prior year. This results in varying numbers of immigrants receiving LPR status each year. Preference immigrant visas are subject to annual limits under the INA, with a minimum of 226,000 family preference immigrants allowed each year. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens have consistently exceeded 254,000 admissions annually, keeping the limit for family-sponsored preference immigrants at 226,000 for the past two decades. Additionally, refugees and asylees can apply for LPR status. Refugees and asylees can apply to adjust to LPR status after one year in refugee/asylee status in the United States. They are exempt from statutory numerical limits, unlike preference immigrants who are subject to a 7% per-country cap. This cap aims to prevent monopolization of visas by a few countries. Congress has exceptions to the per-country ceilings, such as allowing 75% of visas allocated to the 2nd family preference category. The first exception allows 75% of visas in the 2nd family preference category to be exempt from the per-country ceiling. The second exception allows the 7% per-country ceiling for employment-based immigrants to be surpassed for oversubscribed countries. Family and employment preference immigrants are numerically limited and subdivided into categories based on family relationships to U.S. citizens and LPRs. The employment preference categories for immigrants are based on professional accomplishments and skills needed by U.S. employers. The fifth preference category allows foreign investors to acquire LPR status through the EB-5 immigrant investors program, requiring a minimum investment and employment of U.S. workers. Less capital is needed for investments in Targeted Employment Areas. Employers in rural areas or areas with high unemployment levels must petition the U.S. Department of Labor for a labor certification to hire immigrants in certain employment-based preference categories. Prospective immigrants need to meet job qualifications and preference category requirements. If a labor shortage is identified, a certification is issued; otherwise, extensive recruitment efforts are required. Unused numbers in the preference system may roll down to the next category. The diversity immigrant visa program offers 50,000 visas annually to natives of countries with low immigration rates to the US. Eligibility requires a high school education or work experience. Regional distribution has shifted towards African and Eastern European countries. Unused LPR allocations rollover between employment-based and family preference categories. Immigration to the United States is influenced by various factors including U.S. immigration laws and push and pull factors from immigrant-sending countries and the United States. Different pathways exist for individuals to acquire Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) status, aside from family-sponsored and employment-based immigrants. These pathways include aliens in removal proceedings granted LPR status by an immigration judge, victims of crime and human trafficking, and refugees and asylees adjusting to LPR status. Pull factors from the United States include strong employment prospects, family reunification opportunities, and quality of life considerations. U.S. immigration declined after the Great Depression and World War II but gradually increased post-war due to war refugee admissions and economic growth. Immigration growth continued after 1980, partly due to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 legalizing 2.7 million aliens. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 legalized 2.7 million aliens in the U.S. The Immigration Act of 1990 increased preference immigration ceilings. The Refugee Act of 1980 led to an increase in refugee admissions. Dominant countries of immigrant flow have changed over time. The dominant countries of immigrant flow have changed over time, with a shift in country-of-origin composition influenced by per-country ceilings established in 1965. Immigration at the start of the 20th century was dominated by a few countries, while at the start of the 21st century, immigrants originated from a broader set of countries. Mexico has been a top sending country for most of the 20th century and into the 21st century. In recent decades, immigrants to the United States come from various countries in the Western Hemisphere and Asia. In FY2016, around 1.2 million aliens became LPRs, with family-sponsored immigrants making up the majority. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens accounted for 48% of all LPRs granted in 2016. In FY2016, family-sponsored immigrants, not numerically limited by the INA, made up 48% of all LPRs granted. Mexico, China, Cuba, India, and the Dominican Republic were the top source countries, accounting for 37% of all LPRs. Asia, Mexico and Central America, and the Caribbean were the leading regions of birth for LPRs, totaling three-fourths of all LPRs. 48% adjusted to LPR status from within the U.S., while 52% received visas abroad and were admitted as LPRs. In FY2016, most employment-based immigrants (82%) adjusted to LPR status from within the United States, while close to half (45%) of immediate relatives of U.S. citizens also did so. The pool of people eligible to immigrate to the United States as LPRs each year typically exceeds the worldwide level set by U.S. immigration law. At the end of each fiscal year, the Department of State (DOS) publishes a tabulation of immigrant petitions that have been approved by USCIS and forwarded to DOS's National Visa Center. The National Visa Center manages approved family-sponsored or employment-based immigrant petitions awaiting visa availability due to numerical limits in the INA. Family-sponsored preference immigrants make up the majority of the 4.06 million approved LPR visa petitions pending, with 58% being 4th preference siblings of U.S. citizens. Employment-based preference immigrants account for only 3% of the pending visas. The USCIS has a queue of pending petitions for LPR status, including family-sponsored, employment-based, and humanitarian petitions. Spouses and children are entitled to derivative status and are considered in the same order as the principal applicant. The USCIS has a queue of pending petitions for LPR status, including family-sponsored, employment-based, and humanitarian petitions. Spouses and children are entitled to derivative status and are considered in the same order as the principal applicant. Visas are allocated based on preference categories when demand exceeds numerical limits, as shown in the Visa Bulletin. Visa processing reflects numerical limits and per-country caps for LPR categories. As of February 9, 2018, the Department of State (DOS) was processing visa petitions for unmarried adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens from India (1st preference) whose petitions were submitted in March 2011, and for married adult sons and daughters from China (3rd preference) whose petitions were submitted over 12 years ago in December 2005. Brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens (4th preference) could expect to wait over 13 years, with longer waits for siblings from Mexico and the Philippines. DOS consular processing reflects numerical limits and per-country caps for LPR categories. As of February 9, 2018, DOS consular officers were adjudicating visa petitions for siblings of U.S. citizens from the Philippines who filed petitions over 23 years ago. Spouses and minor children of LPRs had a priority date of March 22, 2016, with a wait time of approximately two years. The March 2018 Visa Bulletin showed that all worker visa categories were current, but workers from countries like China and India faced waiting times for specific categories. Some advocate for revising the legal immigration system to address waiting times for workers from China, India, and the Philippines. Congress has considered proposals for strategic changes, including reallocation of visa categories and increased legal immigration to reunite families and meet labor force needs. Some advocate for revising the legal immigration system to address waiting times for workers from China, India, and the Philippines. Proponents of family-sponsored migration argue for additional visas to reduce wait times for those already in the queue, while others believe family-sponsored immigration should be limited to immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and LPRs. Many in Congress support revising employment-based immigration to select immigrants based on merit-based criteria, such as educational attainment and English language skills, rather than employer sponsorship. They also advocate for eliminating the Diversity Immigrant Visa program due to security concerns and low skill requirements."
