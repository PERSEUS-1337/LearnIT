    "content": "The Act titled \"National Resilience Development Act of 2003\" is cited as such. The Congress finds that Americans experienced substantial stress after September 11, 2001, and clinicians should be prepared to assist with trauma-related symptoms. Experiences from the 1995 Tokyo subway attack suggest that psychological casualties from a chemical attack may outnumber physical casualties. Victims from the Tokyo attack continued to suffer from psychological symptoms 5 years later. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, lessons learned from the 2001 anthrax attacks should motivate health departments and organizations to enhance communications and preparedness for terrorism. Federal, State, and local disaster planners should address psychological consequences in their planning for terrorist attacks. According to a national study, doctors are increasingly seeing patients with physical symptoms that actually mask anxiety or depression due to growing terrorism threats. Efforts and funding are needed to understand and prepare for the psychological consequences of bioterrorism. Integration of mental health into public health efforts is crucial for addressing the nation's psychological needs related to terrorism. The goals outlined in Section 3 focus on addressing the psychological consequences of bioterrorism and integrating mental health into public health efforts to meet the nation's psychological needs related to terrorism. The Act aims to coordinate government agencies in developing programs to increase psychological resilience and mitigate distress related to terrorism. It also aims to integrate these programs into the Department of Homeland Security's efforts and identify effective interventions for psychosocial consequences of disasters. The Act aims to integrate mental health and public health emergency preparedness efforts in the United States to effectively respond to the psychosocial consequences of terrorism. SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE ON NATIONAL RESILIENCE. Amends Title III of the Public Health Service Act to establish an Interagency Task Force on National Resilience. The Secretary will establish an interagency task force to enhance the psychological resilience of the American public in preparation for and response to various types of attacks on the United States. Members of the task force will include key officials from various health and emergency response agencies. The task force will have specific duties related to its mission. The interagency task force will coordinate efforts of multiple health agencies to develop programs for increasing psychological resilience and mitigating distress reactions in the American public in preparation for attacks on the United States. The interagency task force will consult with various agencies and organizations to integrate programs and protocols to increase psychological resilience and mitigate distress reactions in the American public in preparation for attacks on the United States. The interagency task force will consult with States to help them respond to the psychosocial consequences of terrorism and develop strategies for State public health and mental health agencies to collaborate on programs to increase psychological resilience and mitigate distress reactions in preparation for attacks on the United States. They will also provide specific recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security on strengthening existing and planned efforts. The interagency task force aims to enhance terrorism preparedness by integrating programs to increase psychological resilience and mitigate distress reactions of the American public. The task force will meet at least four times a year and will be staffed as necessary to achieve the goals outlined in the National Resilience Development Act of 2003. SEC. 5. Mental health activities of states, District of Columbia, and territories regarding national resilience. To enhance mental health activities for national resilience, an amendment to the Public Health Service Act enables State mental health authorities to collaborate with public health authorities and an interagency task force to manage emotional, behavioral, and cognitive responses to disasters, increasing public psychological resilience and mitigating distress reactions to various types of attacks on the United States. Funding for these activities is also addressed in the amendment. The Public Health Service Act is amended to allocate at least 1 percent of funds for subsection (d)(19) activities. The USA Patriot Act is also amended to specify the allowed uses of funds for purchasing and constructing purposes. The Public Health Service Act is amended to allocate funds for State mental health authorities to better understand and manage emotional responses to disasters. The USA Patriot Act is amended to specify allowed uses of funds for purchasing and constructing purposes. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 is amended to allocate at least 1 percent of funds for mental health preparedness in response to disasters. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 is amended to allocate funds for mental health preparedness in response to disasters, while FEMA focuses on national resilience efforts. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to integrate efforts to increase psychological resilience in communities and coordinate with other agencies, including the Public Health Service Act. SEC. 7. ANNUAL REPORT BY SECRETARIES OF HHS AND HOMELAND SECURITY. The Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security must submit an annual report to Congress, including recommendations from an interagency task force, steps taken to implement those recommendations, explanations for rejecting any recommendations, and other actions to achieve the goals of the Act."
