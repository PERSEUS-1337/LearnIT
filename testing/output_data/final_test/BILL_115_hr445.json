    "content": "The \"Buyback Our Safety Act\" is the short title of the Act. It establishes a Gun Buyback Grant Program. The \"Buyback Our Safety Act\" establishes a gun buyback grant program for law enforcement agencies to fund gun buyback programs. Agencies can apply for grants through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs. The Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs requires law enforcement agencies to submit an application for a gun buyback grant, ensuring that the program is advertised to the public, administered by law enforcement personnel, guns remain in their possession, and fraud prevention measures are in place. To be eligible for a gun buyback grant, a law enforcement agency must certify that they will prevent fraud, test purchased guns on-site before payment, and destroy all received guns. The agency must also match all Federal funds with an equal amount from non-Federal sources, with a waiver option available. The Attorney General will work with the National Academy of Sciences to develop standards for identifying guns likely used in violent crimes and establish pricing for purchasing these guns through gun buyback programs funded by grants. The agency receiving a grant for a gun buyback program must submit reports to the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs every 90 days, detailing the number and types of guns collected and destroyed, along with recommendations for future programs. A final report is also required within 90 days after the program ends. The Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs must submit annual reports to Congress on the number of gun buyback programs funded, guns received, total guns purchased, and recommendations for program improvement. Definitions for this section include the meaning of \"State\" as each of the 50 states and other territories, \"unit of local government\" as a local governing body below the state level, and \"violent crime\" as specific offenses reported by the FBI. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2018 through 2022 to implement this section."
