    "content": "Approximately 27 million trips are taken on public transportation daily, with federal assistance provided through the Department of Transportation's Federal Transit Administration. The federal public transportation program, authorized from FY2016 through FY2020, is part of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act. This report discusses key issues for Congress to consider during reauthorization. Public transportation includes buses, subways, commuter rail, light rail, paratransit, and ferryboats, excluding Amtrak, intercity buses, and school buses. Public transportation trips are mainly made by bus, heavy rail, commuter rail, light rail, paratransit, and ferries. It accounts for 3% of all daily transportation trips and 7% of commute trips. Federal funding for public transportation is authorized in multiyear surface transportation acts, with the FAST Act authorizing $61.1 billion for five fiscal years. Federal funding for public transportation is authorized from the mass transit account of the Highway Trust Fund and the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. The general fund share of federal public transportation expenditures increased to about 28% in FY2018, 26% in FY2019, and 21% in FY2020. Funding for the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program provides grants for emergency repairs following natural disasters or other emergencies. In FY2016, $1.3 billion in highway funds was flexed to transit, and funding provided in FY2017 through FY2020 exceeded the level authorized in the FAST Act. There are six major programs for public transportation authorized by the FAST Act, including Urbanized Area Formula, State of Good Repair, Capital Investment Grants (CIG), Rural Area Formula, Bus and Bus Facilities, and Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities. Funding for these programs typically comes from the mass transit account of the Highway Trust Fund. The federal public transportation program funding, except for CIG, comes from the mass transit account of the Highway Trust Fund. CIG funding comes from the general fund. The FAST Act authorized $12.2 billion per year, a 14% increase from the previous MAP-21 authorization. A bill in August 2019 proposed a 27% increase in highway infrastructure programs funding through FY2025. This could lead to federal expenditures of about $15.5 billion per year for public transportation. The federal public transportation program funding, except for CIG, comes from the mass transit account of the Highway Trust Fund. CIG funding comes from the general fund. The FAST Act authorized $12.2 billion per year, a 14% increase from the previous MAP-21 authorization. A bill in August 2019 proposed a 27% increase in highway infrastructure programs funding through FY2025, potentially leading to federal expenditures of about $15.5 billion per year. A higher level of federal funding could improve the condition and performance of public transportation infrastructure, with a reinvestment backlog estimated at $98 billion in 2014. Capital expenditures on public transportation in 2014 totaled $17.7 billion, with $11.3 billion spent on preserving the existing system. The Department of Transportation (DOT) estimates that if current spending patterns continue, the investment backlog for public transportation infrastructure would grow to $116 billion by 2034. To eliminate this backlog and accommodate new riders, annual spending of $23.4 billion to $25.6 billion would be needed, depending on ridership growth scenarios. Additionally, $18.4 billion annually would eliminate the reinvestment backlog over 20 years if there was no increase in ridership. The federal public transportation program focuses on capital expenditures but also supports operational expenses, safety oversight, planning, and research. Increased federal support for transit operations could enhance service quantity or lower fares. However, using federal funding for operating expenses may lead to neglect of maintenance and asset renewal, causing a faster decline in capital assets. Flexibility to use capital funds for maintenance can help preserve equipment and facilities. The federal public transportation program focuses on capital expenditures and supports operational expenses, safety oversight, planning, and research. Using capital funds for maintenance may help agencies preserve equipment and facilities. The federal share of government spending on public transportation has been around 15% to 20% over the past 30 years. The solvency of the Highway Trust Fund and its accounts is a major issue in reauthorization of funding for the public transportation program. The Highway Trust Fund faces a $26 billion gap in revenues and outlays over the next five years. Motor fuel taxes are the primary revenue source, last raised in 1993. General fund transfers have been used to supplement the mass transit account, totaling $29 billion since 2008. The FAST Act transferred $18.1 billion to the mass transit account. A balance of at least $1 billion is needed in the mass transit account for mandated payments to transit agencies. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that without further transfers from the general fund, the mass transit account will have a balance of about $300 million by the end of FY2021 and reach zero in FY2022. This would require the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to slow payments to transit agencies. Solvency issues are expected to arise earlier in the mass transit account compared to the highway account. Balancing the mass transit account would involve cutting program spending, increasing revenues paid into the account, or a combination of both. Regular transfers from the general fund could also be considered. Redirecting revenues from the mass transit account to the highway account and funding transit with a general fund appropriation could make transit funding less certain. The federal government also supports public transportation infrastructure through loans and tax preferences. Changes to federal loan programs like TIFIA and RRIF could be considered for reauthorization. TIFIA provides low-interest loans for transportation projects. The TIFIA program, which provides low-interest loans for transportation projects, has a maximum federal share of project costs set at 33% to 49%. However, DOT has only provided up to 33% for any project so far. This limitation may hinder financially unviable projects from receiving greater federal assistance. Some project sponsors have found the process and upfront costs for obtaining TIFIA assistance to be lengthy, leading them to not seek TIFIA loans. Congress could consider directing DOT to increase the federal share in more circumstances. The TIFIA program offers low-interest loans for transportation projects with a federal share of project costs ranging from 33% to 49%. However, DOT has only provided up to 33% for any project. Some project sponsors have found the process for obtaining TIFIA assistance lengthy, leading them to not seek TIFIA loans. Congress could make small TIFIA loans more attractive by changing requirements for credit ratings and incorporating proposals to speed up approvals. The RRIF program supports freight and commuter railroads, with recent changes allowing loans for transit-oriented development. Loans are made to transit agencies for commuter rail projects, including a $908 million loan to the Dallas Area Rapid Transit. The federal government has provided funding for various rail projects in recent years, including loans to the Dallas Area Rapid Transit, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, and New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority for positive train control. There is a need for federal funding to pay the credit risk premiums for RRIF borrowers, which could be authorized from the Highway Trust Fund or the general fund. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 makes RRIF credit risk premiums eligible for grants under the BUILD Transportation Discretionary Grants Program. There is a proposal to extend the authority to provide loans for transit-oriented development projects. The CIG program receives funding from the general fund, giving appropriators greater influence over its funding. Authorization sets a benchmark for funding levels and program structure, impacting FTA's discretion in implementation. Disagreements between Congress and the Trump Administration may make reauthorization more critical. During the Obama Administration, FTA recommended increased CIG funding for Core Capacity projects. FTA requested Congress to raise annual CIG funding to $3.5 billion in FY2017. The Trump Administration proposed limiting funding to projects with existing authorization for FY2018 and FY2019. The Trump Administration proposed limiting funding for new transit projects in FY2018 and FY2019, but House and Senate appropriators rejected this approach. FTA continued to allocate CIG funding to new projects, committing $7.63 billion to 25 projects since January 2017. FTA has committed $7.63 billion to 25 new projects, with Congress approving nearly $2 billion for the program in FY2020. The Gateway Program aims to improve rail service in the Northeast Corridor, benefiting both Amtrak and NJ Transit. The corridor sees approximately 50 million passenger trips annually, making it one of the busiest routes in the country. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, along with other project sponsors, have proposed $7 billion in funding for the costliest Gateway Program project to date. The project includes building a new tunnel under the Hudson River, restoring the current tunnel damaged by Hurricane Sandy, and preserving the Hudson Yards right-of-way. NJ Transit has also proposed a CIG grant to cover half the cost of the Portal North Bridge project. The overall Gateway Program is estimated to cost around $30 billion. The federal amount sought for the Gateway Program is equal to several years of funding for CIG, potentially overwhelming the program. The largest CIG grant since FY2007 is $2.6 billion, typically paid out in smaller amounts over a prolonged construction period. The proposed use of federal loans in conjunction with federal grants for the Gateway Program is controversial, with the Trump Administration critical of using both federal grants and loans on public transportation projects. In June 2018, FTA considered U.S. Department of Transportation loans as part of all Federal funding sources for CIG projects. However, Section 165 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 prevents the implementation of this policy. In a potential reauthorization, Congress could seek to permanently eliminate DOT's discretion to block project sponsors from combining CIG grants and TIFIA loans. Bills pending in the House would allow recipients of TIFIA and RRIF support to treat the loans as nonfederal funds. Applying for CIG funding involves extensive data development and report preparation, with FTA reviewing all documents for project approval. Legislative changes have aimed to simplify the process, reducing the number of FTA approvals required for more expensive projects. The FAST Act and MAP-21 have made changes to the Capital Investment Grants (CIG) process, reducing the number of approvals needed for more expensive and less expensive projects. The FAST Act also introduced an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot Program for public-private partnerships. There have been no comprehensive evaluations on whether these changes have expedited project progress. The Capital Investment Grants (CIG) process has seen changes under the FAST Act and MAP-21, aiming to expedite project progress. Options to further speed up CIG projects include increasing the small starts threshold and permitting warrants in more circumstances. The Expedited Project Delivery Pilot Program by FTA has been slow to implement, and increasing the federal share of project costs under the program may attract more transit agencies. Despite a peak in annual transit ridership in 2014, there has been an 8% decline to 9.9 billion trips in 2018 according to APTA data. At the national level, competitive factors and transit service supply impact public transportation ridership. Factors like increased car ownership, low gas prices, and alternative transportation options have reduced ridership. While transit service has increased with government investment, rising fares may deter riders. Future ridership depends on population growth, funding for transit, and factors affecting driving attractiveness. Under current law, federal grants to transit agencies are based on population, density, and service provided. Congress could tie funds to agencies' success in boosting ridership or fare revenue. Fully autonomous vehicles may reduce transit ridership in the long term, but uncertainty remains. Federal capital funding might focus on buses over new rail systems. The emergence of new mobility options may have reduced transit ridership, but it also presents an opportunity for transit agencies to provide new services. FTA has funded pilot projects for boosting transit ridership through mobility and technological innovations to address climate change. The effects of climate change on transportation infrastructure are being addressed through surface transportation reauthorization, which includes provisions to reduce GHG emissions and increase resilience. Public transportation can help reduce emissions by replacing single-occupant car trips with trains and buses. The efficiency of public transportation in reducing GHG emissions depends on ridership levels. The efficiency of public transportation in reducing GHG emissions depends on ridership levels and the sources of fuel used. Policy options to reduce emissions include funding for electric buses powered by renewable sources and requiring low or no emissions for buses purchased with federal funds. Electric buses cost more upfront but have comparable lifecycle costs to traditional diesel buses. The federal government could offer low-interest or no-interest loans for buying electric buses to reduce vulnerabilities and increase resilience to climate change in the transportation system. There is currently no dedicated surface transportation funding for adaptation projects, but reauthorization could create a new grant program for adaptation planning and projects. The Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program provides federal funding for states and territories on a reimbursement basis. The Federal Transit Administration's Emergency Relief program provides funding on a reimbursement basis to states, local governments, and public transportation agencies for damage from natural disasters or emergencies. Funds are authorized as needed and require appropriations from the Treasury's general fund, leading transit agencies to rely on FEMA for immediate needs. This reliance could slow response times and blur responsibilities between FTA and FEMA. The Federal Transit Administration's Emergency Relief program may benefit from a quick-release mechanism for funds to expedite disaster response. This could be similar to the Federal Highway Administration's program, funded from the Highway Trust Fund. However, this would require authorization from the mass transit account, potentially straining its resources. The ER program currently lacks a spending limit, which could lead to excessive appropriations and funding for projects not directly related to resilience efforts. The federal government has expanded its role in public transportation safety since 2008, with a focus on making transit systems resilient to natural hazards. Public transportation is safer than traveling by car or light truck, with lower fatality rates per passenger mile. Commuter rail fatalities are often nonusers, such as trespassing pedestrians. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 has brought significant changes to public transportation safety regulations. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandated the installation of positive train control (PTC) systems for commuter railroads, Amtrak, and freight railroads. Commuter rail agencies face significant capital costs for PTC implementation, with ongoing costs estimated at $160 million per year. Without additional funding, the financial condition of commuter rail agencies and their assets may be negatively impacted. Agencies are proposing a new federal PTC funding program to help cover these costs. Rail agencies are proposing a new federal funding program for positive train control (PTC) to cover ongoing costs. Buy America laws restrict domestic content on federally funded transportation projects, with specific requirements varying by funding program. An addition to Buy America law prohibits transit agencies from purchasing railcars and buses. Fiscal Year 2020 (P.L. 116-92, \u00a77613) prohibits transit agencies from purchasing railcars and buses from certain government-owned, -controlled, or -subsidized companies, such as China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation and BYD, even if they are Buy America-compliant. Waivers of Buy America requirements can be difficult to obtain, and Congress may consider standardizing requirements or making them more stringent. The Buy America 2.0 Act (H.R. 2755, 116th Congress) aims to increase the share of domestic components in public transit rolling stock. The Buy America 2.0 Act (H.R. 2755, 116th Congress) aims to increase the share of public transit rolling stock components produced in the United States, reaching 100% by FY2026. This may result in higher costs and longer procurement times for transit agencies."
