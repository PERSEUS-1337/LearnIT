    "content": "Since 2000, South Korea has been the United States' seventh-largest trading partner, with trade flows exceeding $75 billion in 2006. South Korea was the seventh largest export market and source of imports for the U.S., with major exports including semiconductors, machinery, aircraft, and agricultural products. Despite a ban on U.S. beef shipments, U.S. exports to South Korea reached an all-time high of over $30 billion in 2006. Despite the South Korean ban on U.S. beef shipments, the economic relationship between the two countries remains strong. The United States is a key trading partner for South Korea, but China and Japan have surpassed the U.S. in trade importance. Disagreements over trade policies have decreased since the 1980s and 1990s due to market-oriented reforms in South Korea. South Korea enacted market-oriented reforms in exchange for a $58 billion IMF package in 1997. This led to increased foreign investment, with foreign companies now holding significant shares in Korean conglomerates and owning 40% of the stock exchange. President Roh Moo-hyun called for further reforms to boost GDP and transform the economy. South Korea and the United States have improved trade relations through quarterly trade meetings, leading to less acrimonious disputes. In 2006, they announced negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement. The United States and South Korea are in the midst of negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement, with progress reported in various areas. However, disagreements persist over trade in autos, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural products. Both sides aim to complete the negotiation before the end of March to comply with TPA deadlines. If approved by Congress, it would be the largest FTA for the United States since NAFTA. The U.S. and South Korea are negotiating a free trade agreement under the TPA granted by Congress. The agreement must be signed before July 1, 2007, for expedited consideration. The launch of FTA talks is seen as a high-risk, high reward move due to differences in diplomatic and military relations. The launch of FTA talks between the U.S. and South Korea has revealed deep-seated differences in trade and investment relations. The negotiations could strengthen the bilateral relationship if successful, but failure may harm trust. South Korea's 1997 financial crisis, triggered by the bankruptcy of top conglomerates and a sharp increase in foreign debt repayments, led to a loss of investor confidence and a significant devaluation of the Korean won. In December 1997, South Korea faced a financial crisis and turned to the IMF for a $58 billion support package. The government's foreign currency reserves were insufficient, leading to a significant devaluation of the Korean won. Kim Dae Jung was elected president, and Seoul agreed to implement market-oriented reforms in exchange for IMF assistance. After the financial crisis in 1997, South Korea implemented structural reforms and opened its economy to foreign goods and investors. The economy experienced a severe recession in 1998, with GDP contracting by 6.7% and unemployment rising to 7.6%. Anti-IMF and anti-American sentiment grew among South Koreans. However, the economy rebounded in 1999 and 2000, with growth rates exceeding 10% and 9% respectively. In 2001, growth slowed due to various factors including declining consumer and business confidence, stock market bubble burst, rising oil prices, and reduced exports to the United States and Japan. In response to economic downturns in the United States and Japan, South Korea lowered interest rates, introduced stimulus measures, and eased credit card regulations in 2002. This led to a growth rate increase from 3.1% to 6.3%. However, in 2003, excessive credit card use caused financial firms to collapse, resulting in a growth slowdown to 3.1%. Domestic investment remained low despite rapid economic integration with China. In the aftermath of the 1997 crisis, financial institutions turned to consumers for profit, leading to a sharp increase in credit card defaults. Korea's specialized credit-card issuers faced massive losses in 2003 and 2004, requiring bailouts to avoid insolvency. The government responded by tightening credit card restrictions and initiating a debt forgiveness program for individual debtors in 2004. In 2004, South Korea's economy grew by 4.6%, driven by a surge in exports to China. However, growth was below the government's 6% expectation due to high oil prices and weak domestic demand. In 2005, economic growth slowed to around 4% initially, but improved later in the year with a $6.5 billion fiscal stimulus policy. Despite rising energy prices, private spending increased by 3.2% in 2005. In 2005, South Korean exports rose by just over 12%, with a merchandise trade surplus of about $23 billion. In 2006, economic growth increased to an estimated 5%, driven by balanced growth in private consumption and exports. However, rising energy imports caused a decline in the merchandise trade surplus. Additionally, soaring housing prices, especially in the greater Seoul area, became a significant concern. The soaring housing prices in the greater Seoul area became a dominant political issue in 2006, exacerbating concerns about economic inequality. The government has taken steps to curb real estate speculation, but there are fears of a potential hard landing in the housing sector in 2007. Assessing Korea's economic reforms shows significant progress since 1997, with a more transparent and efficient economy today. In the aftermath of the 1997 financial crisis, the South Korean government spent $140 billion to bail out banks and mutual funds, which was about 25%-30% of the country's GDP. Predictions of needing more funds did not materialize, and the banking sector returned to profitability by 2001. Non-performing loans decreased to 2.4% of total loans, compared to 16.4% in 1998. The government accelerated efforts to re-privatize nationalized banks, bringing one-third of the industry's assets back into private hands by 2000. By 2005, foreigners owned about one-third of the assets in the Korean banking sector, including majority stakes in four of Korea's eight nation-wide banks. State ownership of the banking sector led to a trade dispute with the United States and European Union over accusations of illegal subsidies to Hynix Semiconductor Inc. Sales of formerly state-owned banks gave foreign companies a major stake in South Korea's financial sector. In 2004, Citigroup acquired a controlling stake in KorAm for $1.7 billion. The Commission approved Citigroup's $1.7 billion bid for a controlling stake in KorAm, Korea's seventh-largest bank. Despite the Korean banking sector's profitability, reforms to address issues like high debt levels and weak corporate governance have been challenging. Despite efforts to reduce the power of conglomerates, corporate governance issues and cross-shareholdings within chaebol groups persist in South Korea. Bailouts of struggling credit card affiliates in 2003 and 2004 raised concerns about the chaebol's practices. A scandal at SK Global in 2003 highlighted structural problems, while reckless credit card lending activities exposed weaknesses in risk management. The government is pushing for further restructuring of the financial industry to address these issues. The South Korean government pledged to eliminate restrictions on foreign firms' investments as part of its commitment to the IMF in 1997. President Kim Dae Jung's reforms led to increased foreign direct investment, reaching $15.7 billion in 2000 from $3.2 billion in 1996. Concerns remain about cross-shareholding within chaebol groups and the \"too big to fail\" dynamic in the financial sector. Bailouts of LG Card and Samsung Card in 2003 raised fears of ongoing issues in the industry. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in South Korea increased significantly from $3.2 billion in 1996 to a peak of $15.7 billion in 2000. FDI fell from 2001-2003 but rose to $12.8 billion in 2004 under President Roh Moo-hyun's government. U.S. companies have committed nearly $20 billion in FDI since the 1997 crisis. High-profile acquisitions by foreign companies, such as General Motors' purchase of Daewoo Motors and Citigroup's purchase of KorAm Bank, have occurred. Despite increased openness to foreign ownership, some acquisitions have been delayed or cancelled due to nationalistic objections or disagreements over sales prices. In June 2000, Ford bid nearly $7 billion for Daewoo Motors but withdrew its offer due to hidden liabilities and losses. General Motors eventually acquired a controlling stake for $400 million in May 2002 after prolonged negotiations with creditors and the government. The GM-Daewoo partnership has been successful, with sales quadrupling since the purchase of a controlling stake in Daewoo Motors for $400 million. GM-Daewoo has become a global production base for GM, with strong sales in China. However, there is growing concern in Korea about foreign investment, with accusations of \"foreign exploitation\" and discussions of restricting takeovers by foreigners. Newbridge bought Korea First Bank in 1999, credited with turning around its fortunes. Foreign multinationals in Korea face government pressure, as seen with Newbridge resisting loan advances to failing companies. Lone Star's sale of Korea Exchange Bank raised concerns about politically-charged investigations into high-profile investments. Lone Star's sale of Korea Exchange Bank to Kookmin Bank for $7.4 billion in 2003 sparked investigations by South Korean prosecutors over the low sale price. Arrest warrants were issued for Lone Star executives for alleged illegalities in transactions after taking control of KEB. Korean authorities are seeking extradition of two Lone Star officials from the United States, stalling the sale. South Korea has trade surpluses with China and trade deficits with Japan. China is the top destination for South Korean overseas direct investment. Many South Korean exports to China are used in the production of goods exported globally. There is a growing interest in China among South Koreans, leading to concerns about Chinese influence on South Korean policy. Views of China are becoming more favorable among South Koreans, while views of the United States are declining. South Koreans have ambivalent views of China's economic importance due to increased imports causing competitive pressure on local farmers and manufacturers. Concerns arise about job losses to Chinese workers as South Korean investment in China grows. South Korea is North Korea's second-most important economic partner, with inter-Korean trade doubling since 2000. About 40% of this trade is commercial, while the rest is linked to cooperation projects. South Korea has a significant economic relationship with North Korea, providing over $3 billion in aid from 1994-2006. This includes trade surplus, inter-Korean cooperation projects, and humanitarian assistance. The two countries have collaborated on various projects since the 2000 summit, such as reconnecting roads and rail lines, developing a tourism site in Mt. Kumgang, and establishing an industrial zone in Kaesong for South Korean companies. The Kaesong industrial complex in North Korea, located near Seoul, had 15 South Korean firms employing over 10,000 North Korean workers by the end of 2006. Following North Korea's missile and nuclear tests in 2006, South Korea imposed restrictions on economic cooperation projects with the North. Despite this, 40 firms selected before the suspension were set to open operations in Kaesong in 2007. Additionally, South Korea proposed providing electricity to North Korea in exchange for concessions on nuclear weapons programs. The Bush Administration supports South Korea's economic engagement with North Korea, including the Kaesong industrial zone. The United States approved export controls clearances for South Korean firms to bring items to Kaesong. This could potentially use economic leverage to pressure North Korea. The United States has refused to consider Kaesong as part of the KORUS FTA, despite South Korea's request. Key issues include the conditions for North Korean workers and the income the KIC provides for the North Korean government. U.S. labor and human rights advocates argue that North Korean workers in Kaesong are exploited, while South Korean officials claim conditions are better than in the rest of North Korea. The North Korean government earns hard currency from the KIC project through leasing fees and surcharges on workers' wages. The South Korean government aims to increase revenue from the Kaesong project, potentially reaching hundreds of millions of dollars annually for North Korea. However, uncertainties about the project's future make projections speculative. The United States typically leads trade talks with South Korea due to economic disparities. The U.S. sets the agenda for trade talks with South Korea, focusing on transparency issues in Korea's trading and regulatory systems. U.S. exporters and negotiators see lack of transparency as a major barrier to trade, with complaints about government regulations and discrimination. Seoul uses government regulations to discriminate against foreign firms in sensitive industries like automobiles and telecommunications. Labor market restrictions, such as mandatory severance pay, increase the cost of doing business. The U.S. and other countries urge South Korea to open its agricultural market further. U.S. officials and agricultural industry stakeholders argue that South Korea maintains high agricultural tariffs, hindering U.S. exports. A comprehensive FTA could significantly boost U.S. agricultural exports to South Korea, with estimates suggesting a potential increase of over 200% within four years. Despite the declining number of farmers in South Korea, they remain influential, and Seoul plans to provide over $100 million in adjustment assistance to them. South Korea plans to spend over $100 million in adjustment assistance for farmers over the next decade. Agricultural disputes with the U.S. have decreased in recent years, with beef and rice being major issues. South Korea's ban on U.S. beef imports, reinstated in 2006, remains a key trade concern. South Korea partially lifted its ban on U.S. beef imports in 2006, allowing boneless beef from cattle under 30 months old. However, the resumption of imports faced delays, with the first shipments in December 2006 being rejected due to bone fragments found by South Korean meat inspectors. In 2006, South Korean meat inspectors banned U.S. beef imports due to bone fragments. Negotiators failed to resolve the issue by February 12, 2007. U.S. officials argued that the bone fragments were too small to cause mad cow disease. Some Members of Congress called for a suspension of KORUS FTA negotiations until the matter was resolved. South Korea was granted a 10-year grace period before opening its rice market to imports in 2004. The country agreed to allow minimum access for rice through quotas. The United States and South Korea reached an agreement where Korea would double its rice imports over the next 10 years, provide guaranteed access for 50,000 MT of U.S. rice annually, and make imported rice available directly to Korean consumers. In 2005, the Korean National Assembly ratified the rice deal after acrimonious debate. China and Thailand wanted to end the quota system in favor of tariffication. U.S. exporters sold over 60,000 metric tons of rice to South Korea in 2006. The U.S. is pushing South Korea to open its rice markets in KORUS FTA negotiations, which South Korean negotiators strongly resist. Automotive trade is a perennial issue in trade talks between the U.S. and South Korea. U.S. officials argue that Korean tax and certification practices discriminate against imports. In 2005, U.S. officials highlighted automobiles as a key issue for launching an FTA with South Korea. The South Korean Ministry of the Environment granted exemptions to auto makers until 2009 from regulations on ultra-low emissions. South Korean imports of foreign automobiles, including U.S. vehicles, increased to over 4% of the market in 2006. In 2006, South Korean auto manufacturers, mainly Hyundai Motors, sold nearly 750,000 cars in the United States, capturing over 4% of the market. A significant change was that over one-quarter of these cars were produced at Hyundai's plant in Alabama. The U.S. ran a trade deficit with South Korea in auto parts shipments, reaching over $1.7 billion in 2006. The United States has been urging South Korea to lower its 8% tariff on imported cars, which is more than three times the U.S. level of 2.5%. There have been calls for South Korea to switch from engine displacement taxation to a value-based system to avoid penalizing larger vehicles. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to address barriers to foreign market access in South Korea's automotive industry. South Korea's market was closed to automobile imports until 1989, with a ban on Japanese imports lifted in 1999. Despite opening up to foreign investment, most cars sold in Korea are locally produced. In 1998, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed to reduce tariffs on motor vehicles from 80% to 8%, following U.S. pressure to provide fair market access for foreign autos in Korea. Seoul agreed to reduce tariffs on motor vehicles from 80% to 8%, address anti-import activity, lower automobile taxes, create a new financing system, and streamline certification procedures. Korean-owned auto companies have been largely abandoned, with Hyundai purchasing Kia and General Motors acquiring Daewoo Motor Company. Foreign investors now control Samsung and Ssangyong, while Korea's top automotive manufacturer is building cars. Hyundai Motors opened a $1.1 billion plant in Montgomery, Alabama in May 2005, producing nearly 200,000 cars in 2006. The facility is expected to produce 300,000 vehicles annually, employing 2,000 workers and 5,500 workers in its suppliers. In Korea, Hyundai Motor faced legal and labor issues in 2006, including a $24 million fine for competition violations and chairman Chung Mong-koo facing corruption charges. The company's union members staged walkouts on 32 days in 2006, resulting in production losses of 115,683 units. Hyundai Motors faced legal and labor issues in 2006, including a $24 million fine for competition violations and chairman Chung Mong-koo facing corruption charges. The company's union members staged walkouts on 32 days, resulting in production losses of 115,683 units. Hyundai's legal troubles have affected the construction of a new plant in West Point, Georgia by Kia Motors, with production scheduled to begin in 2009. Korea's pharmaceutical trade has been a contentious issue in KORUS FTA talks, with the country ranked in the world's top 15 pharmaceutical markets. Korea's expenditures on pharmaceutical products are about $115 per person per year, less than half the OECD average. The U.S. government has criticized Korea's pharmaceutical policies for protecting the domestic industry, leading to complaints about lack of transparency, price incentives for Korean-made products, poor intellectual property rights protection, and retesting requirements for foreign drugs on Koreans. Seoul requires foreign drugs to be retested on Koreans, not other ethnic Asians as the US insists. In 2002, a bilateral private sector health care reform working group was established. Progress was made in 2005, with South Korea agreeing to consult with the pharmaceutical industry on pricing and reimbursement decisions. US officials considered pharmaceutical regulations a major bilateral issue in 2005. South Korea's protection of its domestic film industry has been a major hurdle in negotiations for a bilateral investment treaty with the United States. Despite pledges to reduce quotas, the issue remains unresolved. The motion picture industries in both countries hold significant political influence, with South Korean actors supporting President Roh during the 2002 elections. South Korea's Prime Minister announced a reduction in screen quotas to 73 days a year, following the partial lifting of the beef ban. This concession was seen as a symbol of the government's ability to make difficult political decisions, paving the way for FTA talks with the U.S. South Korea's intervention in foreign currency markets to boost exports has also been a point of criticism. The won has been appreciating against the dollar since 2001, reaching levels not seen since before the 1997 financial crisis. South Korean authorities have intervened to slow the won's rise, but less than Japan and China. This is worrisome for Korean exporters who compete directly with Japanese companies and rely on imports from Japan. The United States raised currency intervention as a major issue at the APEC Finance Ministers meeting. South Korea's intervention in currency markets was a major issue at the APEC and G-7 Finance Ministers meetings in September 2003. Despite easing off large-scale interventionist policies, minor intervention continued to smooth excessive currency volatility. The won's spike led to discussions on overvaluation, with plans to loosen restrictions on won-denominated transactions. However, signs of resumed intervention by the Bank of Korea emerged by late 2006. The South Korean government aims to stabilize the economy by maintaining the currency at a certain level through unlimited resources and intervention in the currency market. The launch of the Korean Investment Corporation (KIC) in 2005, managing $20 billion initially and expected to reach $100 billion by 2012, aims to invest foreign currency holdings more effectively and boost Korea's asset management industry. The South Korean government aims to stabilize the economy by maintaining the currency at a certain level through unlimited resources and intervention in the currency market. Some members of Congress have criticized Korea's currency policy, with a \"Fair Currency Act\" introduced to monitor and take action against countries like South Korea engaged in currency manipulation. Bilateral tensions have also arisen over U.S. allegations of Korea not sufficiently protecting intellectual property rights, leading to fluctuations in Korea's status on the Special 301 \"priority watch list\" and the \"watch list.\" The USTR downgraded Korea to the \"watch list\" due to significant steps taken to strengthen its IPR regime, including increased protection for internet recordings and the launch of a comprehensive plan for IPR protection. Korea established a Copyright Protection Center and a Standing Inspection Team for enforcement against illegal software. USTR commended these efforts but highlighted areas for additional progress, such as copyright protection and DVD piracy. Telecommunications has become a contentious trade issue between the U.S. and South Korea, with South Korea's high internet usage making it a key market. South Korea, with high internet usage, is a key market for testing wireless products. The government aims to boost GDP through next-gen mobile communications. USTR named South Korea a \"key country of concern\" for setting mandatory wireless standards. The Ministry of Information and Communication in South Korea planned to mandate the use of WIPI for cell phone services, developed by a Korean association funded by ETRI. This would have excluded other platforms like Qualcomm's. A compromise was reached in April 2004 allowing WIPI implementation while also permitting compatibility with other standards. Another dispute involved MoIC's mandatory standard for a new portable broadband Internet system in the 2.3 GHz spectrum. The USTR and U.S. companies accused ETRI of influencing the design of a new broadband Internet system in South Korea to favor Samsung. The Korean government later mandated the use of a standard compatible with IEEE, criticized by USTR for excluding other systems. USTR also urged Korea to revise restrictions on foreign ownership in the telecom sector. South Korean steel exports to the U.S. were a contentious issue from 1998 to 2003, especially after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. South Korean steel exports to the U.S. surged after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, leading to anti-dumping cases and safeguard relief for U.S. steel producers. Challenges at the World Trade Organization resulted in the termination of safeguard tariffs by President Bush in 2003. Korea also won a WTO case regarding anti-dumping duties on stainless steel exports to the U.S. The United States imposed tariffs on Korean exports of stainless steel plate in coils and sheet/strip. Korea is a major steel exporter to the U.S., but behind Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and China. A trade dispute in 2001 involved allegations of Korean government support for Hynix Semiconductor. Hynix's creditors, mostly Korean government-owned, helped restructure its debt. In the United States, Micron Technology led a campaign against support packages for Hynix Semiconductor, arguing they were government-sponsored bailouts. Micron filed a countervailing duty case, resulting in punitive tariffs on Hynix's exports. The European Union also imposed duties. The WTO ruled in 2005 that the U.S. failed to prove Korean government subsidies to Hynix. In June 2005, the WTO's Appellate Body reversed a ruling on government subsidies to Hynix Semiconductor, leading to the United States maintaining punitive tariffs. Hynix underwent a successful turnaround by selling non-semiconductor assets, improving efficiency, and becoming the world's third-largest chipmaker by sales in 2006. South Korea has been praised for bridging differences in multilateral trade talks, but criticized for resisting agricultural liberalization. Seoul has faced criticism for resisting agricultural liberalization in trade negotiations, with high tariffs on agricultural products compared to industrial products. The United States has used anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws to raise tariffs on Korean exports, affecting industries like semiconductors, steel, televisions, and telecommunications equipment. During the Uruguay Round, Korea pushed for revisions to global trade agreements. South Korea has been assertive in challenging U.S. trade practices through the WTO, winning cases on anti-dumping duties for steel and semiconductors. Complaints about U.S. visa policies have been raised by Korean officials, businesses, and Korean-Americans. South Korea is pursuing participation in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, which allows travelers from certain countries to visit the U.S. for up to ninety days without traditional immigration documents. This is a priority for the South Korean government, and any changes in this area by the U.S. could impact the FTA negotiations. South Korea must meet specific requirements, including a low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate, to qualify for the program. South Korea's visa refusal rates have consistently been over the required threshold for participation in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. Meeting the refusal rate is not the only requirement, as a country's participation must also be in the economic, law enforcement, and security interests of the United States. President Bush announced support for South Korea's efforts to develop a roadmap to meet the program's requirements during a summit in November 2005. H.R. 4304, introduced in November 2005 by Representative James Moran, would designate South Korea as a program country under the Visa Waiver Program. South Korea has objected to U.S. visa policies post-9/11, including mandatory interviews and fingerprinting, likening it to Japan's occupation. South Korea also seeks market access for its service providers in the U.S. The curr_chunk discusses legislative actions related to South Korea, including the South Korean Fair Trade Act and the Fair Currency Enforcement Act. It also mentions a bill designating South Korea as a program country under the visa waiver program. Designated the Republic of Korea as a program country under the visa waiver program on November 10, 2005. Referred to House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims. No bills introduced in the 110th Congress."
