    "content": "The U.S. EPA established national standards for mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants in 2005 due to its harmful effects on health, particularly in fetuses and children. Mercury enters water bodies through air emissions and bioaccumulates in fish, leading to advisories in 44 states by December 2004. Mercury contamination in coastal waters and marine fish is a concern in the United States, with coal-fired power plants being the largest source of emissions. The Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) aims to reduce emissions by 69% compared to 1999 levels by 2018, but some argue that mercury control technologies are already available. As of February 2007, 18 states have established more stringent emission limits than the EPA's, with four other states developing similar regulations. These states include Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, collectively accounting for 177 coal-fired power plants. The combined generation capacity of these units is estimated at 97,138 megawatts, representing 32% of total U.S. coal-fired electric generation. As of February 2007, 18 states have stricter emission limits than the EPA's, with four more states developing similar regulations. These states have a total of 177 coal-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 97,138 megawatts, accounting for 32% of total U.S. coal-fired electric generation. Additionally, Georgia, Michigan, Washington, and Wisconsin have proposed mercury standards for 51 plants, adding 33,986 Mw or 11% of U.S. coal-fired generation capacity. The state standards vary in stringency, effective dates, and compliance details, with most programs requiring 80% to 90% reductions in mercury emissions when fully implemented by 2015. The state programs for reducing mercury emissions provide flexibility by measuring compliance as a rolling 12-month average, rather than setting strict emission limits. Unlike the CAMR program, state programs generally prohibit interstate trading of mercury credits to prevent hot spots and ensure emission reductions within their state. States prohibiting interstate trading ensure emission reductions within their state do not generate credits for other states. State mercury control programs vary in emission limit expressions, such as percentage reductions or fixed limits. Some states adjust limits based on coal type or plant size. Comparing stringency across states can be challenging. The stringency of state mercury control programs varies, making it difficult to compare requirements. Factors like varying coal mercury content and existing emission control equipment complicate emission reduction calculations. EPA estimates existing controls already reduce mercury emissions by about one-third nationwide. Achieving a 90% reduction of inlet mercury is challenging. Achieving a 90% reduction of inlet mercury does not necessarily require a 90% reduction in current emission levels, especially at plants with baghouses. Data on current mercury emission levels are limited, making it challenging to predict exact reductions from emission control programs. Monitoring equipment improvements from state and federal programs will help establish more precise emission levels. New Jersey, Virginia, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania have unique features in their emission control programs. New Jersey may extend compliance deadlines for major reductions in pollutants. Virginia has different requirements for the largest utility. Minnesota's law applies to facilities above 500 Mw. Pennsylvania presumes compliance with specific control technology. Three states and the District of Columbia have de facto zero mercury limits. Three states and the District of Columbia have de facto zero mercury limits for power plant emissions under the federal CAMR rule. States without coal-fired power plants or plants smaller than 25 Mw are not granted allowances. If these states do not join the federal cap-and-trade program, they must demonstrate zero emissions through in-state controls. States with de facto zero mercury limits for power plant emissions under the federal CAMR rule can prohibit new coal-fired power plants by demonstrating limited emissions through in-state controls. Alternatively, states can join the federal allowance trading program to allow new coal-fired power plants by purchasing emission allowances from facilities outside the state. Some states, like Idaho, Rhode Island, and Vermont, have chosen not to participate in the CAMR program, effectively banning new coal-fired power plants. Other states with minimal coal-fired generation, such as Alaska, California, Hawaii, Maine, and South Dakota, have very low allowances under CAMR, making up less than 1% of the national total. Some states with minimal coal-fired generation, like Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, and South Dakota, have low allowances under CAMR, making up less than 1% of the national total. Alaska, Hawaii, and South Dakota have chosen to participate in the CAMR program, while Maine has let EPA administer the program. California is considering a state program and is unlikely to participate in CAMR. Additionally, STAPPA and ALAPCO developed a model rule in 2005 to encourage stricter controls on power plant mercury emissions. The STAPPA/ALAPCO model rule in 2005 aims to tighten controls on power plant mercury emissions. It offers two options - the first phase requires an 80% capture of inlet mercury by December 31, 2008, and the second phase mandates a 90-95% capture by December 31, 2012. Interstate trading of allowances is prohibited under this rule. The STAPPA/ALAPCO model rule offers flexibility to electric generating units in exchange for installing control technologies to capture pollutants. Owners can delay compliance with mercury emission limits for four years at 50% capacity if they meet strict standards for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter emissions by 2012. Many states have adopted programs stricter than the federal CAMR rule since the model rule was introduced. Some states, like California and Northeastern states, have adopted stricter environmental requirements than the federal CAMR rule. This reflects a belief that the federal rule is not stringent enough in controlling mercury emissions. EPA's assessment of technology to control mercury emissions is criticized as pessimistic. States faced a deadline to submit programs under the CAMR rule, with the threat of Federal Implementation Plans for non-compliance. EPA officials pushed for CAMR adoption, while some states pursued legal action against the rule. The ongoing debate over EPA's rule on mercury emissions control continues, with states implementing stringent control requirements. The effectiveness and cost of technology will impact EPA's stance, with congressional oversight likely until 2008."
