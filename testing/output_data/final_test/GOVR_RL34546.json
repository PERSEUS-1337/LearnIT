    "content": "Rising energy prices and greenhouse gas emissions have led Congress to focus on energy alternatives like wind power. Wind power is growing rapidly and already plays a significant role in some European nations, as well as in China and India. This report discusses utility-scale wind power issues in the United States, including background, resources, technology, industry trends, economics, and policy issues such as the extension of the renewable energy production tax credit. The economic analysis suggests that the renewable energy production tax credit should be extended past its scheduled expiration in 2009 to fund wind power. Congress is considering legislation to facilitate new transmission capacity for wind farms, as sites are often remote and require expensive infrastructure. There is also discussion on establishing a national renewable portfolio standard to make wind power more competitive compared to fossil and nuclear energy options. The modern wind industry began in the early 1980s driven by high energy prices, energy insecurity, and environmental concerns. Many states have RPS programs to promote wind power development, while federal funding for research and development, siting, and permitting requirements are also discussed. The modern wind industry started in the early 1980s due to high energy prices, energy insecurity, and environmental concerns. Early wind turbines at Altamont Pass in California were primitive and costly, but today's turbines are more powerful, reliable, and cost-effective. The industry has evolved with advanced materials, electronics, and aerodynamics, making wind power more competitive. Large companies and investment banks now drive most wind power activity compared to the early days of collaboration among scientists and inventors. The U.S. wind industry saw stagnation in the mid-1980s to late 1990s due to low energy prices and high costs. However, improvements in technology drove down costs and increased reliability. Federal and state incentives encouraged electricity production at wind farms, leading to rapid expansion in 1999. Wind power is now the fastest growing source of new power generation in the United States, with a 150% increase in installed wind turbine capacity between 2004 and 2007. In 2007, the U.S. wind power industry experienced significant growth, with over 5,000 megawatts of new generating capacity added. Global wind power installations also rose by 27% to reach a total of 94,123 megawatts. Factors driving this growth include advancements in wind energy technology, high fossil fuel prices, federal incentives like the wind production tax credit, and state renewable portfolio standards. Germany is the only country with more wind power capacity than the United States. The U.S. wind power industry faces challenges like difficulty siting and financing new coal-fired power plants, consumer preference for renewable energy, and transmission capacity constraints. Concerns exist in states with higher wind power generation about potential price increases and grid security threats. There is a shortage of wind turbine components and delays in transmission interconnection, leading to rising costs. Benefits and drawbacks of wind energy are frequently noted. The challenges for wind energy include variability in electricity production based on wind consistency, integration costs at 15-30% turbine capacity, and the need for new transmission infrastructure. Construction costs allocation and pricing methodologies are debated for efficient transmission of wind-generated power. Wind power faces transmission constraints due to distance from demand centers and variable output. Texas is considering new transmission capacity costing $3-6 billion to send wind-generated power to more populated areas. Nationally, the DOE suggests building over 12,000 miles of new transmission lines at a cost of $20 billion to meet a 20% wind energy target by 2030. Federal and state incentives support wind power. The EIA estimated federal incentives for wind at $724 million, potentially exceeding $1 billion in 2008 with increased wind generation. Costs of RPS policies are hard to estimate, with some questioning the high costs for a small energy amount. Concerns include the on-off nature of federal PTC incentives, environmental impacts like bird deaths, visual effects, and noise from wind turbines. Wind turbines have no direct emissions of air pollutants and offset the need for fossil fuel extraction and transportation. In 2007, wind power contributed 32 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity to the U.S. grid, preventing the release of 19.5 million tons of carbon dioxide compared to traditional power plants. Wind power displaces coal and gas generation, reducing demand for these fuels and potentially moderating prices. Farmers and ranchers receive royalty payments from wind developers for leasing their land, providing additional income. Wind energy also generates property taxes for local governments. Wind turbines do not require water like fossil and nuclear plants. Wind turbines do not need water for cooling, making them advantageous in areas with scarce water resources. The lead time for planning and constructing wind plants is shorter compared to nuclear and coal plants. Wind energy creates \"green collar\" jobs and a study estimated that 76,000 U.S. jobs in the wind industry were at risk without policy support. The section covers how wind turbines work, wind resources in the U.S., and technology trends in the sector. The section outlines technology trends in the wind power sector, focusing on large utility-scale wind turbines. Wind turbines generate electricity by harnessing wind energy through spinning turbine blades connected to a generator. Wind farms can have power generating capacity equal to traditional power plants. Smaller off-grid wind power applications are also growing rapidly. The evolution of wind power technology and market development is influenced by physical relationships. Wind turbine power output varies with wind speed and blade length, leading to the placement of turbines at higher altitudes and the use of longer blades to increase energy harnessing efficiency. Turbine manufacturers focus on finding strong materials for longer blades to handle twisting forces in fluctuating winds. Power output increases with air density, which is higher in winter and at low altitudes. Wind resources in the US have been extensively studied, with NREL producing wind resource maps indicating promising areas with excellent winds averaging 17 mph or above at 150 feet altitude. The US has abundant wind energy potential, with the Great Plains states having the best onshore wind resources. Wind power advocates believe it could contribute 20% of the nation's electricity by 2030. However, a drawback is that these resources are far from densely populated areas. Developers must carefully study local conditions for over a year to ensure stable revenue streams for potential financiers. The drawback to rich wind resources is their distance from populated areas, requiring expensive transmission line construction. Offshore wind projects have higher development costs and face public opposition, unlike in Europe where 1,099 MW of offshore wind was installed by 2007. The largest proposed US offshore wind project, the 420 MW Cape Wind project, is awaiting a permit. The Cape Wind project is the largest proposed US offshore wind project, awaiting a permit from the DOI's Minerals Management Service. Debate has arisen over its safety, cost, and environmental impact, with proponents touting it as a safe, clean way to develop renewable energy and create jobs. Opponents, including the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, argue that the project threatens the area's ecosystem, maritime navigation, and tourism industry. MMS released a Draft Environmental Impact Statement in March 2008, with a final EIS expected later that year. Other offshore wind projects have been proposed in Delaware and Texas. Commercial, utility-scale wind turbines have evolved significantly since the 1980s and 1990s, growing in size and efficiency. The future of wind technology could be influenced by congressional policy and regulatory frameworks. Turbines have increased in size to a maximum of 6 megawatts in 2008, with the average size in the US being 1.6 megawatts in 2007. Larger turbines provide greater efficiency and economy of scale, but are more complex to build and deploy. Vertical axis and horizontal axis wind turbines are the two main types, with vertical axis turbines being more efficient and easier to service due to ground-level control equipment. However, horizontal axis turbines, which are more common today, are favored for their ability to reach higher wind speeds. These turbines have blades connected to a rotor that spins a low-speed shaft geared to a higher-speed shaft in the generator. An automated yaw motor system adjusts the turbine to face the wind. Size limitations exist for efficient deployment of wind turbines. Barriers to deploying large wind turbines efficiently include transport penalties for oversized components, aviation and radar interference, local opposition to siting, erection challenges, and material fatigue issues. Wind turbine power output depends on wind speed, with capacity factor being a useful tool to summarize average annual wind availability and speed for projects. The capacity factor achieved strongly influences the cost of wind energy production. The capacity factor of wind plants strongly influences the cost and profitability of projects. Nuclear plants have an average capacity factor of 90%, coal plants 70%, and wind plants typically range from 20% to 40%. Offshore wind turbines generally have higher capacity factors than onshore units. Offshore wind turbines have higher capacity factors than onshore units due to steadier ocean winds, lowering the cost of electricity. The timing of electricity production is crucial as it affects the value of electricity. Future advancements in wind turbine technology will likely be evolutionary, focusing on offshore deployment, gearbox innovation, and blade design. Offshore wind turbine advancements focus on gearbox innovation, blade design, and low wind speed turbine development. Energy storage plays a crucial role in making wind power available when needed, with hydroelectric pumped storage being a common method. In the United States, pumped storage accounts for a small percentage of hydroelectric power generation, but growth potential is limited due to existing development and public opposition to new projects. Other energy storage options like compressed air storage and advanced batteries face technical and cost challenges. Research is ongoing to reduce costs for these options, benefiting wind power and other renewable sources. Texas leads in wind power generation in the US, followed by California, Minnesota, Iowa, Washington, and Colorado. Texas leads in wind power generation in the US, followed by California, Minnesota, Iowa, Washington, and Colorado. Other states with significant wind power installations include Oregon, Illinois, and the Dakotas. These states benefit from good wind resources, renewable portfolio standards, and local government support. The Southeastern region lacks wind power projects due to poor wind resources, impacting its opposition to a national Renewable Portfolio Standard. The map in Figure 7 displays existing and planned wind plants in North America by size. While there are more planned projects than existing ones, not all may be built. The upper Great Plains region shows significant potential for tapping into prime wind sites. Limited transmission capacity hinders development in high-quality wind regions. Major wind turbine suppliers in the US include General Electric (GE) Wind, Siemens, Vestas, Mitsubishi, Suzlon, and Gamesa, with GE's 1.5 megawatt turbine being the most commonly installed in 2007. Major wind turbine suppliers in the US include General Electric (GE) Wind, Siemens, Vestas, Mitsubishi, Suzlon, and Gamesa. Suzlon, the world's fifth largest turbine producer, may face challenges after recalling turbine blades in the US market. New manufacturers like Clipper Windpower are gaining market share with new 2.5 megawatt turbines. Chinese firms Gold Wind and Sinovel are expected to enter international markets in 2009 with low-cost turbines. Wind industry manufacturing facilities in the US grew from a small base in 2005 to over 100 in 2007. Wind turbine component manufacturing facilities in the United States expanded significantly from 2005 to 2007, with new facilities opening in several states. European companies find it attractive to expand in the US due to the euro's value against the dollar. Despite the growth in manufacturing facilities globally, demand for wind turbines continues to exceed supply. The financial crisis in 2008 temporarily affected debt financing for infrastructure projects, including wind power. Independent power producers are the main operators of wind plants in the US. Independent power producers (IPPs), also known as merchant providers, operate wind plants in the United States and have the most flexibility in utilizing renewable tax incentives. Utilities build a small percentage of new wind capacity, with companies like Acciona, AES, Babcock & Brown, and FPL Energy actively developing and operating wind plants. Consolidation among companies is strong, with acquisitions such as Horizon Wind by Energias de Portugal and Airtricity North America by E.ON AG. The United States surpassed Germany in wind power deployment in 1996. Strong growth in new wind capacity pushed the US ahead of Spain in 2007. The Global Wind Energy Council expects the US to become the world leader in installed capacity by the end of 2009. Grid operators must address operational issues related to the variability of wind. Despite similar total wind capacity, the US has a lower percentage penetration rate of wind power generation compared to European countries like Denmark, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and Germany. China, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland have experience with high wind integration rates. China's wind sector is rapidly growing but still lags behind coal-fired power plant construction. German wind power experience is highlighted. Wind technology has evolved, leading to larger, more reliable machines. The US manufacturing capacity has expanded, resulting in competitive wind electricity costs. Various factors impact wind power economics, including a financial analysis comparing construction costs. The financial analysis compares the cost of wind power with other technologies like coal, natural gas, and nuclear power. Wind power has low variable costs and high fixed costs, with no fuel expenses and minimal maintenance costs. The analysis was done before the 2008 financial crisis. Expenses related to fossil fuel combustion, such as air pollution control equipment and future carbon controls, are avoided by wind power. Initial cost of wind turbines is half of total development costs. Wind plants have low variable costs but high fixed O&M costs, making them capital intensive. Building wind plants has become more expensive in recent years, with project costs declining in the 1990s but rising again since the early 2000s. The cost of wind power projects has increased steadily since the early 2000s, averaging over $1,700 per kilowatt in 2007. Higher input prices, a shortage of skilled workers, and other factors have contributed to the overall cost increase. Some analysts believe that lapses in the production tax credit have led to boom-and-bust cycles in the sector. Operators aim to maximize power output to spread fixed costs over more kilowatt-hours, making the power more economical for consumers. Wind power is more economical for consumers but cannot run continuously due to wind variability. Geographic diversity can help offset local wind variations, but wind power cannot match the reliability of fossil or nuclear technology. The combination of low capacity factor and high fixed costs drives up the cost of wind-generated electricity. The variable nature of wind power also adds additional cost implications for electric power systems to meet all customer loads reliably. Power systems rely on dispatchable and predictable generating technologies to meet customer loads. Wind turbines, being weather-dependent, are not as reliable as fossil or nuclear units. Energy storage can help mitigate this issue but at a higher cost. When wind constitutes a significant portion of the total generating capacity, the system must account for variations in wind output through existing buffer capacity. This capacity includes fossil fuel, nuclear, or dispatchable renewable energy sources. Wind power integration into power systems incurs additional costs for reliable backup due to variability. Estimates range from $1.85 to $4.97 per megawatt-hour, with examples like a utility in Montana building a gas-fired plant for this purpose. Wind power offers zero fuel costs but has high fixed costs and limited operation compared to fossil or nuclear plants. Wind power integration incurs additional costs for reliable backup due to variability, offset by federal tax credits and state mandates. Wind turbines can act as baseload plants when conditions are favorable. Economic analysis compares wind power to coal, nuclear, and natural gas technologies. The financial analysis technique of levelized costs compares generation costs of wind power and other technologies. Costs are measured in constant 2008 dollars, with assumptions on plant construction costs and operations detailed in the Appendix. Table 2 summarizes the \"overnight\" construction costs for each technology and the assumed capacity factor. Coal and nuclear plants are assumed to be built by regulated utilities with financial resources and regulatory support. The natural gas combined-cycle plant and wind plant are assumed to be built by independent power producers (IPPs) due to their preference for gas-fired projects and inability of regulated utilities to utilize production tax credits. Estimates in Table 2 do not include the impacts of the 2008 financial crisis. Costs were estimated for six cases illustrating economic, operational, and government incentive factors influencing wind power economics. The Base Case assumes continuation of the renewable production tax credit and nuclear plant qualification for the nuclear production tax credit and loan guarantee program. The five alternative cases include: Case 2 - Reduced Incentives, Case 3 - High Natural Gas Prices, Case 4 - Carbon Costs, and Case 5 - Wind Capacity Factor. These cases involve changes in incentives, natural gas prices, carbon costs, and wind plant capacity factor. In Case 6, a system integration charge is added to the cost of wind power, assuming a constant cost of $2.82 per megawatt-hour. The results for the six cases are summarized in Table 3, with estimates subject to uncertainty. The levelized cost of wind power in Case 1 is slightly higher than coal or gas-fired power, while nuclear power benefits from federal incentives. In Case 2, reducing incentives significantly impacts the cost of different energy sources. If the renewable production tax credit ends, wind power becomes 10% more expensive, giving coal and gas a 14% to 15% cost advantage. Without a loan guarantee, nuclear power's cost increases by 28%, making wind power cost similar to nuclear. When gas prices are 50% higher, wind has an 18% cost advantage over gas-fired electricity. In Case 3, wind has an 18% cost advantage over gas-fired electricity. Imposing a $25 per metric ton carbon cost in Case 4 greatly impacts wind's competitiveness with coal, shifting coal from a 4% cost advantage to a 19% disadvantage. Wind's high capacity factor in Case 5 results in the lowest cost among alternatives, over 25% less costly than others. The financial analysis shows that wind power has the lowest cost compared to coal and gas, with a 25% cost advantage in Case 5. The addition of a system integration charge in Case 6 does not significantly change the cost comparison. Federal financial incentives play a significant role in the economics of wind power, with the production tax credit impacting its competitiveness against coal and gas, and nuclear incentives affecting its comparison to nuclear power. The report discusses government policy issues related to wind power, including permitting, renewable production tax credit extension, and compliance with federal, state, and local requirements for wind energy projects in the United States. Most wind projects are built on private land, with local and state jurisdictions playing a crucial role. Improved technology and prime locations can lower the cost of wind power, making it more competitive against coal and gas, especially with higher natural gas prices or carbon charges. Wind energy projects are primarily built on private land, with local and state jurisdictions having a significant role in siting and permitting. Federal requirements such as the Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and FAA Hazard Determination also apply. The main environmental concern is bird and bat collisions with wind turbines, with a small percentage of annual bird deaths attributed to wind-energy facilities. The impact on specific species could be significant as wind power continues to expand. The expansion of wind power could have a significant impact on specific species, with early turbines in California causing bird fatalities, especially among raptors. Today's turbines are more bird-friendly, but bat fatalities have been a concern in various locations. The formation of the Bats & Wind Energy Cooperative aims to reduce bat mortality through collaborative studies. Experts agree that more research is needed to accurately predict the effects of expanding wind plants on avian behavior. The impact of wind plant expansion on species is being studied, with efforts to minimize avian deaths through various mitigation options. Wildlife experts are also examining how wind plant construction affects terrestrial animals, such as greater prairie chickens. Interim guidelines were produced in 2003 to help developers consider and reduce wildlife impacts, and a Wind Turbine Guidelines Advisory Committee has been established by the DOI. The Wind Turbine Guidelines Advisory Committee advises on minimizing wildlife impacts from land-based wind turbines. Some landowners object to the visual impact of wind turbines in valuable areas. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gives MMS authority over siting offshore wind plants. The Cape Wind project faces opposition due to concerns about altering seascapes with wind turbines. Noise and shadow flicker are also objections, with newer turbine models designed to minimize these impacts. Noise is a regulatory siting criterion, while shadow flicker occurs when moving blades cast alternating shadows. Shadow flicker from wind turbines can be annoying for nearby residents, but computer simulations can help position turbines to minimize the impact. Radar interference can occur when turbines reflect radar waves, raising national security concerns. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 required a report on the impacts of wind plants on military readiness. A temporary ruling contested wind plant construction near key military radar facilities until a report was completed. AWEA criticized the moratorium on wind investment. The ruling was clarified for case-by-case evaluation, and permitting resumed for most projects later that year. The DOD impacts report found that wind farms near air defense radars can degrade radar performance. Mitigation options are limited to avoiding turbines in radar line of sight. Research is ongoing for new mitigation approaches. The FAA oversees objects affecting airspace communication, with DOD involved in reviews. Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration is required by the FAA. The FAA requires a Notice of Proposed Construction for projects extending over 200 feet above ground level. The DOD report acknowledges challenges in preventing radar interference from wind farms, but DOE believes practical solutions are achievable. Interference is site-specific and can often be mitigated with software. Transmission constraints pose significant challenges. Transmission constraints are a major challenge for the U.S. wind industry, requiring new investment in aging and overloaded electricity grids. Siting new transmission lines is expensive and time-consuming, especially in remote areas with the best wind resources. Costs for new transmission lines are estimated at $1.5-$2 million per mile. Transmission constraints for wind power projects can occur due to limited capacity, scheduling difficulties, and delays in connecting new sources to the grid. Good wind plant sites may be far from existing transmission lines, requiring costly infrastructure investments. Texas is addressing these constraints through competitive renewable energy zones (CREZs) to optimize connections between wind zones and demand centers. California, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Colorado are expanding transmission infrastructure to accommodate wind and other electricity options. Under EPACT05, FERC may use federal over-ride authority to site new transmission lines in cases of congestion. FERC can approve a funding plan that charges new generators for interconnection costs, which may be costly for small wind facilities. EPACT05 directed FERC to establish incentive rules for transmission infrastructure investments to promote reliability, reduce costs, and address congestion. Order No. 679 allows public utilities to receive incentive rate treatment for such investments. Transmission scheduling challenges for wind power arise from outdated rules not designed for intermittent sources like wind. The electricity sector is transitioning to regional transmission organizations, leading to a rewrite of rules. Economic penalties under the old rules are being reevaluated. Under the old rules, economic penalties were applied to generators that did not meet their day-ahead schedule requirements, which wind power often struggled with due to its variability. FERC issued Order No. 890 in 2007 to increase access to transmission lines for all types of power generators, including renewable energy projects. Rate pancaking, a scheduling barrier for wind power in some regions, can be avoided by large transmission systems acting as a single network resource. FERC's attempt to promote a Standard Market Design order in 2002-2003 for greater transmission pricing uniformity was dropped due to opposition. FERC issued Orders 2003 and 661 to clarify transmission interconnection requirements and address discrimination. Long queues exist for wind and other power plant developers to interconnect with the grid. New guidance is being prepared to improve queuing methodology. Two bills in the 110th Congress aim to address transmission of wind power and renewable electricity. The Clean Renewable Energy and Economic Development Act (S. 2076) would require national renewable energy zones. Transmission interconnection queuing is likely to remain a problem as long as there is a shortage of capacity. The legislation aims to amend the Federal Power Act to establish national renewable energy zones with the potential to generate 1,000 megawatts of electricity from renewable sources. It also requires FERC to ensure that a significant portion of the new transmission capacity is used for renewable energy. The bill was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for further consideration. The Rural Clean Energy Superhighways Act (H.R. 4059) was introduced in November 2007 to create national renewable energy zones and increase electricity generation from renewable sources. It requires the President to identify additional renewable energy trunkline facilities and network upgrades, with FERC regulating transmission service rates for public utilities. The Renewable Energy Trunkline can be funded through transmission charges imposed on utility customers or RTO/ISO customers. Cost allocation procedures are prescribed for new projects and network upgrades. Federal power marketing administrations must finance upgrades if no other entity commits to do so. The renewable production tax credit incentivizes developers of wind and other renewable energy projects. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) incentivizes developers of wind and other renewable energy projects by offering a credit against taxes for each kilowatt-hour of energy produced. The PTC was renewed in 2008 until 2009, with proponents arguing that it corrects market failures and helps level the playing field with federal subsidies for conventional energy sources. Opponents of extending the production tax credit argue against special tax subsidies for renewable energy technologies, stating that subsidies distort the free market. They suggest putting a tax on pollution from energy sources instead. Additionally, they claim that intermittent renewable energy production is less valuable than energy from conventional facilities. The renewable Production Tax Credit (PTC) is not available to investor-owned utilities (IOUs), but allowing them to receive the tax credits could lower the cost of financing wind plants. This could make utilities more competitive in wind power production compared to independent power producers (IPPs), potentially threatening the growth of IPPs in the industry. During the 110th Congress, various bills aimed to extend or modify renewable energy tax incentives, including wind power. Bills like S. 2886, H.R. 3221, and H.R. 5351 proposed extending multiple incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency. For details on legislation related to the PTC for wind energy, refer to CRS Report RL33831. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended until the end of 2009 in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Climate change legislation in Congress focuses on cap-and-trade systems or carbon taxes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, creating a cost on emissions. Congressional Budget Office estimated a $30 per metric ton price for carbon dioxide allowances in a proposed bill. Future legislation is likely to have similar price levels. Wind power would be 19% cheaper than coal with a carbon price. Even without the PTC, wind power is more competitive. The impact on natural gas would be less, but wind would still be cheaper. Congress may need to reconsider the PTC with a carbon constraint. An alternative is the renewable energy payment system, used in Europe, guaranteeing grid interconnection and premium prices for renewable energy producers. Financing projects under this system is reportedly easier due to a transparent revenue source. The Renewable Energy Jobs and Security Act, which includes renewable energy payments, was introduced in mid-June 2008. Many states restructured their electric utility industries in the late 1990s to allow for more competition, with some implementing a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to promote renewable energy. As of April 2008, 26 states and the District of Columbia had an RPS in place, with requirements varying from state to state. Critics in Germany argue that feed-in tariffs can be costly, despite providing a transparent revenue source for renewable energy producers. In April 2008, 26 states and the District of Columbia had a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) in place, covering about 54% of the national electric load. RPS targets range from 2% to 25% of electricity generation, with most states aiming for 10% to 20% by 2010 to 2025. Wind energy is a common eligible resource, and states allow trading of renewable energy credits. Non-compliance penalties range from 1.0 to 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Some states in the Southeast and Midwest lack an RPS requirement, while others include energy efficiency measures. State RPS actions inform a potential national requirement. Proponents of a federal Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) argue that a national system of tradable credits would allow retail suppliers in states with fewer resources to comply at a lower cost. However, opponents believe that regional differences in renewable energy availability would make a federal RPS costly and unfair. Efforts to include a federal RPS in the Energy Independence and Security Act were unsuccessful, with a proposed 15% federal RPS amendment ultimately ruled non-germane. Opponents of a national RPS argue that it would raise electricity prices and disadvantage Southeastern states lacking sufficient renewable energy resources. The House approved H.R. 6 with a 15% RPS, but the Senate dropped the provision under threat of an Administration veto. Wind power in the United States is growing rapidly, supplying about 1% of the country's electricity needs. Some states have a much higher level of wind penetration. The proposed new wind plants in the United States could soon make wind the largest source of new power supply at the national level. However, the expansion of wind power may be hindered by the financial crisis, lack of transmission capacity, and the expiration of the federal renewable production tax credit. Federal policy on climate change in the 111th Congress could give wind power additional advantages over coal and natural gas-based electricity. Congress needs to carefully consider energy and climate legislation when crafting future policy. The analysis period through 2050 evaluates the operating costs and capital recovery of generating technologies. Plant costs vary yearly due to factors like fuel prices and government incentives, converted to uniform annual costs. Capital costs are also converted to levelized annual payments, considering factors like income taxes and cost of money. A project-specific capital charge rate is computed to recover investment costs and provide a return on investment. The study computes a project-specific capital charge rate based on the cost of money and depreciation schedule. It calculates a mortgage-type levelized annual payment using a \"capital recovery factor\" for each project. This allows for comparison of different technologies on an annualized cost per Mwh basis. Inputs include financing costs, fuel prices, and operational expenses. The study considers various factors such as operations and maintenance expenses, plant efficiency, utilization rates, and government incentives like renewable energy production tax credits. The capital costs are estimated based on public information, and federal incentive programs play a significant role in the financial analysis. The Base Case analysis assumes the extension of the tax credit for wind power production sold to third parties. The credit is limited to independent power producers and not available for utility-owned wind plants. It is currently available for new wind, geothermal, and other renewable energy sources, but not for solar energy systems. A production tax credit of 1.8 cents per kWh is available for new advanced nuclear plants for the first eight years of operation. The nuclear production tax credit is not indexed to inflation and decreases in value over time. It is available for plants starting construction before January 1, 2014, and entering service before January 1, 2021. The annual credit is limited to $125 million per thousand megawatts of capacity, with full credit available if total capacity is 6,000 megawatts or less. If capacity exceeds 6,000 megawatts, the credit is prorated. In the case of 9,000 megawatts qualifying, the credit drops to 1.2 cents per kWh. The study uses a 1.2 cent per kWh assumption for the value of the credit. Loan guarantees for carbon-control technologies, including nuclear power, can cover up to 80% of project costs. Entities receiving guarantees must make a \"credit subsidy cost\" payment reflecting the cost to the government. Tax credits are available for renewable energy systems like solar and geothermal electricity generation. Public power entities are unlikely to receive loan guarantees. The investment tax credit applies to renewable energy systems like solar and geothermal electricity generation, excluding wind energy. The credit is 10% for systems installed after January 1, 2009. Geothermal projects cannot take both the investment tax credit and the renewable production tax credit. The estimates in the report are approximations due to uncertainties in factors like future fuel and capital costs. Site-specific factors would influence the choice of generating technologies for developers. The economics of wind energy depend on the strength and consistency of the wind in a given area, unlike the investment tax credit which applies to other renewable energy systems."
