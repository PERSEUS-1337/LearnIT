    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"State Child Well-Being Research Act of 2009\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that child well-being is a crucial concern at the state and local levels, influenced by various factors such as family circumstances, the economy, and public policies. States, including small ones, require specific and current data on child well-being to inform federal and state programs effectively. Regular state-level data collection is deemed essential for monitoring child well-being trends. Telephone surveys of parents are a cost-effective strategy to track child well-being at the State level, especially for small States lacking data in federally supported databases. This method can be used alone or in combination with other survey techniques to gather information on all children, not just those in Federal programs. Phone surveys are currently utilized to monitor progress towards national goals like preschool immunization. A State-level telephone survey, alone or in combination with other techniques, can provide information on various topics such as children's social and emotional development, education, health, safety, family income, family employment, and child care. It can also gather data on marriage and family structure for families with children, informing welfare policymaking for the entire State population. The State-level telephone survey can provide valuable information on children's social and emotional development, education, health, safety, family income, employment, and child care. This data can inform welfare policymaking on various important issues such as income support, child abuse, neglect, child health, family formation, and education. Research on indicators of child well-being is essential for informing welfare policymaking on important issues such as income support, child abuse, neglect, child health, family formation, and education. Section 413 of the Social Security Act is amended to rename the National Survey of Children's Health to the Survey of Children's Health and Well-Being. The survey will now include new indicators to better assess child well-being. The Survey of Children's Health and Well-Being will now include measures related to education, social and emotional development, physical and mental health, safety, and family well-being. Data collected must be statistically representative at the state and national level, and consistent across states. The data collected for the Survey of Children's Health and Well-Being must be reliable, current, and over-sampled for low-income children. It should be collected annually, be technically feasible, and made publicly available. The data collected for the Survey of Children's Health and Well-Being must be reliable, current, and over-sampled for low-income children. It should be collected annually, be technically feasible, and made publicly available. The data collected with respect to the indicators developed shall be published as absolute numbers and expressed in terms of rates or percentages. A data file shall be made available to the public, including indicators, demographic information, and ratios of income to poverty, with adequate sample sizes for microdata. The Secretary shall consult with a subcommittee of the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics to develop indicators and collect data on child well-being domains. The subcommittee will work with the Maternal and Child Health Bureau during the survey design phase. The Secretary will consult with the subcommittee on the design, content, and methodology of indicators, data collection, and costs incurred. The Secretary will establish an advisory panel of experts in consultation with the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics to make recommendations on additional survey matters and necessary methods and tools. The advisory panel established under subparagraph (A) shall include experts on child well-being domains, child indicators, State agencies, nonprofit organizations, and survey methodology. Members must be appointed within 2 months of the enactment of this subsection. The advisory panel established under subparagraph (A) shall meet at least 3 times in the first year after enactment and annually for the next 4 years. $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 for this purpose. GAO will report on data collection and reporting of deaths of children in foster care. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on collecting and reporting data on deaths of children in the child welfare system, including the number of children who died due to abuse or neglect but were not accounted for in State reports. The Comptroller General will provide recommendations on improving surveys to capture data on child deaths in the welfare system, not accounted for in State reports. This aims to help Congress and States develop better policies to enhance child well-being and reduce deaths."
