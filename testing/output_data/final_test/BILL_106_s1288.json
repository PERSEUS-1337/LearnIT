    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Community Forest Restoration Act\". It includes findings related to community forest restoration. The Congress finds that a century of fire suppression, logging, and livestock grazing has disrupted the ecological balance of New Mexico's forests. Some forest lands in the state have an unnaturally high number of small diameter trees, leading to large, intense wildfires that pose risks to human lives, livelihoods, and ecological stability. These lands with an abundance of small trees have reduced biodiversity and provide fewer benefits to communities, wildlife, and watersheds. Healthy watersheds are crucial for minimizing wildfire threats, supporting diverse wildlife habitats, and producing various timber and non-timber products, including high-quality water and increased water flows. Restoration efforts are more successful with involvement from neighboring communities and diverse stewardship. Collaborative design of demonstration projects can lead to cost-effective restoration activities, empower diverse organizations, build ownership and civic pride, and ensure healthy forests and watersheds. The purpose of collaborative restoration efforts is to involve neighboring communities and diverse stewardship in cost-effective activities to ensure healthy forests and watersheds. The Act aims to promote healthy watersheds, reduce wildfires, improve forest ecosystems, enhance biodiversity, facilitate communication among stakeholders, utilize small diameter trees effectively, and foster sustainable communities through collaborative partnerships for forest restoration in New Mexico. The Act aims to promote healthy watersheds, reduce wildfires, improve forest ecosystems, enhance biodiversity, facilitate communication among stakeholders, utilize small diameter trees effectively, and foster sustainable communities through collaborative partnerships for forest restoration in New Mexico. One of the key objectives is to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate ecologically sound forest restoration techniques. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture through the Chief of the Forest Service, and \"stakeholder\" includes tribal governments, educational institutions, landowners, and other interested entities. SEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM. The Secretary will establish a Collaborative Forest Restoration Program in New Mexico to provide cost-share grants for experimental forest restoration projects on various types of forest lands. The Federal share of project costs cannot exceed 80%, with the remaining 20% as a cash or in-kind contribution. Projects must aim to reduce wildfire threats and restore ecosystem balance. Eligible stakeholders include tribal governments, educational institutions, and landowners. The forest restoration projects aim to compete with trees to restore ecosystem functions, re-establish fire regimes, preserve old trees, replant deforested areas, and improve the use of small diameter trees. Compliance with Federal and State environmental laws is required, and a diverse group of stakeholders must be involved in the project design and implementation. The forest restoration project should incorporate current scientific information, include a multi-party assessment to identify existing and desired conditions, create local employment opportunities, not exceed four years in length, and report on project impact and effectiveness. The forest restoration project should not exceed four years in length and should not exceed a total annual cost of $150,000, with the Federal portion not exceeding $120,000 annually. Stakeholders must attend an annual workshop to discuss the program and projects, with the Secretary coordinating and funding the workshop. Stakeholders can use funding for travel expenses to attend the workshop. The selection process for the forest restoration project is outlined in Section 6. The Secretary will select proposals for funding through the Collaborative Forest Restoration Program after consulting with a technical advisory panel. The panel, composed of 12 to 15 members, will evaluate proposals and make recommendations based on eligibility criteria and long-term management objectives. Members will include a State Natural Resource official from New Mexico and representatives from Federal land management agencies. The Collaborative Forest Restoration Program involves a panel of 12-15 members, including representatives from Federal land management agencies, tribal or pueblo representatives, independent scientists, and equal representation from conservation, local communities, and commodity interests. The Secretary will establish a monitoring and evaluation process for the Collaborative Forest Restoration Program, involving interested parties. A monitoring program will assess ecological effects for a minimum of 15 years. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress five years after funding is available for the program, assessing the effectiveness of projects. $5,000,000 annually is authorized for this Act."
