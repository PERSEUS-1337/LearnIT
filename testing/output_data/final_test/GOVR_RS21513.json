    "content": "After the death of Amir Jabir Ahmad al-Jabir Al Sabah in 2006, Kuwait faced political crises leading to economic stagnation until 2013. The Amir is the head of state, appoints judges, and can suspend the National Assembly. The Prime Minister, always from the Sabah family, heads the government and appoints a cabinet. Key ministries are typically led by Sabah family members. After the death of Amir Jabir Ahmad al-Jabir Al Sabah in 2006, a succession dispute led to Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir Al Sabah becoming Amir. He appointed members of his Jabir branch as Crown Prince and Prime Minister. The dispute involved the elected legislature, and Amir Sabah is actively involved in governance at 87 years old. The current Prime Minister of Kuwait, Shaykh Jabir al-Mubarak Al Sabah, has been in office since December 2011. The National Assembly, established in 1962, is the longest-serving all-elected body among Gulf monarchies with 50 elected seats. The government has gradually expanded the electorate, including granting suffrage rights to Kuwaiti women in 2005. The National Assembly in Kuwait holds more authority than any other legislative body in the GCC states. The National Assembly in Kuwait holds significant authority, being able to draft legislation and question ministers. It can remove ministers and oust a prime minister through votes of \"no confidence\" or \"inability to cooperate with the government.\" The Assembly reviews government decrees during periods of suspension, with Kuwait's leaders having dissolved the Assembly on nine occasions. Some seek a constitutional monarchy where the elected Assembly majority names a Prime Minister. Political parties are not allowed, and factions compete in the Assembly. In Kuwait, political factions compete in Assembly elections as \"currents\" or \"trends.\" These factions also gather at traditional diwaniyya social events. The factions include Tribalists, Shia Islamists, elected Women deputies, and educated secular Liberals. Tribalists dominate two electoral districts and focus on government patronage. Shia deputies align with the government, while Women deputies also tend to support the government. Liberals are highly educated and secular in their approach. In Kuwait, political factions compete in Assembly elections as \"currents\" or \"trends.\" Tribalists dominate two electoral districts and focus on government patronage. Shia deputies align with the government, while Women deputies also tend to support the government. Liberals are highly educated and secular elites who have historically supported Arab nationalist movements. Sunni Islamists in Kuwait consist of Muslim Brotherhood supporters and harder-line \"Salafists.\" Kuwaiti youth groups have organized to support \"liberal\" deputies since 2008, participating in street protests during the 2011 Arab uprisings. Disputes between the Al Sabah ruling family and oppositionists in the Assembly have occurred after Amir Jabir's death in 2006. After Amir Jabir's death in 2006, disputes between the Al Sabah ruling family and oppositionists in the Assembly led to repeated suspensions and elections. The power balance between the executive and the Assembly remained unresolved despite multiple attempts. In the June 29, 2006 election, the opposition, supported by youths under the \"Orange\" banner, won 34 out of 50 seats. Women participated for the first time but none were elected. The government later reduced the number of electoral districts to 5. In the May 17, 2008 election, amid demands for government employee pay raises, tensions continued to escalate. In March 2008, the Amir dissolved the Assembly amid demands for pay raises. New elections were set for May 17, 2008, with Sunni Islamists and tribal leaders winning seats. In the May 16, 2009 election, more than 20 new parliamentarians were elected, including 4 women. Two votes of no confidence in the Prime Minister failed in December 2009 and January 2011. The Arab uprisings in early 2011 broadened Kuwait's opposition. In January 2011, opposition deputies forced the Interior Minister to resign for failing to prevent torture of a man in custody. In March 2011, a Shia parliamentarian's request led to a cabinet resignation over Kuwait's support for Bahrain's government. In September 2011, protests over corruption led to the adoption of an anticorruption law. In November 2011, oppositionists stormed the Assembly demanding the Prime Minister's resignation, which eventually happened. Shaykh Jabir al-Mubarak Al Sabah was sworn in as Amir without naming a new cabinet, a constitutional breach. The February 2, 2012 election saw opposition deputies forming a bloc advocating for a fully elected government. They won 32 out of 50 seats, with a 62% turnout. Ahmad al-Sadun became Speaker, and the Prime Minister appointed four oppositionists to the cabinet. In June 2012, the Assembly was suspended for one month by the Amir when they requested to grill the Interior Minister. Article 106 of the constitution allows for the suspension of the Assembly for up to one month, renewable for two months with Assembly approval. In December 2012, new elections were called by the Amir, with changes to the voting system. A boycott by Sunni Islamist factions led to a low turnout of 40%, resulting in a \"progovernment\" Assembly with an increased number of Shia members. In June 2013, another election was triggered by a court decision. The Constitutional Court upheld the Amir's decree for single-candidate voting per district but dissolved the Assembly due to technicalities. New elections were held in July 2013, with eight women running out of 418 candidates. Opposition groups boycotted, resulting in a progovernment Assembly with nine Shias and tribalists. Two women initially won seats, but one was deprived due to a miscount, and the other resigned in 2014. Shaykh Jabir remained Prime Minister, with a cabinet including one Shia and four Salafists. Public demonstrations decreased after 2013, and oppositionists planned to participate in the next Assembly elections. In response to regional challenges, the Amir suspended the National Assembly and called for early elections on November 26, 2016. The elections saw participation from opposition political societies and resulted in a split Assembly. The State Department deemed the elections as \"generally free and fair.\" Following scrutiny of the Prime Minister in 2017, the Amir dissolved the cabinet in October 2017 and appointed a new government in December 2017, with a similar policy outlook. Notably, the Amir's son was appointed as First Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister, and two women were included in the cabinet. The State Department identifies key human rights issues in Kuwait, including allegations of torture, political prisoners, restrictions on freedom of speech, limited rights for stateless Bidoon population, trafficking in persons, criminalization of same-sex activity, and reports of forced labor. Kuwait's government has imprisoned social media critics for \"insulting the Amir\" since 2011. In 2017, Kuwait executed seven prisoners, including a member of the ruling family, for capital offenses, with most being expatriates. Human Rights Watch identified 44 Kuwaiti activists struggling against government repression. Two prominent human rights organizations in Kuwait are the Kuwait Society for Human Rights and the Kuwait Association for the Basic Evaluation of Human Rights. U.S. democracy programs in Kuwait fund various initiatives, including discussions with leaders, civil society training, media support, women's rights promotion, and educational programs. The independent Kuwaiti media promotes women's rights and offers educational opportunities. U.S.-Kuwait meetings mainly focus on security and regional issues. The National Endowment for Democracy supports Kuwaiti groups advocating for civil society, human rights, and women's rights. Women in Kuwait have rights but not equal to men, can participate in elections, drive, own businesses, and work in the oil sector. Kuwait remains a traditional society. Kuwait remains a traditional society with substantial influence from Islamists who limit women's rights. Domestic violence is not specifically prohibited by law, but courts handle cases as assault. Kuwait has been criticized for frequent violence against expatriate domestic workers. The country has made efforts to combat trafficking in persons, moving from a \"Tier Three\" to a \"Tier 2: Watch List\" rating. Female police officers combat sexual harassment in public places. The 2018 report credited Kuwait for implementing a labor law that protects domestic workers, increases penalties for unscrupulous employers, and funds a national strategy to combat trafficking in persons. There have been reports of abuse towards domestic workers, leading to diplomatic issues. In response to a Filipina maid's death, Kuwait expelled the Philippines' ambassador. Kuwait's labor laws protect workers' rights to form unions and strike, with restrictions. Only one trade union per occupation is allowed, led by the Kuwait Trade Union Federation. Foreign workers, except domestic workers, can join unions. Strikes have occurred among customs officers, Kuwait Airways employees, and oil workers. Discrimination persists against non-Gulf Arabs, Asians, and stateless residents. The legal status of around 100,000 stateless persons remains unresolved. The legal status of approximately 100,000 stateless persons in Kuwait, known as \"bidoons,\" has been a longstanding issue. The government has set deadlines to resolve their citizenship claims, but progress has been slow. Some bidoons, particularly children of soldiers killed in the 1990 Iraqi invasion, have been granted citizenship. The government has also been criticized for not always respecting freedom of speech and press freedom, despite ending press censorship in 1992. The Press and Publications Law in Kuwait establishes topics off limits for publication and discussion. Publishers and bloggers need Ministry of Information licenses. Laws against social media criticism of the government have been increasingly used. Kuwait's penal code allows up to five years in jail for criticizing the Amir. A cybercrimes law punishes insulting religious figures and harming Kuwait's relations. Some naturalized Kuwaitis have lost citizenship for government criticism. Kuwait-born citizens cannot have citizenship revoked. Recent State Department reports show little change in Kuwait's religious freedom. Recent State Department reports show little change in Kuwait's respect for religious freedoms. Kuwait's Shia population faces discrimination, with limited access to religious education and places of worship. Non-Muslim religious groups must obtain a license for an official place of worship, but there is no registration requirement. Kuwait allows religious groups to worship without interference, but some face difficulties in obtaining permission to build new facilities. Despite opposition, the government has licensed seven Christian churches to serve the expatriate Christian population. Non-Muslims, including Baha'i, Buddhists, Hindus, and Sikhs, mostly work in Kuwait as noncitizens. The relationship between Kuwait and the United States strengthened during the Iran-Iraq War, leading to the opening of a U.S. consulate in Kuwait in 1951. The U.S. consulate in Kuwait opened in 1951 and became an embassy upon Kuwait's independence in 1961. The U.S.-Kuwait defense relationship deepened after Iraq's invasion in 1990, leading to a Defense Cooperation Agreement in 1991. The agreement includes mutual discussions during crises, joint military exercises, and U.S. training of Kuwaiti forces. Lawrence Robert Silverman is the current U.S. Ambassador to Kuwait. The U.S.-Kuwait Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) includes joint military exercises, U.S. training of Kuwaiti forces, arms sales, prepositioning of military equipment, and access to Kuwaiti facilities. The DCA also includes a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) where U.S. forces in Kuwait are subject to U.S. law. The U.S. commitment to enhance Kuwait's military capabilities was reaffirmed during the second U.S.-Kuwait \"Strategic Dialogue.\" The U.S.-Kuwait military relationship is described as \"very close\" by then-Defense Secretary James Mattis. Meetings between the Amir of Kuwait and President Trump have focused on regional issues, including the U.S. concept of an anti-Iran Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA). The U.S. military has strengthened Kuwait's military capabilities through training and mentorship, with 13,500 U.S. troops stationed in Kuwait since the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq in 2011. Kuwait's military has regained its pre-Iraq invasion strength of 17,000, with U.S. forces in Kuwait including Army combat troops capable of projecting ground force power in the region. Defense Secretary Mattis highlighted Kuwait's hosting of U.S. forces, ranking behind only Germany, Japan, and South Korea in terms of U.S. troop presence. The United States has military forces stationed in Kuwait, including Army combat troops capable of projecting ground force power in the region. U.S. forces in Kuwait participate in annual military exercises with forces from Kuwait and other GCC states. Kuwait hosts the headquarters for U.S.-led operations against the Islamic State and provides military facilities for coalition partners. U.S. forces are stationed at various facilities in Kuwait, including Camp Arifjan, Camp Buehring, Ali al-Salem Air Base, Shaykh Ahmad al-Jabir Air Base, and Camp Patriot. The United States maintains 2,200 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles in Kuwait, and U.S. armor prepositioned in Kuwait was used for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The United States designated Kuwait as a \"major non-NATO ally\" in 2004 due to their cooperation. During the Iran-Iraq War, Iran targeted Kuwait's oil facilities to pressure them to stop supporting Iraq. During Operation Earnest Will in 1987-1988, the US protected Kuwaiti and international shipping from Iranian attacks. Kuwait was invaded by Iraq on August 2, 1990, leading to Operation Desert Storm in 1991 to expel Iraqi forces. Kuwait's leaders were restored after the US-led coalition forces expelled the Iraqi forces. After the 1991 war, Kuwait paid $16.059 billion to offset U.S. war costs and hosted U.S. military personnel to contain Iraq. Kuwait also contributed financially to Operation Southern Watch and UNIKOM, and supported U.S. forces during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Kuwait supported the U.S. in the Iraq War by hosting troops and providing financial assistance. They allowed the use of air bases, airports, and sea ports, contributing $266 million for combat support. Kuwait also hosted about 25,000 U.S. troops from 2003-2011 and facilitated troop deployments to Iraq. Additionally, Kuwait provided $210 million per year in support for U.S. military personnel rotating through Kuwait for Iraq operations. Kuwait has supported military coordination among GCC countries and cooperation with non-Arab U.S. partners. In 2011, discussions began with NATO to open a center in Kuwait City as part of the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative. The NATO-ICI Regional Center opened in 2017, focusing on maritime security, cybersecurity, and protection against weapons of mass destruction. Kuwait also opened a diplomatic office at NATO in 2018. In late November 2017, Kuwait signed a defense cooperation agreement with France. Ground forces exercises were held in Kuwait with France in November 2018. Kuwait has enlisted military help from Pakistan and set up an office there to recruit trainers. U.S. arms sales to Kuwait aim to promote interoperability with U.S. forces. Kuwait, a wealthy state, can fund its own purchases and has received some U.S. assistance for officer training. U.S. defense sales to the GCC were authorized in 2013 to enhance relations. The U.S. authorized defense sales to Kuwait to enhance its military capability and interoperability with U.S. forces. Kuwait purchased Patriot antimissile systems in 1992 and 2012, intercepting Iraqi missiles during the 2003 Iraq War. The U.S. has offered the more advanced THAAD missile defense system to Kuwait, but it has not been decided yet. The United States redeployed Patriot systems from Kuwait, Bahrain, and Jordan to areas relevant to strategic competition with Russia and China. Kuwait's fleet includes 40 F/A-18 combat aircraft purchased in 1992, with plans to buy more in 2016. Kuwait also bought 218 M1A2 tanks in 1993. Kuwait has purchased various military equipment from the United States, including 218 M1A2 tanks in 1993 valued at $1.9 billion, 16 AH-64 Apache helicopters in 2002 valued at $940 million, and tactical missiles in 2008 and 2012 with total values of $178 million and $105 million respectively. Additionally, there are plans for Kuwait to purchase new tank hulls, armament, and engines for its tank force at an estimated value of $29 million. Kuwait has a history of purchasing military equipment from the United States, including tanks, Apache helicopters, and tactical missiles. Recently, Kuwait notified Congress of a potential sale of Hellfire missiles with an estimated value of $30.4 million. The country has also allocated funds for various arms purchases, including F-18s, Apache helicopters, French naval vessels, and Russian-made missile systems. Additionally, Kuwait has received funding under the International Military Education and Training program for officer training in the United States. Kuwait receives funding for officer training in the United States through the IMET program, with amounts of $19,000 in FY2007, $14,000 in FY2008, and $10,000 in FY2010. Approximately 200 Kuwaiti military personnel study various disciplines at U.S. military institutions, costing Kuwait around $10 million annually. Kuwait emphasizes GCC unity in dealing with regional threats, with Amir Sabah playing a key role in mediating intra-GCC rifts. In 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attempted shuttle diplomacy to resolve the Gulf crisis between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. President Trump facilitated brief talks between Qatar's Amir and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince. Kuwait's efforts to mediate the rift were highlighted during the GCC summit in December 2017. The rift was discussed during Amir Sabah's meeting with President Trump in 2018, but no resolution was reached. The U.S.-GCC summit planned for early 2018 was repeatedly postponed due to the ongoing rift. Kuwait's reluctance to take a hard-line stance on Qatar led to the abbreviation of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud's visit to Kuwait in 2018. Kuwait played a mediating role in the Gulf crisis, hosting military meetings to resolve rifts between GCC countries. Despite not joining Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and UAE in withdrawing ambassadors from Qatar in 2014, Kuwait has supported GCC actions, such as sending naval units to assist Bahrain in 2011. Kuwait has also built political ties with Iraq to move past historical conflicts and prevent Shia-led violence. Kuwait has strengthened ties with Iraq to move past historical conflicts and prevent Shia-led violence. This includes appointing ambassadors, high-level visits, and providing humanitarian assistance. Kuwait also hosted a conference on Iraq's stability in 2008 and has supported GCC actions, such as sending naval units to assist Bahrain in 2011. In 2018, Kuwait hosted a conference that raised $30 billion for Iraq's reconstruction post-Islamic State challenge. Residual issues from the Iraqi invasion persist, with efforts to resolve them ongoing. In December 2010, the U.N. Security Council passed resolutions to end Saddam-era sanctions against Iraq. The U.N. resolutions in 1956, 1957, and 1958 ended Saddam-era sanctions against Iraq but maintained the \"Chapter 7\" mandate. 5% of Iraq's oil revenues were used for reparations payments to compensate victims of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The U.N. Compensation Commission paid out $52 billion by 2015, with $4.6 billion remaining to be paid for damage to Kuwaiti oilfields. In 2014, the UNCC extended Iraq's deadline for final payments to early 2016 due to budget shortfalls. Kuwait extended the deadline to 2018, and Iraq paid $90 million in April 2018. They agreed to pay 1.5% of Iraq's oil revenues in 2019, and 3% in 2020 and 2021. Iraq's new government requested a suspension of payments in November 2018. U.N. resolutions aim to resolve the fate of missing Kuwaitis and Kuwaiti National Archives. In 2013, the U.N. abolished the High-Level Coordinator mandate for missing property and persons between Iraq and Kuwait, transferring supervision to UNAMI. The search process has found remains of 236 Kuwaitis, with 369 cases still unresolved. Kuwait has donated to the Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights to help find the fate of 369 missing Kuwaitis. Despite efforts, no human remains have been found since 2004. Iraq returned some Kuwaiti property, but no progress has been made in locating the Kuwaiti National Archives. In November 2018, Iraqi President Barham Salih brought Kuwaiti archival material to Kuwait. Disputes over the Iraq-Kuwait border have been mostly resolved, with Iraq agreeing to pay for border markings. In 2017, Iraq granted Kuwait greater access to the shared Khor Abdullah waterway. Kuwait has unresolved disputes with Iraq regarding debt and stolen planes, but they have made agreements for compensation and joint ventures. Kuwait remains cautious of pro-Iranian Shia militia groups in Iraq, stemming from past incidents attributed to Iran-inspired Iraqi groups. In May 1985, attacks in Kuwait were linked to the Iran-inspired Iraqi Da'wa Party, a Shia group. The party, once led by two Iraqi prime ministers, disbanded its militia wing. Kuwait has engaged with Iran as a counterbalance to Iraq, hosting anti-Saddam Iraqi Shia oppositionists post-1991. High-level visits between Kuwait and Iran have taken place, including meetings with Iran's Supreme Leader and President. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani visited Kuwait and Oman in February 2017, with Kuwait playing a role as a mediator in establishing an Iran-GCC dialogue. Kuwait supports U.S. efforts to limit Iran's influence in the region, enforces U.S. sanctions against Iran, and participates in military exercises in the Persian Gulf. Kuwait has not pursued importing Iranian natural gas and downgraded relations with Iran in 2016. Kuwait has been cautious in its relations with Iran, refusing to break ties but also rebuffing Iranian entreaties. The country supports U.S. efforts to counter Iran's influence in the region and has expressed willingness to join the U.S.-backed Middle East Strategic Alliance. Kuwait has been vigilant in countering Iran's influence, arresting individuals involved in plots against Kuwaiti energy facilities. It joined the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS in 2014 and hosts the operational headquarters for Operation Inherent Resolve. Kuwait, as part of Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), hosts the U.S. Army component ARCENT in Kuwait. They allow Canada and Italy to base aircraft for OIR. Kuwait did not conduct air operations against ISIS in Syria and did not deploy ground forces. They focus on aiding civilian victims in Syria and Iraq. Kuwait has provided over $9 billion in humanitarian support for civilian victims of conflicts in Syria and Iraq, making it the second-largest donor after the United States. Kuwait has donated to nine U.N. agencies and the ICRC, and also contributed to Jordan to help with the financial burdens of hosting refugees. This aid is crucial as refugees have become an economic burden in Jordan, leading to protests over unemployment and rising prices. After an Arab Spring-related uprising in Yemen in 2011, Kuwait and its GCC allies facilitated a transition that led to the departure of President Ali Abdullah Saleh in January 2012. The elected government of Abdu Rabbu Mansour Al Hadi fled in January 2015 under pressure from Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Kuwait joined the Saudi-led combat against the Houthis in 2015 to restore the Hadi government. Kuwait has hosted U.N.-mediated talks between the warring sides in Yemen since 2016, but efforts to negotiate a resolution have been unsuccessful. In February 2017, Rouhani visited Kuwait in an attempt to engage diplomatically with Iran, the key backer of the Houthis. Kuwait's efforts to resolve the Yemen conflict through cooperation with the GCC were unsuccessful. Kuwait has aligned with other GCC states on regional issues post-2011 unrest, supporting Egypt's struggles similar to Saudi Arabia and UAE, but at odds with Qatar. Kuwait has provided significant financial aid to Egypt since the ousting of Morsi in 2013. Kuwait has a history of political activities, including deporting Egyptians for pro-Muslim Brotherhood activities. Despite this, Kuwait disagrees with the Saudi-led ostracism of Qatar. Kuwait expelled Palestinian workers after the 1990 Iraqi invasion and has supported Hamas over the PLO. In June 2018, Kuwait proposed a U.N. resolution to protect pro-Hamas demonstrators at the Gaza border. Kuwait remains critical of Israel but aligns with other GCC and Arab states on regional issues. Kuwait has supported U.N. recognition of a Palestinian State and opposed the Trump Administration's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Kuwait's Foreign Ministers attended a U.S.-sponsored Middle East conference in Warsaw in February 2019, where regional topics, particularly Iran, were discussed. Kuwait denied following Oman, UAE, and Saudi Arabia in building ties with Israel. In 2014, Kuwait's foreign minister visited the Old City of Jerusalem, asserting it represents occupied Palestine. In 2018, Kuwait used its U.N. Security Council seat to block U.S.-backed efforts. In 2018, Kuwait blocked U.S.-backed efforts at the U.N. Security Council and pledged $50 million to UNRWA. Kuwait attended multilateral talks with Israel on various issues during the 1990s and helped end Arab boycotts of Israel in 1994. However, Kuwait did not establish trade offices with Israel and maintained the Arab League boycott. Kuwait maintained the Arab League boycott on trade with Israel and had a significant number of North Korean laborers. In 2017, Kuwait curtailed its relationship with North Korea following increased U.S. pressure. After a meeting between the Amir and President Trump, Kuwait expelled North Korea's ambassador and diplomats, ceased renewing visas for North Korean workers, and halted trade ties and direct flights with North Korea. Kuwait has prevented most terrorist attacks by groups like the Islamic State since 2015, with help from U.S. agencies. In 2016, security forces thwarted planned attacks, including one on a Shia mosque. An Islamic State-inspired individual attempted an attack on U.S. military personnel in 2016, but no one was harmed. In 2017, a suspected Islamic State leader was extradited from the Philippines to Kuwait for planning attacks. U.S. agencies assist Kuwait with counterterrorism efforts, border control, and export controls. Kuwait has strong security cooperation with the U.S., including participation in counterterrorism programs and information sharing agreements. They have implemented biometric fingerprinting at entry points and ratified a GCC security pact. Additionally, Kuwait seeks the return of prisoners from Guantanamo. Kuwait sought the return of two prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, who were accused of belonging to Al Qaeda. They were reintegrated into society after their return, and Kuwait was praised for its efforts to counter terrorism financing. Kuwait also announced terrorist designations in collaboration with the GCC and the U.S., and implemented a same-day policy for imposing U.N. terrorist financing sanctions. Kuwait is a member of MENAFATF. Kuwait has taken steps to address criticism on anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing, including enacting laws to prosecute terrorism-related crimes and freeze terrorist assets. The country joined counter terrorism-financing conventions and criminalized online fundraising for terrorist purposes. As of mid-2014, Kuwait is no longer deemed deficient in AML/CFT by the FATF. Kuwait has joined counter terrorism-financing conventions, including the Egmont Group and the U.S.-GCC \"Terrorist Financing Targeting Center.\" However, Kuwait's record on this issue has been mixed, with Kuwaiti donors raising funds for armed factions like the Al Nusra Front in Syria. The appointment of a leading Kuwaiti donor to Al Nusra as Minister of Justice and Minister of Islamic Endowments was criticized, leading to sanctions imposed on two Kuwaitis under Executive Order 13224 for supporting international terrorism. The United States has sanctioned Kuwaitis for supporting international terrorism, including providing financial support to Al Nusra Front and Al Qaeda. The Treasury Department froze assets of a Kuwait-based charity with alleged links to Al Qaeda. The U.S. has provided small amounts of aid to help Kuwait counter terrorism financing. Kuwait's programs to encourage moderation in Islam are praised in State Department terrorism reports. Kuwait supports local counter-messaging campaigns to promote moderation in Islam. The government has established a new Directorate for Cybersecurity to combat violent extremism. Despite economic challenges due to political infighting and low oil prices, Kuwait is working to reduce its economic vulnerability. Kuwait has been running budget deficits of about $15 billion per year since 2015, deferring infrastructure investment and reducing public sector salaries and subsidies. Despite economic challenges, Kuwait still maintains a large sovereign wealth fund of nearly $600 billion managed by the Kuwait Investment Authority. Additionally, Kuwait agreed to slightly reduce its crude oil production as part of an OPEC agreement in November 2016. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia discussed increasing oil production by 500,000 barrels per day by reactivating two closed fields in their joint \"neutral zone.\" Privatization plans for state-owned industries have been ongoing, with the cancellation of Kuwait Airways privatization due to workforce opposition. Political disputes have hindered progress on potential growth drivers. Disputes delayed major growth drivers in Kuwait, including opening northern oil fields for foreign investment. A new $8 billion oil refinery is under construction, while the \"Silk City\" project aims to attract foreign investment with a $90 billion investment plan involving infrastructure development. The $10 billion \"Kuwait-China Silk Road Fund\" will finance the expansion of Kuwait's infrastructure, including a new airport, railways, and port facilities. Kuwait's \"New Kuwait 2035\" economic strategy includes the development of the northern region. Kuwait abandoned plans for nuclear power reactors in 2012 but continues nuclear research through the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) with oversight from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The United States provided $38,000 in FY2015 to support this effort. In FY2015 and FY2016, the United States provided funding to train Kuwaiti personnel in nuclear security issues. Kuwait is a founding member of the World Trade Organization and signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with the U.S. in 2004. During the U.S.-Kuwait Strategic Dialogue in 2017, a memorandum of understanding was finalized to encourage investments in both countries. Kuwait also donated $500 million worth of oil to U.S. states affected by Hurricane Katrina. The U.S. imports about 100,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Kuwait. The United States imports about 100,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Kuwait. Total U.S. exports to Kuwait were about $5.1 billion in 2017, with imports from Kuwait totaling about $3 billion. In 2018, U.S. exports to Kuwait decreased by half compared to the previous year, while imports from Kuwait fell by 25%. U.S. exports to Kuwait mainly include automobiles, industrial equipment, and foodstuffs. Kuwait receives minimal U.S. foreign assistance due to its high per capita GDP. In FY2016, Kuwait received $3,000 for counternarcotics programs as part of targeted assistance to achieve objectives benefiting U.S. national security, including civil society promotion, nuclear security training, and counterterrorism financing."
