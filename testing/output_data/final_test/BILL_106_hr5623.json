    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Chemical Security and Right to Know Act of 2000\". Congress finds that the possibility of terrorist and criminal attacks on chemical plants poses a serious threat to human health, safety, and the environment. Limiting public access to chemical accident information does not address the underlying problem of plant vulnerability. Employing safer technologies in chemical manufacturing can prevent criminal attacks and offer industry cost savings. Safer technologies in chemical manufacturing can reduce the need for security measures and insurance, while chemical plants must ensure safe facilities to prevent criminal activity. If deemed necessary, the Attorney General will establish a program to enforce protective actions. SEC. 3. PREVENTION OF CRIMINAL RELEASES. Section 112(r)(1) of the Clean Air Act is amended to include a general duty for owners and operators of stationary sources to identify and prevent hazards from accidental or criminal releases. The Clean Air Act is amended to include definitions for \"criminal release\" and \"design and maintenance of safe facilities\" in relation to regulated substance releases from stationary sources. The term `design and maintenance of safe facilities' refers to practices at stationary sources to prevent or reduce vulnerability to regulated substance releases through safer technology and containment measures. The term 'design and maintenance of safe facilities' involves making stationary sources impregnable to intruders, improving site security and employee training, and reducing potential consequences through buffer zones. The term 'use of inherently safer technology' refers to utilizing technology, products, raw materials, or practices that reduce or eliminate the possibility of toxic releases compared to current methods. The term 'use of inherently safer technology' involves reducing or eliminating the release of toxic, volatile, corrosive, or flammable substances to protect public health and the environment through various methods like input substitution, process redesign, and technology modification. The Clean Air Act is amended to include the prevention of criminal releases through technology modification to use less hazardous substances, moderate pressures, reduce human error, improve inventory control, and eliminate storage of hazardous chemicals. The Clean Air Act is amended to prevent criminal releases by assessing if stationary sources have taken adequate actions to detect, prevent, and minimize the consequences of such releases that may harm public health, safety, and the environment. If actions are deemed inadequate, the Attorney General will work with the Administrator to implement chemical security regulations. The Clean Air Act is amended to require owners or operators of stationary sources to take actions to detect, prevent, and minimize criminal releases that may harm public health, safety, and the environment. The Administrator will ensure public access to risk management plans submitted by owners or operators. The Clean Air Act amendment requires owners or operators of stationary sources to submit risk management plans to the Administrator for public access in electronic and paper form. Public can also make copies of the plans. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Attorney General may create necessary regulations for the Act and its amendments. Appropriations are authorized for them to carry out the Act, with funds remaining available until expended."
