    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Electronic Medication and Safety Protection (E-MEDS) Act of 2007\". Key findings are outlined in the Act. Patient safety is a top priority for patients, providers, insurers, businesses, and government entities. Adverse drug events, defined as any injury due to medication, are a significant concern. Over 1.5 million preventable adverse drug events occur annually in the United States, with at least 530,000 happening among the Medicare population, costing the Federal Government $887 million. Electronic prescription drug programs, or e-prescribing, allow for the electronic transmission of prescription information from the healthcare provider to the pharmacy. Electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) provides formulary and coverage information before writing a prescription, helping to inform patients and prescribers of lower cost options. It can eliminate medical errors, injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from illegible prescriptions and bad drug interactions, while also reducing patient medication non-adherence. The Institute of Medicine recommends all physicians implement e-prescribing technology by 2010. Incentives for e-prescribing under Medicare. Incentive Payments for Physician Use of E-Prescribing under Medicare include a one-time bonus for start-up costs based on claims submitted by physicians for evaluation and management services. The Secretary will make a payment to physicians who use the electronic prescription drug program, in addition to other payments, based on specified amounts. The payment amount varies depending on the year, with $2,000 for 2008 or 2009, and $1,500 for 2010 or 2011. Only one payment can be made per physician under this subsection. The Secretary will provide a bonus to physicians who use e-prescribing based on specified amounts depending on the year, with $2,000 for 2008 or 2009, and $1,500 for 2010 or 2011, or $1,000 for 2012 onwards. If a physician meets certain e-prescribing criteria, they will receive additional payment under this program. The physician will receive an additional payment equal to 1 percent of allowed charges for evaluation and management services under section 1848. This payment will not apply to prescriptions for controlled substances that cannot be prescribed electronically. The additional payment will be considered in applying subsections (m) and (u) for physician shortage bonuses. Auditing provisions for claims under this subsection will follow the same rules as claims for payment and false claims enforcement. The term 'electronic prescription drug program' is defined under section 1860D-4(e). A new requirement for e-prescribing is added to Section 1848(a) of the Act, effective from January 1, 2011, for evaluation and management services. The fee schedule amount under this section is reduced by 10 percent for prescriptions not all made under the electronic prescription drug program. The Secretary may waive this reduction in cases of hardship or unforeseen circumstances until January 1, 2012 or January 1, 2013. SEC. 4. REPORTS ON E-PRESCRIBING. The Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must submit a report to Congress on the progress of implementing e-prescribing under the Medicare electronic prescription drug program. The report will include information on the percentage of Medicare physicians using e-prescribing, estimated savings, and progress in reducing medical errors. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress on the impact of the e-prescribing program on physicians, including factors influencing adoption and the Act's impact on physicians in different practice settings."
