    "content": "The \"Graton Rancheria Restoration Act\" is cited in Section 1. The findings in Section 2 mention the recommendation for legislative restoration of the Graton Rancheria and the decision to restrict gaming by the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria Tribal Council. Section 3 provides definitions. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Tribe\" refers to the Indians of the Graton Rancheria of California. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"Interim Tribal Council\" is the governing body of the Tribe specified in section 7. The term \"member\" is an individual who meets the membership criteria under section 6(b). The term \"State\" is the State of California. The term \"reservation\" refers to lands held in trust by the Secretary for the benefit of the Tribe. The term \"service area\" includes the counties of Marin and Sonoma in California. Federal recognition is restored to the Tribe, along with all rights and privileges under Federal treaties, orders, and statutes. Laws and regulations applicable to Indians will also apply to the Tribe and its members. The Tribe and its members are eligible for Federal services and benefits, regardless of reservation status. This eligibility does not affect other payments or benefits received by the tribe or individual. The Act does not impact any payments or benefits received by the tribe or individual under federal programs. It also does not affect hunting, fishing, trapping, gathering, or water rights of the Tribe and its members. Additionally, the Act does not alter any property rights, contractual obligations, or tax obligations, except as specifically provided. SEC. 5. TRANSFER OF LAND TO BE HELD IN TRUST. Upon application, the Secretary will accept real property in Marin or Sonoma County, California, into trust for the Tribe if there are no legal claims. This includes Indian-owned fee land held by distributees or dependent members listed in a 1959 distribution plan. The property taken into trust will become part of the reservation. Real property taken into trust for the Tribe under this Act will be part of the Tribe's reservation and exempt from taxation. Gaming on such lands will be restricted. SEC. 6. MEMBERSHIP ROLLS. The Secretary must compile a membership roll of the Tribe within 1 year of the Act's enactment, in consultation with the Tribe. Criteria for membership include being living, not a member of another federally recognized tribe, and meeting specific requirements related to historical distribution lists. The Graton Indian Rancheria distribution list requirements for membership include being identified as an Indian from specific California vicinities or being a lineal descendant of a listed individual. After adopting a tribal constitution, membership in the Tribe is governed by the constitution. Proof of Graton Indian ancestry is required for membership. The Secretary will accept any available evidence establishing Graton Indian ancestry, including information from specific census records and distribution lists approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Proof of Graton Indian ancestry is required for membership in the Tribe. The Interim Tribal Council will govern the Tribe until a final constitution is ratified. The council's initial members will be those elected under the 1997 tribal constitution. Vacancies will be filled by individuals meeting membership criteria. After compiling the tribal membership roll, the Secretary will conduct a secret ballot election, upon request of the Interim Council, to ratify the final constitution. Absentee voting is allowed regardless of voter residence. Within 120 days of ratification, the Secretary will hold another secret ballot election to elect tribal officials in accordance with the tribal constitution. The tribal constitution must be followed in procedures, unless conflicting with it."
