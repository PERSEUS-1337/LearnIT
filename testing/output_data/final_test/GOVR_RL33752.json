    "content": "In 1981, a dispute over lumber imports from Canada led to investigations by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission. Despite initial findings of injury to the U.S. industry, subsidies were deemed minimal in 1983, ending the investigation. In 1986, a new petition for investigation was filed, citing a favorable court ruling on similar imports from Mexico. Pressure from Senators also influenced the need for action on lumber imports for a U.S.-Canada free trade agreement. In 1986, the U.S. and Canada signed a memorandum imposing a 15% tax on Canadian lumber exports to the U.S., which was to be replaced by higher stumpage fees within five years. This agreement led to the withdrawal of a petition by the U.S. industry. In 1991, Canada announced its withdrawal from the agreement due to increased stumpage fees, prompting a Section 301 investigation by the U.S. Trade Representative. In March 1992, the DOC issued a preliminary subsidy finding of 14.48% ad valorem, leading to a 6.51% ad valorem duty. The ITC determined that the U.S. industry was materially injured by Canadian lumber imports. The Canadian government appealed to binational review panels under the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. The binational panel remanded the DOC finding twice, eventually leading to the DOC finding no subsidies in January 1994. In January 1994, the DOC complied with the order to revoke the CVD. The USTR requested an ECC to review binational panel decisions, but it was dismissed for not meeting FTA standards. In October, the USTR announced the termination of the Section 301 action. In September 1994, two events led Canada to negotiate restrictions on lumber exports to the US: a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the binational panel review process and the submission of implementing legislation for the GATT Uruguay Round agreements. In February 1996, an agreement-in-principle was reached between the US and Canada regarding a fee on Canadian lumber exports exceeding a specified quota. The final US-Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement (1996 SLA) was signed in May, retroactive to April 1, 1996, and effective until March 31, 2001. The agreement aimed to address the rise in Canadian lumber imports to the US market, which U.S. producers argued was due to unfair subsidies given to Canadian producers, causing injury to U.S. producers. These issues of subsidies and injury are key factors in determining the need for a Countervailing Duty (CVD) under U.S. trade law. The U.S. lumber industry argues that Canadian stumpage fees are a subsidy, as provinces own 90% of timberlands and set fees administratively. This contrasts with the U.S., where only 42% of forests are publicly owned. In Canada, 90% of timberlands are owned by provinces, and stumpage fees are set administratively. This differs from the U.S. where 42% of forests are publicly owned, and timber is sold at market prices through competitive auctions. Comparisons of U.S. and Canadian stumpage fees are disputed due to various factors. The DOC identified export restrictions by British Columbia as a subsidy to softwood lumber manufacturers by lowering log prices in the domestic market. Export restrictions on public timber in the US result in higher prices for export logs compared to domestic sales, which is generally considered a subsidy. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade prohibits export restrictions. The DOC affirmed its position on countervailability of export restraints in implementing the Uruguay Round Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Canada challenged this in a WTO dispute, arguing it violated the SCM Agreement. Proving injury to U.S. lumber producers is essential for a CVD, with Canadian lumber's market share growing substantially over the past 50 years. Since 1995, Canada's market share in lumber has fluctuated between 33% and 35%, leading U.S. producers to claim that Canadian imports hinder domestic growth. However, U.S. homebuilders argue for unrestricted imports, citing the necessity of Canadian lumber to meet domestic demand. Despite consistent findings of injury by the ITC, proving harm to U.S. producers is challenging. After the 1996 SLA expired in 2001, the U.S. Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions, leading to investigations and a preliminary determination of threat of material injury by the ITC. The DOC published preliminary determinations of Canadian subsidies at 19.31% ad valorem and dumping margins ranging from 5.94% to 19.24%. Negotiations to forestall final determinations collapsed, leading to final determinations of Canadian subsidies at 18.79% ad valorem and dumping margins ranging from 2.18% to 12.44%. The DOC issued final determinations of Canadian subsidies at 18.79% ad valorem and dumping margins ranging from 2.18% to 12.44%. The ITC determined a threat of material injury, leading to duties averaging 27% going into effect. Canada challenged these determinations in binational panels and dispute settlement proceedings. Canadian producers filed claims against the U.S. government under NAFTA, alleging breach of obligations. Canada also challenged agency actions in softwood investigations and other related statutes. Despite winning NAFTA and WTO cases, the U.S. continued to collect duties on softwood entries. The United States maintained duties on softwood entries using a WTO-related ITC affirmative threat of injury determination, despite Canada's earlier negative threat determination in its NAFTA case. The domestic and international litigation affecting the AD and CV duty orders was not fully resolved when the April 2006 framework agreement was reached. NAFTA Chapter 19 allows for binational panel review of final agency determinations in antidumping or countervailing duty investigations. NAFTA Chapter 19 allows for binational panel review of final agency determinations in antidumping or countervailing duty investigations. The binational panel determines if the challenged determination complies with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country involved and can direct the issuing agency to issue a new determination if necessary. Appeals can be made to an Extraordinary Challenge Committee for review on limited issues. NAFTA-implementing legislation requires action consistent with panel decisions within a specified time frame. Multiple agency remands may occur if the panel is not satisfied with the initial determination. The WTO dispute settlement process involves consultations, panel and possibly Appellate Body review, and implementation. Unlike NAFTA Chapter 19, a WTO panel reviews a measure for consistency with international obligations. The DSU allows disputing parties to agree on a compliance deadline or have it determined by arbitration. The WTO cannot compel compliance with a decision. The WTO dispute settlement process allows for compliance deadlines to be determined by arbitration. If a defending Member does not implement a decision within the established period, the complaining Member can seek compensation or request authorization for retaliatory measures, such as tariff increases. A compliance panel can be established to ensure adherence to the WTO decision. The executive branch has discretion in responding to adverse WTO decisions under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. The URAA allows the DOC and ITC to issue new determinations in response to adverse WTO decisions, but the USTR decides whether to request the agency to do so. Section 129 determinations apply prospectively to entries after the USTR directs the Commerce Department. Unlike government-to-government processes, NAFTA Chapter 11 allows private investors to file arbitral claims. Private investors can file arbitral claims under NAFTA Chapter 11 against a government for breaching investment obligations. If successful, monetary damages may be awarded, but punitive damages or removal of offending measures are not allowed. Canada challenged DOC and ITC determinations, resulting in a reduced subsidy rate and a negative threat of injury determination. Canada challenged DOC and ITC determinations, leading to a reduced subsidy rate and a negative threat of injury determination. The U.S. industry group filed a constitutional challenge to the binational panel process in the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(g)(4), was part of the legal proceedings between the United States and Canada that were terminated as part of the SLA litigation settlement. A motion to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction was filed on October 12, 2006, and the case was dismissed on December 12, 2006. In July 2003, a binational panel affirmed the DOC final dumping determination partially and remanded part of it back to the DOC for revised dumping margins. The DOC submitted a new determination in October 2003, resulting in lower AD duty rates for most producers. The panel's decision in March 2004 found DOC determinations inconsistent with U.S. law, leading to new determinations for three Canadian exporters. The DOC lowered dumping margins for two producers and found a negligible margin for the third. The panel remanded the dumping determination in June 2005, instructing the DOC to revoke the AD order for West Fraser and recalculate dumping margins without zeroing. The NAFTA panel criticized the DOC for using zeroing in price comparisons, leading to higher dumping margins in a 2005 redetermination. The DOC calculated dumping rates for producers, with West Fraser receiving a 3.21% rate. The panel was asked to reconsider its approval of the zeroing methodology. The 2006 SLA aims to dismiss the action between Canada and the United States. The binational panel upheld the DOC's treatment of provincial stumpage programs as subsidies. The DOC revised its determination in January 2004, reducing the duty rate from 18.79% to 13.23%. The recalculated rate was based on a new methodology using Canadian log prices and import values, adjusting for harvesting costs. Certain Maritime-origin lumber and old lumber were excluded from the scope of the CVD order. In June 2004, the binational panel granted a remand to the DOC to reconsider limited implementation issues and recalculate various aspects. The panel remanded the case to the DOC multiple times to recalculate benchmark prices and profit adjustments for Canadian provinces. The DOC issued its fifth remand determination, lowering the subsidy rate to 0.80%, which was deemed de minimis. The United States requested an ECC review but suspended it due to a settlement agreement with Canada on the softwood lumber dispute. The United States and Canada agreed to suspend proceedings regarding the softwood lumber dispute. A suit filed by Canadian industry groups seeking USTR appointment to the ECC was dismissed. The 2006 SLA amendment stated that the US would withdraw its ECC request. In 2003, a binational panel affirmed parts of the ITC threat determination but remanded it for further examination. The ITC issued multiple threat determinations regarding dumped and subsidized imports. A binational panel directed the ITC to issue a \"no threat\" determination, which was affirmed. The United States requested an ECC review, which affirmed the panel decisions. Canada argued for the removal of AD and CVD orders, while the United States disagreed. The United States claimed that a threat determination by the ITC superseded a previous NAFTA-related decision, allowing duties to continue. Canada successfully challenged this in the USCIT, leading to duty deposits on softwood lumber entries to be returned. The USCIT and WTO cases in the 2006 SLA settlement involved the review of U.S. administrative actions in softwood lumber AD and CVD investigations. Issues included DOC's administrative review of the CVD order, implementation of the ITC determination on threat of injury, and the DOC dumping determination in response to a WTO ruling. The binational panel on the ITC injury determination was stayed pending the outcome of the NAFTA ECC proceeding. The 2006 SLA settlement involved the review of U.S. administrative actions in softwood lumber AD and CVD investigations. Canadian producers filed panel requests in 2006 concerning DOC's reviews of the AD and CVD orders, as well as a ruling on certain products falling within the scope of the CVD order. These cases were pending at the time of the April 2006 framework agreement. Three Canadian lumber companies filed arbitral claims against the United States under NAFTA, alleging breach of investment obligations. The arbitral panel ruled it lacked jurisdiction over AD and CVD claims but could adjudicate claims related to the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act. The 2006 SLA, as amended, states that Canfor Corporation will withdraw its claim against the United States in the Chapter 11 arbitration. Canada also initiated WTO cases related to softwood antidumping and CVD investigations, with mixed outcomes. Canada prevailed in complaints involving U.S. subsidy, dumping, and injury determinations. DOC and ITC issued new determinations resulting in similar subsidy rates, higher dumping margins, and reconfirmation of findings. The 2006 SLA settled six WTO cases related to softwood antidumping and CVD investigations. The DOC recognized countervailability of export restrictions in its 1992 determination of Canadian softwood lumber subsidies. The Uruguay Round Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures defines a subsidy as a financial contribution by a government that confers a benefit. The U.S. law and the SCM Agreement recognize that indirect subsidies can be provided through export restraint schemes, as confirmed by the DOC in the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements Act. In the 1992 softwood case, U.S. trade law would permit reaching the same conclusion. Canada challenged this in May 2000. In May 2000, Canada challenged the U.S. interpretation of the SCM Agreement regarding export restraints as subsidies in the WTO. The WTO panel agreed with Canada that export restraints do not constitute a financial contribution from the government as defined in the agreement. The WTO panel found that export restraints do not qualify as a financial contribution from the government as defined in the agreement. Canada filed a complaint against the U.S. challenging a specific provision in January 2001, which was adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body in August 2001. The U.S. system suspends liquidation of softwood lumber entries if AD and CVD duties are applied. Canada is concerned that duties deposited before a challenge may not be returned. Canada alleged that the United States violated WTO obligations by not refunding estimated antidumping or countervailing duties deposited on softwood lumber entries. The United States argued that the statute only applies to imports entered after the implementation date, not prior unliquidated entries. The United States argued that the statute does not mandate any specific treatment of prior unliquidated entries and has other legal options for dealing with them, such as establishing new dumping or subsidy margins using WTO-consistent methodology. The panel report concluded that Canada failed to prove the statute required WTO-inconsistent action or prevented the US from acting in accordance with its WTO obligations. The WTO panel upheld the U.S. determination that provincial stumpage programs constitute a financial contribution to the industry but faulted the methodology used by the DOC in determining whether a benefit was conferred on Canadian lumber producers. The WTO panel upheld the U.S. determination on provincial stumpage programs as a financial contribution to the industry. The panel also found issues with the DOC's critical circumstances determination but did not find critical circumstances in the final CVD determination. U.S. laws on expedited and administrative reviews in CVD cases were upheld, with no appeals made. The panel report was adopted on November 1, 2002. Canada challenged the United States at the WTO regarding preliminary duties and cash deposits related to lumber imports. The US argued it was not required to take action as the duties were no longer in effect and deposits had been refunded. Canada also disputed the initiation of an antidumping investigation and preliminary determination by the US. In a dispute at the WTO, Canada challenged the US over subsidy determinations in the softwood lumber CVD investigation. The panel upheld that provincial stumpage programs were financial contributions but disagreed on the use of cross-border price comparisons. The WTO Appellate Body upheld the panel's stumpage determination but reversed the decision on cross-border comparisons. The WTO Appellate Body upheld the panel's finding that the United States had violated WTO obligations by determining the existence and amount of benefits in the softwood lumber CVD investigation. The analysis was incomplete due to insufficient information on the proper benchmark used by the US. The issue of downstream users was also addressed, focusing on whether subsidies were passed through arm's length transactions in the production chain. The Appellate Body upheld the panel's finding that the United States violated WTO obligations by failing to conduct a pass-through analysis on arm's-length sales of logs by tenured harvesters/sawmills. The DOC issued a revised CVD determination with a reduced subsidy rate, and a compliance deadline was set for December 17, 2004. The compliance panel reviewed the new DOC determination, reducing the net subsidy rate to 16.37% ad valorem. Canada sought retaliatory measures against the U.S., leading to arbitration being suspended until completion of the compliance panel process. The panel found that the DOC had not conducted necessary pass-through analysis on non-arm's-length sales of logs, impacting calculations in the Section 129 determination and the first administrative review. The DOC's calculations lacked evidence of pass-through benefits from subsidized log inputs to processed products. The AB upheld the panel's jurisdiction over the first administrative review, confirming legal conclusions on U.S. actions. DSB adopted the panel and AB reports in December 2005. Canada and the U.S. did not request arbitration on Canada's retaliation request. Canada initiated consultations with the U.S. in September 2002 regarding the DOC's final determination. In September 2002, Canada requested consultations with the United States regarding the DOC's final softwood dumping determination, alleging violations of WTO rules. The panel report in April 2004 mostly rejected Canada's claims but faulted the U.S. for using zeroing in calculating dumping margins. The Appellate Body upheld the panel's findings on zeroing and reversed a decision appealed by Canada. The panel reversed its finding that the US did not infringe Antidumping Agreement provisions in calculating financial expenses for softwood lumber for one company (Abitibi). The Appellate Body did not make findings on whether the US acted consistently with the provisions. The DOC issued a preliminary Section 129 determination in January 2005, finding increased dumping margins by comparing prices on a transaction-to-transaction basis. The DOC maintained that the WTO ruling only applied to zeroing in the methodology used in the case, not other price comparison methods. A final Section 129 determination in May 2005 showed higher dumping margins, ranging from 3.93% to 16.35%. Canada requested a WTO compliance panel review and sought authorization to suspend concessions totaling C$400 million for 2005. The compliance panel found that the use of zeroing in transaction-to-transaction comparisons was consistent with U.S. obligations under the Antidumping Agreement. The Appellate Body reversed the panel's decision, stating that zeroing is not permitted in this methodology. Canada requested consultations with the United States regarding the ITC's threat of injury determination, alleging violations of trade agreements. A panel report faulted the ITC's determination and recommended the U.S. to comply with WTO agreements. The United States disagreed with the WTO panel's findings on compliance with antidumping agreements. The ITC affirmed its threat of injury determination, leading to amendments in AD and CVD orders by the DOC. In February 2005, Canada requested a compliance panel to impose C$4.25 billion in sanctions due to the United States' failure to revoke CVD and antidumping orders. The compliance panel found the ITC determination consistent with U.S. obligations in November 2005. In 2005, a compliance panel found the ITC determination consistent with U.S. obligations under the Antidumping and SCM Agreements. The WTO Appellate Body later reversed the compliance panel's ruling, stating it had not examined the ITC determination with enough scrutiny. The United States maintained its position regarding the determination. The United States maintained its position on the Section 129 determination, supporting the imposition of duties on Canadian softwood lumber despite challenges in court. In July 2006, the court ruled that the USTR did not have the authority to issue orders to the DOC, leading to the May 2002 antidumping and countervailing duty orders being unsupported. The court also questioned whether cash deposits on softwood entries should be returned to importers. The court ruled in October 2006 that all unliquidated softwood entries subject to suspension would be liquidated according to a NAFTA panel's decision, resulting in refunds of antidumping and countervailing duty deposits. The antidumping and countervailing duty orders were revoked on October 12, 2006, following the effective date of the SLA. Canada requested consultations with the United States on April 14, 2004, regarding the CVD case, alleging violations of the SCM Agreement and GATT. Legal proceedings ensued, with Canada opposing the United States' motion to vacate a decision made on October 13. Canada was concerned that duty deposits might not be returned to importers if Canadian firms were excluded from an AD or CVD order. The duties could potentially be distributed to U.S. lumber firms under the Byrd Amendment, despite its repeal in 2006. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled in favor of Canada and Canadian producers in a suit regarding the distribution of duties collected before October 1, 2007. The CDSOA does not apply to Canadian imports, as ruled in a suit filed by Canada and Canadian producers. The WTO panel and Appellate Body found the statute violated WTO agreements, allowing Canada to retaliate by imposing a 15% surcharge. Canada imposed a 15% surcharge on U.S. imports like live swine, cigarettes, oysters, and specialty fish in retaliation for the CDSOA payments. Concerns were raised that the U.S. was not fully complying with WTO decisions due to these payments. The CDSOA amendment does not apply to Canadian imports, as ruled by the court in 2006. The U.S. CBP was prohibited from making CDSOA payments from duties on Canadian products. Canada did not renew its tariff surcharge, and a tentative agreement was reached to terminate AD and CVD duties. The Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA 2006) was signed on July 1, 2006, with finalized amendments on September 12, 2006. It entered into force on October 12, 2006, revoking CVD and AD orders on Canadian lumber in exchange for terminating NAFTA, WTO, and domestic court cases. Export charges are imposed by Canada when lumber prices fall below US$355 per MBF. The Softwood Lumber Agreement of 2006 introduced export charges that vary based on the composite price of lumber. These charges can be reduced with volume restraints from Canadian producing regions. Additional provisions include a third country trigger for charge refunds and a surge mechanism for excessive exports. High-value products are subject to a fixed export charge of C$500. The Softwood Lumber Agreement of 2006 introduced export charges based on lumber prices, with a fixed charge of C$500 for high-value products. Provisions include volume restraints, a third country trigger for charge refunds, and a surge mechanism for excessive exports. The agreement is for seven years, renewable for two more years, with termination possible after 18 months if export measures are not applied. The Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA) includes commitments to refrain from trade remedy investigations on softwood lumber while in effect. U.S. producers in the SLA agreed not to file AD or CVD petitions involving Canadian softwood lumber if the agreement expires or is terminated. $5 billion in deposits under the CVD and AD orders are being returned to importers, with $4 billion or 80% of deposits plus interest going back to importers. The remaining $1 billion from the Softwood Lumber Agreement is being split between various initiatives, including assistance for timber-reliant communities, low-income housing, disaster relief, and sustainable forest management practices. The three meritorious initiatives include the United States Endowment for Forestry and Communities, Inc. ($200 million), Habitat for Humanity International ($100 million), and the American Forest Foundation ($150 million). The Softwood Lumber Dispute involves trade protection, subsidies, and competitive timber systems between Canada and the United States. Various reports and comments have been submitted regarding the economic impact and trade barriers in the softwood lumber industry. The Canadian forest industry is at a crossroads, facing challenges such as saw timber depletion and the need for sustainable forest management practices. In 2000, a Global Forest Watch Canada Report and CRS Report RL30826 analyzed the Softwood Lumber Dispute between Canada and the United States, focusing on dumping margins and subsidy rates."
