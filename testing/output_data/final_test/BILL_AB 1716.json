    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts Chapter 10.5, known as the Lower American River Conservancy Program Act, to protect the Lower American River, a vital natural environment with recreational and educational opportunities for millions of visitors annually. The American River Parkway, known as \"the jewel\" of the Sacramento region, was established in 1959 by the County of Sacramento with support from state and other entities. The County continues to update, maintain, and manage the Parkway in accordance with the American River Parkway Plan. The American River Parkway, established in 1959, provides various benefits to the state and Sacramento region, including flood control, water supply, habitat for various species like salmon and steelhead, migratory waterfowl, and sensitive species. The Legislature recognized its importance by enacting the Urban American River Parkway Preservation Act. The Lower American River Parkway is designated as part of the California Wild and Scenic Rivers System and the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The American River Parkway Plan serves as the management plan for the lower American River, providing guidance for state and local agencies in carrying out their responsibilities under the California Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The state aims to collaborate with local agencies to expand, enhance, and restore the natural, recreational, cultural, and educational resources in and around the American River Parkway. The Lower American River Conservancy Program will partner with local agencies and nonprofit organizations to fund projects for the restoration, enhancement, and protection of the American River Parkway's resources. It aims to continue the state's funding role in protecting the natural resources while the County of Sacramento manages the lands and public uses of the Parkway. The Lower American River Conservancy Program defines key terms such as \"Adjacent to,\" \"Advisory committee,\" \"American River Parkway,\" \"American River Parkway Plan,\" \"Board,\" and \"Fund\" for the purpose of funding projects for the restoration and protection of the Parkway's resources. The Lower American River Conservancy Program defines key terms such as \"Fund,\" \"Nonprofit organization,\" and \"Parkway Manager\" for the purpose of managing and funding conservation projects. The Lower American River Conservancy Program is created to receive and expend funds for the American River Parkway. The board will prioritize developing a natural resource management plan and improving access to the parkway. An advisory committee will be established with members from the Board of Supervisors of the County of Sacramento. The Lower American River Conservancy Program advisory committee will include representatives from the City of Sacramento, City of Rancho Cordova, state agencies, and three public members with expertise in the American River Parkway. The advisory committee for the Lower American River Conservancy Program includes members who serve without compensation and must hold qualifying office. Meetings must occur at least twice a year in Sacramento County and follow the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act. The board must coordinate with relevant entities in implementing the program. Prior to approving funding for any project, consult with the County of Sacramento to ensure consistency with the American River Parkway Plan. Draft a staff report including all findings and comments from the County and Parkway Manager. Administer allocated funds and provide assistance to develop a natural resource management plan for the American River Parkway. Grants may be given to local agencies and nonprofit organizations for projects approved by the County. The board may provide grants for acquisition, restoration, and maintenance of fish and wildlife habitat in the American River Parkway. Funding for acquisition projects must ensure title is held by the County of Sacramento or another local public entity. Grants can also be used for improving public access and recreational facilities in the area. The American River Parkway board provides grants for various projects including enhancing interpretive and educational facilities, controlling invasive species, improving lands within and adjacent to the parkway, and implementing stormwater capture projects to improve water quality and habitat for fish and wildlife. The American River Parkway board solicits grants and donations for the program but is restricted from funding projects without landowner consent, managing land owned by others without agreements, levying taxes, or taking actions inconsistent with specific acts. They do not own or acquire land. The Lower American River Conservancy Program Fund is created in the State Treasury for capital improvements, land acquisition, and program support. Preference is given to projects involving the California Conservation Corps or Community Conservation Corps. The board can accept money, grants, goods, or services from public or private entities. Received funds are deposited in the Donation Account and are continuously appropriated for the chapter's purposes. Goods and services received can be used for the same purposes. This chapter does not override the authority of entities responsible for managing lands within the American River Parkway. The Sacramento County Board of Supervisors, acting as the Parkway Manager, interprets and implements the American River Parkway Plan. The board can also accept money, grants, goods, or services from public or private entities."
