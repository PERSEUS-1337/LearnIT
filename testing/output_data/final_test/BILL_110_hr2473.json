    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Voluntary Public Access and Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program Act of 2007\". In 2001, 82 million individuals in the US aged 16 and older participated in wildlife-related activities, including hunting and observing wildlife. They spent over $56 billion on hunting and fishing equipment and supplies, and more than $28 billion on food, lodging, and transportation. Stamps and excise taxes on goods used by hunters and fishers have generated billions for wildlife conservation. Public demand for hunting and fishing opportunities is limited by land resources. Recreational hunting and fishing provide funding for wildlife habitat development, conservation, and ecosystem preservation. Limited public access on private land is a common issue. Limited public access on private land has frustrated hunters, fishers, and naturalists, impacting the relationship between landowners and the public. Some states and tribal governments have successful walk-in programs for public hunting on private land, but demand remains unmet. Traditional agricultural methods offer limited income opportunities, and proposals for agricultural trade reform aim to support producers' income with minimal impact on production and prices. SEC. 3. VOLUNTARY PUBLIC ACCESS AND HABITAT INCENTIVE PROGRAM. This section adds a new program to the Food Security Act of 1985 aimed at providing voluntary public access and habitat incentives. The Secretary will establish a voluntary public access program for States and tribal governments to apply for grants to encourage private landowners to allow public access for wildlife-dependent recreation, including hunting and fishing. States and tribal governments must describe the benefits and methods for achieving public access to private farm and ranch land. The Secretary will prioritize States and tribal governments that propose programs to maximize participation, ensure appropriate wildlife habitat, strengthen habitat improvement efforts, and utilize additional resources in granting grants for public access to private land for wildlife-dependent recreation. The Secretary will prioritize States and tribal governments for public access programs on private land for wildlife-dependent recreation. Funding for the program will be up to $20,000,000 annually from 2008 to 2012, with regulations to be promulgated as needed. SEC. 4. Prevention of excess base acres by amending a section of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002."
