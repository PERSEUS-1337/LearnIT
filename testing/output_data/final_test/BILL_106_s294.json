    "content": "Water diversion protection and fisheries enhancement program. The Secretary, in cooperation with other relevant agencies, shall develop a program for fish protection in water diversions by local governmental entities in certain states. The goals are to reduce fish entering water supply systems and decrease fish mortality without hindering water withdrawal for irrigation. Non-Federal participation is voluntary. The program for fish protection in water diversions by local governmental entities is voluntary. The program includes inventory, evaluation, identification, prioritization, and implementation of fish protection measures. Evaluation and prioritization are based on effectiveness and critical areas for improvement. Prioritization for fish protection in water diversions is based on the objectives of the Endangered Species Act, cost effectiveness, diversion size, funding availability, and biological benefits. The Secretary must consult with other agencies and utilize existing data and studies in developing the program. Recommended fish protection measures must meet certain requirements. The recommended fish screen or passage device must meet federal and state requirements and be agreed upon by all involved entities. Non-Federal interests are responsible for 35% of the implementation cost for recommended measures under the program. Non-Federal interests are required to provide land, easements, rights-of-way, and cover costs for projects under the program. They are also responsible for operating, maintaining, and repairing the projects. Construction can only begin after the non-Federal interest agrees to pay the costs. The non-Federal interest must agree to pay the costs of construction and 100% of operation, maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, or replacement costs for the project. The owner of the land where the project is located must grant access to Federal personnel for necessary activities. Authorization of Appropriations: $25,000,000 is authorized annually for projects under this section. Non-Federal interests must provide reports on costs and actions taken for project requirements. Federal use or regulation of surrounding private land is not allowed."
