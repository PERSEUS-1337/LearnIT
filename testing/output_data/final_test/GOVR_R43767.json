Congress recognizes the importance of the domestic industrial base in supplying materials for defense and responding to disasters or terrorism. The President can prioritize government contracts, offer incentives in the domestic market, and enhance production of critical materials and technologies. The DPA has been reauthorized over 50 times since 1950, with the majority of authorities set to expire in 2025. The Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA) grants the President broad authorities to ensure domestic industry meets national defense needs. The majority of DPA authorities will expire on September 30, 2025, unless reauthorized. This report examines the history of the DPA, focusing on its creation and recent legislative reauthorization. It also discusses active authorities of the DPA and relevant delegations of the President's DPA authorities. The report provides an overview of issues Congress may consider in overseeing the executive branch's use of the DPA. The report provides an overview of issues Congress may consider in its oversight of executive branch use of DPA authorities and the implementation of recent reauthorization changes. It also discusses congressional considerations for expanding, restricting, or modifying DPA authorities through new legislation. Supplementary tables in the report offer additional resources related to DPA subjects and a chronology of laws reauthorizing DPA authorities. The Defense Production Act (DPA) was reauthorized through P.L. 113-172 to improve the Defense Production Act Committee. The DPA was initially enacted in 1950 during the Cold War and granted the President broad authority to control national economic policy for defense production. The Defense Production Act (DPA) was enacted in 1950 during the Cold War to enhance defense production capacity. It allowed the government to requisition materials, ration consumer goods, fix wage and price ceilings, and regulate credit. Some provisions expired in 1953. The DPA currently falls under the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The Defense Production Act (DPA) was enacted in 1950 during the Cold War to enhance defense production capacity. It allowed the government to requisition materials, ration consumer goods, fix wage and price ceilings, and regulate credit. Some provisions expired in 1953. The DPA currently falls under the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Prior to 1975, House rules did not permit simultaneous referral of bills to two or more committees. Precedents in both chambers did not allow divided or joint referrals, regardless of bill content. Instead, bills were assigned to committees based on the preponderance of their subject matter. The Defense Production Act was assigned in 1950 to the House and Senate Committees on Banking and Currency. Although some parts of the act are no longer in force, these committees have retained jurisdiction. The Defense Production Act (DPA) was enacted in 1950 during the Cold War to enhance defense production capacity. It allowed the government to requisition materials, ration consumer goods, fix wage and price ceilings, and regulate credit. The Joint Committee on Defense Production, composed of selected members from the standing Committees on Banking and Currency of the Senate and House, was intended to review DPA programs and advise on legislation. The committee ceased to exist in 1977 due to lack of funding. The DPA has been amended and reauthorized multiple times, with certain titles expiring in 1953. The Defense Production Act (DPA) was enacted in 1950 during the Cold War to enhance defense production capacity. It has been reauthorized 53 times, with short-term extensions. The most recent reauthorization was in the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, extending the termination date by six years. The Defense Production Act (DPA) was extended by six years to September 30, 2025, granting the President various authorities for national defense preparedness programs. The DPA has been reauthorized 53 times since its enactment in 1950 during the Cold War. The Defense Production Act (DPA) grants the President authorities to shape national defense preparedness programs and maintain the domestic industrial base. DPA authorities are tied to the definition of national defense, which includes military and energy production, critical infrastructure assistance to foreign nations, homeland security, stockpiling, space activities, and emergency preparedness. The Defense Production Act (DPA) grants the President authorities to shape national defense preparedness programs and maintain the domestic industrial base. Further reference can be made to Title VI of the Stafford Act for a definition of \"emergency preparedness\" activities, which includes activities to prepare for hazards, deal with emergency conditions, and restore vital utilities and facilities. The use of DPA authorities extends beyond military preparedness to enhance domestic preparedness, response, and recovery from hazards and national emergencies. The Defense Production Act (DPA) grants the President authorities to shape national defense preparedness programs and maintain the domestic industrial base. Congress has expanded the definition of national defense over the years, including critical infrastructure assistance to foreign nations and homeland security. The DPA statute includes a \"Findings\" and \"Statement of Policy\" section, providing guidance to the executive branch on using DPA authorities for national security. Congress emphasized the importance of augmenting domestic energy supplies through renewable sources and efficient technologies to ensure national defense and energy security. Additionally, Congress recommended the geographic dispersal of industrial facilities to safeguard productive capacity in the event of an attack on the United States. The President is authorized to prioritize contracts for national defense and allocate materials, services, and facilities as necessary to promote national defense within vulnerable geographic areas. This authority ensures timely availability of critical resources in the private market. The Defense Production Act (DPA) allows the government to prioritize contracts for national defense and ensure the availability of critical materials, equipment, and services from the private market. Contractors are required to accept prioritized orders, with limited exemptions, and are not liable for actions taken to comply with DPA regulations. The government can also prioritize the performance of contracts between private parties. The Defense Production Act (DPA) allows the government to prioritize contracts for national defense and ensure critical materials' availability. The President can allocate materials, services, and facilities to fulfill priority contracts. There are restrictions, such as not using it for employment contracts or wage/price controls without Congress authorization. Private persons are not obligated to assist. Title I of the Defense Production Act (DPA) authorizes the President to allocate contracts for domestic energy supplies, with restrictions on rationing gasoline without Congress approval. Energy is designated as a strategic material, enabling policy actions under Title III authorities. The Defense Production Act authorizes the President to allocate contracts for domestic energy supplies under Title I authorities. The Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy, and Secretary of Homeland Security make determinations related to national defense programs under E.O. 13603. The Secretary of Homeland Security, along with other Cabinet Secretaries, can use the President's priorities and allocation authority for national defense programs. E.O. 13603 delegates this authority to different Secretaries based on their expertise in various resource sectors. This allows agencies to use each other's authorities, such as DHS using the Department of Agriculture's priorities authority for food resources. The President delegated priorities and allocations authority to six federal agencies, including the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Transportation. These agencies are required by law to issue regulations for using the authority to promote national defense. The Department of Defense has not yet issued its regulation for water resources, but has indicated that it is in preliminary draft. The Department of Commerce's DPAS rule is the most frequently used by the executive branch. It served as a model for the creation of the FPAS, which establishes two priority levels for orders - \"DO\" and \"DX.\" A \"DO\" order takes precedence over nonrated orders, but a \"DX\" order supersedes a \"DO\" order if needed. The DOD regularly prioritizes contracts using this system. The DOD routinely uses the \"DX\" rating to prioritize contracts under the Department of Commerce's authority. This authority has been utilized for various projects such as the Integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles. Other departments and agencies use this authority less frequently for purposes like terrorism prevention and disaster preparedness. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have prioritized contracts for terrorism prevention and disaster preparedness. The Federal Emergency Management Agency used the authority extensively during the 2017 disaster season. U.S. allies have also used the authority for defense-related procurement issues. The Department of Energy used specific Title I authorities to ensure emergency supplies of natural gas to California utilities. The allocation authority, not used since the Cold War, supports the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program managed by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Civilian aircraft are allocated for potential use by the DOD during national defense crises. Civilian carriers participating in the program receive preference in carrying commercial cargo for the DOD. Title III authorities aim to ensure the nation has essential materials and goods during emergencies. The President can use Title III authorities to provide financial incentives for developing, maintaining, and expanding domestic production capacity for critical components, technology items, materials, and industrial resources essential for national security. This includes ensuring availability of these resources from reliable sources during peacetime, mobilization, and national emergencies. Loan guarantees and direct loans can be issued to address industrial resource shortfalls. Loan guarantees and direct loans can be issued to private businesses to address current or projected shortfalls of industrial resources, critical technology items, or essential materials needed for national defense purposes. These authorities can be used to provide financial assistance to defense contractors responsible for critical services essential to national defense when credit is not available in the private market. The Defense Production Act allows for loan guarantees and direct loans to be issued to private businesses for national defense purposes. Restrictions are in place, requiring specific budget authority and conditions to be met before these loan mechanisms can be used. The loans must be the most cost-effective and practical option, with determination requirements in place to ensure repayment by the recipient. The Defense Production Act allows for loan guarantees and direct loans to be issued to private businesses for national defense purposes, with the President having the authority to ensure repayment by the recipient. Section 303 grants the President various powers to support domestic industrial base capabilities essential to national defense, including purchasing industrial resources, making subsidy payments for domestically produced materials, and expanding productive capacity. These authorities incentivize domestic private industry to produce critical goods for national defense. Section 303 authorities under the Defense Production Act incentivize domestic industry to produce critical goods necessary for national defense by allowing for direct purchases or subsidies. The President must determine a \"domestic industrial base shortfall\" before utilizing these authorities to ensure a sufficient supply of essential goods. The President must authorize projects exceeding $50 million to address industrial base shortfalls, with notification to Congress and committees. Waivers can be granted in emergencies. E.O. 13603 outlines procurement for national defense agencies. In E.O. 13603, agencies engaged in procurement for national defense are delegated authorities under Title III of the DPA. This includes the ability to make determinations not explicitly mentioned in the statute. However, the authority to encourage exploration, development, and mining of materials is delegated only to the Secretaries of Defense and the Interior. The DPA establishes the Defense Production Act Fund to carry out its provisions and collect proceeds from DPA activities. The DPA Fund, established under Title III of the Defense Production Act, allows for the resale of DPA-procured commodities or products. Appropriations to the DPA Fund have been made through various agencies' funding bills, with recent contributions mainly coming from DOD appropriations acts. Additionally, transfers from other appropriations, such as the Department of Energy, have also been made to the DPA Fund in the past. The DPA Fund, funded through transfers from DOD and other agencies, has an average project size of $25.13 million since 2000. The Fund Manager, designated by the President, is responsible for financial accounting but not decision-making. Loan authorities provided in the Defense Production Act have not been utilized by the federal government. The federal government has not used loan authorities provided in the Defense Production Act for over 30 years. Current projects are initiated under Section 303 of Title III of the DPA, with the DOD managing 22 projects in FY2017. Examples include projects for biofuel production and radar/electronic warfare support. Title VII of the Defense Production Act (DPA) outlines provisions for giving special preference to small businesses in contracts issued under DPA authorities. Section 701 emphasizes the importance of supporting small businesses, especially those in areas of high unemployment or economic decline. The DPA statute includes definitions for national defense and homeland security, with provisions for obtaining information from private industries under Section 705 to utilize DPA authorities effectively. The DPA grants the Secretary of Commerce authority to obtain necessary information for enforcement. This includes industrial base assessments to monitor manufacturing capabilities. Regulations ensure the authority is used appropriately. The DPA grants the Secretary of Commerce authority to obtain necessary information for enforcement, including industrial base assessments. The regulation issued by DOC allows for voluntary agreements between private industry interests under Title VII of the DPA, with approval from the President or presidential delegate. These agreements are made to help provide for national defense in response to a direct threat determined by the President. Parties can enter into voluntary agreements under the DPA to cooperate in various activities, such as weapons manufacture and infrastructure repair following disasters. The authority to establish these agreements is delegated to federal department heads, allowing for collaboration across multiple agencies. The Secretary of Homeland Security tracks the use of voluntary agreements that can be used by federal departments and agencies. FEMA issued regulations in 1981 under the DPA, which are still in effect. The Maritime Administration manages the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement and Voluntary Tanker Agreement in partnership with the U.S. Transportation Command of DOD. The National Defense Executive Reserve (NDER) is a volunteer body of industry executives established under Title VII of the DPA. It consists of individuals with expertise from various sectors who can be trained for executive positions in the federal government during emergencies to improve war mobilization and productivity. The NDER is a volunteer body of industry executives established under Title VII of the DPA to improve war mobilization and productivity. No active NDER units currently exist, but they can be established by the head of a governmental department or agency. Units can only be activated in emergencies declared by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Appropriations for the DPA are authorized by Section 711 of Title VII, with a specific authorization of $133 million per fiscal year starting in FY2015. The Defense Production Act (DPA) Fund receives annual appropriations, with an average of $109.1 million between FY2010 and FY2019. The highest appropriation was $223.5 million in FY2013, and the lowest was $34.3 million in FY2011. Monies in the fund are available until expended, and appropriations can carry over if not spent. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) oversees national security implications of foreign investment. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has the authority to review foreign investment transactions that threaten national security. Initially created through Executive Orders, CFIUS was codified in 1988 with the \"Exon-Florio\" amendment to the Defense Production Act (DPA). This amendment allowed the President to investigate the impact of corporate mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers on national security. In 2007, Congress passed the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-49) to create CFIUS in statute. The CFIUS review process is voluntary for investors, with potential 3-step review process: a 30-day national security review, a 45-day national security investigation, and a 15-day presidential determination. The President can suspend or prohibit foreign investments if credible evidence suggests a threat to national security. Title VII of the DPA includes a \"sunset\" clause for most authorities, except for four sections exempt from termination. These sections provide prohibitions on wage or price controls, mandatory compliance for chemical or biological warfare production, limited immunity for complying with DPA regulations. P.L. 115-232 extended the termination date of certain sections of the DPA to September 30, 2025, ensuring that contracts or projects created under DPA authorities prior to this date can still be executed even if the DPA is not reauthorized. The Defense Production Act Committee (DPAC) was established to advise the President on the effective use of the DPA authorities. Membership includes heads of federal agencies with DPA authorities and the Chairperson of the Council of Economic Advisors. DPAC now focuses on priorities and allocations under Title I of the DPA. The DPAC, chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security, coordinates DPA authorities. It appoints a federal employee for coordination, reports annually on Title I priorities, and is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The DPAC report, chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security, includes updated Title I-related rules, contingency planning descriptions, and recommendations for legislative actions. It is submitted annually to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House Committee on Financial Services. A new report is required by March 31, 2015, and every year thereafter. The Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations govern defense trade, including industrial compensation like co-production and technology transfer. The Secretary of Commerce must report annually on offsets' impact on defense preparedness, competitiveness, and trade. Congress may consider adding more reporting requirements on the use of authorities in the Defense Production Act. Congress may consider expanding reporting requirements on the use of authorities in the Defense Production Act, including formal notification of Congress prior to or after specific circumstances, such as the use of priorities and allocations authority on contracts above a certain dollar amount. This could involve semi-annual updates on authority use and explanations of controversial determinations made by the President, potentially extending reporting to the entire Congress or other interested committees. Congress may consider reviewing agencies' compliance with rulemaking requirements under the Defense Production Act, including updating outdated voluntary agreement authority and issuing rules for the use of Title I authorities. There is a need to potentially expand regulatory requirements for other authorities in the DPA, such as establishing standards and procedures for the use of Title III authorities. These regulations could formalize the executive branch's policies and procedures for using DPA authorities. The Defense Production Act regulations serve to allow private citizens and industry to comment on and understand the impact of DPA authorities. The President has delegated authorities to various agency officials, including the Defense Production Act Committee (DPAC) members from different government departments. Homeland Security, Interior, Transportation, Treasury, and State, Attorney General, Administrators of NASA and General Services, Chair of Council of Economic Advisers, Directors of CIA and National Intelligence. Congress may consider reestablishing a select committee for oversight of agencies using DPA authorities. Alternatively, oversight responsibilities could be broadened to all relevant standing committees for better coordination.Enhancing inter-committee communication is also recommended. Congress may consider joint referral of proposed DPA-related legislation to appropriate oversight committees for better coordination. The DPA could be amended at any time to extend, restrict, or clarify the President's powers. New authorities could be added to address novel threats to national defense. Congress may amend the \"Declaration of Policy\" in the Defense Production Act to address specific concerns related to emerging technologies for national defense. This could include expanding or restricting the President's authorities granted by the DPA. The DPA's Declaration of Policy serves as a guide for the use of these authorities, but changes to it may not fully impact the President's powers without amending other provisions of the DPA. Congress may amend the definitions of key terms in the Defense Production Act to shape the scope and use of authorities, such as the definition of national defense. This could include removing or adding specific areas like space, counter-narcotics, cybersecurity, or organized crime. Congress could also consider limiting certain DPA authorities to specific agencies by amending the President's delegation of powers. Congress could amend the Defense Production Act to assign specific authorities to individual Cabinet Secretaries, expand the use of the legislative clause \"on a nondelegable basis,\" and adjust appropriations to the DPA Fund to manage the scope of Title III projects initiated by the President. This would not affect the President's ability to exercise authorities under other titles of the DPA. Congress may consider drafting legislation to change the nature of the Defense Production Act Fund or authorize its use beyond specific titles. This could include reintroducing a provision for certain appropriation amounts over time for Title III projects or other DPA authorities. Congress could also provide more specific direction on fund usage, restrictions, or reporting requirements related to the DPA in appropriations for other accounts, like the Disaster Relief Fund managed by FEMA."
