The Act \"Iran Financial System Access Limitation Act of 2016\" prohibits transactions with Iran and blocks property of foreign financial institutions. Congress finds that a nuclear capable Iran poses a direct threat, sanctions have been effective, Iran violated UN resolutions, and sanctions were imposed for its pursuit of nuclear weapons. President Obama has paid Iran $1.7 billion and given them access to global assets and US dollars, evading Congress, despite Iran's violations of UN resolutions and pursuit of nuclear weapons. President Obama allows Iran to control the interpretation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Iranian banks are restricted from clearing U.S. dollars through New York and holding correspondent account relationships with U.S. financial institutions. Granting access to the U.S. dollar will enhance Iran's global financial system access, facilitate illicit weapons trade transactions, and reduce U.S. leverage. The United States Government aims to decrease Iran's leverage by limiting access to U.S. dollars, as Iran supports terrorist organizations. Congress believes action is necessary due to conflicting statements by Secretary of State John Kerry and President Obama regarding Iran's access to U.S. dollars. Congress must act to prevent licenses granting access to US dollars and correct unconstitutional actions by President Obama regarding Iran. The President is prohibited from issuing licenses for offshore dollar clearing transactions with Iranian financial institutions in US dollars. The Act prohibits US persons from transferring funds to or from Iran, or for the benefit of persons in Iran, even if it is necessary for a transaction. The President is authorized to block transactions with foreign financial institutions that clear dollars for Iranian entities. The Act prohibits US persons from transferring funds to or from Iran, or for the benefit of persons in Iran.

Before providing Iran access to the US dollar, the President must submit a report to Congress. This section will end when Iran is no longer a state sponsor of terrorism. The term \"Iranian financial institution\" is defined in the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010."
