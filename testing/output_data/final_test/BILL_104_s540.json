Section 118(c)(7) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include conducting at least 3 demonstration projects for remediation technologies in the Great Lakes System. The Administrator shall prioritize sites for demonstration projects in the Great Lakes System, including the Ashtabula River in Ohio, Buffalo River in New York, Duluth and Superior Harbor in Minnesota, Fox River in Wisconsin, Grand Calumet River in Indiana, and Saginaw Bay in Michigan. Deadlines for project implementation shall be determined by the Administrator. The Administrator must identify 3 sites and technologies for demonstration within 18 months and complete 3 projects within 5 years, including full-scale remediation technology demonstrations. Additional projects may also be undertaken. The Administrator, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary of the Army, may conduct additional pilot and full-scale demonstration projects with promising technologies at sites in the Great Lakes System. The Administrator can cooperate with the Assistant Secretary of the Army to plan, engineer, design, and execute these projects. The Administrator may accept non-Federal contributions for demonstration projects and there is an authorization of appropriations for $3,500,000 for each fiscal year.

The Administrator can provide technical assistance for remediation technologies and practices, with special priority given to Great Lakes areas of concern. Coordination with other demonstrations is required. The Administrator can coordinate technology demonstrations for sediment remediation with other federally assisted projects and share information from these demonstrations. This does not limit the Administrator's authority to carry out sediment remediation activities under other laws. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of appropriations is provided for $1,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1997 to 2001 to carry out sediment remediation activities.
