The Act \"World War I Memorial and Centennial Act of 2009\" acknowledges the significant impact of World War I, with over 4 million Americans serving in defense of liberty, resulting in 375,000 casualties.

General Pershing praised the people of Kansas City for their support during the dedication ceremony.
