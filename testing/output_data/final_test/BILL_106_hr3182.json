    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Craig Municipal Equity Act of 1999\". It includes findings. Congress finds that the Alaska Statehood Act granted 400,000 acres of national forest land to Alaska for development. In 1969, 17,040 acres were selected by the city of Craig but not approved by the Forest Service. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 directed the conveyance of certain lands to Alaska Native village corporations in Southeast Alaska. The Federal Government conveyed 3,960 acres of public land in Craig, Alaska to 2 Native village corporations under ANCSA. These conveyances occupy 93 percent of the city's 4,258 acres. Outside the townsite, no land within 10 miles of Craig has been available for selection under the Alaska Statehood Act. Native corporations were exempted from municipal taxation of underdeveloped land in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Since 1971, the city of Craig in Alaska has grown significantly in population and demographics, making it challenging to qualify for certain government programs. The enactment of ANCSA has prevented Craig from acquiring a State land entitlement, as Federal land conveyances to Native village corporations have occupied a large portion of the city's land. Additionally, a tax recapture provision further discourages development of Native village corporation land. The city of Craig in Alaska faces challenges in qualifying for government programs due to Federal tax laws and land conveyances preventing the city from taxing 93% of its land and receiving promised Federal land grants for expansion and development. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to convey Federal lands to the city of Craig, Alaska, as described in the Copper River Meridian. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to convey Federal lands to the city of Craig, Alaska, as described in the Copper River Meridian. The conveyed lands include multiple sections in T. 71 S., R. 81 E., T. 71 S., R. 82 E., and T. 72 S., R. 82 E., totaling 4532 acres. The Secretary must convey 4532 acres of Federal lands to Craig, Alaska within 90 days. Proceeds from contracts related to the land will be deposited into a separate Treasury account for investment in public debt securities. The Secretary of the Treasury will invest proceeds from land contracts in public debt securities, with earnings deposited in a separate account. The funds will be paid to the city of Craig upon land conveyance. Timber harvested from the conveyed land cannot be transported as unprocessed logs from Alaska. The conveyed land will be considered in lieu of land not transferred under this section. The conveyance of land in Craig, Alaska, under this section is not subject to the Alaska Statehood Act and does not limit the State of Alaska's land entitlement. Maps of the lands to be conveyed will be available for public inspection in various offices. The acreages cited are approximate, and any discrepancies will be addressed. The maps will control in case of any discrepancy between cited acreage and land depicted, without conveying State of Alaska or private land. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as ANCSA, Alaska Statehood Act, and Secretary."
