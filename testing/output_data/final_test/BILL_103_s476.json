JONES CENTER FOR THE SOUNDS AT THE POCOSIN LAKES NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE - SEC. 301. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern North Carolina lacks an educational center for visitors. A partnership is proposed to establish the Center for the Sounds, which would bring economic benefits to Tyrrell County and Columbia. The Federal Government designated the Albemarle-Pamlico estuary system in northeastern North Carolina as an estuary of national concern. Walter B. Jones supported the establishment and expansion of National Wildlife Refuges in eastern North Carolina, including the Alligator River and Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuges. Jones increased refuge acreage by over 303,000 acres in his district. Walter B. Jones supported the reintroduction of endangered red wolves at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge and dedicated his congressional career to fish and wildlife conservation. He should be honored by naming the Center for the Sounds at Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge System after him. The Secretary of the Interior may construct and operate the \"Walter B. Jones Center for the Sounds\" at Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina for public study, environmental education, wildlife awareness, and refuge administration. The Secretary of the Interior will ensure that the design, size, and location of the facility are in line with the area's cultural and natural history. Contributions from non-Federal sources can be accepted to cover operating costs, and a report on progress must be submitted to Congress within 6 months.
