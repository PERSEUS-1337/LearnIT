    "content": "Congress has had a longstanding interest in Mexico's counter-narcotics efforts, requiring annual certification of cooperation with the United States. Mexico was fully certified in following years, but there were calls for modification of the certification procedures after the election of President Vicente Fox. President Bush certified Mexico as fully cooperative in 2001. In 2001, Congress considered measures to suspend drug certification requirements for three years, but no final action was taken. In December 2001, the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act waived the certification requirements for FY2002. In September 2002, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act made permanent the requirement for the President to designate countries that failed to meet international counter-narcotics obligations. Mexico is a key transit country for cocaine, marijuana, heroin, methamphetamine, and synthetic drugs entering the United States, according to the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Mexico has consistently high levels of illicit drug trafficking, with some variations in estimates. Mexico is a key transit country for cocaine and other drugs entering the United States, with estimates showing that around 70 percent of U.S.-bound cocaine shipments pass through Mexican territory. The methodology for estimating drug trafficking is not entirely reliable and can be influenced by changing patterns in trafficking and demand. Mexico serves as a major transit point for cocaine entering the United States, with over half of the cocaine sold in the U.S. passing through Mexico. Additionally, Mexico supplies 30 to 40 percent of the U.S. heroin market, particularly in states west of the Mississippi. Geographical proximity allows Mexico to play a significant role in the U.S. drug market. Mexico is a major source of heroin and marijuana consumed in the United States. Mexican drug traffickers dominate distribution centers and use money laundering methods to transfer illicit currency through global financial systems. Mexico's role in drug trafficking includes smuggling U.S. currency into Mexico and moving funds back into the U.S. through various methods. Drug trafficking from Mexico to the U.S. increased in 2003, particularly in cocaine and heroin supply. State Department estimates from 1998 to 2003 show Mexico's efforts in seizures, arrests, and eradication. Caution is advised when interpreting changes in these areas as indicators of Mexico's seriousness in controlling drug trafficking. The State Department's report on Mexican seizures of drugs in 2003 showed mixed results compared to previous years. While there were negative trends in cocaine, opium, and heroin seizures, there were positive trends in marijuana, methamphetamine, and drug lab seizures. Recent data from the first six months of 2004 also indicated positive results in drug seizures. Mexican drug seizures in 2004 showed positive results, with increased seizures of opium, heroin, and marijuana. Cocaine seizures saw a significant 59% increase from 2002 to 2003, reaching 20.0 metric tons. Despite this increase, it was still a 15% reduction from the average seizures of the previous five years. Mexican drug seizures in 2004 continued to show positive results, with reductions in cocaine, opium, and heroin seizures compared to previous years. Cocaine seizures decreased by 17% in the first half of 2004, while opium seizures dropped by 39% in 2003. Heroin seizures also declined by 41% in 2003. In 2004, Mexican drug seizures saw an increase in heroin seizures by 166% compared to the previous year. Marijuana seizures also rose by 24% in 2003, reaching the highest level in six years. Methamphetamine seizures increased by 43% from 2002 to 2003. In 2003, Mexican drug seizures increased significantly, with the largest level of seizures in six years. Seizures of illicit drug labs also rose, and arrests for drug-related charges increased compared to the previous year. In 2003, Mexican drug seizures increased significantly, with the largest level of seizures in six years. Arrests for drug-related charges were up slightly from 2002 but lower than previous years and the average for 1998-2002. Mexican arrests and total arrests increased by 10% from 2002 to 2003 but were down 20% from the average of the previous five years. Recent data show higher arrest figures for 2003 and a 10% increase in total arrests in the first six months of 2004. The State Department's INSCR reports have praised Mexican authorities for their successes in arresting leaders of major drug trafficking organizations, resulting in tangible successes against top drug groups in the country. Despite mixed results on arrests, new cartels have emerged to replace those that have been damaged. The 2003 report highlights Mexico's intensive counternarcotics efforts, resulting in the arrest of key figures from major drug cartels. Successes against the Arellano Felix Organization include arrests and killings of leaders. The 2003 report highlights Mexico's successful counternarcotics efforts, including the arrest of key figures from major drug cartels. This includes the arrest of Benjamin Arellano Felix, Miguel Herrera Barraza, corrupt police officers, Jorge Arellano Felix, and Efrain Perez. Additionally, accomplishments against the Carrillo Fuentes Organization in Juarez include the arrest of former Governor Mario Villanueva, cell leader Ramon Alcides Magana, and Jesus Albino Quintero Meraz. In May 2002, Jesus Albino Quintero Meraz, a top lieutenant in the Gulf Cartel, was arrested. In April 2003, Arturo Hernandez, a senior hit man responsible for many deaths, was also arrested. In August and September 2003, major CFO traffickers Jose Laija Serron and Rigoberto Glaxiola were arrested. In July 2003, Manuel Medina Campas, a leading lieutenant of the Ismael Zambada Garcia Organization, was arrested. The Osiel Cardenas-Guillen Organization achievements include the arrests of traffickers Gilberto Garcia Mena and Adan Medrano in April 2001 and March 2002. The Mexican government achieved significant successes in combating drug cartels, including the arrests of key figures such as Osiel Cardenas-Guillen, Ramiro Hernandez, and Gilberto Higuera Guerrero. Other accomplishments include the arrest of Miguel Caro Quintero and Armando Valencia-Cornelio. Additionally, a record number of 31 individuals were extradited to the United States in 2003. The Mexican government achieved significant successes in combating drug cartels, including the arrests of key figures. In 2003, a record number of 31 individuals were extradited to the United States. The number of extraditions decreased in the following years, with 19 narcotics defendants extradited in 2004. Denials of U.S. extradition requests also decreased, and Mexican domestic prosecution of fugitives from foreign jurisdictions increased. The Zedillo Administration broke new ground by extraditing Mexican nationals to the United States between 1996 and 2000. In 2001, the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that Mexican citizens can be extradited to the United States for drug charges as long as they are sentenced under Mexican guidelines. Despite this, lower court decisions on issues like life imprisonment and capital punishment continued to hinder the extradition process. In October 2001, the Mexican Supreme Court declared life imprisonment unconstitutional in Mexico, posing a barrier to extradition. The Mexican Supreme Court ruled that life imprisonment is unconstitutional in Mexico, affecting extradition for fugitives facing that penalty in another country. The INCSR report expressed concerns about the impact of this decision on extradition requests. The Mexican Senate approved a protocol to the U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty in 2000, allowing temporary surrender. The U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty, approved by the U.S. Senate, allows temporary surrender of fugitives serving sentences in one country but wanted for crimes in the other. President Fox aims to strengthen democracy, fight corruption, and professionalize the police to address security concerns. President Fox has reorganized law enforcement agencies to combat security and police corruption, including creating a new Federal Investigative Agency. He announced a national crusade against drug trafficking after the escape of \"El Chapo\" Guzman, promising to eliminate corruption in the police and prison systems. A tougher National Drug Control Plan was presented in 2002 to address Mexico's growing drug problem and enhance cooperation among agencies. President Fox has taken steps to combat security and police corruption, including reorganizing law enforcement agencies and creating a new Federal Investigative Agency. He has also implemented measures to address Mexico's growing drug problem, such as a National Drug Control Plan and efforts to punish drug-related corruption. Notable arrests include prison officials facilitating drug lord escapes and law enforcement officials with ties to drug traffickers. President Fox has implemented measures to combat security and police corruption, including arrests of officials with ties to drug traffickers and the disbandment of corrupt anti-drug units. The government has also established a national police registry to prevent reemployment of corrupt officers and expanded screening for sensitive investigations units. The Mexican government has taken measures to combat security and police corruption, including the formation of Sensitive Investigations Units (SIUs). The Attorney General's office dismissed 1,100 employees for irregularities in 2001, while the anti-corruption agency took action against over 4,400 employees in 2002. Efforts to eradicate opium poppy and marijuana cultivation have shown surprising results, with the total area under cultivation expanding considerably. The area under cultivation in Mexico has been expanding due to favorable growing conditions, leading to potential increases in product yield. Data from the U.S. Department of State shows the eradication efforts of illicit drugs in hectares, with effective eradication reflecting U.S. estimates of hectares eradicated. The U.S. estimates the eradication of opium poppy cultivation in 2003 at 20,000 hectares, which is 2% higher than in 2002 and 15% above the average from 1998-2002. Effective eradication in 2003 was 10,100 hectares, 6% lower than in 2000 and 8% below the average from 1998-2002. The potential harvest was 4,800 hectares, resulting in a yield of 101 metric tons of opium gum in 2003. The potential yield of opium gum in 2003 was 101 metric tons, a 74% increase from 2002 and a 45% increase from the average of 1998-2002. The total area of opium poppy eradication in Mexico increased by 39% from 2003 to 2004. The U.S. estimate for marijuana eradication in 2003 was 36,600 hectares, a 19% increase from 2002. Effective eradication of Mexican marijuana in 2003 was 20,800 hectares, a 39% increase from 2002. The potential yield of marijuana in 2003 was 13,500 metric tons, up 71% from 2002. In 2003, the estimated yield of opium poppy gum in Mexico increased by 74%, while the estimated yield of marijuana increased by 71%. The Mexican State of the Nation report showed a 72% increase in the total area of marijuana eradication from 2003 to 2004. U.S.-Mexico counter-narcotics cooperation increased significantly during President Zedillo's administration. The United States and Mexico have established joint anti-drug strategies through various high-level meetings and agreements. President Bush and President Fox pledged to strengthen law enforcement cooperation during their meeting in 2001. President Bush expressed confidence in President Fox's efforts to combat corruption and drug trafficking in Mexico. President Bush certified Mexico's full cooperation with U.S. counter-narcotics efforts in 2001, citing arrests of drug traffickers and eradication results. During President Fox's state visit to the U.S., he called for legislation to suspend drug certification requirements as a gesture of trust. The joint communique following Bush-Fox talks praised growing law enforcement cooperation and expressed support for multilateral evaluation of counter-narcotics efforts. President Bush committed to replacing the annual counter-narcotics certification regime with new measures to enhance international cooperation. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee proposed bills to modify drug certification requirements, but lacking congressional action, the requirements were temporarily modified in late 2001. The Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for FY2002 waived drug certification requirements and required the President to designate countries that failed to meet counter-narcotics obligations. During a meeting in Mexico in March 2002, Presidents Bush and Fox acknowledged Mexico's success in fighting narco-trafficking and emphasized the importance of judicial cooperation between the countries. Cooperation in bilateral counter-narcotics and law enforcement efforts had significantly improved in recent years. In recent years, bilateral cooperation between the United States and Mexico in counter-narcotics efforts has significantly improved. This includes sharing sensitive information, joint operations, military intelligence sharing, and increased military-to-military contacts. Operation Marquis in June 2001 resulted in the arrest of about 80 individuals in both countries. This cooperation led to the enactment of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2003 in September 2002. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2003 made permanent the requirement for the President to designate countries failing to meet counter-narcotics obligations. The cooperation between the United States and Mexico in fighting drug trafficking has reached unprecedented levels, with law enforcement personnel sharing sensitive information for capturing and prosecuting drug traffickers. The cooperation between the United States and Mexico in fighting drug trafficking has reached unprecedented levels, with law enforcement personnel sharing sensitive information for capturing and prosecuting drug traffickers. The reports mentioned the professionalization of law enforcement and military institutions, with the United States playing a prominent role in sponsoring training courses and providing equipment to Mexican authorities. Despite extensive U.S.-sponsored military training for 200 Mexican military members and collaboration on border security measures, Mexico remains a key transit country for drugs entering the United States. The cooperation between the two countries has led to significant strides against drug trafficking organizations, but challenges persist in controlling the flow of drugs into the U.S. Despite efforts to combat drug trafficking, Mexico remains a major source of marijuana and heroin entering the United States. Production of opium poppy gum and marijuana in Mexico has increased significantly in recent years."
