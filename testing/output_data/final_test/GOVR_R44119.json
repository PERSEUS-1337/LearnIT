    "content": "U.S. exports of agricultural products and medicine to Cuba have increased as part of efforts to normalize relations between the two countries, following a significant shift announced by President Obama in 2014. The U.S. has taken steps to normalize relations with Cuba, including removing Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, reestablishing diplomatic relations, and reopening embassies. President Obama visited Cuba in 2016, the first U.S. President to do so in almost 90 years. Despite these actions, most economic restrictions imposed on Cuba in 1962 remain in place. This report examines the current state of agricultural trade between the U.S. and Cuba and identifies obstacles to expanding bilateral trade. The report examines obstacles to expanding agricultural trade between the United States and Cuba, including key provisions in the law and potential consequences for trade. It also discusses bills in Congress aiming to remove restrictions on agricultural trade and lift the embargo on Cuba. Relations between the two countries deteriorated in the 1960s, leading to a shift towards antagonistic lines. In the early 1960s, Cuba shifted towards a repressive communist regime and aligned with the Soviet Union, leading to the expropriation of U.S. assets and the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. President Kennedy imposed a trade embargo in 1962, which was later expanded to include financial transactions and freeze Cuban assets in the U.S. Sanctions were further strengthened over the years, including democracy-building measures with the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992. The U.S. sanctions regime against Cuba, including laws such as the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Solidarity Act of 1996, has been adjusted over the years. Despite some changes, key restrictions on economic relations with Cuba persist, limiting trade in U.S. products. Key restrictions on economic relations with Cuba persist, limiting trade in U.S. products, including prohibitions on credit for exports, access to government programs, tourism, and imports from Cuba. The Obama Administration took steps to ease the embargo, such as allowing certain goods to be exported to Cuba and permitting private export financing in 2016. The U.S. embargo on Cuba limits trade in agricultural products due to restrictions on private export financing. The U.S. Department of Agriculture acknowledges barriers hindering agricultural exports to Cuba, despite the potential for the U.S. to become a major trading partner. Prohibitions under the TSRA, such as credit guarantees and market promotion programs, offset logistical advantages over competitors like Brazil and Europe. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recognizes barriers to expanding agricultural exports to Cuba, including limited foreign exchange and the requirement for imports to go through Cuba's state corporation, Alimport. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act (TSRA) restricts payment and financing terms, hindering U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. Following President Obama's \"normalization\" initiative in late 2014, the U.S. Treasury changed its interpretation of \"cash in advance\" for exports to Cuba. This now requires cash payment before transfer of title, allowing U.S. institutions to open correspondent accounts at Cuban financial institutions. However, the inability to extend credit to Cuban buyers puts U.S. agricultural exporters at a competitive disadvantage. Before the Cuban revolution in 1959, the U.S. and Cuba had a thriving trade in agricultural products. Before the Cuban revolution in 1959, Cuba was a significant market for U.S. agricultural exports and imports. The Castro regime and U.S. sanctions halted agricultural trade in the early 1960s. Trade resumed with the enactment of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allowed certain sales of food, medicines, and medical equipment to Cuba. Despite restrictions on credit and government support, U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba peaked at $685 million in 2008 but have since decreased to an average of $365 million per year from 2012 to 2014. U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba have declined to $286 million in CY2014, with chicken meat, corn, soybean meal, and soybeans accounting for 84% of total exports between 2012 and 2014. The decline is attributed to factors such as Cuba diversifying its supplier network, establishing closer relations with allies like China and Vietnam, and the availability of credit from non-U.S. suppliers due to U.S. trade sanctions. The USDA states that U.S. restrictions on credit to Cuban buyers have hindered agricultural exports to Cuba. Cuba has turned to the EU and Brazil for imports as U.S. exports have decreased. The Senate Committee on Finance requested the ITC to investigate Cuban import trends and U.S. restrictions. The Senate Committee on Finance requested the ITC to investigate Cuban import trends, major supplying countries, and the impact of U.S. trade restrictions on Cuban imports. The committee also asked for an analysis of non-tariff measures and barriers inhibiting U.S. and non-U.S. firms from conducting business in Cuba. The Senate Committee on Finance requested the ITC to investigate Cuban import trends, major supplying countries, and the impact of U.S. trade restrictions on Cuban imports. They also asked for an analysis of non-tariff measures and barriers inhibiting U.S. and non-U.S. firms from conducting business in Cuba, including restrictions on trade and investment, property rights, customs duties, sanitary measures, state trading, intellectual property rights, and infrastructure affecting telecommunications and port facilities. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of the effects of Cuban tariff and non-tariff measures on U.S. and non-U.S. firms conducting business in Cuba was also requested. ITC held a hearing in June 2015 to gather views on U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The March 2016 report highlighted obstacles like credit restrictions and travel limitations. U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba have declined since 2009, while overall Cuban agricultural imports have risen. The U.S. is a competitive exporter of grains, meat, and soybeans. The United States is a competitive exporter of farm products like grains, meat, soybeans, and soybean products, which Cuba heavily depends on importing. U.S. exporters have advantages such as proximity to Cuba and lower shipping costs, making them price competitive if restrictions were lifted. It is uncertain if lifting restrictions would change Cuba's requirement for state trading agency imports. Cuba aims to diversify suppliers to avoid overreliance on the U.S. Other factors affecting U.S. agricultural exports include Cuban purchasing power. The potential increase in U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba depends on factors like the Cuban economy's purchasing power and import substitution policy. The ITC report suggests that lifting trade restrictions could lead to a 155% increase in agricultural exports within five years. However, concerns about subsidized competition from Cuba exist, especially for Florida agriculture. The USDA issued a report in June 2015 assessing the potential for increased U.S. agricultural trade with Cuba. The report compares Cuba to the Dominican Republic in terms of population size and per capita income. It considers the potential for the Cuban market to expand to levels similar to the Dominican Republic, which imported $1.1 billion of U.S. agricultural products on average from 2012-2014. The report also highlights concerns about the impact of lifting the ban on imports from Cuba, including subsidized competition and the introduction of new pests and diseases into Florida agriculture. The USDA sees an opportunity to expand U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba due to its close proximity and low market share. They believe U.S. rice could regain a large market share in Cuba if competitive credit terms are offered, citing advantages like year-round availability and transportation cost advantages. The USDA suggests that exports of U.S. commodities like dry beans, wheat, and dry milk could rebound in Cuba if normal trade relations were restored. They also see potential for increased sales of cheese, yogurt, and higher value cuts of pork, poultry meat, and beef. Additionally, there is an opportunity for expanded sales of low-value cuts of pork, pork variety meats, chicken leg quarters, and milk powder in Cuba. The USDA suggests that U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba could reach $1.2 billion within five years if trade financing and travel restrictions were relaxed. Texas A&M University identified Arkansas, Texas, Minnesota, Louisiana, Missouri, and Nebraska as the states that would benefit the most. Factors influencing exports include remittances from Cuban-Americans and access to foreign exchange from Cuba's exports like tourism, nickel/cobalt, pharmaceuticals, sugar, and tobacco products. The potential for U.S. agricultural export gains from lifting trade restrictions with Cuba includes the opportunity for Cuba to ship its agricultural products to the United States. Concerns arise over potential competition with Florida farmers who grow similar products, with worries about subsidized competition from Cuban farms. Cuba's agricultural exports are limited, with sugar accounting for 89% of its farm exports. Concerns exist about potential competition with Florida agriculture and the threat of new pests and diseases. China and the European Union are the main markets for Cuba's agricultural exports. Cuba's agricultural exports have been dominated by sugar, accounting for 89% of its farm exports. However, its sugar production and export trade have declined significantly since the 1990s. If the embargo on Cuban products were lifted, the country could potentially boost its agricultural exports to the United States by leveraging its comparative advantages in tropical fruit, vegetables, sugar, and tobacco. Cuba's sugar production has fallen sharply from 6.5-8.5 million metric tons in the 1980s to an average of 1.6 million metric tons in recent years, with exports averaging just below 1 million tons annually. Cuba's sugar production and exports have declined significantly since the 1990s, with exports averaging just below 1 million tons annually. Any post-embargo access to the U.S. sugar market would have to be negotiated, potentially limited by existing trade agreements. The USDA study in June 2015 concluded that establishing a normal trading relationship with Cuba could lead to some U.S. sugar imports from Cuba, but at much lower volumes than in the late 1950s. The study identified six possible options for providing Cuba access to the U.S. sugar market under existing multilateral trade agreements. President Obama's initiative to change U.S.-Cuba relations could impact this potential market access. President Obama's initiative to change U.S.-Cuba relations does not have the authority to end the embargo, as it is codified in legislation. The LIBERTAD Act requires the President to end the trade embargo if Cuba meets certain criteria, including free and fair elections, respect for civil liberties, and a move towards a free market economic system. Congressional action would be needed otherwise to amend or repeal the Act. Existing statutes contain restrictions important for trade in food and agricultural products with Cuba. Some Members of Congress are proposing legislation to ease the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, including bills like H.R. 274, H.R. 403, and H.R. 735. One bill, H.R. 635, aims to facilitate the export of U.S. agricultural and medical exports to Cuba by redefining the term \"payment of cash in advance\" and authorizing direct transfers between Cuban and U.S. financial institutions. Some proposed legislation aims to ease the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba by allowing direct transfers between Cuban and U.S. financial institutions for exported products, establishing an export promotion program for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, and prohibiting travel restrictions. Other bills seek to remove restrictions on trade with Cuba, including financing of agricultural sales, export assistance, and entry of Cuban goods into the U.S. Private financing of agricultural commodity sales to Cuba is also being considered. The proposed legislation aims to ease the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba by repealing restrictions on private financing for Cuba, while still prohibiting U.S. government financial assistance for exports to Cuba. H.R. 3687 would amend TSRA to allow U.S. entities to make loans or extend credit for sales of agricultural commodities to Cuba and permit U.S. government assistance for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The proposed legislation aims to ease the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba by allowing private financing for Cuba, while still prohibiting U.S. government financial assistance for exports to Cuba. It would authorize U.S. entities to provide loans or credit for sales of agricultural commodities to Cuba, and permit U.S. government assistance for agricultural exports to Cuba, as long as the recipient is not controlled by the Cuban government. Additionally, it would allow investment in agricultural businesses in Cuba that are not controlled by the Cuban government or involved in trafficking confiscated U.S. property."
