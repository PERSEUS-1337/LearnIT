    "content": "The Information Maximization Autoencoder (IMAE) is a novel approach to learning both continuous and discrete representations in an unsupervised manner. Unlike the Variational Autoencoder, IMAE uses a stochastic encoder to map input data to a hybrid representation, maximizing mutual information. A decoder approximates the posterior distribution of the data, achieving high fidelity by leveraging informative representations. The proposed objective aims to find informative yet compact representations of data through generative latent variable models. The model is optimized by fitting the data distribution to the training data, maximizing likelihood for \u03b8. The variational autoencoder (VAE) proposes to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the marginal likelihood objective to address the intractability issue of complex functions. However, maximizing ELBO penalizes the mutual information between data and their representations, making representation learning harder. Recent efforts focus on revising ELBO to target either \"disentangled representations\" or control the mutual information between data and representations. The proposed model aims to maximize mutual information between data and representations by using a stochastic encoder. This approach improves decoding quality and balances informativeness of latent factors while maintaining statistical independence. It offers a principled way to learn meaningful representations without compromising the ELBO. The work proposes a framework for learning both continuous and discrete representations for categorical data. It focuses on capturing categorical information and continuous variation in a natural way. Compared to VAE based approaches, the proposed objective offers a more effective method for learning hybrid representations. The text discusses the limitations of \u03b2-VAE in learning interpretable representations and proposes different approaches to address these limitations.\u03b2-VAE penalizes mutual information more than a standard VAE, leading to underutilization of latent representation space. Follow-up works suggest constraining mutual information by adjusting the KL divergence term in ELBO. However, specifying and tuning the target value for this adjustment can be challenging. Alternatively, (Zhao et al., 2017) proposes dropping the mutual information term in ELBO to encourage independence in latent representations without violating the VAE objective. Other approaches like BID8 BID12 BID4 BID7 aim to learn disentangled representations by minimizing the total correlation term of latent factors. In contrast to previous approaches like dropping the mutual information term in ELBO or minimizing the total correlation term, our information maximization objective aims to maximize the informativeness of each representation factor while promoting statistical independence. We introduce a new perspective on VAE-based unsupervised representation learning by maximizing mutual information between data and representations, incorporating both continuous and discrete representations for modeling diverse real-world data. The proposed objective aims to learn semantically meaningful representations by maximizing mutual information between data and its representations, using a hybrid continuous-discrete approach. The objective seeks compact yet informative low-dimensional representations under proper constraints, ensuring effectiveness in learning. The mutual information measures the decrease in uncertainty of one random variable given another. A probabilistic decoder approximates the true posterior, optimizing the dissimilarity between them. IMAE balances latent representation informativeness and decoding quality by minimizing KL divergence. The second term in the optimization process involves reparameterization tricks for continuous and discrete representations. The first term quantifies the informativeness of each representation factor and the statistical dependence between them. The total correlation term measures the independence between continuous latent factors. The optimization process involves maximizing informativeness of each latent factor and promoting statistical independence between them. Various sampling strategies have been proposed for optimizing total correlation. Tractable approximations are constructed for the mutual information between latent factors and data. The equality in the optimization process is achieved when the factors are independent of each other. The optimization process aims to maximize informativeness of each latent factor and promote statistical independence between them. Proposition 1 states that z k is more informative about x when it has less uncertainty and captures more variance in data. A vanishing variance of the conditional distribution p(z k |x) results in a plain autoencoder mapping each data sample to a deterministic latent point, potentially fragmenting the latent space. The optimization process aims to maximize the informativeness of each latent factor by controlling the variance in the latent space. To avoid degenerate solutions, the surrogate for maximizing the mutual information involves pushing each distribution towards a Gaussian distribution. This helps achieve a more reasonable trade-off between enlarging the spread of the latent variable and maintaining continuity. The mutual information I \u03b8 (x; y) can be well approximated with a discrete representation and data, especially when the space of y is low. With a large batch of samples, the empirical mutual information I \u03b8 (x; y) is a good approximation, enabling optimization in a theoretically justifiable way. Let y be a discrete random variable with bounded marginal probabilities, allowing for optimization with stochastic gradient descent. Maximizing mutual information I \u03b8 (x; y) involves balancing category assignment and categorical identity confidence. The objective is to achieve a deterministic p \u03b8 (y|x) and a uniform marginal distribution p \u03b8 (y). This trade-off aims to learn discrete categorical representations effectively. The overall objective is to maximize information while optimizing with stochastic gradient descent. The overall objective is to balance category assignment and categorical identity confidence by maximizing mutual information. This involves optimizing a hybrid of continuous and discrete representations through a weighted objective function. The goal is to achieve a better balance between information maximization and posterior approximation, promoting statistically independent latent factors and improving decoding quality. The proposed approach, IMAE, aims to learn a hybrid representation successfully and is compared against various VAE based approaches. The proposed approach, IMAE, aims to successfully learn a hybrid of continuous and discrete representations, outperforming VAE based models by achieving a better trade-off between representation interpretability and decoding quality. Priors r(z) and r(y) are chosen as isotropic Gaussian and uniform distributions respectively. Different VAE based models like \u03b2-VAE, InfoVAE, and JointVAE are compared in terms of controlling mutual information and KL divergence terms. The proposed IMAE approach aims to learn hybrid representations, outperforming VAE models by balancing interpretability and decoding quality. It qualitatively demonstrates that informative representations lead to better interpretability, with high mutual information variables showing dispersion across data samples. This is validated through continuous and discrete representations, showcasing intuitive factors of variation. In this section, quantitative evaluations are performed on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and dSprites BID17 datasets. IMAE achieves better interpretability vs. decoding quality trade-off by maximizing mutual information between representations and data. The assumption made on discrete representations is that the conditional distribution should be locally smooth for high interpretability. The assumption for using neural networks to learn discrete representations is that the conditional distribution should be locally smooth. To address this, the virtual adversarial training (VAT) trick is adopted to maintain local smoothness in the prediction model. Using VAT is essential for learning interpretable discrete representations. InfoVAE outperforms \u03b2-VAE in learning interpretable discrete representations by dropping mutual information I(x; y) from ELBO. It performs well on distinctive data like MNIST by uniformly distributing data over categories with large \u03b2 values. However, it struggles with less distinctive data like Fashion-MNIST. Figure 4 shows IMAE's ability to uncover discrete factors and achieve confident category separation by minimizing conditional entropy H(y|x) while maintaining local smoothness with VAT. This approach outperforms JointVAE and \u03b2-VAE in learning interpretable representations. Although JointVAE outperforms \u03b2-VAE in pushing the upper bound of I(x; y) towards a target value, it can get stuck at bad local optima. Increasing C y may induce oscillation within that region. Using large \u03b2 values sacrifices mutual information and leads to less informative representations and poor decoding quality. IMAE excels in learning discrete presentations over others like JointVAE and InfoVAE. IMA is more capable of learning discrete presentations compared to JointVAE and InfoVAE, yielding better decoding quality. It consistently performs well with different hyperparameters, especially in regions where decoding quality and informativeness of latent representations are good. The disentanglement capability of IMAE is quantitatively evaluated on dSprites. The disentanglement metric proposed by BID4 evaluates the gap between top two empirical mutual information of latent representation factors and ground truth factors. A high disentanglement score indicates more informative and disentangled representation factors. Large \u03b2 values in \u03b2-VAE penalize mutual information too much, degrading representations, while other methods achieve higher disentanglement scores with better decoding quality. JointVAE with higher \u03b2 values converges mutual information to a target value, maintaining more mutual information. The disentanglement score tends to decrease along with the total correlation if using larger \u03b2 values, leading to diminishing informativeness of representation factors. Simply restricting the overall capacity of latent representations is not enough for learning disentangled representations. InfoVAE yields comparatively better decoding quality but poor disentanglement quality in this region. IMAE is a novel approach for learning categorical information and uncovering shared continuous features. It achieves a better trade-off between disentanglement score and decoding quality compared to InfoVAE. This is attributed to seeking statistically independent latent factors by minimizing total correlation. IMAE aims to maximize mutual information between data and representations using a stochastic encoder and decoder. It focuses on generating informative representations for semantically meaningful results while maintaining good decoding quality. The model tackles the challenge of unsupervised joint learning of disentangled continuous and discrete representations. However, it has a limitation in assuming independent scalar latent factors for disentanglement. The curr_chunk discusses the need for more structured disentangled representations in data, specifically focusing on encouraging group independence. The text also mentions the balance between posterior inference fidelity and information maximization. The mutual information between data and its representations is rewritten to show the trade-off parameter \u03b2. The optimization procedure focuses on balancing the informativeness of latent representation and generation fidelity. It involves decomposing the mutual information between data and its representations into joint random variables. The text discusses the assumption of marginal independence between variables y and z, leading to the Monte Carlo estimator of true probability. The Hoeffding's inequality is applied to bounded random variables to yield results. The concentration results of entropy with respect to the empirical distribution are established for bounded random variables. The divergence between two defined functions is then bounded using similar arguments as before. The text discusses estimating marginal distributions of continuous representations using minibatch data and approximating entropy. The method aims to scale up for large datasets by proposing estimations based on sampled data. The distribution of variances output by the encoder is also recorded. The text discusses the distribution of variances output by the encoder in the context of estimating marginal distributions of continuous representations using minibatch data. It also explains the generative model in VAE and the optimization of the evidence lower bound to minimize the KL divergence and reduce the mutual information between variables. IMAIE aims to maximize the mutual information between data x and representations z from the start, in contrast to other approaches that either drop the mutual information term or increase penalties on total correlation. IMAE focuses on maximizing mutual information between data x and representations z while avoiding degenerated solutions. The decoder in IMAE serves as a variational approximation to the true posterior. IMAE excels in balancing disentanglement score and decoding quality, showing a negative correlation between total correlation and disentanglement score. This implies that the disentanglement score decreases with larger beta values, leading to less informative representation factors. When using larger beta values, the total correlation and disentanglement score can degrade to zero. Training procedures vary for different datasets: momentum is used for MNIST and Fashion MNIST with a learning rate of 1e-3, while Adam is used for dSprites with the same learning rate."
