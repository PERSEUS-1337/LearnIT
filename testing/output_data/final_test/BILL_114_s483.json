    "content": "The Act titled \"Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2016\" introduces amendments to the Controlled Substances Act regarding factors relevant to public health and safety and addressing imminent danger situations. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to define \"imminent danger to the public health or safety\" and provide an opportunity for corrective action plans before revocation or suspension of registration. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to allow for an order to show cause before denial, revocation, or suspension of registration, providing specific citations to alleged violations and the opportunity to submit a corrective action plan. Upon review of the plan, the Attorney General will determine if proceedings should be discontinued or deferred for modification. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to allow for an order to show cause before denial, revocation, or suspension of registration. Proceedings for such actions shall be conducted independently of criminal prosecutions. Additionally, a report to Congress is required within one year of the Act's enactment. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, along with the CDC Director, DEA Administrator, and consultation with Defense and Veterans Affairs Secretaries, must submit a report to Congress on obstacles to patient access to controlled substances, diversion issues, and collaboration between law enforcement and the pharmaceutical industry to benefit patients and prevent abuse. The report will address obstacles to patient access to controlled substances, collaboration between law enforcement and the pharmaceutical industry to prevent abuse, medical education and training opportunities for pain management, enhancements to State prescription drug monitoring programs, and improvements in reporting requirements for prescription opioids. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of incorporating feedback and recommendations from various stakeholders including patient groups, pharmacies, drug manufacturers, healthcare providers, law enforcement agencies, insurance providers, veterinarians, and public health authorities.
