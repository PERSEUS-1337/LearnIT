    "title": "SB 1004",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 2.55 of Title 6 of the Penal Code establishes a Deferred Entry of Judgment Pilot Program in specified counties for eligible defendants charged with felony offenses. Participants must be between 18 and 21 years old, plead guilty, and meet certain requirements determined by the probation department. The Deferred Entry of Judgment Pilot Program in certain counties is for individuals aged 18-21 who plead guilty to felony offenses. To qualify, they must pass a risk assessment, show potential for benefiting from delinquent services, meet juvenile hall rules, and have no prior serious convictions. The probation department, in consultation with relevant authorities, develops an evaluation process using a risk assessment tool to determine eligibility for the program. Defendants required to register as sex offenders or convicted of specific offenses are not eligible for the Deferred Entry of Judgment Pilot Program. The court grants deferred entry of judgment to eligible defendants who consent to participate in the program, waive their right to a speedy trial, plead guilty, and waive time for judgment. If the defendant is not eligible or does not consent, proceedings continue as usual. If the defendant is not benefiting from the program or is performing unsatisfactorily due to a new crime or rule violation, the probation department may request judgment. The court will hold a hearing, and if the defendant is found guilty, judgment will be entered, and a sentencing hearing scheduled. The defendant will be removed from the program and returned to county jail. The defendant may be moved from custody in juvenile hall to county jail if not benefiting from the program or due to a new crime. The local multidisciplinary team will determine the mechanism for this transfer. The court will dismiss the criminal charge if the defendant performs satisfactorily during the deferred entry of judgment period. The defendant can serve a maximum of one year in juvenile hall. The probation department will provide reentry services like housing, employment, and education. Data on program effectiveness will be submitted to the Division of Recidivism Reduction and Re-Entry. Prior to establishing a pilot program, the county must seek approval from the Board of State and Community Corrections for a suitable confinement institution. The board will review the application within 30 days, considering programming, capacity, and safety for individuals in criminal and juvenile court jurisdictions. The defendant in the program cannot have contact with minors in juvenile hall for any reason. The Board of State and Community Corrections reviews county pilot programs for compliance with federal Juvenile Justice Act requirements. Each county must establish a multidisciplinary team to oversee program implementation, including representatives from probation, district attorney, public defender, sheriff, courts, and board of supervisors. The county pilot program must submit data to the Board of State and Community Corrections for evaluation. This evaluation will assess the program's impact on sentencing, community supervision opportunities, minors in juvenile facilities, and program participants' outcomes compared to young adult offenders. The Board of State and Community Corrections evaluates county pilot programs and submits comprehensive reports to the Assembly and Senate Committees on Public Safety. The board may contract with an independent entity for these evaluations. This chapter will be in effect until January 1, 2020, unless extended or repealed by a later statute. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for certain counties due to unique circumstances. Recent research shows ongoing brain development in adolescents beyond 18 years. This bill allows transitional age youth in specified counties access to age-appropriate rehabilitative services to reduce their involvement in the criminal justice system."
