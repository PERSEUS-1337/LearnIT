    "content": "The \"Corps of Engineers Reform Act of 2000\" includes provisions for project planning and mitigation. It outlines independent review, stakeholder involvement, monitoring, recommendations, principles, and guidelines. Additionally, it establishes a Full Mitigation and Concurrent Mitigation framework. The Corps of Engineers is responsible for managing the nation's water resources. Efficient funding use and oversight are needed. Project planning must consider recreation, clean water, and wildlife habitat. Environmental impacts must be mitigated, and stakeholders should have a larger role in project development. The Act aims to address these issues. The Act aims to ensure economically justified water resources investments, independent review of feasibility studies, successful mitigation for projects, enhanced stakeholder involvement, and revised planning principles for riverside and coastal communities. The Act defines the term \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Army. It also includes provisions for independent review in project planning. The Secretary of the Army shall ensure that feasibility reports for water resources projects over $25,000,000 and controversial projects are reviewed by an independent panel of experts. An Office of Independent Review is established within the Corps of Engineers, with a Director appointed by the Secretary for a 3-year term. The Director of the Office of Independent Review is appointed by the Secretary for a 3-year term and must be a distinguished scholar. The Director's duties include establishing a panel of experts for project reviews, with each panel consisting of 5 to 9 independent experts representing various areas of expertise. The Director appoints individuals to serve on panels of experts for projects, considering financial or professional associations. The Director consults with the National Academy of Sciences for expert lists. Panelists are compensated and receive travel expenses. Panel of experts for projects under this section review feasibility reports, gather public comments, and submit economic, engineering, and environmental analyses to the Secretary within 180 days. Controversial projects are identified based on public controversy. The project will be considered controversial if there is substantial public controversy, objections from the affected State, or if the US Fish and Wildlife Service determines it will have a significant adverse effect on fish and wildlife. The Secretary must consider expert panel recommendations, make reports public, and include them in reports to Congress. The cost of reviewing a project under this section is capped at $250,000 and is considered part of the total project cost. The Secretary has the authority to waive this limitation for valid reasons. SEC. 102. STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT. The Secretary will establish a stakeholder advisory group for feasibility studies, ensuring balanced representation of interest groups. Federal Advisory Committee Act applies to the group. SEC. 103. MONITORING. SEC. 103. MONITORING. The Secretary will monitor economic and environmental results of water resources projects costing over $25,000,000 for at least 15 years, providing annual reports to Congress. Monitoring costs will be covered by the Federal government. SEC. 104. RECOMMENDATIONS. The Secretary must calculate all project costs, including mitigation costs, before recommending an initial plan for a proposed project. SEC. 105. PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES. SEC. 105. PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES. Section 209 of the Flood Control Act of 1970 is amended to read as follows: \"SEC. 209. CONGRESSIONAL STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES.\" The intent of Congress is for economic development and environmental protection to be co-equal goals in water resources planning. The Secretary is required to revise principles and guidelines for flood control projects to include a national ecological restoration account, a national economic development account, and an optimum trade-off plan. Additionally, new techniques in risk analysis, elimination of biases for nonstructural projects, new analytical techniques, and restoration of aquatic ecosystems are to be incorporated. The Secretary will update the Guidance for Conducting Civil Works Planning Studies to comply with the restoration of aquatic ecosystems. SEC. 106. ENVIRONMENTAL ADVISORY BOARD. Section 905(b) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to include a requirement for the Environmental Advisory Board of the Corps of Engineers to review all reconnaissance studies to assess potential environmental impacts of proposed projects. The Board will make recommendations to the Secretary based on their review. A feasibility study is recommended for a project based on a reconnaissance report, and adjustments are made to align paragraphs within the text. TITLE II--MITIGATION\n\nSEC. 201. FULL MITIGATION. Section 906(d) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to include mitigation plans as part of project proposals. The Secretary must meet high standards for mitigation, including acquiring and restoring habitat to replace any negatively impacted by the project. The Secretary must ensure that resources impacted by projects are replaced, design mitigation projects to reflect habitat importance, and not recommend projects without meeting mitigation standards. The Secretary must complete all planned mitigation in a watershed before constructing any new water resources project in that watershed. The Secretary must complete 50% of required mitigation before starting project construction and use project funding for the rest."
