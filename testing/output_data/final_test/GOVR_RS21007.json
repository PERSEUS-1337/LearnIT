    "content": "The Navy procured 18 Ohio class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) between FY1974 and FY1991 to serve as part of the U.S. strategic nuclear deterrent force. These submarines, commonly known as Trident submarines, carry Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). The first Trident entered service in 1981, with the final one in 1997. Initially armed with Trident I (C4) SLBMs, the later submarines were armed with Trident II (D5) SLBMs. Designed for a 30-year life, they were later certified for a 42-year life, including a mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul. The Clinton Administration's 1994 Nuclear Posture Review recommended a strategic nuclear force for the START II treaty that included 14 Tridents armed with D5 missiles. The recommendation to reduce the Trident SSBN force to 14 boats prompted interest in converting the first 4 Trident SSBNs into non-strategic submarines called SSGNs. The Navy generally supported the concept but expressed concerns over financing all four conversions. Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to report on the issue as part of the proposed FY1999 defense budget. The FY1999 defense budget directed the Secretary of Defense to report on the issue of converting Trident SSBNs to SSGNs. The report was delivered to Congress in June 1999. The Bush Administration requested funding to convert only two of the four Tridents due to Navy budget constraints. The Navy decided to refuel and convert SSBNs 726 and 728 due to budget constraints. The deadline for this decision had passed between late 2000 and June 2001. Congress increased funding for the program in FY2002 to support a four-boat conversion program pursued by the Bush Administration. The converted Tridents can carry up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles. The SSBNs 726 and 728 were refueled and converted to carry up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 66 Navy SEAL personnel. Modifications included using SLBM tubes for SOF personnel, converting spaces for berthing SOF personnel, and modernizing fire control systems. Each boat also underwent mid-life engineering refueling. Each SSGN underwent a mid-life engineering refueling overhaul to extend their operational lifespan. The aim is to have two SSGNs continuously forward deployed until their decommissioning in the late 2020s. SSBNs 726 and 727 are homeported in Puget Sound at Bangor, WA, while SSBNs 728 and 729 are homeported at Kings Bay, GA. The 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review directed the exploration of homeporting SSGNs in the Western Pacific, with SSBNs 726 and 727 operated out of Guam in the Western Pacific. The SSGNs, homeported at Bangor, operate covertly from Guam in the Western Pacific for strike and SOF-support missions. They fulfill Tomahawk missile requirements, allowing other Navy assets to focus on different tasks. The SSGNs also serve as replacements for older SSBNs converted into SSNs for SOF support. The Trident SSGN program is seen as a defense transformation initiative. The Trident SSGN program is considered a defense transformation initiative, converting strategic-nuclear-forces platforms into non-strategic ones with a large number of cruise missiles. Some argue that the program may have slowed the transformation of the Navy's submarine force by reducing funding for more radical changes to the Virginia-class attack submarine design. The Navy aims to maximize the value of SSGNs by using them as test beds for new ideas, like deploying highly capable UUVs from submarines. The cost for refueling and converting four Tridents is estimated at $4.0 billion, representing a significant increase from earlier estimates. This program avoids a near-term expenditure of about $440 million. The Navy's program to refuel and convert four Tridents avoids a near-term expenditure of $440 million. The estimated net additional cost to convert the 4 boats rather than inactivate them is $3.56 billion, or about $890 million per boat. The total 20-year life-cycle cost for the four Trident SSGNs is roughly $7.6 billion. All four Trident conversions have been completed. Trident conversions completed, IOC declared on November 1, 2007. SSBN-726 first ship converted, began operational deployment as SSGN in October 2007. Refuelings and conversions done by PSNSY in WA and NNSY in VA. General Dynamics' Electric Boat Division prime contractor for program. Agreement with Russia on new nuclear arms treaty announced on May 13, 2002. The agreement aims to reduce strategic nuclear warheads by 2012, addressing concerns about counting \"phantom\" warheads on converted Trident SSGNs. Congress may question the cost increase of a conversion program and funding for advanced payloads. Considerations include reducing the Trident SSBN force, expanding the SSGN conversion program, and the lack of replacements for SSGNs in the Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan lacks replacements for the 4 SSGNs, leading to their disappearance from the fleet by 2028. The FY2009 defense appropriations act approved $3 million for the SSGN program."
