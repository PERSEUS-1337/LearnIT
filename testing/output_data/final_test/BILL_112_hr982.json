    "content": "The \"Home Energy Affordability Tax Relief Act of 2011\" or \"HEATR Act of 2011\" introduces a refundable credit for residential energy costs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"HEATR Act of 2011\" introduces a credit for residential energy costs for individuals, capped at 33% of costs or $500. The credit is reduced based on adjusted gross income exceeding $50,000. The \"HEATR Act of 2011\" introduces a credit for residential energy costs, defined as expenses for utilities and qualified fuel in the taxpayer's primary residence during the heating season. Adjusted gross income is calculated without considering specific sections. The term 'principal residence' is defined as the taxpayer's main home during the heating season, excluding residences outside the US. The heating season is from October to March, and qualified fuel includes propane, heating oil, kerosene, wood, and wood pellets. Individuals paying for natural gas under a level payment plan for any period will have those amounts treated as paid for natural gas used during that portion of the heating season. The same rule applies to electricity and any qualified fuel. Homeowners associations and members, as well as tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations, can allocate or apportion residential energy costs to individuals paying for them. The residential energy cost credit can be allocated among individuals in joint occupancy. The credit is treated as a refundable credit for tax purposes. Dollar amounts in subsections (a)(2) and (b)(1)(A) are adjusted for inflation starting in 2012. The amount is adjusted for inflation starting in 2012, based on fuel price inflation and cost-of-living adjustments. The adjustment for 2012 is based on the difference between the CPI fuel component for October 2011 and October 2010. The dollar amount in subsection (a)(2) is rounded to the nearest multiple of $10 if it is not already a multiple of $10. The section applies to residential energy costs paid after enactment, in taxable years ending before January 1, 2013. Conforming amendments include adding section 6433 to title 31 and updating the table of sections. The amendments made by section 6433 provide a refundable credit for residential energy costs, effective for taxable years ending after the enactment date of the Act."
