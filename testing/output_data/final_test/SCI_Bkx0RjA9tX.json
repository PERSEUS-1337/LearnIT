This approach allows for scalable and interpretable reasoning, achieving competitive performance on benchmarks and improving generalization from biased training data to adversarial testing data. The text discusses the proposal of generative question answering models to combat overfitting to biases in datasets by learning a prior over answers and a conditional language model to generate questions. This approach aims to improve generalization from biased training data to adversarial testing data. The text discusses a generative question answering model that uses a prior over answers and a conditional language model to generate questions, enabling improved generalization from biased training data to adversarial test data. The model explains questions word-by-word, supporting chains of reasoning and allowing many-hop reasoning. Our approach in the generative question answering model focuses on interpretable reasoning steps for each question word, achieving high accuracy on the CLEVR benchmark. This opens a new direction for question answering with strong results in language understanding, reasoning, and generalization. The media speculated that the script for a film shot in Mexico City was altered to please Mexican authorities for financial support, but producer Michael G. Wilson denied the claims. The text discusses training models to minimize the negative log likelihood of questions and answers given context, using different models for text and images. It also evaluates a prior over answers and models the likelihood of questions. At test time, the answer maximizing the joint distribution is returned. Contextualized word representations are used, similar to ELMo. Hyperparameters and training details are provided in the appendix. The text discusses using contextualized word representations for training models, with parameters frozen and not finetuned. Character-based word embeddings are used along with a 2-layer LSTM language model. Encoder information about the article topic is provided by summing the representation with a trainable vector. Bidirectional LSTMs are used with residual connections. In a standard and adversarial SQUAD question setting, the model assigns higher probability to question words near Isaac Newton in the standard setting, while Earth distinguishes the true answer in the adversarial setting. The answer is represented as a weighted sum of words within a span, allowing the model to select multiple head words. Generative training enables modeling complex interactions between the answer and context. In a generative training approach, complex interactions between the answer and context are modeled by computing an answer-dependent document representation on SQUAD. This involves concatenating the output of the answer-independent representation of each context word with various embeddings and feeding it into residual bidirectional LSTMs. Additionally, pre-trained features from a ResNet-101 model are used for image encoding, with dropout applied before projecting the representations to a specific size. The curr_chunk discusses the process of modeling the distribution over answers given the context, using convolutional layers and positional encoding. On SQUAD, the answer-independent context representation is concatenated and processed with a hidden layer before scoring. On CLEVR, a fully connected layer is applied to the image representation for answer prediction. The curr_chunk describes the process of generating question words using a multi-layer RNN with attention and computing the likelihood of the next word. It involves using a pretrained language model and a trainable LSTM layer. Decoder blocks consist of question self-attention and question-to-context attention mechanisms fed into an LSTM. The context attention query is computed using the previous layer state and self-attention value. Blocks are connected with residual connections. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of attention mechanisms in a model based on Vaswani et al., using single-headed attention and a bias term to filter out irrelevant context. A final block combines self-attention and question-to-document attention with a Gated Linear Unit layer to output a vector. Generating rare words is more challenging for generative models due to the difficulty in predicting their meaning. The curr_chunk discusses improving modelling of rare words using character-based softmax and copy mechanism. It compares Word Softmax and Character Softmax approaches, showing skewed word probability distributions towards semantically valid choices. The curr_chunk discusses using a pointer mechanism to improve vocabulary representation in SQUAD. It includes generative training with teacher forcing to avoid negative question-answer combinations during training. The model is fine-tuned to prioritize the correct answer over other options, improving performance by establishing complex dependencies between input and output. This approach helps avoid overfitting and enhances the model's ability to handle a large number of possible answers efficiently. To efficiently handle a large number of possible answers in SQUAD, beam search is used to evaluate answer spans up to length 30. The top 250 candidates are selected, and p(q|a, c) is evaluated for each. The model (GQA) is evaluated on the SQUAD dataset, showing competitive results with discriminative models, indicating the potential of generative models for such tasks. Generative models have shown potential for tasks like SQUAD, with techniques such as ensembles, data augmentation, and reinforcement learning improving results. Ablations demonstrate the importance of character-based softmax, pointer mechanism, and fine-tuning with negative question-answer pairs. Generative training learns additional relationships but benefits from exposure to negative pairs during fine-tuning. The ablation study on the number of answer candidates in the beam at inference time shows that considering more candidates improves results but increases computational cost. The model's ability to perform multihop reasoning on the CLEVR dataset is evaluated, demonstrating high accuracy at complex reasoning tasks. The approach of incorporating MAC cells or FiLM layers into the decoder or encoder could potentially improve results, but the emphasis is on generative decoding for multihop reasoning. The model emphasizes generative decoding for multihop reasoning, updating attention based on new information. Popular QA datasets contain biases that models can exploit, such as selecting answers based on expected types. Instead of removing biases, the study focuses on making training robust to bias by creating deliberately biased subsets of SQUAD based on named entity types.

GQA shows improvement in explaining all question words, making it the most robust model to adversarial attacks. The model can answer questions in a multiparagraph setting, training on single paragraphs but capable of handling multi-paragraph context.

Training involves batches of 10 documents and a cosine learning rate schedule. Fine-tuning includes freezing certain parameters. During fine-tuning, the answer-independent context encoding and p(a|c) model are frozen to reduce memory requirements and stabilize learning.

During generative training, gradient descent with momentum 0.9 is used with an initial learning rate of 0.025, decayed by a factor of 5 after 10 epochs without improvement. Batch size is set to 1024. For fine-tuning, the initial learning rate is 0.001 with a batch size of 32."
