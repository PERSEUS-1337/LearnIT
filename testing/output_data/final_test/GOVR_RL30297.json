The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the annual adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget, serving as a budget plan for the upcoming fiscal year and following four years. While programmatic assumptions within the budget are not binding, the totals and committee spending allocations may be enforced through points of order and the budget reconciliation process. This report provides information on the budget resolutions adopted and rejected by Congress, including U.S. Statutes-at-Large citations and committee report numbers, as well as details on their formulation and content. It also includes a table of optional components, a list of budget reconciliation measures developed pursuant to directives in budget resolutions, and information on the number of years covered by budget resolutions. Additionally, it covers the consideration and adoption of budget resolutions, including House special rules for their consideration and amendments. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires annual adoption of budget resolutions, with modifications made over time. Initially, two resolutions were adopted each year, setting nonbinding targets in the spring and guiding budgetary legislation in the fall. Various laws and resolutions have altered the budget process, including rules for consideration, amendments, and dates of action by Congress. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 eliminated the requirement for a second budget resolution starting in 1986. Congress did not adopt a second budget resolution for FY1983-FY1986, instead making spending and revenue totals in the first resolution binding automatically at the beginning of the fiscal year. During the 41 years under the Budget Act, Congress completed action on 40 budget resolutions for the fiscal year. Congress did not complete action on a budget resolution for nine fiscal years, most recently for FY2015. Congress also adopted a second budget resolution in seven of the 41 years, and in 1977, a third budget resolution for FY1977 was adopted. Table 1 lists all budget resolutions adopted by Congress, including House and Senate votes on initial passage and adoption of the conference report. Congress did not complete action on a budget resolution. U.S. Statutes-at-Large citations for budget resolutions adopted by Congress are listed. Budget resolutions rejected in the House are listed in Table 3. Senate rejected motions to proceed to different budget resolutions in 2011 and 2012. House and Senate Budget Committees develop and report the budget resolution. Each House and Senate committee submits its \"views and estimates\" relating to budget matters to its Budget Committee within six weeks after the President's budget submission. The Budget Committees submit their \"views and estimates\" on budget matters to their respective Budget Committee, including comments on the President's budget proposals and estimates of legislation impact. The committees are not bound by these recommendations, and they are often printed in committee reports or separate committee prints. The budget resolution serves as a framework for budget decisions, with specific program determinations left to other committees. The budget resolution serves as a framework for budget decisions, with program changes influencing appropriations bills and other budgetary legislation. Section 301(a) of the Budget Act outlines the required matters to be included in the budget resolution for the upcoming fiscal year and the following four fiscal years. The Budget Act mandates that budget resolutions cover federal revenue levels, new budget authority, and outlays for major categories. Congress expanded the time frame to include the upcoming fiscal year and two ensuing years. The elastic clause allowed for three-year budget resolutions from FY1980 to FY1986. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 extended the period the budget resolution is required to cover to five fiscal years, starting from FY1991. This provision was later extended to cover the FY1996 through FY1998 budget resolutions. In pursuit of a balanced budget by FY2002, the FY1996 and FY1997 budget resolutions covered seven and six fiscal years, respectively. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 amended the Budget Act to require budget resolutions to cover at least five fiscal years. Congress can revise current-year budget levels in the resolution. Optional matters can also be included in the budget resolution, such as selected components in first budget resolutions from FY1976-FY2016. Budget reconciliation is a two-step process Congress uses to align spending, revenue, and debt levels with budget resolutions. Committees are directed to recommend changes in statute to meet budget resolution levels, and their recommendations are included in reconciliation bills without revision. During the 41-year period of the congressional budget process, budget reconciliation legislation has been used to align spending, revenue, and debt levels with budget resolutions. Special rules govern the consideration of these bills to limit content, prohibit certain amendments, and ensure timely completion. Out of 24 budget reconciliation measures considered by Congress, 20 were signed into law and four were vetoed. Table 7 lists budget resolutions with reconciliation directives and associated acts. Since FY1981, federal credit activities amounts were included. The 1985 Balanced Budget Act made direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments mandatory. Federal credit levels became optional in 1997. 18 out of 31 budget resolutions included federal credit amounts. Reserve funds in budget resolutions allow for revisions if deficit-neutral. The budget resolutions often include reserve funds and declaratory statements to indicate policy intent. Congress has included an average of 21 declaratory statements in the last 14 budget resolutions. The budget resolutions include declaratory statements and procedural provisions, such as deferred enrollment and the elastic clause, to guide budgetary actions. The budget resolution includes procedural provisions like deferred enrollment and special rules for consideration in the House and Senate. The House and Senate have different procedures for considering budget resolutions. The House typically considers an average of seven amendments per resolution, with the largest number of amendments considered being 45 in 1979. The amending activity in the House has decreased over the last few decades compared to the early years under the Budget Act. The House has historically considered an average of 16 amendments per budget resolution, with only 5 amendments adopted in the past 33 years. The special rule typically allows for amendments in the nature of a substitute, resulting in very few amendments being agreed to. In the Senate, the terms of debate and consideration of amendments are governed by procedures set forth in the Budget Act. The Senate typically considers many amendments to the budget resolution, with an average of almost 54 amendments per resolution between 1975 and 2015. The largest number of amendments considered was 254 in 2015, with 146 amendments agreed to. The Senate has seen an increase in the number of amendments considered during budget resolution discussions. On average, almost 90 amendments are considered per budget resolution, with over 56 being agreed to. The success rate for amendments in the Senate has been higher compared to the House, with a rate of 60% or more in 13 of the past 18 years. The Budget Act sets April 15 as the target date for completing action on the annual budget resolution. The adoption of budget resolutions for FY1976-FY2015 by Congress has been inconsistent. The budget resolution was adopted by the target date only six times, with the most recent being in 2003 for the FY2004 budget resolution. The deadline was changed to April 15 in 1985, and Congress has completed action on the budget resolution by the target date four times since then. However, there were nine fiscal years where Congress did not complete action on a budget resolution, most recently for FY2015. On average, when Congress did adopt a budget resolution, it was done 36 days after the target date. The FY1991 budget resolution was adopted on October 9, 1990, 177 days after the target date. The earliest adoption was for FY1994 on April 1, 1993, 14 days before the target date. Tables provide dates for consideration and adoption in the House and Senate. The Humphrey-Hawkins Act called for debate on economic goals. The Temporary Increase in the Public Debt Limit mandated budget balance for FY1981 and FY1982. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 had provisions related to budget control. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 required Congress to complete a budget resolution by April 15 each year, eliminated the need for a second resolution by September 15, formalized a three-year budget resolution, included off-budget entities in the budget, and mandated limits on deficit amounts. The budget resolution recommends a deficit amount exceeding the maximum deficit amount set in the 1985 Balanced Budget Act. Social Security is excluded from budget totals, except for deficit calculations to determine if sequestration is needed. The resolution may include two deficit totals: one with Social Security and one without. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 added provisions for pay-as-you-go procedures in the budget resolution and required budget resolutions for FY1991-FY1995 to cover five fiscal years. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 made changes to the budget process, including setting deficit limits and pay-as-you-go procedures. It also added a point of order in the Senate to prevent exceeding discretionary spending limits. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 extended these provisions through FY1998. Extended through FY1998 the BEA requirement that budget resolutions cover five fiscal years. Made permanent a temporary modification applying Section 301(i) to budget resolutions at any stage of consideration, protecting Social Security balances. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 permanently required the budget resolution to cover at least five fiscal years. The Budget Resolution for FY2000 (H.Con.Res. 68; 106th Congress; April 15, 1999) made changes to the budget resolution process, including optional reporting of loan obligations, special pay-as-you-go procedures in the Senate, and setting alternative deadlines for committee submissions. It also introduced a point of order against budget resolutions recommending a decrease in the Social Security trust funds surplus and prohibited consideration of revised budgets with on-budget deficits. The provision in the revised FY2000 or FY2001 budget resolution set forth a point of order against on-budget deficits, with exceptions for structural programmatic reforms, low economic growth, or a declaration of war. Amendments with \"precatory\" language were not allowed in budget resolutions and reconciliation legislation. The FY2004 and FY2006 Budget Resolutions extended the three-fifths vote requirement in the Senate for certain points of order. House Rule XXI, Clause 7 created a point of order against budget resolutions reducing the surplus or increasing the deficit. The budget resolutions for FY2008 and FY2011 modified rules in the Senate and House to prevent increases in deficit or direct spending. A separate order in the House for the 113th Congress created a requirement for budget resolutions. The budget resolution for FY2016 extended the three-fifths vote requirement in the Senate for certain points of order specified in the Budget Act until September 30, 2025."
