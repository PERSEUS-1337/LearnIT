    "content": "Congress is highly interested in the health of U.S. manufacturing due to its economic and national defense significance. Manufacturing contributes 12% to the GDP, employs 12 million workers, and supports additional jobs. Manufacturers fund two-thirds of industrial R&D, leading to technological innovation. Average compensation for manufacturing workers is higher than the national average. The manufacturing base is crucial for producing military equipment. Analysts have differing views on the sector's health. Some analysts have divergent views on the health of U.S. manufacturing. While some see the sector as vibrant and point to strong growth in output and productivity, others believe it is at risk due to offshoring, competition from other nations, and a long-term decline in employment. The declining U.S. manufacturing employment trend during the 2007-2009 recession raised concerns about the sector's health. Stakeholders and policymakers suggest reducing tax and regulatory burdens, reforming tort laws, and implementing federal initiatives like the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation proposed by President Obama to address these concerns. The report focuses on the establishment of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) proposed by President Obama in 2012. It discusses legislative actions, funding availability, the federal government's role, and oversight issues. The NNMI aims to support up to 15 institutes with $1 billion in mandatory funding. The Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office (AMNPO) gathered input from various stakeholders nationwide. The AMNPO sought input from various stakeholders nationwide to design the NNMI. Input was gathered through workshops, a Request for Information, and a National Science and Technology Council report. The President's proposal for $1 billion in mandatory funding was not enacted in the 112th Congress. In 2013, bills were introduced to establish the NNMI. The Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act (RAMI Act) was passed by Congress in December 2014, establishing the Network for Manufacturing Innovation. President Obama's FY2015 budget proposal included funding for up to 45 NNMI institutes as part of the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative (OGSI), but no legislative action was taken on this proposal. The RAMI Act, signed into law in December 2014, directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NMI) program. The program was rebranded as \"Manufacturing USA\" in September 2016. Prior to the RAMI Act, the Obama Administration established seven NNMI-like institutes using existing authorities of the Department of Defense and Department of Energy. Five institutes were awarded by DOD: America Makes, DMDII, LIFT, AIM Photonics, and NextFlex. Two institutes were awarded by DOE: PowerAmerica and IACMI. The RAMI Act allows existing manufacturing institutes to be classified as part of the program. The RAMI Act allows certain existing manufacturing institutes to be classified as IMIs for participation in the network, but prohibits them from receiving financial assistance authorized by the act. Seven additional IMIs have been awarded since the passage of the RAMI Act, three of which were awarded by DOD. Innovation Institute (ARMI), Manchester, NH, and Advanced Robotics Manufacturing Institute (ARM Institute), Pittsburgh, PA, are among the IMIs awarded by DOE and DOC for various manufacturing innovations. Congress allocated funding in December 2015 for the establishment and coordination of IMIs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided NIST with $25.0 million for the NNMI, including funding for the establishment of IMIs. NIST held an open competition in 2016 to select technological focus areas for industry-driven manufacturing institutes. NIST intended to establish two institutes with up to $70 million each over five to seven years, with federal funding matched by private sources. Only one IMI has been selected so far. The RAMI Act established the NNMI program with funding up to $5 million from the NIST ITS account. Congress appropriated $138.1 million in FY2015 for the ITS account, directing NIST to spend $130.0 million. Funding for NNMI depends on annual appropriations and may be subject to congressional prioritization and restrictions. In FY2015, Congress appropriated $138.1 million for the NIST ITS account, allocating $130.0 million for the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership and $8.1 million for NIST's Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortia program. The FY2016 NIST appropriation exceeded the RAMI Act authorization, providing $25 million for the NNMI for establishing new IMIs and coordination activities. NIST was operating on a continuing resolution through April 28, 2017, with funding at 99.8% of FY2016 levels. The RAMI Act also authorized the Department of Energy to transfer up to $250 million to NIST for NNMI funding from FY2015-FY2024. The availability of funds for the NNMI program at NIST depends on DOE appropriations for advanced manufacturing R&D, potential restrictions in the appropriations bill, and DOE's willingness to transfer funds. The RAMI Act allows the Secretary of Commerce to accept funds from other sources. Allocation of funds between program management and IMIs is not specified. President Obama's FY2017 budget request for NIST includes $47 million in discretionary funding for the NNMI, with $42 million for establishing three additional IMIs and $5 million for network coordination. An additional $1.9 billion in mandatory funding is requested to complete the NNMI network with 45 institutes by FY2025. Funding allocation between program management and IMIs is not specified, leaving flexibility for the use of funds. The RAMI Act authorizes the NNMI network with 45 institutes by FY2025. It designates the National Program Office as the convener of the Network but does not specify its purpose or federal role. Congress may consider amending the act to clarify these points. The NNMI is authorized through FY2024, with a final assessment due by December 31, 2024. No federal role is specified after FY2024, prompting Congress to decide on its continuation. In FY2016, NIST merged the AMTech program into NNMI, with no separate funding for AMTech in the President's FY2017 request. It is uncertain if FY2016 funds for NNMI can be used for new AMTech grants. Congress may need to provide guidance on the future of AMTech activities. The House version of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Report Appropriations Bill, 2017 did not address AMTech. The Senate version provided funding for NIST's activities in NNMI, following the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014. Congress may need to provide guidance on the future of AMTech activities. The NNMI program is subject to oversight hearings by Congress to ensure proper implementation, funding, interagency cooperation, establishment of new IMIs, and integration with existing federal manufacturing activities. While the RAMI Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing in the U.S. economy, it does not specify the shortcomings the NNMI program aims to address. Analysts have differing views on the necessity of the NNMI program, with some expressing concerns about the risk to the U.S. manufacturing sector. Analysts are concerned about the risk to the U.S. manufacturing sector, citing a decline in manufacturing employment and the trend of U.S. manufacturers moving production offshore. Other nations are actively growing their manufacturing capabilities and attracting U.S.-headquartered multinational companies with various policy incentives. The U.S. manufacturing sector has seen a significant decline in employment, with the number of jobs falling to its lowest level since March 1941. Analysts argue that long-term employment losses in manufacturing are inevitable due to technology and market forces. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers believes that the focus should be on providing good jobs in the information age. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation supports the President's proposal for a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, citing the need to address technology and talent issues in U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. Market failures, such as underinvestment in R&D and innovation, hinder the scale-up of innovative manufacturing processes. The lack of federal support for manufacturing-focused research activities in the U.S. is hindering the integration of manufacturing systems across supply chains. Foreign governments engage in various activities to attract manufacturing firms, while U.S. academia does not incentivize engineering advances and practical problem-solving. The U.S. academic engineering programs focus on \"originality and breakthroughs\" rather than practical problem-solving. Some argue that the U.S. manufacturing sector is strong and does not need the NNMI, citing growth in output and productivity. Manufacturing employment in the U.S. grew by 878,000 jobs between March 2010 and December 2015, with analysts attributing previous job losses to global technology and business trends. Some analysts and policymakers argue against the NNMI program, stating it may not be necessary due to global trends like offshoring and foreign competition in manufacturing. There is a debate on the federal government's role in supporting technological innovation and specific industries like manufacturing. Advocates and critics debate the federal government's role in supporting technological innovation and industries like manufacturing. Advocates argue for targeted federal investments in technologies for economic, national security, and societal benefits. Critics argue against favoring or subsidizing specific companies, industries, or technologies. Critics argue against government intervention in favoring or subsidizing specific companies, industries, or technologies, citing concerns about inefficient capital allocation, development of inferior technologies, political favoritism, and corporate welfare. Some believe the private sector should take on the role envisioned for government programs like the NNMI. Some critics argue against government intervention in favoring specific industries or technologies, citing concerns about inefficient capital allocation, political favoritism, and corporate welfare. They believe the private sector should take on the role envisioned for government programs like the NNMI. Supporters and opponents may prefer alternative approaches to support U.S. manufacturing, such as increasing federal funding for R&D or reducing taxes and regulations. Some may question the effectiveness of additional federal funding for the NNMI and its impact on U.S. manufacturing. Both proponents and opponents see the program as potentially leading to future funding increases and the creation of similar programs. The RAMI Act amends the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to establish the NNMI. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act establishes the NNMI program to improve U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, stimulate leadership in advanced manufacturing, facilitate technology transition, access to infrastructure, workforce development, and accelerate innovation. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act establishes the NNMI program to improve U.S. manufacturing competitiveness and accelerate innovation. It directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a Network for Manufacturing Innovation program at NIST to support the establishment of Institutes for Manufacturing Innovation (IMIs) that address challenges in advanced manufacturing and assist manufacturers in retaining or expanding. The NNMI program aims to address challenges in advanced manufacturing and help manufacturers retain or expand production and jobs in the US. It focuses on manufacturing processes, novel materials, enabling technologies, supply chain integration, and other aspects like nanotechnology, advanced ceramics, photonics, composites, and tool development for microelectronics. The program aims to improve US manufacturing competitiveness, attract nonfederal investment, and enable the commercial application of new technologies. It involves collaboration among industrial entities, research universities, and community colleges. The NNMI program aims to address challenges in advanced manufacturing by collaborating with various entities to conduct research, development, and demonstration projects to reduce the cost, time, and risk of commercializing new technologies. Activities of an IMI include research, development, and education programs to solve industrial problems with economic or national security implications. The RAMI Act focuses on developing innovative methodologies and practices for supply chain integration and introducing new technologies. It also includes outreach to small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises, as well as large manufacturing enterprises. Existing manufacturing institutes can be classified as an IMI for participation in the network. The RAMI Act incorporates existing manufacturing centers recognized as IMIs, but prohibits them from receiving financial assistance. The act authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to award financial assistance for planning, establishing, or supporting an IMI, with an open application process for all relevant advanced manufacturing areas. The RAMI Act allows the Secretary of Commerce to award financial assistance for establishing an IMI through a competitive merit-based review process. Political appointees are barred from peer review panels, and a conflict of interest policy must be implemented for transparency. Performance measures will assess funded activities. The RAMI Act requires the Secretary to collaborate with federal departments and agencies for IMI selections. Considerations include advancing domestic manufacturing, economic impact, and financial support from nonfederal sources. The IMI will need long-term federal funding and must show how it will increase nonfederal investment in advanced manufacturing research. It should engage with small and medium-sized enterprises to improve their capacity to commercialize new technologies and carry out educational activities to meet industrial needs. The IMI's focus should be on advancing economic competitiveness and generating benefits beyond direct participants. The RAMI Act outlines provisions for IMI funding, including limitations on financial assistance duration and total federal funding. Preference is given to IMIs seeking less than 50% federal assistance and exceptions may be made for large capital purchases. The RAMI Act authorizes NIST to use $5 million per year for FY2015-FY2024 from funds appropriated to its Industrial Technology Services account for the Network for Manufacturing Innovation program. The Department of Energy can transfer up to $250 million over the same period to NIST for advanced manufacturing R&D. Exceptions may be made for IMIs meeting goals, facing unforeseen circumstances, and identifying future nonfederal funding sources. The RAMI Act authorizes NIST to use funds for the Network for Manufacturing Innovation program, with the Secretary of Commerce overseeing the program and accepting funds from covered entities. The National Program Office within NIST is responsible for planning, management, and coordination of the program, entering into agreements with federal agencies, and developing a strategic plan within one year of the act's enactment. The RAMI Act directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a strategic plan for the Network for Manufacturing Innovation program within one year of enactment, updating it every three years. The plan should maximize cooperation with other federal departments and incorporate the NIST MEP for small and medium-sized entities. The Secretary is also tasked with creating a public information clearinghouse and acting as a network convener. Recommendations and advice are to be solicited for plan development. The RAMI Act directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a strategic plan for the Network for Manufacturing Innovation program, updating it every three years. Recommendations and advice are solicited from various stakeholders. The Secretary is also tasked with creating a public information clearinghouse and acting as a network convener. The act authorizes federal government employees to be detailed to the National Program Office without reimbursement. Mandated reports and audits are required, including annual reports by IMIs to the Secretary of Commerce. The RAMI Act mandates annual reports from recipients of federal assistance under the program to the Secretary of Commerce, detailing finances and performance of the IMIs. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on program performance, including summaries of IMI reports, funds expended, and assessments. The RAMI Act requires biennial assessments by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on the program's success, management, and industry utility, with a final assessment due by December 31, 2024. The assessments cover the overall performance of the program and its alignment with the act's purposes. The RAMI Act mandates biennial assessments by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on the program's success, management, and industry utility. The assessments include recommendations for legislative and administrative action to improve the program and evaluate the implementation of prior recommendations. Additional authorities allow the Secretary of Commerce to appoint personnel, enter contracts, and transfer funds to other federal agencies for program support. The RAMI Act allows funds to be used for financial assistance programs, with agencies accepting transferred funds from the Secretary of Commerce. It also authorizes the use of resources from covered entities. The Act applies 35 U.S.C. 18 to funding agreements for new or existing institutes. The Bayh-Dole Act, also known as the University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980, is part of the U.S. Code."
