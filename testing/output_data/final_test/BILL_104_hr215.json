    "content": "The Act titled \"Truth in Voting Act of 1995\" includes changes in discretionary spending limits, such as the creation of a Deficit Reduction Trust Fund. The \"Truth in Voting Act of 1995\" establishes the Deficit Reduction Trust Fund in the Treasury of the United States. The Fund consists of amounts from the deficit reduction lock box provision of appropriation Acts, which are transferred within 10 days of enactment. The moneys in the Fund are not available for appropriation, obligation, expenditure, or transfer. Additionally, the Act includes downward adjustments of discretionary spending limits. SEC. 102. DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS OF DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS. The discretionary spending limit for new budget authority for any fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount of budget authority transferred to the Fund, as calculated by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The adjusted discretionary spending limit for outlays for that fiscal year shall also be reduced accordingly. All reductions will occur on the same day as the transfers to the Fund. SEC. 103. DEFICIT REDUCTION LOCK-BOX PROVISIONS OF APPROPRIATION MEASURES. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to include deficit reduction lock-box provisions in appropriation bills. Sec. 314 requires any general appropriation bill marked up by the Committee on Appropriations to include a line item for 'Deficit Reduction Lock-box'. Any spending reductions proposed by a Member must be placed in this lock-box unless specified otherwise. The amendment allows for reductions to be placed in the deficit reduction lock-box, preventing modifications beyond the scope of the provision committed to the conference committee. A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents. SEC. 314. Deficit reduction lock-box provisions of appropriation measures. CBO will score all general appropriation measures passed by the House and Senate to facilitate compliance with section 314. TITLE II - MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS TO THE RULES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. Amendments to House Rules include a 5-day waiting period and a requirement for two-thirds approval for restrictive rules or waiving House rules. Amendments to House Rules require a two-thirds vote for waiving rules, banning King-of-the-Hill rules, and self-executing rules. The House Rules Committee reported a resolution that would automatically adopt motions, amendments, or bills without the need for separate votes. Rule XLIX of the House Rules is repealed, and conference committees are restricted from funding programs at higher levels than in the original bill. Rule XXVIII of the House of Representatives is amended to prevent the consideration of a conference report that would violate any motion to instruct conferees agreed to by the House. TITLE III--ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT IMPACT STATEMENTS\n\nSEC. 301. ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT IMPACT STATEMENTS. The Comptroller General of the United States is required to prepare an economic and employment impact statement for each bill, resolution, or conference report considered by the House of Representatives or the Senate. This statement must assess the potential increased costs to the private sector, individuals, or State and local governments over a 5-year period. The economic and employment impact statement required for each bill must assess costs to consumers, businesses, national employment, international competitiveness, State and local governments, Federal Government outlays, revenues, and impact on GDP. An exception allows for a brief summary assessment instead of a detailed assessment if needed. In lieu of a detailed assessment, a bill, resolution, or conference report may have a brief summary if the impact is less than $100,000 or 1,000 jobs. An economic and employment impact statement must accompany each legislation before being considered on the floor of either House. It is not allowed to consider any bill, resolution, or conference report without this statement. (f) Executive Regulations.--Each regulation and proposed regulation from a Federal department or executive agency must include an economic and employment impact statement. This statement, prepared according to subsection (b), must be published in the Federal Register alongside the regulation. Additionally, a waiver for a national security emergency can be granted. (g) Provision for National Security Emergency Waiver allows Congress to waive certain requirements during a declaration of war or national security emergency at the President's request. The President can also waive requirements in response to a national security emergency as determined in consultation with Congress. Additionally, Paragraph 11 of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate is repealed. TITLE IV--APPLICABILITY OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT\n\nSEC. 401. APPLICATION OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT TO THE CONGRESS.\n\nThe Congress and its instrumentalities are subject to the Freedom of Information Act to the same extent as Executive agencies."
