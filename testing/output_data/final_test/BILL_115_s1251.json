    "content": "The \"Portable Benefits for Independent Workers Pilot Program Act\" may be cited as the short title. Many independent workers in the US lack benefits and protections typically provided by traditional full-time employment. They include independent contractors, temporary workers, and self-employed individuals. Studies show a significant growth in the contingent workforce, with a large portion of employment growth occurring in alternative work arrangements. The growth in the United States economy from 2005 to 2015 was driven by an increase in alternative work arrangements, emphasizing the need for portable benefits for independent workers. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, eligible organization refers to State or local government or nonprofit organization, eligible work is work not in traditional full-time employment, eligible worker includes independent contractors, freelance workers, and portable benefits are work-related benefits that can be maintained by the worker. Portable benefits allow workers to maintain benefits when changing jobs, including contributions from entities or the worker themselves. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Labor. Work-related benefits encompass various protections for workers. Benefits refer to protections commonly provided to full-time employees, such as workers' compensation, skills training, disability coverage, health insurance, retirement savings, income security, and short-term savings. Establishment of portable benefits pilot program. The Secretary will award grants to eligible organizations for innovation and experimentation with portable benefits in fiscal year 2018. Grants can be used for improving existing models or creating new ones for providing portable benefits, with a restriction on using funds for retirement-related benefits. The Secretary will award grants to eligible organizations for innovation and experimentation with portable benefits in fiscal year 2018. Grants cannot be used for retirement-related benefits. The potential for national applicability of the model or approach will be considered in grant awards. Eligible organizations must submit applications to the Secretary to receive grants. The Comptroller General of the United States will evaluate grants awarded under section 4(a) by September 30, 2020, and report to Congress on their impact on worker compensation. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2018 includes $5,000,000 for grants under section 4(b)(1)(A) and $15,000,000 for grants under section 4(b)(1)(B), with funds remaining available until expended."
