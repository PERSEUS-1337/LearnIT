    "content": "The \"Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act\" amends limitations on customs and tax exemptions, extends the period for filing claims in certain proceedings, and allows claims after seizure. SEC. 4. CLAIM AFTER SEIZURE. Section 608 of the Tariff Act of 1930 is amended to address seizure, claims, and representation. Section 608 of the Tariff Act of 1930 allows for the filing of a claim within 60 days of a seizure of property under certain laws. The customs officer will then transmit the claim to the United States attorney for condemnation proceedings. If needed, court-appointed counsel can be provided for individuals filing claims regarding seized property. The court may appoint counsel for individuals who are financially unable to obtain representation for claims regarding seized property under certain laws. The compensation for appointed counsel will be equivalent to that provided under section 3006A of title 18, United States Code, and will be paid from the Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund. SEC. 5. BURDEN OF PROOF IN FORFEITURE PROCEEDINGS.\n\nAmends Section 615 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to shift the burden of proof to the Government in forfeiture proceedings, requiring clear and convincing evidence for property seizure cases related to imports or tonnage violations. SEC. 6. RELEASE OF SEIZED PROPERTY FOR SUBSTANTIAL HARDSHIP. Section 614 of the Tariff Act of 1930 is amended to allow for the immediate release of seized property if it would cause substantial hardship to the claimant. The claimant must request possession of the property from the customs officer and provide the basis for the release within 10 days. If a request is made for the release of seized property and it has not been released, the claimant can file a complaint in a district court with jurisdiction over forfeiture proceedings. The complaint must state the nature of the claim, reasons for hardship if possession is not returned, and steps taken to secure release from customs. The district court will then order the return of the property. The district court may order the return of seized property to the claimant if it is likely that the claimant has a possessory interest and continued possession by the government would cause substantial hardship. The court can impose conditions on the release to preserve the property for forfeiture, and must make a decision on the complaint within a specified time frame. The court must make a decision on a complaint within a specified time frame, typically 30 days after filing, unless extended by consent of parties or for good cause shown. SEC. 7. JUSTICE ASSETS FORFEITURE FUND. Amends Section 524(c) of title 28, United States Code to include payment of court-awarded compensation for representation of claimants. SEC. 8. CLARIFICATION REGARDING FORFEITURES UNDER THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT. Section 511(a)(7) of the Controlled Substances Act is amended to clarify forfeiture conditions. The amendments apply to claims and suits filed under the Tariff Act of 1930 after the enactment of this Act."
