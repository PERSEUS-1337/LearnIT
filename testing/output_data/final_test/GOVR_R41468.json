    "content": "The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is comprehensive legislation that provides broad nondiscrimination protection for individuals with disabilities in employment, public services, accommodations, transportation, and telecommunications. It mandates reasonable accommodations to make goods, services, and facilities accessible to individuals with disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) mandates reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities in various public entities. The Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations define service animals as trained dogs that perform tasks for individuals with disabilities. The DOJ regulations limit the definition of service animals to trained dogs, excluding other species due to concerns about disease transmission and unpredictable behavior. The DOJ regulations define a service animal as a dog trained to perform tasks for individuals with disabilities, such as assisting the blind, alerting the deaf, providing protection, and more. The DOJ emphasizes that for an animal to qualify as a service animal, it must be individually trained to perform tasks for individuals with disabilities. This includes recognizing a problem and responding to it, such as a service animal detecting a psychiatric episode and taking action to ensure safety. Animals that provide emotional support without specific training do not qualify as service animals. The DOJ distinguishes between service animals and comfort animals, noting that the ADA covers a broader range of public settings than the FHA or ACAA. While the definition is limited to dogs, miniature horses may be allowed in certain circumstances. Public entities and accommodations are required to make reasonable modifications to accommodate service animals. The DOJ requires public entities to make reasonable modifications to accommodate miniature horses trained to assist individuals with disabilities. Miniature horses are considered an alternative to dogs for those with allergies or religious beliefs against dogs, and their longer lifespan reduces replacement costs. Factors to consider include the horse's size, weight, control by the handler, and suitability for the facility. The handler must have control over the miniature horse, and its presence should not compromise safety requirements. Miniature horses may be excluded if they fundamentally alter the nature of programs or services. Public entities must allow individuals with disabilities to be accompanied by their service animal, including miniature horses. A public entity or place of public accommodation must allow service animals without surcharges. The animal must be under control, and the entity can ask for removal if the animal is out of control or not housebroken. The handler is responsible for the animal's behavior. A public entity or place of public accommodation must allow service animals without surcharges and ensure they are under control. If provocation or injury occurs, steps should be taken to prevent similar actions. The entity can ask two questions to determine if the animal is a service animal. The interaction between the ADA's requirements and other statutes like the Fair Housing Act is uncertain, especially in mixed-use facilities. The issue of conflicting service animal requirements for individuals with allergies and disabilities remains unresolved, awaiting judicial clarification. The ADA Amendments Act was at issue in Lockett v. Catalina Channel Express, Inc. Catalina Channel Express excluded animals from part of the ferry due to a passenger's request for an area free of animal dander. When a visually impaired individual with a guide dog tried to buy a ticket for that area, they were initially refused, although the policy was changed two weeks later. The court found that the ferry company had made a one-time reasonable judgment while investigating competing interests, leading to ambiguity in addressing conflicting claims for service animal accommodations."
