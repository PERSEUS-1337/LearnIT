Most recipients are retired or disabled workers, with benefits based on past earnings. Social Security has a significant impact on income support and poverty reduction for both young and old beneficiaries. However, current projections show that revenues may be insufficient to pay full benefits after 2035, making it a topic of interest for policymakers. Proposed changes to Social Security often focus on benefit computation rules. To qualify for Social Security benefits, a worker needs a sufficient history of earnings subject to payroll taxes. Insured status is based on quart ers of coverage earned, with one QC earned for every $1,360 of earnings in 2019. Workers must be fully insured with a minimum of 6 QCs and a maximum of 40 QCs to be eligible for most benefits. Retirement benefits can be claimed at 62 years old. To be eligible for Social Security retirement benefits at 62, a worker must have worked for 10 years and be fully insured with a minimum of 6 QCs and a maximum of 40 QCs. Benefits can also be paid to eligible survivors of fully insured workers. Disability benefits require workers to have earned 20 QCs in the 10 years before becoming disabled, with fewer QCs required for younger workers. International totalization agreements allow workers with work history in multiple countries to combine their earnings for eligibility. International totalization agreements help workers with careers in the US and certain countries combine work credits to qualify for Social Security benefits. The first step in computing benefits is determining the worker's average indexed monthly earnings (AIME), which updates past earnings to reflect growth in the economy. Earnings after 1950 are adjusted based on the national average wage index until two years before eligibility for benefits. For example, the average wage increased from $32,155 in 2000 to $41,674 in 2010. The AIME for retired workers is calculated based on the 35 highest years of indexed earnings, divided by 12 to convert to a monthly measure. If a worker dies before turning 62, the number of computation years is reduced below 35 by the years until they would have reached 62. Disabled workers' computation years depend on their age. The primary insurance amount (PIA) for disabled workers is determined by computing the AIME, which is divided into three brackets using bend points. The PIA is calculated based on fixed factors applied to the AIME brackets, making the benefit formula progressive. The PIA for retirement, disability, or death benefits in 2019 is determined based on covered earnings up to the maximum taxable amount. The benefit formula is progressive, with replacement rates remaining stable over time. A cost-of-living adjustment is applied to benefits starting in the second year. The cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits is applied starting in the second year of eligibility at age 63. The COLA is based on the growth in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) and beneficiaries will receive a 2.8% COLA in January 2019. The full retirement age (FRA) determines when a worker can receive the full Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) with any COLAs included. Retired workers can claim benefits at 62, but waiting results in a higher monthly benefit. The higher the delay in claiming Social Security benefits, the higher the monthly benefit to offset fewer payments over a lifetime. Actuarial reduction applies to early claimers, with a 6\u2154% reduction for the first three years and 5% for additional years. Delayed retirement credit increases benefits by 8% for each year after full retirement age, up to age 70. Monthly benefits range from 75% of PIA for those claiming at 62 to 132% for those waiting until 70. Claiming Social Security benefits at different ages can result in varying monthly benefits, with individuals who claim earlier receiving more payments over a lifetime. The increase in Full Retirement Age (FRA) can lead to lower benefits, with monthly benefits being different for individuals with different FRAs. For example, someone with an FRA of 66 claiming at 62 will receive 75% of the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), while someone with an FRA of 67 will receive 70% of the PIA. The scheduled increase in FRA from 66 to 67 can reduce monthly benefits by 6.1% to 7.7%. The increase in FRA from 66 to 67 will reduce monthly benefits by 6.1% to 7.7%. Lifetime benefits vary for workers with different FRAs, even if they have identical work histories and age of death. Social Security benefits can be payable to spouses, divorced spouses, dependent children, and parents of retired, disabled, or deceased workers. The base benefit for dependents is determined by a percentage of the worker's Primary Insurance Amount (PIA). Various benefit adjustments, such as the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO), may apply in certain situations. The Retirement Earnings Test can result in a withholding of benefits for beneficiaries below full retirement age with earnings above a certain level. The maximum family benefit limits benefits payable based on a worker's record. Some Social Security benefits may be subject to federal income tax, affecting beneficiaries' net income.
