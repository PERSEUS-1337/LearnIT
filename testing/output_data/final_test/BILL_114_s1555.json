    "content": "The Act titled \"Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2015\" recognizes the history of the Philippines and its fight for independence from Spanish colonial rule. The Treaty of Paris between the United States and Spain disregarded Filipino independence declaration, leading to clashes between Filipino nationalists and US forces during the Philippine-American War. The Philippine-American War from 1899 to 1902 led to the establishment of the United States civil government in the Philippines. Filipino soldiers were incorporated into the United States Army as the Philippine Scouts in 1901. The Philippine Independence Act of 1934 set a timetable for ending US colonial rule, with sovereignty over foreign policy retained until Philippine independence in 1946. President Manuel Quezon signed the National Defense Act in 1935. General Douglas MacArthur established an independent army in the Philippines, comprising a small regular force, the Philippine Constabulary, and reservists. By July 1941, the Philippine army had 130,000 reservists and 6,000 officers. President Franklin D. Roosevelt called into service all organized military forces of the Philippines in July 1941, leading to the establishment of the United States Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) in response to rising tensions with Japan. The United States Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) was established in Manila with General Douglas MacArthur as the commander. The first phase of absorbing the Philippine army into the USAFFE began on September 1, 1941, with 25,000 men and 4,000 officers. Filipinos who served in the USAFFE included the Philippine Scouts, the Philippine Commonwealth Army, the new Philippine Scouts, and Filipino civilians who volunteered in 1945 and 1946. On December 8th, 1941, Japanese forces attacked US Army bases in the Philippines, leading to the capture of over 78,000 members of the US Armed Forces, including Filipinos and service members. The new Philippine Scouts continued their wartime service until the end of 1946, gradually disbanding by 1950. The Japanese captured over 78,000 US and Filipino service members during the attack on US Army bases in the Philippines in 1941. They forced the captured soldiers to endure the infamous Bataan Death March, where nearly 700 Americans and 6,000 to 10,000 Filipinos died. After the fall of Bataan, the Japanese targeted Corregidor, resulting in 800 deaths, 1,000 wounded, and 11,000 captured soldiers who were marched through Manila to various POW camps. During World War II, after the fall of Corregidor, captured troops were either distributed to POW camps or escaped to join guerrilla armies. Filipino resistance fighters raided Japanese camps, sabotaged troops, and continued to fight against Japanese forces, with an estimated 300,000 Filipinos resisting until the return of US Armed Forces in 1944. During World War II, Filipino guerrillas worked to restore communication with US forces in the Pacific, providing valuable intelligence to General MacArthur's headquarters. This included Japanese naval plans and information on aircraft, ship, and troop movements, allowing Allied forces to attack Japanese supply lines. President Roosevelt signed an important document on December 20, 1941. During World War II, President Roosevelt signed the Selective Training and Service Amendments Act, allowing Filipinos in the US to enlist in the Armed Forces. Subsequently, 16,000 Filipinos in California alone decided to enlist, leading to the activation of the First Filipino Infantry Battalion and Regiment in California. The Second Filipino Infantry Regiment was activated at Fort Ord, California on November 21, 1942. Nearly 9,000 Filipinos and Filipino Americans fought in the United States Army 1st and 2nd Filipino Infantry Regiments, participating in combat operations in New Guinea, Leyte, Samar, Luzon, and the Southern Philippines. In 1943, 800 men from the regiments were sent to Australia for training in intelligence gathering, sabotage, and demolition, and later reorganized as part of the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion to coordinate with guerrilla armies in the Philippines. Members of the 1st Regiment also worked with the United States 6th Army \"Alamo Scouts\" reconnaissance group. During World War II, Filipino guerrillas provided crucial information for the liberation of Allied prisoners from the Cabanatuan death camp and Santo Tomas POW camp. The 2nd Filipino Infantry Battalion played a key role in intelligence missions and civil affairs operations. Filipinos participated in the war out of national pride. During World War II, Filipinos participated in the war out of national pride and commitment to the Allied forces struggle against fascism. 57,000 Filipinos in uniform died in the war effort, with estimates of civilian deaths ranging from 700,000 to upwards of 1,000,000. Despite being initially entitled to full veterans benefits, the guarantee was reversed by the Rescission Acts of 1946. The loyal and valiant Filipino Veterans of World War II fought alongside the United States Armed Forces, but were denied benefits due to the Rescission Acts of 1946. They fought, suffered, and died in the same manner as other US forces, defending their country under the same commander. The Filipino Veterans of World War II fought alongside the United States Armed Forces, defending and liberating sovereign territory. The United States acknowledges their bravery, valor, and patriotism. The term \"Filipino Veterans of World War II\" includes individuals who served honorably from July 26, 1941, to December 31, 1946, under the command of the United States Armed Forces in the Far East. The Filipino Veterans of World War II, including various military units, are recognized for their dedicated service. The President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives will arrange for the award of a single gold medal to honor their bravery and patriotism. The Secretary of the Treasury will strike the Gold Medal for this purpose. The Secretary will strike a Gold Medal with emblems for Filipino Veterans of World War II. The medal will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research. Congress suggests displaying it at other relevant locations. The Secretary may also create and sell bronze duplicates under regulations. The Gold Medal struck under this Act will cover costs including labor, materials, and overhead expenses. Sale of duplicate medals will deposit funds into the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. Medals are considered national medals and numismatic items under the Act. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
