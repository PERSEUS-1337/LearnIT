    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Future of the Nunn-Lugar Program Act of 2017\". The Cooperative Threat Reduction program, established in 1991 by Senators Richard Lugar and Sam Nunn, funded and secured nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons in former Soviet Union states. Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan implemented the program, improving security at nuclear facilities and removing nuclear warheads within three years. The Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Domestic Preparedness Initiative expanded on the goals of the Cooperative Threat Reduction program by training civilians to assist after a mass destruction attack. Recent funding has focused on export and border control programs, detecting radiological weapons, and disposing of chemical weapons in Libya. The United States participated in the removal of chemical weapons from Syria through the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program. New partnerships and strategies will be needed to address evolving threats from weapons of mass destruction. SEC. 3. ASSESSMENT ON THE FUTURE OF COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION. The Secretary of Defense will assess current, anticipated, and future requirements for cooperative threat reduction within 30 days of the Act's enactment. A federally funded research and development center will conduct the assessment and be provided with necessary information and resources. An interim report is due one year after the Act's enactment. The federally funded research and development center will submit an interim report on the assessment within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The final report will include a detailed discussion on reducing threats of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, as well as identifying capability gaps for cooperative threat reduction efforts. The interim report on the assessment will include recommendations for modernizing the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and the command and control enterprise. Other relevant matters will also be addressed in the report. The Secretary must submit reports to Congress within seven days of receiving them. Cooperative threat reduction is defined as activities specified in the Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction Act."
