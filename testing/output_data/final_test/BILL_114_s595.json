The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits baiting of migratory game birds by defining a baited area as any place where salt, grain, or feed is used to attract these birds. Baiting means the direct manipulation of a standing, unharvested crop through activities like mowing, discing, or rolling, unless it is a normal agricultural practice. An area is not considered baited if it has been treated with a normal agricultural practice, has standing crops that have not been manipulated, or has standing crops that have been flooded.
