    "title": "AB 279",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 19551.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow tax officials of cities, counties, or city and counties to enter into reciprocal agreements with the Franchise Tax Board to exchange tax information for administration purposes. The information shared is limited as specified in the agreement. Tax officials of cities, counties, or city and counties can receive limited tax information from the Franchise Tax Board for taxpayers within their jurisdiction who report income from a trade or business. The information shared includes the taxpayer's name, address, social security or taxpayer identification number, and business activity code. This information is restricted to use by authorized employees of the taxing authority and must be safeguarded as per Franchise Tax Board requirements. Tax officials must complete a data exchange security questionnaire, allow for an onsite safeguard review, undergo disclosure training, and sign a confidentiality statement to access taxpayer information from the Franchise Tax Board. Employees with access to this information must acknowledge data security requirements and penalties for unauthorized access or disclosure. Tax officials must report any unauthorized access or disclosure of tax information to the Franchise Tax Board promptly. Records must be destroyed to prevent individual identification within a specified timeframe. Information provided by the Franchise Tax Board can only be used for tax enforcement purposes. Section 19542.1 is applicable to this regulation. The Franchise Tax Board must receive payment for first year costs before providing information to a city, county, or city and county. This includes equipment, process development, and labor expenses. An agreement has been made for the city, county, or city and county to reimburse the Franchise Tax Board for annual costs incurred. The Board has received payment for first-year costs. Tax officials can request information from the Board by affidavit, excluding specific tax information. This section does not affect any other laws and allows cities, counties, or city and counties to obtain taxpayer information through other legal means. It also clarifies that it does not impact obligations, rights, or remedies related to personal information under state or federal law. The Franchise Tax Board may waive reimbursement costs for a city, county, or city and county if they enter into a reciprocal agreement. The agreement must specify that each party bears its own costs for data exchange. This section is in effect until January 1, 2019, and will be repealed after that date. Section 19551.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended. Section 19551.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require cities, counties, or city and counties to submit business tax and license information to the Franchise Tax Board annually upon request. The information collected includes business name, mailing address, and ownership details. Business tax and license information must be submitted annually to the Franchise Tax Board, including business mailing address, federal employer identification number or owner's social security number, SIC or NAICS code, start and cease dates, account/license number, and ownership type in machine-readable form as per regulations. Cities must provide requested information to the Franchise Tax Board by December 31, 2009, annually and in the prescribed form. The data provided is subject to Section 19542 and can only be used for state tax enforcement or as authorized by law. If a city, county, or city and county has a reciprocal agreement with the Franchise Tax Board, they must waive reimbursement for costs to provide required information and cannot seek reimbursement as specified in a specific statute. The agreement states that each party bears its own costs for exchanging data authorized by certain sections, and the Franchise Tax Board cannot seek reimbursement as specified in another section. A city, county, or city and county is not obligated to share information with the Franchise Tax Board if the Board fails to reciprocate. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2019. No reimbursement is required by this act under the California Constitution because any costs incurred by a local agency or school district would be due to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
