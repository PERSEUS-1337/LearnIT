Section 830.9 of the Penal Code is also amended. Section 830.9 of the Penal Code is amended to allow animal control officers to exercise powers of arrest and serve warrants if they complete a training course. Officers appointed before July 1, 2016, must complete the training by July 1, 2017, unless their agency prohibits firearm use. Animal control officers appointed before January 1, 2016, with no break in employment longer than three years are deemed to have met training requirements.

Firearms training is not required for officers whose agency prohibits firearm use. Animal control officers appointed after July 1, 2016, must complete a training course on powers of arrest and serving warrants within one year of appointment.
