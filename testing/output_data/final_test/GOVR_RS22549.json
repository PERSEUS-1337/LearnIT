    "content": "The Older Americans Act (OAA) was first enacted in 1965 and is the main federal program for providing social and nutrition services to older individuals. OAA grant funds are distributed to states and other entities through various titles, funding programs such as supportive services, congregate and home-delivered nutrition services, caregiver support, community service employment, and elder rights protection activities. The Older Americans Act (OAA) provides services to prevent abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older persons, including grants for nutrition and supportive services for Native Americans. The act has been reauthorized multiple times, with the most recent in 2016 (P.L. 114-144) authorizing appropriations for OAA programs through FY2019. Funding for OAA-authorized activities continued through FY2016 after the authorizations expired in FY2011. States, U.S. territories, and tribal organizations receive funding for most OAA programs. The Older Americans Act (OAA) provides funding to states, U.S. territories, and tribal organizations based on population factors. Statutory requirements include a \"hold harmless\" provision to guarantee funding levels. Title III authorizes grants to State Units on Aging (SUAs) and Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) to advocate for and coordinate programs for individuals aged 60 and older. The Administration on Aging (AOA) allocates Title III funds to State Units on Aging (SUAs), which then distribute funds to over 600 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) based on a state-developed funding formula. This formula considers the geographical distribution of older individuals and those with the greatest economic and social need, with approval from the Assistant Secretary for Aging. The Older Americans Act's Title III funds are allocated by the Administration on Aging to State Units on Aging, which then distribute funds to over 600 Area Agencies on Aging. Discretionary spending under Title III accounts for 73% of the act's total FY2019 appropriations, with states receiving separate allotments for six programs. States must provide matching shares for some programs, while others do not require a match. The funding formula for six Title III programs under the Older Americans Act is calculated separately for each program. The formulas for supportive services, senior centers, nutrition services, and health promotion services have been contentious during OAA reauthorizations in 2000, 2006, and 2016. Appendices provide a legislative history and analysis of population data. Appendix B analyzes state-based population data for U.S. population age 60 and older for Title III programs. Appendix C compares FY2016 allotment amounts with actual allotment amounts for FY2017 to FY2019. State allotments are based on population formula factors. Total U.S. population aged 60 and older includes all states, D.C., Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories. The U.S. Census provides annual population estimates with a two-year time lag for state allotments based on the population aged 60 and older. States receive a minimum amount of funds based on the \"small state minimum\" criteria, ensuring equitable distribution of grant appropriations. Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands each have specific minimum allotments. The Mariana Islands are each allotted no less than 0.0625% of the total grant amount. The OAA Reauthorization Act of 2016 Amendments reduces state and U.S. territory hold harmless amounts by 1% each fiscal year. The Nutrition Services Incentives Program provides funds to states, territories, and Indian tribal organizations for food purchases. The Nutrition Services Incentives Program (NSIP) provides funds to states, territories, and tribal organizations for food purchases through the USDA. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) offers services for caregivers in areas such as health resources, counseling, respite care, and supplemental services. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) complements care provided by family and other caregivers through various services. Funds for NFCSP are allocated to states based on the population aged 70 years and older. Title V authorizes the Community Service Employment for Older Americans Program (CSEOA), administered by the Department of Labor. Title V, administered by the Department of Labor, is the only federally subsidized employment program for low-income individuals aged 55 and older. It received $400 million in FY2019, representing 20% of the act's total discretionary funding. There is a 10% nonfederal match requirement for grant activities. Funds are allocated to state agencies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories, as well as national grantees. Grant allotments are determined separately for each state based on grant type. The 2016 OAA reauthorization did not change the Title V funding formula. The 2016 OAA reauthorization did not revise the Title V funding formula, which had been a past issue for Congress. The allocation of funds to states under the Title V formula includes specific reservations for demonstration projects, pilot projects, evaluation projects, and grants to certain territories. The 2016 OAA reauthorization maintains the Title V funding formula, with reservations for specific projects and grants to territories. Remaining funds are allocated to state and national grantees based on program funding levels, with adjustments made if funds exceed or fall below FY2000 levels. Up to $35 million of any excess funds is distributed between state and national grantees. The 2016 OAA reauthorization maintains the Title V funding formula, with reservations for specific projects and grants to territories. Excess funds are distributed between state and national grantees, with 25% provided to all national grantees and the remaining amount over $35 million split 50/50. Funding levels for grants are determined based on a formula considering a state's population aged 55 and older and per capita income relative to other states. The U.S. Census provides population estimates, while per capita income data is from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. State allotments are determined based on two criteria: a minimum grant allotment of 0.5% and a \"hold harmless\" provision. States receive allotments in proportion to their FY2000 levels if grant amounts exceed those levels. Title VI authorizes funds for supportive and nutrition services to older Native Americans through grants awarded directly to tribal organizations. Eligibility requires representation of at least 50 Native American elders aged 60 or older. In FY2017, grants were awarded to 270 tribal organizations representing 400 Indian tribes. FY2019 funding for supportive and nutrition services grants is $34.2 million, while funding for the Native American caregiver program is $10.1 million. In FY2019, grants for supportive and nutrition services to older Native Americans total $34.2 million, with an additional $10.1 million allocated for the Native American caregiver program. Tribal organizations do not need to match these grant funds. Formula grants are awarded for nutrition and supportive services, as well as family caregiver support services, based on the population of Native Americans aged 60 and over in their service area. Tribal organization allotments must adhere to a FY1991 \"hold harmless\" provision. If funds exceed the FY1991 amount, grant amounts are adjusted to match previous funding levels. Title VII authorizes the Long-Term Care (LTC) Ombudsman Program and elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation prevention programs. Funding for the LTC Ombudsman and Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation Prevention Programs totals $21.7 million for FY2019, with no state matching requirement. Funds are allotted based on each state's share of the population aged 60 and older. The law requires states to receive a minimum amount of funds for determining state allotments, based on a percentage of the total grant appropriation for the fiscal year. Different territories have varying minimum allotments. State allotments must also adhere to a \"hold harmless\" provision. Funds can be awarded to various organizations for administration. The Older Americans Act (OAA) Title III funding formula underwent changes in 1973, shifting to base allocations on states' populations aged 60 and over instead of 65 and over. Minimum allotments were adjusted, with states receiving no less than 0.5% of total funds appropriated, and territories like Guam and American Samoa receiving specific percentages. These changes were in effect until 1973. The 1973 amendments to the Older Americans Act changed the funding formula to base allocations on states' populations aged 60 and over. Minimum allotments were adjusted, with specific percentages allocated to territories like Guam and American Samoa. In 1978, amendments further modified the minimum funding amounts for American Samoa and added a minimum for the Northern Marianas. The hold harmless amount was also changed to ensure states received no less than they did in FY1978. Amendments in 1984 required states to receive no less than their FY1984 funding for subsequent fiscal years. The 1992 amendments to the Older Americans Act moved the hold harmless reference year to FY1987. The Title III funding formula has been a point of controversy in recent congressional attempts to reauthorize the Act, with concerns about its consistency with statutory requirements and accuracy in reflecting aging trends in the U.S. The Title III funding formula in the Older Americans Act has been a contentious issue in congressional debates. The 2000 OAA reauthorization saw changes to the formula after concerns were raised about its accuracy in distributing funds based on the older population in each state. The 2000 OAA reauthorization made changes to the Title III funding formula in response to concerns about its accuracy in distributing funds based on the older population in each state. The changes included allotting funds based on the most recent population data, implementing an FY2000 \"hold harmless\" requirement, and creating a \"guaranteed growth\" provision for all states. During the 2006 OAA reauthorization debate, Congress revisited the Title III funding formula, including the \"hold harmless\" requirement and \"guaranteed growth\" provision. These provisions ensured that all states received a share of any increase above the FY2000 appropriation, leading to divisions among Members representing states with different population growth rates. The OAA 2006 Amendments changed the funding formula to ensure every state receives at least its FY2006 amount and phased out the \"guaranteed growth\" provision gradually from FY2008 onwards. The OAA 2006 Amendments changed the funding formula to ensure every state receives at least its FY2006 amount and phased out the \"guaranteed growth\" provision gradually from FY2008 onwards. The Title III funding formula for supportive services, senior centers, nutrition programs, and health promotion services was a major point of contention during the 2016 OAA reauthorization debate in Congress. Legislation introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to extend authorizations of appropriations through FY2018 for most OAA programs. The Senate HELP Committee ordered S. 1562 reported favorably with an amendment in the nature of a substitute for OAA programs. Two OAA reauthorization bills (H.R. 3850 and H.R. 4122) were introduced in the House of Representatives but saw no further legislative action. GAO examined OAA statutory funding formulas, suggesting modifications to better address state differences in elderly population needs, service costs, and state capacity. The GAO found that current formulas for OAA services could better target those with the \"greatest economic need\" and \"greatest social need\" by using data on older individuals' functional limitations. Revisions to the statutory formula may be challenging, but options like phasing in implementation over several years or instituting funding floors or ceilings could help. Senator Richard Burr introduced an amendment in the 113th Congress to amend OAA statutory funding formulas. In FY2006, the hold harmless provision for Title III Part B, Part C, and Part D of the Older Americans Act was rejected. Senator Tom Harkin announced further examination of the funding formula by a Senate bipartisan workgroup. The bill was reported out of committee but did not receive Senate consideration. In the 114th Congress, the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2015 (S. 192) was introduced, authorizing appropriations for OAA programs from FY2016 to FY2018 with amendments to the funding formula for supportive services and senior centers. The Senate HELP Committee approved changes to the funding formula for various services under Title III of the Older Americans Act. S. 192 was passed by the Senate in July 2015 and by the House in March 2016 with amendments for appropriations from FY2017 to FY2019. The hold harmless provision was adjusted to reduce its impact from FY2017 through FY2019, with a freeze for FY2020 and beyond unless amended. President Barack Obama signed P.L. 114-144, the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016, on April 19, 2016. This law changed funding allocations for OAA Title III, Parts B, C, and D by reducing state and U.S. territory hold harmless amounts by 1% annually for three years, with a freeze in place for FY2020 and beyond unless amended. The policy change under the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 minimizes funding reductions to no more than 1% annually for states receiving allotments based on their FY2006 hold harmless amount. Population trends for individuals aged 60 and older are shown in Table B-1, using data from the U.S. Census for selected years, with a two-year lag between population estimates and appropriation years. The FY2019 state allotments are calculated based on 2017 estimates of the population aged 60 and older. The \"% Age 60+\" column represents the entities' share of the 60+ population, used to determine state allotments under OAA Title III, Parts B, C, and D and Title VII. The final column in Table B-1 shows the percentage point change in the population formula factor for each state and U.S. territory from 2000 to 2017. Out of 56 states and U.S. territories, 29 saw an increase in the population formula factor, with Texas, California, Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona experiencing the greatest increases. Pennsylvania had the greatest decline at -0.85%. The Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-144) analyzed the formula change in FY2016 allotment amounts for states and entities compared to FY2017 to FY2019. Tables provided results for various programs, showing the impact of the funding formula change on allotments. The Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-144) analyzed the formula change in FY2016 allotment amounts for states and entities compared to FY2017 to FY2019. The tables show the percentage change in allotments and the types of allotments entities receive under the new funding formula. The statutory funding formula, combined with increases in appropriated funding amounts, reduces the effect of hold harmless over time. In FY2017, 16 states and territories received an allotment based on their FY2006 hold harmless level for the congregate nutrition services program. The number of states receiving funding based on hold harmless remained at 4 in FY2018 with a 10% increase in the total allotment amount compared to the prior year. As hold harmless amounts are gradually reduced by 1% over three fiscal years, more states and territories receive funding based on their hold harmless amount. The change to the statutory funding formula, along with increased appropriated funding, allows for redistribution of funding from hold harmless reductions to states and territories based on population factors. This resulted in more states and territories receiving funding based on their population aged 60 and over in FY2016. Total funding for supportive services, senior centers, disease prevention, and health promotion programs in FY2016 was below FY2006 levels. The number of entities receiving funding based on hold harmless decreased from FY2017 to FY2018. In FY2018, the number of states receiving funding for supportive services decreased from 29 to 10, and for disease prevention from 28 to 0. The funding amounts remained the same from FY2018 to FY2019, with a slight increase in entities receiving funding based on hold harmless to 12 for supportive services and 9 for disease prevention. Funding for home-delivered nutrition services had a smaller effect due to a funding formula change. All states received funding based on population age 60 and older or the minimum grant amount in FY2018 and FY2019."
