    "content": "The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has been in effect since January 1, 1994, signed by President George H. W. Bush in 1992 and approved by Congress in 1993. President Trump has expressed interest in renegotiating NAFTA and imposing tariffs on products from Mexico. This report outlines NAFTA's provisions, economic effects, and policy implications. The U.S. Trade Representative notified Congress of intent to renegotiate NAFTA with Canada and Mexico. Key trade issues include economic effects, impact on relations, demands from Canada and Mexico, and modernizing the agreement. Withdrawal from TPP also a concern for some NAFTA participants. Some TPP participants consider moving forward on a similar agreement without the United States, impacting U.S. competitiveness and NAFTA renegotiation. Trade experts credit NAFTA and FTAs for boosting trade, efficiency, lower consumer prices, and better living standards. However, others criticize FTAs for job losses, lower wages, and insufficient labor and environmental standards. NAFTA influenced subsequent U.S. trade agreements and multilateral negotiations. The NAFTA agreement influenced multilateral negotiations and initiated a new generation of trade agreements in the Western Hemisphere and other parts of the world. The United States currently has 14 FTAs with 20 countries, which have been supported or criticized on similar arguments related to jobs. Economic integration in North America was not a new concept, with previous agreements dating back to 1911 and 1965. Canada signed the U.S.-Canada Automotive Products Agreement, creating an integrated North American automotive sector. Mexico had already begun liberalizing its economy before NAFTA negotiations. The United States and Canada signed the bilateral Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) in 1987, the first economically significant bilateral FTA for the U.S. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the United States and Canada was a significant moment for Canada in 1988. It led to a \"free trade election\" where Prime Minister Brian Mulroney defeated John Turner. The FTA was passed by Parliament in December 1988 and came into effect on January 1, 1989. It eliminated tariffs by 1998, phased out remaining tariffs in 5-10 years, and included groundbreaking provisions. The Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Canada, implemented in 1988, eliminated tariffs by 1998 and included provisions for national treatment, liberalized financial services trade, facilitated cross-border travel for business professionals, and resolved disputes through a binding binational panel. It also prohibited import and export restrictions on energy products. The Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Canada in 1988 eliminated tariffs by 1998 and prohibited import/export restrictions on energy products. NAFTA expanded on these provisions but introduced new elements like Intellectual Property Rights and Cultural Exemptions. Transportation services and investment in the Canadian energy sector were excluded from the FTA but limited in NAFTA. Trade remedies were not eliminated in either agreement, meeting a key Canadian goal. NAFTA introduced a dispute settlement mechanism for trade remedy decisions, but it did not address the ongoing softwood lumber issue. Canada was able to exempt its agriculture supply management system and allow a small increase in dairy, poultry, and egg imports. Mexico had already started liberalizing its trade and investment policies before NAFTA negotiations began. Mexico began liberalizing its trade and investment policies in the mid-1980s, shifting from a protected economy to one of the most open in the world. This included joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1986 and reducing maximum tariff rates to 50%. Mexico now has 12 FTAs with 46 countries. Mexico continued its trade liberalization efforts by reducing its highest tariff rate from 100% to 20% and lowering its trade-weighted average tariff to about 19% in 1989. Despite ongoing reforms, barriers for U.S. exports remained high, with Mexico still requiring import licenses on 230 products from the United States, affecting 7% of U.S. exports. Additionally, about 60% of U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico required import licenses. Mexico also had nontariff barriers like \"official import prices\" that inflated duty assessments. An FTA with the U.S. was seen as a way for Mexico to solidify its market opening reforms. The United States helped Mexico lock in market-opening reforms after the debt crisis of the 1980s. An FTA with the U.S. prevented rollbacks of reforms, boosted imports, and increased investment confidence to attract foreign investment and spur economic growth. NAFTA also helped deflect protectionist demands in Mexico. Since NAFTA's entry into force, Mexico has used it as a model for other FTAs. The agreement provided the U.S. with an opportunity to expand exports to a growing market and improve bilateral relations. It also supported political pluralism and democratic processes in Mexico. NAFTA provided the United States and Canada with greater access to the Mexican market, creating one of the largest single markets in the world. Key provisions included trade liberalization, rules of origin, services trade, foreign investment, intellectual property rights protection, and dispute resolution. Labor and environmental provisions were addressed in separate side agreements. The NAFTA agreement gradually eliminated tariffs and non-tariff barriers on goods traded within North America over 15 years. Some tariffs were removed immediately, while others phased out over 5 to 15 years. Certain sectors had longer phase-out schedules. Safeguard provisions allowed for tariff increases or quotas in case of harm to domestic producers. All existing drawback programs were terminated by January 1, 2001. The NAFTA agreement resulted in the removal of tariffs and quotas on imports from Mexico to the United States and Canada. Mexican tariffs were higher than those of the United States, leading to an expectation of increased U.S. exports. In 1993, over 50% of U.S. imports from Mexico entered duty-free, while the United States faced higher tariffs and non-tariff barriers on exports to Mexico. NAFTA eliminated trade barriers between the United States and Mexico, with Mexico's average tariff on U.S. products at 11%. Significant changes occurred in textiles, apparel, automotive, and agriculture industries. NAFTA phased out duties on textile and apparel goods over 10 years, with Mexico previously imposing tariffs of 16% on U.S. products. In the automotive sector, NAFTA phased out Mexico's restrictive auto decree. NAFTA phased out U.S. tariffs on imports from Mexico and Mexican tariffs on U.S. and Canadian automotive products, with specific content requirements. Prior to NAFTA, the U.S. imposed tariffs on Mexican imports, while Mexican tariffs on U.S. and Canadian automotive products were also in place. NAFTA eliminated non-tariff barriers in agriculture trade between Mexico and the United States, converting them to tariff-rate quotas or ordinary tariffs. Tariffs were phased out over 15 years, with sensitive products like sugar and corn having longer phase-out periods. About half of U.S.-Mexico agricultural trade became duty-free under the agreement. Prior to NAFTA, some U.S. exports to Mexico faced tariffs as high as 12%, and a quarter of U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico were subject to restrictive import licensing requirements. The NAFTA services provisions established rules and obligations in services trade among partner countries, granting certain rights to services providers. Exclusions and reservations were made by each country, such as maritime shipping for the United States, film and publishing for Canada, and oil and gas drilling for Mexico. While NAFTA liberalized certain service sectors in Mexico, other sectors were minimally affected. In telecommunications services, NAFTA partners agreed to exclude the provision of basic telecommunications services but granted a \"bill of rights\" for providers and users. This included access to public telecommunications services, connection to private lines at economic costs, and the right to choose terminal equipment. NAFTA did not require authorization for foreign providers to operate in telecommunications or bar parties from maintaining monopoly providers like Telmex in Mexico. NAFTA included provisions on foreign investment, intellectual property rights, dispute resolution, and government procurement. It removed investment barriers, provided protections for investors, and allowed for dispute settlement. The agreement also addressed non-discriminatory treatment for foreign investment in certain sectors, with exceptions for the energy sector in Mexico and Canada's cultural industries. NAFTA built upon existing international intellectual property treaties to set enforceable commitments on copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. Dispute settlement procedures included arbitration and separate provisions for antidumping disputes. Government procurement was opened up under NAFTA. NAFTA opened up federal government procurement to suppliers from other member countries on a nondiscriminatory basis, with limitations for state-owned enterprises. The agreement did not include labor or environmental provisions, leading to concerns from policymakers and criticism from labor and environmental groups. President Clinton addressed these concerns shortly after taking office. President Clinton addressed labor and environmental issues by negotiating side agreements with Canada and Mexico shortly after taking office. The NAFTA implementing legislation included provisions for U.S. participation in labor and environmental commissions, as well as adjustment assistance programs to ease trade-related pressures. The North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC) and the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) entered into force on January 1, 1994, along with NAFTA. These agreements aimed to promote cooperation on labor and environmental matters. The side agreements associated with NAFTA included provisions for labor and environmental cooperation, as well as dispute settlement processes with monetary assessments and sanctions for non-compliance. These agreements marked the first time such provisions were included in an FTA, offering an opportunity for cross-border cooperation on environmental and labor issues. Additionally, a bilateral side agreement between the United States and Mexico focused on border environmental cooperation and infrastructure projects along the U.S.-Mexico border. The agreement established the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC) and the North American Development Bank (NADBank) to develop environmental infrastructure projects along the U.S.-Mexico border. These projects provide border residents with improved access to drinking water, sewer, and wastewater treatment. In December 2014, a merger of BECC and NADBank was approved, but not yet completed. The merger of two organizations, approved but not completed, is under scrutiny. Economists believe trade liberalization boosts economic growth, despite short-term costs. NAFTA linked wealthy countries with a developing one, sparking debate among various stakeholders. Proponents argue for job creation and income equality, while opponents fear job losses to Mexico. Estimating trade agreement impacts is complex. Estimating the economic impact of trade agreements like NAFTA is challenging due to data limitations and theoretical complexities. Studies show mixed results on NAFTA's effects, with some indicating benefits while others point to costs for U.S. workers. Trade liberalization is generally believed to promote economic growth, but winners and losers exist. Factors beyond NAFTA, such as the peso devaluation and recession in Mexico, also influence trade patterns in North America since 1994. Since NAFTA took effect in 1993, U.S. trade with its NAFTA partners has more than tripled, growing faster than trade with the rest of the world. In 2011, trilateral trade among NAFTA partners reached $1 trillion. By 2016, Canada became the leading market for U.S. exports, with Mexico ranking second. Together, Canada and Mexico accounted for 34% of total U.S. exports in 2016. In terms of imports, Canada and Mexico ranked second and third as suppliers of U.S. imports. In 2016, Canada and Mexico were the second and third largest suppliers of U.S. imports, accounting for 26% of total imports. NAFTA accelerated U.S.-Mexico trade, but economic growth patterns also influenced trade levels. Economic downturns in 2001 and 2009 contributed to declines in U.S. exports to and imports from Canada and Mexico. Trade in crude oil and petroleum products is a significant aspect of U.S. trade with both countries. Excluding these products from the trade balance would impact the deficit with NAFTA. In 2016, U.S. imports from NAFTA partners included motor vehicles, crude petroleum oil, motor vehicle parts, computer hardware, and motor vehicles for the transport of goods. U.S. exports to NAFTA partners consisted of motor vehicle parts, non-crude petroleum oil products, motor vehicles, office machinery parts, and motor vehicles for the transport of goods. U.S. trade with Canada more than doubled in the first decade of the FTA/NAFTA, reaching $362.2 billion by 1999. Total trade with Canada peaked at $600.6 billion in 2008 but fell to $430.9 billion during the financial crisis in 2009. The U.S. has had a trade deficit with Canada since the FTA/NAFTA era, which increased to $78.3 billion in 2008 before decreasing to $11.2 billion in 2016. In 2016, the trade deficit with Canada decreased to $11.2 billion. The United States had a surplus of $27.4 billion in services trade with Canada in 2015. U.S. private services exports to Canada increased from $17.0 billion in 1993 to $56.4 billion in 2015. U.S. exports to Mexico increased from $41.6 billion in 1993 to $231.0 billion in 2016, while imports from Mexico increased from $39.9 billion in 1993 to $294.2 billion in 2016. The trade deficit with Mexico decreased to $63.2 billion in 2016, with a surplus of $9.6 billion in services trade. U.S. private services exports to Mexico increased from $10.4 billion in 1993 to $31.5 billion in 2015. NAFTA had a relatively small overall effect on the U.S. economy due to trade with Mexico and Canada being less than 5% of GDP at the time. The impact of NAFTA on the U.S. economy was relatively small as trade with Mexico and Canada accounted for less than 5% of GDP. It is challenging to separate the effects of NAFTA from other factors, and a 2003 report estimated that it likely increased annual U.S. GDP by only a few billion dollars. Certain industries, like textiles, apparel, and automotive, were more affected by the removal of trade barriers. The USITC studies on the effects of NAFTA highlighted the challenges in isolating its impact from other factors. Estimates suggest a small increase in U.S. GDP of 0.1% to 0.5% upon full implementation. NAFTA led to increased trade volumes for all three countries, a slight rise in U.S. welfare, and minimal changes in U.S. employment. The 2016 USITC report found that NAFTA had minimal impact on U.S. wages, with some industries experiencing wage depression while others saw increases. Economists credit NAFTA for helping U.S. manufacturing industries, like the auto industry, become more competitive through economic integration and supply chain development. Increased U.S.-Mexico trade was driven by specialization and manufacturing efficiency, leading to supply chains crossing national boundaries. The importance of input-output linkages in trade agreements, such as NAFTA, is often overlooked. Trade between the United States and its NAFTA partners involves production sharing and vertical supply relationships, especially along the U.S.-Mexico border. This has led to increased efficiency in manufacturing and the creation of goods through collaboration across national boundaries. The U.S.-Mexico border region has become a crucial production site due to increased exports to Mexico and the return flow of finished products. U.S. manufacturing industries heavily rely on Mexican manufacturers, with 40% of U.S. imports from Mexico and 25% from Canada being of U.S. origin. NAFTA played a key role in integrating the auto industry in all three countries, leading to significant changes in trade, including the phased elimination of tariffs. The provisions of NAFTA included phased elimination of tariffs, removal of non-tariff barriers, uniform country of origin rules, protection of intellectual property rights, and less restrictive government procurement. U.S. auto manufacturers like Ford rely on parts from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico for final assembly. North American auto parts producers may use inputs from NAFTA partners to assemble parts sold in any of the three countries, with domestic content ranging from 47% to 85%. After NAFTA's implementation, U.S. trade in vehicles and auto parts saw significant growth, with Mexico becoming a major trading partner. U.S. auto exports to Mexico increased by 262%, while imports rose by 765% between 1993 and 2016. Mexico became the top supplier of automotive goods to the U.S. in 2016, accounting for 30% of total imports, followed by Canada at 19%. Studies show that NAFTA brought economic benefits to Mexico, but the distribution of these benefits was uneven. The 2011 World Bank study found that NAFTA positively impacted Mexican productivity. Post-NAFTA studies show overall positive but modest effects on the Mexican economy. It is challenging to attribute economic changes solely to NAFTA, but the agreement helped Mexico align closer to the development levels of the U.S. and Canada. NAFTA had positive impacts on job quality and reduced macroeconomic volatility in Mexico. It increased business cycle synchronicity with the US and Canada but failed to significantly improve the Mexican economy or reduce income disparities. Lack of complementary policies limited its success, especially in the agricultural sector. One of the controversial aspects of NAFTA is its impact on the agricultural sector in Mexico, with critics claiming it led to job losses, particularly in corn production. While some changes were influenced by NAFTA, others were due to Mexico's own agricultural reform measures in the 1980s and 1990s, including privatization and increased competition. Mexico's agricultural sector underwent unilateral reforms in the 1980s and 1990s, coinciding with NAFTA negotiations. The country's reliance on the U.S. export market slightly decreased over the years, with China surpassing Mexico as the second-leading supplier of U.S. imports in 2003. Foreign direct investment has played a significant role in Mexico's economy. Foreign direct investment (FDI) between the United States and Mexico has been significant, especially after NAFTA. The U.S. is the largest source of FDI in Mexico, with U.S. FDI in Mexico increasing from $15.2 billion in 1993 to $104.4 billion in 2012, then decreasing to $92.8 billion in 2015. Mexican FDI in the U.S. has also increased rapidly, from $1.2 billion in 1993 to $16.6 billion in 2015. The flows of FDI have been influenced by various factors, including economic expansion in the late 1990s and slower growth in recent years possibly due to the 2008 global financial crisis and increased violence in Mexico. NAFTA provisions on foreign investment helped increase U.S. FDI in Mexico, reaching $16.6 billion in 2015. Nearly half of total FDI in Mexico is in manufacturing. NAFTA aimed to improve economic conditions in Mexico and narrow income disparity with the U.S. and Canada, but economic convergence in North America has not materialized. Economic convergence in North America has failed to materialize post-NAFTA. A study suggests that the lack of deeper regional integration and cooperation between Mexico and the United States, along with domestic policies and geographic factors, contribute to income disparities. The authors argue that both countries did not adopt complementary policies after NAFTA to promote successful regional integration, such as education, industrial policies, and investment in infrastructure. Security measures post-9/11 have also hindered the movement of goods. The World Bank study suggests that NAFTA brought economic benefits to Mexico but did not narrow the economic disparities with the United States. It recommends Mexico to invest more in education, innovation, infrastructure, and national institutions for income convergence. The World Bank study suggests that NAFTA brought economic benefits to Mexico but did not narrow the economic disparities with the United States. It recommends Mexico to invest more in education, innovation, infrastructure, and national institutions for income convergence. Trade liberalization between the US and Canada was already underway before NAFTA, with the FTA coming into effect in 1989. The impact of trade liberalization from both agreements on Canada is discussed, highlighting the importance of what did not happen as a result of the FTA. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the US and Canada did not result in the feared economic consequences for Canada. It helped Canada grow as a trading nation and did not lead to loss of control over resources. However, some expected benefits like increased productivity did not materialize. Canada remains a significant trading partner of the US, with a trade deficit of $12.1 billion in 2016. Canada's share of exports to the US increased from 60.6% in 1980 to 87.7% in 2002, but has since fallen to 76.4% in 2016. The US share of Canada's imports declined from 70.0% in 1983 to 52.1% in 2015. Canada was the largest purchaser of US exports, but its share fell from 23.5% in 1987 to 18.3% in 2016. In 1987, Canada was the largest purchaser of US exports, but its share fell to 18.3% in 2016. China became the largest supplier of US imports in 2007, with Mexico taking the second spot in 2015. Canada remains the largest trading partner of the US when trade in services is considered. The composition of trade has changed, with some manufacturing sectors thriving as the Canadian dollar became more competitive. The Canadian dollar appreciated from a low of US$0.65 in 2002 to parity in 2007, driven by natural resource exports. However, it slid to US$0.75 by the end of 2016 due to the end of the commodity boom. The strong loonie in 2010-2013 hurt Canadian manufacturing, despite the North American economy's recovery. The auto sector, despite contributing to GM's bailout, has not significantly improved. Despite contributing $12 billion to the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, no new auto assembly plant has opened in Canada since 2009. Model lines have shifted to Mexico or the United States, leading to a decline in Canada's share of North American vehicle output to 14% by 2014. Planned capacity expansion in Mexico and increased investment in the United States could further erode Canadian producers' market share. The long-term labor productivity gap between the United States and Canada was expected to improve with free trade, but the low value of the Canadian dollar has contributed to this disparity since NAFTA. The low value of the Canadian dollar post-NAFTA has led to a gap in labor productivity compared to the United States. Despite Canada leading in population with post-secondary education, concerns remain about low productivity levels, lack of investment in R&D, and information technology. Two-way investment has increased since NAFTA, with the United States being the largest investor. Since NAFTA, U.S. investment in Canada has significantly increased, with a stock of FDI reaching $352.9 billion in 2015, representing 49.4% of total FDI in Canada. Despite a decrease in FDI flows initially after the FTA, U.S. investment has risen to an average of $20.1 billion from 2005-2015. The stock of U.S. FDI now equals 22% of Canadian GDP, compared to 1% at the start of the FTA. Canada is not the largest investor in the U.S., but in 2015, it had a stock of $269.0 billion in the U.S. In 2015, the United States was the largest destination for Canadian FDI with a stock of $269.0 billion, showing a significant increase from $26.6 billion in 1988. Canadian FDI flows into the U.S. have been increasing, reaching an annual average of $9.9 billion in the 10 years leading up to 2015. This shift reflects a more positive view of FDI among Canadians, welcoming new jobs and techniques. President Trump initiated talks to renegotiate NAFTA with Canada and Mexico in 2017. President Trump initiated talks to renegotiate NAFTA in 2017. The President has the authority to negotiate with foreign countries under Article II of the Constitution. Implementation of the renegotiated agreement in domestic law would likely take the form of a Presidential proclamation. The President has the authority to negotiate NAFTA changes and may seek expedited treatment of implementing legislation under the Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Promotion and Accountability Act of 2015. Some modifications can be made by the President, including tariff changes, rules of origin, and customs provisions, which can take effect 15 days after proclamation. Consultation and layover requirements apply to certain proclamations, including additional duties to maintain reciprocal concessions with Canada or Mexico. The consultation and layover provisions apply to tariff modifications, rules of origin for carpets and sweaters, automotive tracing requirements, regional value-content provisions for autos, and rules of origin definitions under NAFTA. Implementing legislation for changes to U.S. law would likely require TPA authority. Under TPA, Congress has the authority to set trade negotiating objectives and expedite the consideration of implementing bills for certain trade agreements. The President can initiate negotiations if trade barriers unduly burden the US economy. Consultation with Congress is required before negotiations, with a 90-day notification period. Under TPA, the President must notify and consult with Congress before initiating negotiations, give a 90-day notice of intent to begin negotiations, adhere to reporting requirements, and follow negotiating objectives set by Congress. Implementing legislation from resulting agreements can be considered under expedited procedures. NAFTA allows a country to withdraw with a six-month notice, while the agreement remains in force for other parties. The President can terminate U.S. international commitments, including trade agreements, in accordance with the agreements' terms and the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. A domestic court is unlikely to find a case challenging such action suitable for judicial review. The President can withdraw from the agreement as a matter of international law six months after providing written notice. Existing NAFTA tariff rates would continue for one year under the Trade Act of 1974, but the President can adjust them during this time. The President can terminate trade agreements like NAFTA in accordance with international law. Existing tariff rates would continue for one year, but the President can adjust them. After withdrawal, the President can proclaim prior tariff rates for Mexico and Canada. Congressional assent would likely be needed to repeal statutory provisions implementing NAFTA. The basis for U.S.-Canada trade post-withdrawal is uncertain. The CFTA could potentially \"snap-back\" into force after a withdrawal from NAFTA, requiring a presidential proclamation. The 115th Congress is concerned about U.S. trade policy under the Trump Administration, including the renegotiation of NAFTA. Congress may need to consider modernizing and renegotiating NAFTA, the role of Congress in the renegotiation, negotiating positions of Mexico and Canada, and the implications of a possible NAFTA withdrawal. Congress could also address new \"21st Century\" trade issues in recent U.S. FTAs. The recent U.S. FTAs, such as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement and TPP, could be potential topics of discussion in regard to NAFTA. Withdrawal from NAFTA could disrupt North American production chains and cause job losses. There are opportunities to review NAFTA's successes and failures. Economists and business representatives aim to maintain the trade relationship with Canada and Mexico under NAFTA for improved relations and economic integration. Labor groups and consumer-advocacy groups argue that NAFTA has led to outsourcing and lower wages, negatively impacting the U.S. economy. Some proponents and critics of NAFTA agree that the three countries may wish to look at what the agreement has failed to do as they look to the future of North American trade and economic relations. Policies could include updating or \"modernizing\" provisions to include commitments in more recent U.S. FTAs. NAFTA parties have not specifically stated how NAFTA should be renegotiated, or what changes they may seek if the agreement is amended. Renegotiation may provide opportunities to address issues not currently covered in NAFTA, such as negotiating new rules of origin to address modern developments in auto manufacturing. NAFTA phased out Mexico's restrictive auto decree, opening the Mexican auto sector to foreign investment from the United States and liberalizing North American auto trade. It eliminated U.S. tariffs on automotive imports from Mexico and Mexican tariffs on U.S. and Canadian products, with rules of origin requirements of 62.5% content for autos and 60% for other vehicles and parts. The United States prioritizes services trade liberalization in FTAs, including NAFTA, covering core obligations in a separate chapter and addressing services trade provisions in related chapters like financial services. The role of the Internet in international commerce has expanded since NAFTA's implementation. New services commitments, like those in TPP, could be considered by NAFTA parties to address barriers in electronic payment card services, telecommunications, and data transmission across borders. Discussions on cross-border transfer of information and forced localization of data centers may also be on the table. The NAFTA agreement was the first to include an Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) chapter, which later influenced the WTO TRIPs Agreement. Since NAFTA, IPR provisions in US FTAs have evolved, with the TPP including provisions for copyright in the digital environment, patent protections for pharmaceuticals, criminal penalties for trade secret theft, and customs authority to seize counterfeit goods. The NAFTA agreement includes provisions on counterfeit and pirated goods, criminal penalties for copyright and trademark infringement in the digital environment, and limited provisions on state-owned enterprises. Renegotiation could involve discussions on state-owned enterprises to address issues negotiated in the TPP, such as potential commercial disadvantages to private sector firms. All three countries may be interested in revising the NAFTA investment chapter to align with more recent agreements and maintain core investor protections reflecting U.S. law. The NAFTA investment chapter, including the investor-state dispute settlement provision, has undergone changes to affirm a government's right to regulate for environmental, health, or safety outcomes. NAFTA was the first FTA to include ISDS, allowing investors to arbitrate disputes with host governments. Additionally, NAFTA contains a binational dispute settlement mechanism (Chapter 19) for anti-dumping and countervailing duty decisions. This mechanism was created as a compromise with Canada in the CFTA. NAFTA created a state-to-state mechanism (Chapter 20) for dispute resolution, which has been underutilized compared to the WTO's dispute settlement system. U.S. industry groups affected by Chapter 19 decisions have pushed for the removal of NAFTA's binational review panel provisions. If NAFTA is revised with provisions not found in WTO agreements, the use and effectiveness of NAFTA panels may be reevaluated during renegotiation. NAFTA introduced worker rights provisions in FTAs for the first time. The US aims to enhance NAFTA's protection of worker rights. Recent trade agreements like the TPP and US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement have stronger provisions requiring parties to uphold internationally recognized worker rights principles. Mexico is working on labor reforms to align with TPP standards. NAFTA only mandates enforcement of each party's labor laws. The United States aims to align NAFTA's labor laws with TPP provisions, including protecting collective bargaining and reforming labor justice. NAFTA was the first FTA to include environmental provisions, and parties could seek more enforceable environmental regulations. Cooperation to address trans-national environmental threats and promote inclusive policymaking could also be enhanced. NAFTA's investment provisions include exemptions in the energy sector. NAFTA's investment provisions in the energy sector include exemptions for Mexico, allowing the government to restrict foreign investment. The United States may aim for increased access to Mexico's oil sector and enhanced cooperation on energy. In Canada, the energy chapters of CFTA and NAFTA have a \"proportionality\" provision, limiting restrictions on Canadian energy exports to the U.S. Some Canadians argue this provision hinders their energy policy decisions. Changes in customs procedures between NAFTA partners could have a significant impact on trade. Discussions on customs procedures between NAFTA partners could impact bilateral trade significantly. Topics include customs automation, single-access window for importers/exporters, risk analysis, and special procedures for express shipments. Sanitary and phytosanitary standards focus on human/animal/plant safety in agriculture trade. Considerations could include commitments from the proposed TPP for science-based regulatory activities and notifications to importers/exporters. Mexico is considering modernizing NAFTA and broadening negotiations to include security and immigration issues. Tensions arose in January 2017 due to U.S. policies towards Mexico, leading to potential tariffs on Mexican imports. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is open to discussing NAFTA but has warned of immediate retaliation if tariffs are increased. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico is open to discussing NAFTA with mutual respect for national sovereignty. Mexico may consider withdrawing if negotiations are unfavorable, but aims to improve the agreement. NAFTA trucking provisions have been a trade issue, with the U.S. delaying implementation for years due to safety concerns. The United States and Canada resolved trucking issues after years of cooperation and talks. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters may challenge NAFTA's trucking provisions in a potential renegotiation. Discussions may also involve dairy, softwood lumber, and Buy American provisions. Canada's supply management system for dairy, poultry, and eggs could be a topic of negotiation, with U.S. dairy producers seeking greater market access. Trade in softwood lumber may also be addressed in potential negotiations. Possible negotiations between the United States and Canada could address trade in softwood lumber and issues related to Buy American policies. The U.S. industry claims that Canadian stumpage fees are subsidized, while Canada argues it has a comparative advantage in timber production. Canada is dissatisfied with the application of Buy American policies in U.S. government procurement, particularly in \"pass-through\" contracts. Canada argues that many industries rely on parts sourced from both countries and have been excluded from \"pass-through\" procurements using federal funds. NAFTA played a crucial role in developing supply chains in North America, especially in the auto industry, where labor-intensive parts are made in Mexico and complex parts in the United States. The North American auto industry employs over 1.5 million people and contributes significantly to the U.S. economy. Congress should consider the impact of imposing tariffs on certain goods if NAFTA is renegotiated. The United States, Canada, and Mexico are involved in negotiations for the proposed TPP among 12 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. President Trump directed the U.S. to withdraw from the TPP, citing concerns about potential job losses and benefits to other countries like Germany and Japan. The agreement had not entered into force due to the requirement for ratification by member countries accounting for 85% of the region's GDP. The TPP agreement, which requires ratification by member countries accounting for 85% of the region's GDP, cannot enter into effect without U.S. participation. President Trump's decision to withdraw from TPP has led some partners to consider a similar agreement without the United States, potentially impacting U.S. competitiveness in certain markets. Mexico and Canada are exploring new trade agreements to diversify their trade relationships. The government of Chile plans to pursue trade deals with the Asia-Pacific region and has invited ministers from TPP countries, China, and South Korea to a summit in March to discuss future trade agreements. Numerous countries are expected to attend."
