It highlights Israel's expertise in homeland security and anti-terrorism, as well as the successful history of cooperation between the United States and Israel in developing various technologies. The BIRD Foundation, established in 1977 as a joint US-Israel grant program, has invested $180 million in 600 projects over 27 years, resulting in $7 billion in sales and important technologies.
