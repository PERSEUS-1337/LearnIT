    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to establish a voluntary certification program through the Department of Veterans Affairs for charitable entities providing supportive services to veterans. This program will certify entities meeting minimum standards of cultural competency and financial legitimacy. Additionally, there is consideration for providing a preference to certified entities in state contracting for supportive services to veterans or their families. Article 8 of the Military and Veterans Code introduces a Veterans Preference For State Services Contracts. A certified California veteran service provider must offer at least two supportive services to veterans and their families and demonstrate the knowledge and experience to provide these services. To qualify as a certified California veteran service provider, an organization must demonstrate fiscal and management capacity, nonprofit status, effective service to veteran clients, and compliance with state regulations and standards. To become a certified California veteran service provider, an organization must submit various documents such as articles of incorporation, IRS Letter of Determination, taxpayer identification number, and independent audit reports. The application process must be completed according to the department's requirements starting July 1, 2017. The department maintains a list of certified California veteran service providers on its website, with details of services provided. A certification approved by the department is valid for three years unless decertified. The department may accept certifications from other state entities for certification. A progress report on regulations is due to the Committee on Veterans Affairs by April 1, 2017. The department may accept a congressionally chartered veterans service organization's status as support for certification of a certified California veteran service provider. By July 1, 2017, rules will be adopted for certification and decertification of providers not meeting requirements. A fee of up to $750 will be charged for certification."
