    "content": "The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) establishes requirements for controlling and responding to releases of hazardous chemicals. The report describes key provisions of EPCRA and provides references for more detailed information. It highlights key provisions and addresses authorities and limitations imposed by the statute. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) was enacted in 1986 in response to the Bhopal incident, aiming to reduce chemical accident risks in the US. EPCRA mandates reporting of hazardous chemical releases, establishes state commissions, and provides public access to information on toxic chemical releases. EPA enforces compliance and mobilizes local officials, businesses, and citizens for emergency planning. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986 requires local planning for chemical accidents, including the creation of State Emergency Response Commissions (SERC) and local emergency planning committees (LEPCs). EPA lists extremely hazardous substances and sets planning quantities. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986 mandates local planning for chemical accidents through State Emergency Response Commissions (SERC) and local emergency planning committees (LEPCs). EPA lists hazardous substances with specific planning quantities, requiring facilities to notify LEPCs if they store or use these chemicals above threshold levels. LEPCs collaborate with facilities to develop response procedures, evacuation plans, and training programs for first responders. Owners must provide additional information as requested for emergency preparedness. Section 304 of EPCRA requires facilities to report releases of hazardous substances exceeding reportable quantities to state, local, and federal officials. Subtitle B establishes reporting requirements for facilities to develop and implement emergency plans. The Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970 (OSHAct) requires employers to provide employees with access to material safety data sheets (MSDS) for hazardous chemicals. EPCRA Section 311 mandates facilities to submit MSDS or a list of hazardous chemicals to LEPC, SERC, and local fire department. EPA can establish hazard categories and require facilities to report hazardous chemicals grouped by these categories. An MSDS only needs to be submitted once unless there are changes. EPA requires facilities to report hazardous chemicals grouped by categories. MSDS must be provided upon request by LEPC or the public. EPCRA Section 312 mandates annual submission of emergency and hazardous chemical inventory forms. Threshold quantities may exempt facilities from reporting. Section 313 requires development of hazardous chemical release forms. Section 313 of EPCRA mandates reporting of toxic chemical releases by manufacturing facilities to the EPA. The Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) database contains information on chemicals released to the environment. Data is available to the public in raw and summarized forms, accessible through written requests or online. Reporting is required for facilities with 10 or more employees that use 10,000 pounds or more of toxic chemicals. EPCRA mandates reporting of toxic chemical releases by manufacturing facilities with 10 or more employees using 10,000 pounds or more of toxic chemicals. Reporting requirements include data on chemical use, amounts present, treatment methods, and environmental releases. EPA can adjust thresholds for chemicals or facilities and expand reporting to additional industries. EPA promulgated a rule in 1997 to enforce these requirements. EPA expanded reporting requirements in 1997 to include toxic releases from additional industries such as metal mining, coal mining, electric utilities, petroleum terminals, chemical wholesalers, and solvent recovery facilities. The list of chemicals for reporting has been updated to include 666 individual chemicals based on criteria for significant adverse health effects. EPA has the authority to adjust the list of chemicals as needed. Subtitle C of the EPA reporting requirements covers acute human health effects and significant adverse effects on the environment due to toxic chemical releases. It includes provisions for trade secret protection and informing health professionals of withheld chemical identities. Section 324 of EPCRA directs EPA, governors, SERCs, and LEPCs to make emergency response plans, MSDSs, lists of chemicals, inventory forms, toxic chemical release forms, and follow-up emergency notices available to the public. Section 325 establishes penalties for noncompliance, Section 326 allows citizens to bring civil action, Section 327 exempts chemicals in transport, Section 328 authorizes EPA to issue regulations, and Section 330 authorizes necessary appropriations. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) authorizes necessary appropriations to carry out its provisions. This includes making emergency response plans, MSDSs, chemical lists, inventory forms, toxic release forms, and follow-up notices available to the public. Penalties for noncompliance, citizen civil action, exemptions for chemicals in transport, and EPA's authority to issue regulations are also established."
