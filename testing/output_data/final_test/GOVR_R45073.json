    "content": "The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (S. 2155) was passed by the Senate on March 14, 2018, and signed into law by President Donald Trump on May 24, 2018. The Act changes financial regulations, providing relief to banks, altering aspects of regulation in banks, capital markets, mortgage lending, and credit reporting agencies. It includes provisions for regulatory relief, relaxation of mortgage lending rules, and additional consumer protections related to credit reporting, veterans' mortgage refinancing, and student loans. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (S. 2155) amends the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III Accords, providing targeted financial regulatory relief to eliminate burdensome regulations, foster economic growth, and strengthen consumer protections. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (S. 2155) amends Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III Accords, providing targeted financial regulatory relief to eliminate burdensome regulations, foster economic growth, and strengthen consumer protections. Opponents argue it pares back important safeguards to benefit large banks. P.L. 115-174 focuses on banking industry, mortgages, capital formation, and credit reporting, differing from the broader scope of the Financial CHOICE Act. The Treasury Department's reports, including the first one on banks and credit unions, offer recommendations for regulatory changes without congressional action. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act would reduce the budget deficit by $23 million over 10 years, mainly through a provision requiring the Federal Reserve to transfer $675 million to the Treasury. The provision in P.L. 115-174 shifts Fed remittances from the future to the present, impacting the Treasury's income. Various provisions in the legislation are forecasted to increase the deficit, with key effects on community banks, enhanced regulation thresholds, and leverage ratios for custody banks. The legislation focuses on mortgage lending, regulatory relief for banks, consumer protection, and changes in securities markets. The report on P.L. 115-174 provides regulatory relief for large banks and securities markets. It includes background information, provisions, and policy issues related to these areas. Additionally, it addresses mortgage lending regulations and credit availability. In response to the 2007 housing crisis, new mortgage regulations were implemented to address lax standards. Some analysts argue that current regulations restrict mortgage availability, leading to provisions in P.L. 115-174 aimed at relaxing rules for small lenders and specific markets. Others believe the pre-existing regulatory structure provided important consumer protections despite market developments tightening mortgage credit. House prices rose significantly between 1991 and 2007, then sharply declined for several years, not returning to peak levels until the end of 2015. The decrease in prices led to a surge in foreclosures, negatively impacting homeowners and contributing to the financial crisis. Factors such as relaxed mortgage standards, nontraditional mortgage products, and misaligned incentives are believed to have caused the housing bubble and its collapse. The Dodd-Frank Act brought reforms to the mortgage system, including the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and consumer protections in Title XIV. There is a perceived trade-off between consumer protection and credit availability in regulating mortgages and financial services. Some policymakers believe postcrisis mortgage rules strike a balance between consumer protection and credit availability. Critics argue that regulations have increased compliance costs for lenders, limiting credit options for consumers, especially for nonstandard mortgages. Some experts argue that mortgage rules are unduly burdensome for certain types of lenders, leading to tighter mortgage credit availability. There is no consensus on the extent to which rules have restricted mortgages, as other economic and market factors also play a role. The supply of homes, demand, and demographic trends impact the housing market. Title I amends laws affecting small segments of the mortgage market, relaxing consumer protections in some areas. It aims to balance safety and soundness with access to credit, creating a new qualified mortgage compliance option. Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act established the ability-to-repay (ATR) requirement to ensure borrowers can repay their mortgages. Lenders must verify and document borrowers' ability to repay, or face legal liability. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued regulations in 2013 to implement the ATR requirement. The CFPB issued regulations in January 2013 to implement the Ability-to-Repay (ATR) requirement, which lenders must comply with by originating a Qualified Mortgage (QM) to reduce legal liability. The QM regulations establish a Standard QM and additional categories of QMs. The Small Creditor Portfolio QM provides lenders with a presumption of compliance with the ATR requirement, with less strict underwriting requirements compared to the Standard QM. To qualify, the mortgage must be held in the lender's portfolio for at least three years, be held by a small creditor, and meet underwriting requirements similar to a Standard QM. Some argue that the QM definition has led to unnecessary credit constraints and burdens for lenders. Critics believe that not all underwriting requirements in the Small Creditor Portfolio QM are essential for verifying a borrower's ability to repay. Keeping the loan in portfolio incentivizes thorough underwriting as lenders retain default risk and potential losses if the borrower defaults. This risk encourages small creditors to scrutinize borrowers during underwriting, even without a legal mandate. The expanded portfolio option under P.L. 115-174 offers a new compliance choice for lenders, allowing larger institutions to use the portfolio compliance option with raised asset thresholds. This option benefits creditworthy borrowers with unique financial situations, such as self-employed or seasonal employees, by providing less prescriptive underwriting standards compared to existing QM options. The expanded portfolio option under P.L. 115-174 offers a new compliance choice for lenders, allowing larger institutions to use the portfolio compliance option with raised asset thresholds. This option benefits creditworthy borrowers with unique financial situations by providing less prescriptive underwriting standards compared to existing QM options. The new option is limited to insured depositories and has more restrictive portfolio requirements, but with more relaxed loan criteria. Critics of the expanded portfolio QM option in P.L. 115-174 argue that it may not adequately protect consumers, while proponents believe it will increase credit availability and align borrower and lender incentives. The current law requires appraisers to be compensated at a customary and reasonable rate. The housing crisis raised concerns about appraisal accuracy during the housing bubble and subsequent bust. The Dodd-Frank Act strengthened appraisal requirements by addressing concerns about appraisal accuracy during the housing bubble. Section 102 allows appraisers to donate their services to charitable organizations without violating the customary-and-reasonable fee requirement. The Dodd-Frank Act strengthened appraisal requirements by addressing concerns about appraisal accuracy during the housing bubble. Section 103 waives the general requirement for independent home appraisals for federally related mortgages in rural areas under certain conditions. Section 104 exempts banks and credit unions from certain Home Mortgage and Disclosure Act reporting requirements. HMDA requires lenders to report data on mortgage business to assess community housing needs, distribute investments, and identify discriminatory lending patterns. Lenders with fewer than 500 closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit in the past two years qualify for reduced reporting if they meet certain CRA compliance scores. Dodd-Frank Act mandated additional data collection through HMDA, including points and fees, mortgage terms, and interest information. Section 105 of the Dodd-Frank Act exempts credit union loans for non-primary residence single-family homes from being classified as member business loans, which are subject to restrictions on loan types and volumes. Section 106 allows state-licensed mortgage loan originators to temporarily work in another state while awaiting licensing approval, as per P.L. 115-174. Under the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289; SAFE Act), mortgage loan originators (MLOs) must register with the National Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (NMLS) if they work for a bank, and be licensed and registered in their state if they work for a nonbank lender. The legislation aims to prevent unscrupulous or incompetent MLOs from evading consequences by moving jobs. Becoming licensed and registered in a state can be a time-intensive process for MLOs at nonbank lenders, involving background checks. The SAFE Act and Dodd-Frank Act established new requirements for mortgage originators' licensing, registration, compensation, and training in response to problems in the mortgage market. Section 106 provides grace periods for individuals transferring positions between bank and nonbank lenders or across states to become appropriately licensed and registered. The definition of a mortgage originator includes individuals who assist consumers in obtaining residential mortgage loans. Section 107 expands exceptions for employees of manufactured-home retailers, while Section 108 exempts loans made by banks or credit unions from certain escrow requirements. Section 108 exempts loans made by banks or credit unions from certain escrow requirements if they meet specific criteria, such as having assets of $10 billion or less and originating fewer than 1,000 mortgage loans in the previous year. Escrow accounts are used to pay property-related expenses like taxes and insurance, and must be maintained for at least one year for higher-priced mortgage loans. Maintaining escrow accounts can be costly for some small institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the escrow account requirement for higher-priced mortgage loans from one year to five years, with the possibility of termination under certain conditions. The CFPB has exemptions for lenders in rural areas who meet specific criteria, including operating in underserved areas, having fewer than 2,000 mortgages, less than $2 billion in assets, and not escrowing for any mortgages they service. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the escrow account requirement for higher-priced mortgage loans from one year to five years. Lenders in rural areas can be exempt if they meet specific criteria, including operating in underserved areas, having fewer than 2,000 mortgages, less than $2 billion in assets, and not escrowing for any mortgages they service. Additionally, a lender must intend to hold the loan in its portfolio to be exempt from the escrow requirement. Banks or credit unions with assets of $10 billion or less, originated fewer than 1,000 mortgage loans in the preceding year, and met certain criteria are also exempt. The CFPB issued the TRID final rule on November 20, 2013, requiring lenders to use streamlined disclosure forms, with borrowers needing to receive the disclosures at least three days before the mortgage closing. Section 109 of P.L. 115-174 waives the three-day waiting period for mortgage closing if borrowers receive an amended disclosure with a lower interest rate. It also calls for additional guidance from the CFPB on certain aspects of the final rule. Title II of the same law focuses on providing regulatory relief to community banks. Title II of P.L. 115-174 aims to provide regulatory relief to community banks by raising asset thresholds for exemptions from certain regulations. The term \"community bank\" typically refers to small banks focused on traditional banking activities. However, there is no consensus on the size limit that defines a community bank, and some doubt the effectiveness of size-based measures in identifying them. Observers question the effectiveness of size-based measures in identifying community banks, which are more focused on core banking activities like loans and deposits. These banks operate in smaller geographic areas and prioritize relationship lending. Proponents argue that community banks are crucial credit sources for local communities and underserved groups, as larger banks may not meet their needs. Impeding small banks could restrict credit availability. Easing regulatory burdens on small banks, which pose less systemic risk and have limited resources for compliance, could be justified by the fact that they did not cause the 2007-2009 crisis and do not individually threaten the financial system's stability. This approach questions the necessity of applying regulations aimed at systemic stability to community banks. Easing regulations on small banks may be justified by lower compliance costs compared to larger banks. Compliance costs as a percentage of overall costs are likely to decrease with size, but regulatory complexity may disproportionately affect small banks. Some argue for reducing the regulatory burden on small banks to improve access to credit and lower prices for certain borrowers. Community banks offer credit at lower prices than large banks for certain borrowers, occupying market niches that larger banks may not fill. Some argue that regulations on small banks are unduly burdensome, while others believe the regulatory burden is appropriate, with exemptions and tailored regulations in place to reduce compliance costs for small banks. Regulatory supervision is structured to be less burdensome for small banks. The cost for small banks to comply with regulations is a concern, with supervision structured to be less burdensome for them. Small institutions played a role in past crises, like the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s. Title II provisions amend laws affecting depositories, including banks and credit unions. Title II provisions in the legislation aim to provide regulatory relief to small banks by relaxing certain regulations, such as minimum capital requirements and exam frequency. Section 201 introduces a Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR) with a threshold ratio of 8% to 10% for well-capitalized status, compared to the general 5% leverage ratio requirement. The legislation introduces a Community Bank Leverage Ratio (CBLR) for banks with less than $10 billion in assets. Capital, defined as tangible equity, allows banks to absorb losses without failing. Regulators set minimum capital requirements expressed as capital ratio requirements, either risk-weighted or leverage ratios. Riskier assets receive higher risk weights in risk-weighted ratios. Some argue for maintaining both risk-weighted ratios and a leverage ratio to complement each other. Riskier assets require higher risk weights, leading to banks holding more capital to absorb potential losses. Without risk weighting, banks may be incentivized to hold riskier assets due to the same capital requirement for all assets in a leverage ratio system. Some argue for maintaining both risk-weighted ratios and a leverage ratio to complement each other. Risk weights assigned to assets may not accurately reflect their true risk, leading to potential misallocation of capital. Some critics argue that risk weights set before the financial crisis led to banks investing in risky assets, like highly rated mortgage-backed securities, which suffered large losses. They believe the current risk-weighted system is overly complex and burdensome for small banks, benefiting larger banks instead. They suggest implementing a simpler system for small banks. Critics argue that the current risk-weighted system is complex and burdensome for small banks, giving larger banks a competitive advantage. The CBO estimates that implementing a 9% leverage ratio could lead to increased risk-taking by community banks, potentially resulting in more bank failures. This could raise costs to the Deposit Insurance Fund by $240 million over 10 years, partially offset by higher insurance premiums. Section 202 exempts reciprocal deposits from regulations. Reciprocal deposits, where two banks deposit equal amounts with each other, are exempt from prohibitions on brokered deposits for well-capitalized banks. Brokered deposits are placed by third-party brokers for clients seeking higher interest rates, considered less stable due to easier withdrawal. Regulators generally prohibit not-well-capitalized banks from accepting brokered deposits to limit potential losses to the FDIC. Section 202 allows certain not-well-capitalized banks to accept reciprocal deposits, where two banks place a portion of their customers' deposits with each other to stay under the $250,000 deposit insurance limit. Reciprocal deposits are considered funding held by a bank without a relationship with the depositors. Section 202 permits certain not-well-capitalized banks to accept reciprocal deposits, which are funding held by a bank without a relationship with depositors. This could increase the budget deficit by $25 million over 10 years due to higher deposit insurance payouts from bank failures. Section 203 exempts banks with less than $10 billion in assets from prohibitions on proprietary trading and relationships with certain investment funds. The Volcker Rule, under Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. Section 204 eases some restrictions related to sharing a name with organized funds. Proponents argue that proprietary trading adds risk to commercial banking and that other institutions are better suited for it, making bank involvement unnecessary and creating moral hazard issues. Supporters of the Volcker Rule argue that it prevents banks from engaging in risky activities like proprietary trading, which could lead to moral hazard issues due to government-insured deposits. Critics question the rule's necessity and effectiveness, pointing out that proprietary trading did not cause the financial crisis. They argue that the rule would not have prevented the failures of large investment banks and insurers or losses on loans held by commercial banks. The risks posed by activities prohibited under the Volcker Rule are debated in terms of their impact on bank solvency and the financial system. The Volcker Rule poses risks to bank solvency and financial stability, with debates on whether it is more risky than traditional banking activities. Exceptions exist for bank trading, such as hedging and market-making, leading to regulatory complexity and compliance costs. There is also a debate on whether small banks should be subjected to the rule, with proponents arguing that most community banks are not affected. Some argue that community banks should be exempt from the burdensome Volcker Rule, as compliance can be achieved through clear policies. Section 205 aims to reduce reporting requirements for banks with assets under $5 billion. Banks with assets under $5 billion must comply with reduced reporting requirements in the first and third quarters of the year. This involves submitting a detailed report of income, expenses, and balance sheet to federal bank agencies. The regulators are directed to simplify the reports for smaller banks. Section 206 of the financial reform focuses on allowing federal savings associations with under $20 billion in assets to switch to the national bank regulatory regime without changing their charter. This provision aims to streamline the process for institutions wanting to change regulatory regimes. Section 207 of the financial reform raises the asset threshold in the Federal Reserve Small Bank Holding Company (BHC) and Small Saving and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion in total assets. This allows BHCs under the asset threshold to take on more debt for mergers. Section 207 of the financial reform raises the asset threshold in the Federal Reserve Small Bank Holding Company (BHC) and Small Saving and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion in total assets, allowing BHCs under the threshold to take on more debt for mergers. The Dodd-Frank Act exempts BHCs subject to this policy statement from certain capital requirements at the holding company level. The significance of the Collins Amendment depends on the extent of nonbank activities in BHCs, with many small banks not having substantial activities in nonbank subsidiaries. Section 210 raises the asset threshold for banks to be eligible for an 18-month examination cycle from $1 billion to $3 billion. This allows more banks to be subject to less frequent examination. Section 213 permits financial institutions to use a scan of a driver's license for identification purposes. Section 214 of P.L. 115-174 allows banks to classify certain credit facilities for commercial properties as regular commercial real estate exposures instead of high volatility commercial real estate exposures for risk-weighted capital requirements. This change eliminates the previous requirement for developers to contribute at least 15% of the project's value in capital. Section 214 of P.L. 115-174 provides avenues for commercial real estate exposures to avoid or shed HVCRE status, allowing the property's appraised value to count as a capital contribution and certain credit facilities to finance income-producing properties without HVCRE classification. A HVCRE loan could be reclassified when property development is completed or generates sufficient cash flow. Lower capital requirements incentivize banks to make HVCRE loans but provide less cushion against potential losses. Title III, Title VI, and Section 215 address consumer protection challenges in credit markets. The credit reporting industry collects and provides information to companies about consumer behavior in financial transactions. Credit reports include identity information, credit transactions, public record information, and credit inquiries. Credit reports are prepared by credit reporting agencies, with Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian being the largest. About 400 smaller CRAs also exist, specializing in specific types of information. Companies use credit reports to assess consumer creditworthiness. Companies rely on consumer data from credit reports to assess behaviors that could impact their financial relationships. This data is used by lenders, banks, insurance companies, and employers to evaluate risks and make decisions on offering loans, checking accounts, insurance products, and employment opportunities. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) regulates credit reporting agencies to ensure fair and equitable treatment of consumer information. Consumers have rights regarding their credit reports, including being notified of adverse actions and receiving one free credit report annually from each of the three largest agencies. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) grants consumers the right to one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting agencies. Consumers can dispute inaccurate information in their reports, which must be investigated and corrected within 30 days. The FCRA also imposes responsibilities on entities that collect, furnish, and use consumer credit information. Enforcement authority was transferred from the Federal Trade Commission to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which supervises larger participants in the consumer reporting market for FCRA compliance. Previously, CRAs were not actively supervised for FCRA compliance on an ongoing basis. Concerns about how consumers' personal information is used and protected have been raised, especially regarding identity theft. The Equifax security breach in September 2017 exposed the sensitive information of 145.5 million U.S. consumers, emphasizing the importance of this issue. Active duty military members face unique challenges due to sudden deployments that can impact their credit and financial well-being. The U.S. laws dating back to World War I aim to ease financial burdens on military members and protect them from financial mistreatment. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides additional protections for active duty servicemembers, but some observers argue that servicemembers are still inadequately protected in certain transactions. Student loan debt in the U.S. has significantly increased over time, with average tuition prices more than doubling at colleges and universities in the past three decades. The total amount of outstanding federal student loan debt in the U.S. exceeded $1.37 trillion at the end of the 2017 fiscal year. Studies suggest that repayment burdens for borrowers have increased as overall student loan indebtedness has risen. Concerns have been raised about the lack of appropriate protections in the private student loan market. Private student loans lack the same repayment relief options as federal loans. Section 215 allows financial institutions to verify customer information electronically with the Social Security Administration. Identity thieves use synthetic identity theft to apply for credit using a mix of real and fake information. The SSA Consent-Based Social Security Number Verification system aims to combat identity theft by allowing electronic signatures for verification requests. Section 301 of P.L. 115-174 extends fraud alerts on consumer credit files to one year and grants consumers the right to place or remove them. Section 301 of P.L. 115-174 extends fraud alerts on consumer credit files to one year, allowing consumers to place or remove them for free. This new provision also includes protections for minors' credit reports. Section 301 of P.L. 115-174 extends fraud alerts on consumer credit files to one year, allowing consumers to place or remove them for free. This provision also allows individuals to place security freezes on their credit reports, making it harder for identity thieves to open new credit lines using stolen information. Placing fraud alerts or security freezes on credit reports can help prevent fraud and identity theft, but it may also create additional costs and hurdles for lenders and consumers. Removing or lifting these protections when applying for new credit can be a time-consuming process. This relates to broader discussions about the control and use of personal financial information. The availability of personal financial information raises concerns about individuals' control over their sensitive data, especially when used for adverse decisions or compromised by fraud. Requiring credit reporting agencies to place security freezes and extend fraud alerts on consumer reports can help address these issues. Section 301 and 302 of the FCRA give consumers more control over their credit reports. Section 302 specifically addresses medical debt for veterans, allowing a one-year delay before it can be reported. It also requires removal of delinquent medical debt information once paid or settled, and establishes a dispute process for veterans. Section 302 of the FCRA establishes a dispute process for veterans to remove debt-related information if the Department of Veterans Affairs is making payment. It also mandates credit reporting agencies to provide free credit monitoring to active duty military members. Section 303 protects financial institution employees from liability for disclosing suspected fraud against individuals aged 65 or older. Section 304 repeals the sunset provision of the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act, restoring notification and eviction requirements for renters in foreclosed properties. Section 307 requires the CFPB to issue regulations. Some states promote home retrofitting through Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing programs, allowing property owners to invest in energy efficiency upgrades or renewable energy projects. PACE loans are repaid through property tax assessments over time, offering an alternative to traditional loans. Concerns have been raised about potential mortgage defaults due to the relatively high interest rates on PACE loans. Section 307 extends consumer protections to PACE loans by applying the ability-to-repay requirement. Section 309 enhances consumer protections for veterans in refinancing housing loans by restricting new loan terms and requiring lenders to disclose refinancing benefits. VA-backed loans for veterans are targeted to prevent deceptive practices, ensuring only refinancing meeting certain standards is insured or guaranteed. Section 309 enhances consumer protections for veterans in refinancing housing loans by restricting new loan terms and requiring lenders to disclose refinancing benefits. VA-backed loans for veterans must meet certain standards, including recouping upfront fees within 36 months and providing a net tangible benefit test. Additionally, Section 310 mandates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to evaluate additional credit scores for mortgage underwriting and establish approval criteria for integrity, reliability, and accuracy. Currently, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are considering new credit scoring models to use for mortgage approvals, as the classic FICO model they currently use is seen as outdated and lacking in certain considerations. Fair Isaac has developed new credit scores, and the VantageScore has also been introduced. FHFA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac are evaluating these new scoring options, with FHFA seeking feedback on the matter. Section 310 and 313 of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act address credit model approval and protection periods for active duty servicemembers against mortgage property sale, foreclosure, or seizure. The protection period was originally 90 days. The protection period for active duty servicemembers under the SCRA was extended to one year by Congress. Section 601 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 enhances consumer protections for student borrowers and cosigners of student loans. It prohibits lenders from declaring automatic default in case of death or bankruptcy of the cosigner and requires lenders to release cosigners from obligations in the event of the student borrower's death. Section 602 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 allows borrowers to request removal of default information on private student loans from their credit report if they complete a loan rehabilitation program. Borrowers with federal student loans in default have a one-time rehabilitation option by making nine on-time monthly payments. After making nine on-time monthly payments during a 10-month period, a borrower's loan is considered rehabilitated. The borrower's credit report will be updated to show the loan is no longer in default, but late payment information may still remain for seven years. Private loan defaulters may not have a similar rehabilitation option, as it is at the discretion of the financial institution to offer such programs. If a bank chooses to offer rehabilitation and the consumer completes the program, default information can be excluded from the credit report. Title IV aims to provide regulatory relief to large banks, especially those considered \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The debate revolves around identifying these institutions and determining how their regulation should differ to prevent financial instability and moral hazard. Enhanced prudential regulation is a key response to addressing financial stability and ending \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) institutions. The largest banks face more stringent regulatory requirements than medium-sized and smaller banks, based on criteria set by Dodd-Frank and Basel III accords. About 38 U.S. bank holding companies or the U.S. operations of foreign banks with over $50 billion in assets fall under enhanced regulations. Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act established enhanced prudential regulations for banks with over $50 billion in assets. This includes stress tests, capital planning, living wills, and liquidity requirements to ensure financial stability. There are 8 G-SIBs in the U.S. out of 30 worldwide. The Dodd-Frank Act established enhanced prudential regulations for banks with over $50 billion in assets, including stress tests, capital planning, living wills, and liquidity requirements to ensure financial stability. Liquidity requirements are implemented through firm-run stress tests, Fed-run liquidity coverage ratio, and proposed net stable funding ratio rules. Risk management standards mandate risk committees for publicly traded companies with over $10 billion in assets and chief risk officers for banks with over $50 billion in assets. Financial stability requirements allow regulatory interventions if a bank poses a threat to financial stability. Interventions for banks posing a threat to financial stability include limits on mergers, acquisitions, product offerings, activities, and asset divestment. Emergency powers include debt to equity ratio, FSOC reporting, early remediation, and enhanced FDIC powers. Some requirements are tailored for advanced banks or G-SIBs, with more stringent regulations like LCR, NSFR, and SCCL. The SCCL proposed includes a stringent requirement for G-SIBs, with a 3% SLR for advanced approaches banks and a 5% SLR for G-SIBs at the holding company level. G-SIBs must also meet a 6% SLR at the depository subsidiary level to be considered well capitalized. The Basel III regulations impose additional capital requirements on large banks, such as the countercyclical capital buffer and the G-SIB capital surcharge. These regulations aim to ensure that banks hold enough capital to absorb potential losses and prevent taxpayer bailouts. TLAC requirements aim to prevent taxpayer bailouts by ensuring equity- and debt-holders can absorb losses. Banks with assets between $50 billion and $100 billion are exempt from enhanced regulation, while those with $100 billion to $250 billion are subject to stress tests. Domestic G-SIBs and banks with over $250 billion in assets remain under enhanced regulation. The $250 billion threshold under P.L. 115-174 affects firms with assets above this amount, replacing the previous $50 billion threshold for foreign banking organizations operating in the US. The legislation gives the Federal Reserve discretion to impose standards between $100 billion and $250 billion for global assets. All Intermediate Holding Companies (IHCs) in Table 2 have foreign parents with over $250 billion in global assets. Foreign banks with more than $50 billion in U.S. nonbranch assets must form intermediate holding companies (IHCs) for their U.S. operations. The increase in the $50 billion threshold to $250 billion under P.L. 115-174 does not invalidate the rule implementing an IHC, capital planning, stress tests, risk management, and liquidity requirements for banks with more than $100 billion in global assets. This change does not limit the Fed's authority to establish an IHC or implement enhanced prudential standards for banks with more than $100 billion in global assets. The legislation (P.L. 115-174) mandates tailoring of enhanced regulation for foreign banks with a smaller U.S. presence. For banks with less than $100 billion in assets, changes took effect immediately, while for banks with more than $100 billion in assets, changes take effect within 18 months. The Fed has discretion to alter prudential standards for banks with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets before that date. Additionally, regulators have the discretion to reduce the number of stress test scenarios. The bill increases asset thresholds for stress tests and risk committees at banks. It also makes credit exposure report requirements discretionary for the Federal Reserve. Banks with $50 billion to $100 billion in assets no longer pay assessments for enhanced regulation, and assessments for banks with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets will be adjusted based on regulatory status. Supporters and opponents of P.L. 115-174 agree that enhanced prudential regulation should apply to systemically important banks, but disagree on which banks could pose systemic risk. Prior to the enactment of the law, there was widespread support for raising the $50 billion threshold, with critics distinguishing between regional and Wall Street banks based on their business models and activities. Banks with assets close to $50 billion face a higher regulatory burden under enhanced regulation. Identifying systemically important banks is challenging due to various potential causes of financial disruption. The issue of \"too big to fail\" is more about complexity and interdependence rather than just size. The size of banks correlates with complexity and interdependence, but size is a simpler metric. A dollar threshold could be a good proxy for systemic importance. P.L. 115-174 designates banks with assets over $250 billion automatically and applies standards for banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion to mitigate challenges in designation. The approach of using a dollar threshold to designate banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion can help mitigate drawbacks but may not eliminate them entirely. However, this method still runs the risk of including banks that do not pose systemic risk. Applying standards on a case-by-case basis would be more costly, time-consuming, and subjective, potentially leading to legal challenges. Reducing the number of banks subject to enhanced regulation could have negative effects on financial stability and second-order benefits, such as protecting taxpayers from FDIC insurance losses. It may also exacerbate the \"too big to fail\" problem if market participants view regulated banks as officially too big to fail, increasing moral hazard. The government's protection of TBTF firms reduces their incentive to monitor riskiness. Setting a low asset threshold and mandatory tailoring of regulation aims to prevent de facto TBTF designation. P.L. 115-174 mandates tailored regulation for banks with $100-250 billion in assets. Systemic risk regulation is less tailored due to the elimination of tiers at $10 billion and $50 billion. The legislation includes size-based exemptions for bank regulation, with CBO estimating a $114 million increase in the deficit due to reduced regulation on large banks. This could lead to higher costs for the FDIC insurance fund and lower fees paid to cover the Fed's regulatory duties. The legislation includes exemptions for bank regulation based on size, potentially increasing the deficit by $114 million. Banks paying fees to cover the Fed's regulatory duties may exceed the cost savings of no longer being subject to enhanced regulation. Custody banks are allowed to hold less capital against certain deposits to meet leverage ratios. Custodian banks provide unique services for asset managers, holding securities, managing interest/dividends, and facilitating ownership transfers. They argue that leverage ratios disproportionately burden them due to their business model, but others believe it measures bank capital against assets regardless of risk. The leverage ratio measures bank capital against assets regardless of risk. P.L. 115-174 allows bank regulators to define banks predominantly engaged in custody activities, potentially benefiting some banks like Bank of New York Mellon, Northern Trust, and State Street. Northern Trust could reduce its capital by $3 for every $100 deposited at central banks, while Bank of New York Mellon and State Street could reduce their capital by $6. New York Mellon, Northern Trust, and State Street could reduce their capital by $6 for every $100 of banking subsidiary deposits at central banks. The FDIC reported their deposits at the Federal Reserve at the end of December 2017. The legislation may also provide relief for deposits at foreign central banks, but the amount of capital relief could be limited. CBO estimated that the legislation would increase the budget deficit by $45 million over 10 years due to the potential impact on custodial banks. The legislation may provide relief for custodial banks like New York Mellon, Northern Trust, and State Street by reducing their capital requirements for deposits at central banks. CBO estimated a small budgetary effect due to the change in probability of bank failure under the legislation. Section 403 requires bank regulators to treat certain municipal bonds as high-quality liquid assets for compliance with the LCR. Prior to P.L. 115-174, banks could count limited municipal securities as level 2B assets, but FDIC and OCC did not. Level 2B assets can fulfill up to 50% of the LCR and cannot exceed 15% of HQLA. The LCR may increase borrowing costs for states and municipalities, but its impact on the municipal bond market is limited as few banks are subject to it. Banks under the LCR can still hold municipal bonds with stable funding. Banks subject to the LCR held $187 billion in state and municipal bonds. The LCR requires banks to hold ample liquid assets, such as municipal bonds, which may pose little default risk but can be illiquid. The total outstanding municipal debt is $3.8 trillion, with banks holding $187 billion in state and municipal bonds. Arguments that municipal bonds should qualify as HQLA are based on confusion between default risk and liquidity risk.

Title V of P.L. 115-174 provides regulatory relief for capital markets participants, streamlining registration and disclosure requirements for securities issuers and market intermediaries. Capital markets are crucial for companies to access funding through equity or debt securities. In 2016, U.S. capital markets provided 65% of financing for nonfinancial companies, surpassing bank loans. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates U.S. capital markets, which are vital for funding growth, innovation, and job creation. Policymakers debate balancing capital formation and investor protection challenges. Investor protection and capital formation are key objectives in policymaker debates. Reducing regulatory compliance can speed up capital formation but may expose investors to additional risks. These risks include reduced information for investment decisions and potential lack of compliance that could harm investor interests. Investor protection is crucial for healthy and efficient capital markets. Title V provisions aim to balance the debate between updating regulations for better capital access for small- and medium-sized companies and maintaining investor protection. Some argue for regulatory relief to facilitate capital access, while others believe existing regulations strike a balance between access and protection. Maintaining integrity and transparency in markets is crucial for investor confidence and lower capital costs. Section 501 of P.L. 115-174 alters the criteria for covered securities under the Securities Act of 1933, removing the substantially similar criterion and granting covered status to securities listed on SEC-registered exchanges. This change raises concerns about investor protection, especially for those with limited knowledge or financial resilience. The provision in Section 501 of P.L. 115-174 removes the substantially similar criterion for covered securities under the Securities Act of 1933. It grants covered status to securities listed on SEC-registered exchanges, which advocates argue could lead to more innovative and competitive exchanges. Critics, however, are concerned about the potential for lower listing standards and increased opportunities for investor fraud. For more information on securities exchange reform proposals, refer to CRS In Focus IF10862. Section 504 of P.L. 115-174, H.R. 10, and H.R. 4546 propose the creation of qualifying venture capital funds (QVCFs) exempt from the Investment Company Act of 1940. These funds target wealthy investors seeking private equity stakes in small and medium-sized firms with growth potential, providing active management and guidance. Exemption from the Act reduces registration and disclosure requirements, as venture capital funds typically need SEC registration. Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, venture capital funds must register with the SEC and comply with reporting responsibilities. Registration requires disclosures about investment objectives, financial condition, and product offerings. Investment companies must safeguard investor assets and act in their best interest. A venture capital fund can qualify as a QVCF and avoid registration if it has no more than 250 investors and $10 million in invested capital. Some argue for expanding the investor threshold for venture capital funds to improve capital access for small businesses, while others are concerned about weakening investor protections. Section 506 repeals the exemption for mutual funds in domestic territories. Section 506 repeals the exemption for mutual funds in domestic territories like Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam from the Investment Company Act of 1940, requiring them to register with the SEC and comply with regulatory oversight. This change was made to address concerns about weakening investor protections and improve capital access for small businesses. Section 507 of P.L. 115-174 increases the threshold amount of stock a company can sell to its corporate personnel without additional disclosure requirements from $5 million to $10 million over any 12-month period. This change aims to reduce compliance costs for small- and medium-sized businesses and startups. In 1988, the SEC adopted Rule 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, creating an exemption from registration requirements for nonpublic companies, including startups offering their securities. The SEC adopted Rule 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, exempting nonpublic companies, including startups, that offer securities to corporate personnel. Eligibility conditions include limits on stock issuance not exceeding $1 million or 15% of total assets. P.L. 115-174 increased the threshold to $10 million over 12 months to reduce compliance costs for small businesses. Section 507 of P.L. 115-174 raises the threshold for offerings to $10 million, triggered by certain asset or securities scenarios. Section 508 expands Regulation A+ to allow \"fully reporting\" companies exemptions from disclosure requirements for securities sales. Regulation A+ is an exemption from registration designed to help small- to medium-sized companies access capital with fewer disclosure requirements. Previously, it only applied to nonreporting companies, but now thousands of SEC reporting companies qualify for streamlined registration and disclosure under Regulation A+. This reduced disclosure may lower costs for companies but also limit information available to investors. Section 509 of P.L. 115-174 directs the SEC to allow closed-end funds to use streamlined reporting procedures under the WKSI status, previously only granted to operating companies. This allows closed-end funds to benefit from simplified registration statements. Section 509 of P.L. 115-174 allows closed-end funds to use streamlined reporting procedures under the WKSI status, enabling benefits such as shelf registration, communication with investors, and electronic prospectus delivery. If SEC rules are not finalized within a year, closed-end funds would be subject to the Securities Offering Reform of 2005. The number of closed-end funds has decreased in recent years, with some attributing this to burdensome regulation. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act includes provisions related to deposits in U.S. territories and small public housing agencies. Some argue that the decline in closed-end funds is due to burdensome regulation, but isolating the effects of regulations in a dynamic market is challenging. Section 209 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act aims to assist small public housing agencies (SPHAs) by reducing administrative requirements, implementing a corrective action process for troubled SPHAs, and creating an incentive program to reduce energy consumption. Section 211 establishes an Insurance Policy Advisory Committee on International Capital Standards and Other Insurance Issues at the Federal Reserve. Section 212 requires the National Credit Union Administration to publish a draft of its annual budget. The National Credit Union Administration is required to publish its annual budget in the Federal Register and hold public hearings. The Federal Reserve's surplus account cap is reduced from $7.5 billion to $6.825 billion, with excess funds remitted to the Treasury as general revenues. This provision is estimated to increase revenues by $478 million over 10 years, by shifting Fed remittances from the future to the present. Section 305 directs the Treasury Secretary to use loan guarantees to remediate lead and asbestos hazards in residential properties. Section 306 modifies the Family Self Sufficiency Program to unify separate programs, expand services, and make technical changes. Section 505 allows national securities exchanges to offset overpayments to the SEC against future fees. Section 308 requires a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on consumer reporting, Section 311 requires a GAO report on foreclosures in Puerto Rico, Section 312 requires a Department of Housing and Urban Development report on lead-based paint hazard prevention, Section 502 requires an SEC report on algorithmic trading in capital markets, and Section 503 amends the Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980 by requiring the SEC to release public assessments and reports on small business capital formation. Section 603 directs the Financial Literary and Education Commission to establish. Section 603 of P.L. 115-174 directs the Financial Literary and Education Commission to establish best practices for teaching financial literacy skills in higher education institutions and provide information to students for making financial decisions. Appendix A lists provisions in P.L. 115-174 that change size-based threshold criteria for certain institutions. Appendix B addresses policy issues also found in the Financial CHOICE Act (H.R. 10) and other House bills in the 115th Congress. The report discusses sections of P.L. 115-174, H.R. 10, and House bills proposing changes in financial literacy education. While some issues are similar, the bills may differ significantly in how they address them. The report does not examine the differences in detail."
