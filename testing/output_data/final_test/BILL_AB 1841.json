    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the risks posed by the increased use of information technology in public enterprises, especially in critical infrastructure within California. Protecting this infrastructure is crucial for public health, safety, and economic stability. A comprehensive cybersecurity strategy developed among state agencies will help prepare for threats to critical infrastructure, reducing potential consequences from attacks. The Department of Technology directs state agency information security standards, while the Office of Emergency Services integrates cybersecurity into the State Emergency Plan. The Department of Technology is enhancing information security incident response coordination with various agencies to prepare California for cybersecurity threats. Legislation is enacted to add to the state's comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, under the coordination of the Office of Emergency Services. In this article, \"critical infrastructure controls\" refer to vital networks and systems that, if compromised, would severely impact public health, safety, and economic security. \"Critical infrastructure information\" includes non-public data related to potential threats or attacks on these controls, whether physical or cyber-based, that violate laws or harm public interests. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms like \"Department,\" \"Office,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"State agency.\" It also mentions the importance of critical infrastructure controls' ability to resist interference or compromise. The Department must update the Technology Recovery Plan element of the State Administrative Manual by July 1, 2018, to include cybersecurity incident response standards for state agencies. Agencies need to consider costs, security of critical infrastructure information, risk management, best practices, continuity of operations, and protection of personal information. Each agency must provide the department with a copy of its updated Technology Recovery Plan. Each state agency must report its compliance with updated standards to the department by July 1, 2019. The department may suggest improvements for compliance to the head of the agency and the responsible secretary. If no secretary, suggestions will be given to the head of the agency and the Governor. The information required by Section 8592.35 and any related public records are confidential and cannot be disclosed under state law. The Legislature finds that preventing public disclosure of cybersecurity preparations and critical infrastructure information of state agencies promotes public safety by prohibiting access to those who may use the information to thwart cybersecurity controls within the state."
