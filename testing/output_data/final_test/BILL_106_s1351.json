    "content": "Credit for electricity generated from renewable sources is addressed in Section 1. Extension and Modification of Placed-in-Service Rules for wind and biomass facilities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In 2004, biomass must make up at least 75% of the monthly fuel input for the facility, or no more than 25% for coal-based electricity production. Special rules apply for qualified facilities. The 10-year period for qualified facilities begins with the enactment of the paragraph, and certain rules do not apply to facilities in service before January 1, 1997. The enactment of this paragraph adjusts the amount of the credit for projects by multiplying it by 0.59. The credit does not apply to electricity sold to utilities under certain contracts.

It does not apply to electricity sold to utilities under specific contracts, with exceptions for facilities placed in service after June 30, 1999, and contracts entered into before January 1, 1987. Amendments to contracts can affect the pricing for energy and capacity from these facilities. The contract prices exceeding avoided cost prices apply to annual electricity quantities not exceeding the average annual quantity sold to the utility in 1994-1998 or the estimate in the contract. The contract amendment allows excess energy and capacity to be sold to the utility at avoided cost prices or to a third party with advance notice.
