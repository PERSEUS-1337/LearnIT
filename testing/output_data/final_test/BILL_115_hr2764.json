    "content": "The Act titled \"Veteran Small Business Tax Credit Act of 2017\" introduces a new section, SEC. 45S, which provides a tax credit for veteran small business start-ups. The \"Veteran Small Business Tax Credit Act of 2017\" introduces section 38, offering a 15% tax credit for applicable veteran-owned businesses with qualified start-up expenditures up to $80,000. An applicable veteran-owned small business is defined as one controlled by qualified veterans who have served on active duty in the Armed Forces. The term 'controlled' in the context of the \"Veteran Small Business Tax Credit Act of 2017\" refers to the management and operation of a business by qualified veterans who have served in the Armed Forces. A small business is defined as one where the veteran owner holds at least 51% ownership in the case of a sole proprietorship, corporation, partnership, or joint venture. The term 'small business' is defined as a person engaged in a trade or business in the United States with gross receipts not exceeding $5,000,000 or employing not more than 100 full-time employees. Full-time employees are those working at least 30 hours per week for 20 or more calendar weeks in the taxable year. Qualified start-up expenditures are defined as specific expenses for new businesses. The term 'qualified start-up expenditures' includes start-up expenses defined in section 195(c) and amounts paid for real or personal property used in a trade or business. Taxpayers can elect this section for the first 2 taxable years with allowable deductions under section 162. The text discusses how controlled groups and common control are treated as a single employer for tax credit purposes. It also mentions that the basis of property will be reduced by the amount of the credit. The text introduces a new tax credit for veteran small business start-ups, which will be included as part of the general business credit. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 2018."
