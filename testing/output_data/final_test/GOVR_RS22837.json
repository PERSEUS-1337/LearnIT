It focuses on maximizing efforts against drug, human, and weapons trafficking, with Mexico increasing security spending by 24% in 2007 and the U.S. working to reduce trafficking along the border. The Initiative also supports the U.S. Strategy for Combating Criminal Gangs in Central America and Mexico, aiming to strengthen governments' capacity to intercept unauthorized activities. The M\u00c3\u00a9rida Initiative aims to enhance cooperation in combating drug trafficking, gangs, and criminal groups by providing funding for equipment and technology infrastructure improvements for Mexican military and law enforcement agencies. The Administration requested a total of $1.1 billion for Mexico and Central American countries in FY2008 and FY2009 through the INCLE account. The FY2008 supplemental request for the M\u00c3\u00a9rida Initiative included $208.3 million for the procurement of transport helicopters, ion scanners, surveillance planes, and equipment for Mexican military and law enforcement agencies. Additionally, funds were requested for inspections equipment, canine training for Mexican customs, modernizing the Mexican immigration agency's database, and securing communications systems. The FY2009 request for the M\u00c3\u00a9rida Initiative focused on non-military assistance along Mexico's southern border. It included funds for improving communications systems, database interconnectivity, forensic analysis tools, and support for the Operation Against Smugglers Initiative on Safety and Security (OASISS). The request also allocated funds to improve infrastructure and information systems at non-military agencies, such as Mexico's immigration agency, the Attorney General Office, intelligence service, postal service, and customs. The FY2009 request for the M\u00c3\u00a9rida Initiative focused on non-military assistance along Mexico's southern border, including funds for improving communications systems, forensic analysis tools, and support for OASISS. The request also allocated funds to improve infrastructure and information systems at non-military agencies like the PGR, CISEN, postal service, and customs. Military aid included $100 million for surveillance aircraft for the Mexican Navy and $20 million for gamma ray inspection equipment at Army checkpoints. The FY2008 supplemental request included aid for inspection scanners, x-ray vans, canine detection teams, security equipment, and computer infrastructure upgrades for countering money laundering. The supplemental request for FY2009 included $15.1 million to support Mexico's Secretariat of Health's drug demand reduction efforts. The majority of the assistance, $147.6 million, would go towards supporting the Mexican federal police with transport helicopters, maintenance support, mobile gamma ray inspection equipment, x-ray vans, and canine training. Additionally, $10.9 million was requested for drug demand reduction programs. The PGR would receive $19.9 million for digitalization, database improvements, and a case management system, and $5 million for its Forensic Institute. The Administration's request included $15 million for anti-corruption, transparency, and human rights support, law enforcement, court institutions, and civil society groups working to improve the justice system. The FY2009 request included significantly less funding for this category, with $23.4 million to improve the justice system, $8.5 million for the PGR's Forensic Institute, and $9.4 million for improved data collection and analysis. The FY2008 supplemental request included $37 million and the FY2009 request included $22.5 million for program support covering U.S. personnel, administration, and budget services related to the aid package. The Administration proposed spending on initiatives like the Central American Fingerprinting Exploitation (CAF\u00c9) to improve information-sharing on violent gang members and criminals, enhance drug crime information sharing, and expand police units for counternarcotics efforts. Additionally, funds were allocated for programs to enhance maritime interdiction capabilities, provide technical assistance on firearms tracing, interdiction, and destruction, and improve port, airport, and border security. The Administration proposed $3.8 million for port, airport, and border security, including equipment and training through the OAS Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism. The FY2009 request included $40 million, with $25.8 million for land and maritime interdiction, a regional arms tracking program, $1 million for drug demand reduction, and $2 million for combating currency smuggling. In the FY2008 supplemental request, $25.7 million was allocated for policing and anti-gang efforts in Central America. Additionally, $12.6 million was requested to implement the U.S. Strategy for Combating Criminal Gangs in Central America and Mexico. The Administration requested funding for combating criminal gangs from Central America and Mexico, including support for diplomatic efforts, the eTD system, anti-gang units, and community-based prevention programs. It also asked for $11.1 million for specialized police training and equipment, with $2 million for the ILEA in El Salvador. The FY2009 budget request included $13 million for the U.S. anti-gang strategy, with $7.5 million for community prevention programs. Additionally, $13 million was allocated for police modernization and technical assistance, and $6 million for the ILEA. The Administration proposed $7.7 million for rule of law. The Administration's FY2009 budget request for rule of law programs included $23 million, with increases for courts management and prosecutorial capacity training. It also allocated funds for juvenile justice systems, rehabilitation programs, and building public confidence in the justice system. Additionally, $5 million was designated for unspecified program support. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs approved the Merida Initiative to Combat Illicit Narcotics and Reduce Organized Crime Authorization Act of 2008, authorizing $1.6 billion over three years for Mexico, Central America, and the U.S. ATF to reduce illegal weapons flow. The Merida Initiative requires vetting procedures to prevent human rights violations by military or law enforcement agencies receiving assistance. FY2008 supplemental funding for the initiative was part of a broader appropriations act, providing $461.5 million with $400 million for Mexico and $61.5 million for Central America, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. The Senate version of H.R. 2642, as amended on May 22, 2008, allocated $450 million for the Merida Initiative, with $350 million for Mexico and $100 million for Central America, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. The House approved an amended version of the FY2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act, providing $465 million for Mexico and Central America. President Bush signed the bill into law on June 30, 2008, with Mexico receiving $352 million in FY2008 and $48 million in FY2009 supplemental assistance. Mexico received $352 million in FY2008 supplemental assistance and $48 million in FY2009 bridge fund supplemental assistance, while Central America, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic received $65 million in FY2008 supplemental assistance. The final enacted measure had softer human rights conditions compared to earlier versions, with funding subject to human rights conditions reduced from 25% to 15% and other conditions being softened."
