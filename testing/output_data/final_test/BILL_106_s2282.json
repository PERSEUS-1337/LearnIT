    "content": "The Act titled \"Native American Agricultural Research, Development and Export Enhancement Act of 2000\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings and purposes of the Act. The Act recognizes the special relationship between the United States and Indian tribes, reaffirmed by successive Presidents since 1970. President Clinton's 1994 executive memorandum obligated Federal departments to consider impacts on Indian tribes. The United States has an obligation to protect this relationship. The United States has a duty to safeguard and preserve the agricultural resources of Indian tribes to support strong tribal governments, self-determination, and economic self-sufficiency. Despite abundant natural resources and a cultural emphasis on self-reliance, Native Americans face high rates of unemployment, poverty, poor health, and substandard housing. Reservation-based Indians are the most rural and geographically isolated minority group, with limited resources and low access to financial support from the government. Indian land in the United States covers nearly 55,000,000 acres, with agriculture being a significant revenue source and employer in Indian country. Lack of coordination in federal agriculture programs hinders the development of Indian agriculture and tribal economic potential. About 20 percent of reservation land is estimated to receive payment or loans from the United States. (10) Approximately 20% of reservation grazing land and 70% of cropland are leased to non-Indian producers. American Indians utilize their lands for agriculture and agribusiness to enhance economic self-sufficiency and reservation employment. (11) Despite eligibility for Department of Agriculture programs, Indian producers have not fully benefited due to insufficient coordination within the department. The United States has a responsibility to assist Indian tribes in creating favorable economic and political conditions for Indian lands. The purpose of this Act is to promote coordination of agricultural programs within the Department of Agriculture for the benefit of Indian tribes, encourage trade and business development to improve the standard of living for tribal members, and create favorable economic conditions for Indian lands. The economic success of Native American communities relies on efforts from the Federal Government, tribal governments, the private sector, and individuals. The Act aims to enhance the productivity and living standards of Indian tribes, boost their economic self-sufficiency, improve access to capital and markets, develop Native economies, and promote self-determination for tribes and their members.
