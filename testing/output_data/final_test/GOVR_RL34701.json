    "content": "NATO held a summit in Bucharest, Romania in April 2008 to consider the membership candidacies of Albania, Croatia, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). Albania and Croatia received invitations to join the alliance, but Greece blocked Macedonia's invitation due to a name dispute. This marked the third round of enlargement in the post-Cold War era, following previous strategic expansions involving countries like Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and others. Albania and Croatia, former communist states, transitioned to democracy after the collapse of Yugoslavia and the end of the Cold War. Despite their small size and military capabilities, they aspired to join the European Union and NATO. Their contributions to the alliance were not considered strategically significant. NATO's purpose has evolved beyond collective defense to include missions against terrorism and weapons proliferation. The former Bush Administration urged allies to develop more mobile forces. Smaller member states like Albania and Croatia are expected to develop niche capabilities. Several allied governments believe that the overall pace of NATO enlargement is too compressed and wish to resolve issues like nationalist emotions in Serbia, NATO-Russian relations, and energy security before considering new members. NATO's founding instrument requires member states to be democracies and follow the rule of law. The NATO Treaty requires member states to be democracies, follow the rule of law, strengthen their militaries, and refrain from using force to settle disputes. Article X allows states meeting qualifications to join, with a refined process post-Cold War. The Partnership for Peace program allows non-members to train with NATO forces and seek closer ties. Some countries, like Austria, participate without seeking membership. The 1995 Study on NATO Enlargement provides a roadmap for interested governments. The 1995 Study on NATO Enlargement outlines requirements for candidate states to join NATO, including developing democratic structures, market economies, and capable military forces. It also emphasizes the need to settle disputes with neighboring countries. NATO has evolved into a collective security and defense organization, requiring prospective members to have forces trained for peacekeeping and state-building. After Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary joined in 1999, a more detailed process for prospective members was developed. Allies, led by the United States, developed the Membership Action Plan (MAP) for prospective NATO members, outlining specific steps such as civilian oversight of the military and resolving border disputes. The MAP process has been criticized for being US-centric and giving Washington the final decision on meeting requirements. The 2003 round of enlargement in NATO was criticized for not adequately assessing qualifications for new member states. The process of inviting candidate states to join the alliance was a political decision requiring consensus among member governments. Greece's opposition to Macedonia's invitation in 2008 exemplified how a single member's veto could block a state's progress. After issuing official invitations to Albania and Croatia at the April Bucharest summit, on July 9, 2008, the allies signed accession protocols for their entry into NATO. The protocols outlined NATO's expectations of the two prospective members and member governments began their constitutional processes to admit a new state or states. In some member states, such as the United Kingdom, the government had the authority to determine whether to proceed with the invitation. NATO issued invitations to Albania and Croatia at the April Bucharest summit in 2008. The process of admitting new states into NATO varied among member states, with some like the United Kingdom allowing the government to decide on admission, while others like the Netherlands had a more detailed parliamentary process. By March 2009, all 26 member states had ratified the accession protocols for Croatia, despite a maritime border dispute with Slovenia. Slovenia's parliament had ratified the protocols, but there was a movement for a national referendum on Croatia's accession. On April 1, 2009, Albania and Croatia officially became the 27th and 28th members of NATO, depositing ratified documents at the Department of State. The United States Senate has the authority to amend the Washington Treaty for NATO enlargement, with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee holding initial authority on the issue. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the full Senate may decide on voting for candidate states separately or together for NATO enlargement. Hearings are held to discuss costs, qualifications, regional security implications, relations with Russia, and new missions. In 2008, a hearing was held for Albania and Croatia's accession to NATO. Senator Dodd congratulated both countries for their progress towards NATO membership. Both Albania and Croatia were praised for their progress towards NATO membership, with a focus on achieving acceptable levels of reform in various areas. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried highlighted the significant reforms made by both countries in becoming stable democracies. Albania sought NATO membership after the fall of communism in 1989-1991. Its candidacy was evaluated based on political and economic reforms, public support, defense capabilities, and regional role. NATO's decision was a political judgment by member states. Main challenges included the pace of political reforms. Albania's current government is led by the center-right Democratic Party. Albania's current government, led by the Democratic Party of Albania (DPA), formed a coalition after the 2005 parliamentary elections. Prime Minister Sali Berisha, known for his uncompromising leadership style, has tried to moderate his image. Albanian politics have been marked by fierce conflicts and factional struggles since the first multiparty election in 1991. In 1997, public order collapsed due to financial pyramid schemes. The DPA and the Socialist Party of Albania have both faced electoral losses and allegations of fraud. Albania's political landscape has been tumultuous, with parties often disputing election results. Key issues include electoral and judicial reform, with slow progress in legislation drafting. Public support for NATO membership is high, but Albania's small size and weak economy limit its military contributions to the alliance. Albania is working on developing a small, efficient armed force with the help of the United States and NATO. The country currently has 11,020 troops, but aims to reduce this number to about 10,000 by 2010. Despite limited resources, Albania is allocating a significant portion of its budget to defense, with defense spending at 1.8% of GDP in 2007 and projected to increase to 2.01% in 2008. NATO has encouraged Albania to focus on developing specialized capabilities to support alliance missions. Albania is developing niche capabilities to assist NATO missions, including a Rapid Reaction Brigade, military police, special operations forces, explosive ordnance disposal teams, engineers, and medical support units. They plan to have 40% of their land forces ready for international missions, with 8% deployable at any one time. Despite facing limitations, Albania is committed to these reforms and has already acted as a de facto NATO ally in missions like SFOR in Bosnia and ISAF. Albania, part of ISAF in Afghanistan, lacks logistical capabilities and relies on international donations for hardware. It recognized Kosovo's independence, straining relations with Serbia. Albanian leaders oppose merging with Kosovo. Albanian leaders have repeatedly stated their opposition to merging with Kosovo and parts of Macedonia in a \"Greater Albania.\" They participate in various defense cooperation initiatives to boost NATO membership prospects and stabilize the region. Membership in NATO is seen as a way to counter extremist forces in Serbia and support pro-western forces. Croatia's progress on political and economic reforms has been generally considered very good and has not hindered its NATO candidacy. NATO countries evaluated Croatia's request for membership based on various criteria, including political and economic reforms, public support, defense capabilities, and regional role. Ultimately, NATO made a political judgment on whether Croatia's membership would enhance their security. Croatia has also been in membership negotiations with the EU since 2005. In a 2007 progress report on Croatia's EU candidacy, the European Commission praised Croatia for meeting political criteria, reforming its judiciary, and fighting corruption. Progress was noted in minority rights and the return of Serb refugees. Croatia is a functioning market economy but needs further structural reforms and less state interference. Public support for NATO membership was just over 50%. Public opinion polls in early 2008 showed support for NATO membership in Croatia barely exceeding 50%. After an attack on the Croatian embassy in Belgrade, support increased to over 60%. Opponents feared NATO would involve Croatia in unwanted conflicts and demand bases. Despite government efforts to boost support, Croatia's accession to NATO in 2009 happened quietly. The largest party in the governing coalition, HDZ, strongly supported NATO. The Croatian Democratic Community (HDZ) in the governing coalition strongly supported NATO membership for Croatia. The Social Democratic Party, the leading opposition party, also supports NATO membership but called for a public referendum. Prime Minister Sanader ruled out a referendum on NATO membership during the country's November 2007 parliamentary elections. Anti-NATO activists failed to collect enough signatures for a referendum. Croatia failed to collect enough signatures for a referendum on defense reforms. The country is transitioning to a smaller, more professional armed forces, with plans to increase deployment for international missions. Croatia aims to reach NATO's recommended defense expenditure level of 2% of GDP by 2010. Croatia is developing special operations and demining capabilities for NATO missions. They also plan to acquire helicopters and contribute infantry, defense, and engineering units. Independent assessments question Croatia's financial commitment to these reforms. Croatia has troops in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led ISAF force, leading a team that trains Afghan army units. Croatia participates in NATO missions with special operations and demining capabilities. They have troops in Afghanistan as part of the ISAF force and collaborate with Albania and Macedonia in a military medical team. Croatia did not support the U.S. invasion of Iraq and may need logistical support to deploy forces. Relations with neighbors are generally peaceful, with a dispute with Slovenia over a maritime boundary. Relations with Serbia have improved since democratic governments came to power in both countries. Croatia has played a positive role in Bosnia and Herzegovina, encouraging ethnic Croats to work within the Bosnian political system. In March 19, Croatia recognized Kosovo diplomatically. Since 2003, Croatia, Albania, and Macedonia have cooperated in defense reforms through the U.S.-sponsored Adriatic Charter to enhance their NATO membership prospects. Macedonia, with strong domestic support, has been working closely with NATO on reforms since joining the Membership Action Plan in 1999. Macedonia has made progress in implementing political, economic, and military reforms under NATO's Membership Action Plan. NATO representatives have praised Macedonia's efforts but noted that more needs to be accomplished. The state of political reforms remains a key factor in Macedonia's NATO candidacy prospects. The reform priorities in Macedonia include meeting democratic standards, reducing corruption and organized crime, judicial reform, improving public administration, and promoting good-neighborly relations. Political conflict in 2007 caused deadlock in parliament, leading to stalled progress on key reform measures. The government nearly fell after an ethnic Albanian party briefly left the coalition, resulting in snap elections on June 1. Prime Minister Gruevski won a crushing victory. The June 1 election saw Prime Minister Gruevski's VRMO-DPMNE party secure a decisive win, forming a coalition with an ethnic Albanian party. Macedonia's EU candidacy has been praised, but concerns remain over political tensions hindering reforms and accession talks. Macedonia prioritizes unfulfilled defense goal with extensive track record of reforms and global contributions. Army undergoing restructuring for smaller, professional force with niche capabilities for allied operations. Downsizing forces to 8,000 troops by 2008, focusing on special forces and military police. Sustained contributions to international missions and reducing limitations on use. Macedonia has made significant contributions to international missions, including providing security in Kabul, Afghanistan, personnel to the EU force in Bosnia, and a special operations unit in Baghdad. It also hosts a NATO headquarters in Skopje for Balkan operations. However, its prospects for NATO membership have been hindered by a longstanding dispute with Greece over the use of the name \"Macedonia.\" Since 1995, U.N. Envoy Matthew Nimetz has been working with Greece and Macedonia to resolve their dispute over the name issue. Despite new proposals, no agreement was reached. The dispute became linked to Macedonia's NATO candidacy, with Greece threatening to veto if no resolution was found. Macedonia argued it had already made concessions. Macedonia made concessions in the name dispute, rejecting linking accession to it. NATO urged a compromise through the Nimetz process. Talks on the name issue were expected to conclude soon. NATO member states contribute to the alliance through armed forces deployment. During the period leading up to the first round of enlargement in central and eastern Europe in 1999, analysts estimated the cost of adding new members to NATO at between $10 billion and $125 billion, funded by individual contributions from member states based on per capita GDP. Some Members of Congress expressed concern over the cost projections and burden-sharing arrangements. The NATO study estimated that enlargement would require $1.5 billion in common funds expenditures over 10 years, with the 2004 round of enlargement costing a similar amount. The inclusion of ten new contributors to the NATO common funds reduced the percentage shares of established members, including the United States. In preparation for the 2009 NATO summit, estimates of total cost and cost-sharing implications for a new round of enlargement were deemed valid by NATO staff and allies. The costs of prior rounds of enlargement were still valid, with the addition of new members in 2009 not entailing significant costs. Main expenses would be for air defense upgrades, facility improvements, and secure communications. Cost issues have received little attention, with focus on member capabilities and willingness to contribute. The NATO alliance focuses on member states' willingness to contribute military assets, political agenda development, and the importance of candidate states developing professional military and democratic structures. The former Bush Administration and the new Obama administration supported the entry of new European NATO member states into the European Union to build stability. They believed Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia had made progress in improving their militaries and political institutions, contributing to the political stabilization of southeastern Europe. The United States also supported the entry of countries like Georgia into NATO. The United States strongly supported Georgia and Ukraine's entry into NATO, advocating for them to join the Membership Action Plan (MAP) despite opposition from some allies. The Bush Administration promoted a clear roadmap to NATO membership for both countries, emphasizing their qualifications and the need for stability in the region. Both presidential candidates in the 2008 election expressed support for Georgia and Ukraine's NATO aspirations. The Obama Administration also supports the idea of a \"NATO with global partners,\" engaging countries like Australia, New Zealand, and Japan in stabilizing Afghanistan without actively promoting their membership in the alliance. Partnership for Peace status has been extended to central Asian governments, supported by successive U.S. administrations for various reasons, even if some are not democratic. The Partnership for Peace (PfP) was initially aimed at integrating former Soviet Republics into the west and promoting human rights and democratic practices in central Asia. Some non-democratic governments in the region have provided logistical support to allied operations in Afghanistan and are crucial for energy security due to their oil and natural gas resources. Georgia, after its \"rose revolution\" in 2003, prioritized integration with NATO and became a significant contributor to coalition efforts in Afghanistan. Georgia, the third largest contributor to coalition operations in Iraq, deployed 2,000 troops. It joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 1994 and aspired to NATO membership in 2002. The Senate approved a resolution urging NATO to award Georgia a Membership Action Plan (MAP) in 2008. Despite progress in its economy, the conflict with Russia in August 2008 hindered Georgia's growth. The Russia-Georgia conflict in August 2008 significantly impacted Georgia's GDP growth, reducing it to 3.5% from 12.4% in 2007. The Georgian military aimed to enhance interoperability with NATO by modernizing its equipment. NATO's failure to offer Georgia a Membership Action Plan in 2008 may have emboldened Russia's aggression towards Georgia. The Russia-Georgia conflict in August 2008, fueled by Georgia's integration with the west, aimed to crush Georgia's independence and NATO aspirations. France and Germany opposed Georgia's NATO membership after the crisis due to tensions over separatist regions and military actions in South Ossetia. The US supported Georgia's NATO Membership Action Plan in April 2008, but the conflict with Russia put it on hold. NATO condemned Russia's military incursion into Georgia as disproportionate and the recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia's independence as violating Georgia's territorial integrity. The NATO-Russia Council was temporarily suspended in August 2008 due to the conflict between Russia and Georgia. A NATO-Georgia Council was formed to address Georgia's post-conflict needs, with the inaugural meeting held in Tbilisi in September 2008. NATO reaffirmed its commitment to Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, offering assistance through a reform program outlined in Georgia's Individual Partnership Action Plan. At the December 2008 NATO foreign ministerial meeting, the issue of offering a Membership Action Plan to Georgia was avoided, instead offering increased assistance through an Annual National Program. At a meeting of the NATO-Georgia Commission, foreign ministers assured Georgia of further assistance in implementing reforms for NATO membership. They emphasized the importance of democratic reform progress and called for a review of security documents and military personnel management. NATO announced increased staffing at its liaison office in Tbilisi. At a NATO meeting, defense ministers discussed recovery assistance to Georgia and Russia's military bases in breakaway regions. Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer expressed disagreement with Russia's actions and called for discussions through the NATO-Russia Council. NATO agreed to reopen talks with Russia to press for compliance with ceasefire accords and to revoke recognition and basing arrangements with Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Secretary of State Clinton emphasized NATO's commitment to Georgia and Ukraine's eventual Alliance membership and to work with them against Russian intimidation. She also highlighted the benefits of reenergizing the NATO-Russia Council and argued against punishing Russia by stopping conversations with them. Lithuania's foreign minister disagreed, calling the renewal of NATO-Russia Council meetings premature. The Lithuanian foreign minister disagreed with Secretary of State Clinton's stance on renewing NATO-Russia Council meetings, citing unchanged Russian behavior. However, Lithuania would still call for meetings to address Georgia's territorial integrity. Most Georgians support NATO membership, with 77% voting in favor in a plebiscite held during the January 2008 presidential election. Opposition parties also back Georgia's accession to NATO. In January 2008, most Georgians supported NATO membership, with 77% voting in favor during a plebiscite. However, some opposition parties warned against joining NATO, fearing it would require accepting the independence of separatist regions. A Polish think-tank noted that the conflict in Georgia had slowed down the integration process with NATO, potentially delaying membership for years. The NATO-Georgia Commission continues to address concerns about Georgia's armed forces and leadership trustworthiness. NATO will work with Georgia through the Commission but is unlikely to raise the issue of Membership Action Plan (MAP) or membership soon. Ukraine is in an \"Intensified Dialogue\" with NATO for possible future membership. President Yushchenko, PM Tymoshenko, and parliament speaker Yatsenyuk requested NATO membership in 2008. Yatsenyuk, Yushchenko, and Tymoshenko requested a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Ukraine at the NATO summit in Bucharest in 2008. Supporters believe Ukraine's membership would strengthen ties with the Euro-Atlantic community and serve as a defense against potential Russian threats. Ukraine's future MAP candidacy at NATO faces challenges due to a lack of consensus on membership within Ukrainian society. Public opinion polls show less than one-third support NATO membership, with regional divides evident. Southern and eastern regions, with Russian-speaking populations, oppose NATO due to fears of worsening ties with Russia. In contrast, western Ukraine, with a higher support for a western orientation, favors NATO membership. Support for a western orientation in Ukraine is high, especially in western regions, despite challenges due to regional divides. Many fear NATO membership could lead to involvement in conflicts like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. President Yushchenko strongly supports NATO, while Prime Minister Tymoshenko is less enthusiastic but has signed letters to NATO in support. Ukraine's past involvement in the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq was unpopular, leading to troop withdrawal in 2005. Despite opposition from the Party of Regions and the Communist Party, Yushchenko signed letters supporting MAP for Ukraine in 2008. The parliament resumed operations in March 2008 after passing a resolution to consider NATO membership only after a public referendum. Ukrainian leaders recognize the need for a public information campaign to increase support for NATO membership. Domestic consensus on NATO membership is crucial for future Ukrainian governments to fulfill MAP terms. In 2008, President Yushchenko stated that Ukraine will not allow NATO bases on its soil, except for Russia's Black Sea naval base. US officials emphasized the need for broad government support, defense reforms, and public education on NATO before considering membership. The January 2008 letter to NATO Secretary General addressed these concerns. President Bush supported granting a Membership Action Plan (MAP) to Ukraine at the Bucharest summit, despite European NATO allies' reluctance due to concerns about Ukraine's qualifications and relations with Russia. The allies praised Ukraine's contributions to Alliance operations but declined to offer a MAP at the summit. At the 2008 Bucharest summit, NATO pledged support for Georgia and Ukraine's eventual membership without specifying a timeline. The decision on Membership Action Plans for Kiev and Tbilisi was postponed to a later meeting. The outcome caused mixed reactions in Ukraine, with President Yushchenko seeing it as progress towards NATO membership, while Yanukovych and the opposition viewed it as a setback to pro-NATO policies. Supporters of a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Ukraine believed it would deter Russia's aggressive tactics and reject Moscow's sphere of influence in post-Soviet countries. However, opposition from European NATO countries grew after the conflict with Georgia, fearing strained relations with Moscow and potential military conflict. Ukraine's unstable government, marked by tensions between Prime Minister Tymoshenko and President Yushchenko, also impacted its MAP prospects. Tymoshenko's support for a Membership Action Plan (MAP) in 2008 may have been a tactical move to improve Ukraine's political climate. NATO declined to offer a MAP to Ukraine but agreed to work on \"Annual National Programs\" to assist Ukraine's defense reform efforts. France and Germany warned against seeing this as a shortcut to NATO membership, emphasizing that a MAP would still be necessary. The NATO-Ukraine Commission met in March 2009 to discuss Ukraine's progress towards NATO aspirations. The NATO-Ukraine Commission met at the foreign ministers' level to discuss Ukraine's development of its first Annual National Program. The issue of NATO membership has faded from Ukraine's political agenda in 2009 due to the global financial crisis and the upcoming elections where President Yushchenko is likely to be replaced. Leading candidates have differing views on a Membership Action Plan (MAP), with Viktor Yanukovych opposed to it and Prime Minister Tymoshenko's advocacy fading. Russian leaders were dissatisfied with the outcome of the 2008 Bucharest summit. Russia strongly opposed NATO's pledge of eventual membership for Ukraine, viewing the country as within its sphere of influence. Putin warned of military countermeasures, including aiming missiles at Ukraine, if it joined NATO or hosted foreign bases. The Russian General Staff also threatened military action if Ukraine joined the alliance. NATO's unfinished business in the region was highlighted in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee testimony. Secretary Fried emphasized NATO's unfinished business in Georgia and Ukraine, stating that both countries are not ready for membership yet. The United States supports their entry into NATO's Membership Action Plan, considering the aspirations of the people in these countries. Other countries in the Partnership for Peace program, like Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, could also seek full NATO membership in the future. At the Bucharest summit, NATO invited Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina to start an Intensified Dialogue for membership aspirations. Serbia may request a similar dialogue, but political consensus is lacking. Kosovo may seek closer ties with NATO through PfP. Some allied governments believe NATO enlargement should proceed more slowly, opposing placing Georgia and Ukraine in the MAP at Bucharest. Some allied governments oppose placing Georgia and Ukraine in the MAP at Bucharest, citing the need to address issues such as nationalist emotions in Serbia, NATO-Russian relations, and energy security before considering new countries for membership. Political factors, stabilization of southeastern Europe, Russia's role in European security, and bilateral relations also influence candidate states' applications for NATO membership. NATO's decision to intervene in Kosovo in 1999 underscores the importance of stability in southeastern Europe for both NATO and the EU. NATO's intervention in Kosovo in 1999 and the creation of Kosovo Force (KFOR) to maintain stability, along with the EU's supervision of Kosovo's independence, have sparked strong reactions from Serbia and Russia. Despite opposition, the US and most EU countries recognized Kosovo's independence in 2008. Serbia's government refuses to accept Kosovo's independence and may be inciting unrest among the Serbian minority in northern Kosovo. Serbia seeks integration into Europe through EU membership and supports closer relations with NATO. Public opposition in Serbia to full NATO membership hinders political support for intensified dialogue. Russia opposes Ukraine and Georgia's NATO membership, threatening nuclear targeting on Ukraine. Russia has used natural gas supply reductions and cyber attacks to intimidate these countries and obstruct improved relations with NATO. The conflict between Russia and Georgia in August 2008 has raised concerns within NATO about the collective defense clause in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. There are debates on whether Russia would have invaded Georgia if it were a NATO member and how NATO would have responded. This conflict has prompted discussions on the possibility of armed conflict between NATO and Russia. The conflict between Russia and Georgia in 2008 raised concerns within NATO about Article 5's credibility for collective defense. The Baltic states and Poland are worried about NATO's response to an attack on a member. Debate over Article 5 may intensify as NATO considers enlargement near Russia's sphere of influence. Albania and Croatia's membership could bring stability to southeastern Europe. The US and other allies expect new members to contribute to niche capabilities. NATO and leading governments expect new member states to develop niche capabilities for global operations. US officials view NATO as key for transatlantic security and peace in Europe. Challenges include Afghanistan stabilization, global terrorism, cyber-attacks, energy security, and relations with Russia. Gazprom's efforts to control Europe's energy network are a concern. Gazprom's control over Europe's energy network poses a threat to energy security in the region. Efforts to reduce dependence on Russian energy sources through new pipelines and conservation measures will be costly and time-consuming. Some allies believe that enhancing energy security is crucial before extending NATO invitations to vulnerable countries. Improving relations with Russia will be a key focus for European allies. The Senate has supported NATO enlargement through various legislation, authorizing assistance to former Soviet Bloc countries and endorsing eastward expansion. Conditions were set before ratifying treaty protocols for NATO's enlargements in 1998 and 2004. The Senate's resolutions for NATO enlargement in 1998 and 2004 included a condition for the president to submit detailed reports on countries being considered for membership, evaluating their eligibility, military readiness, and impact on US national security interests. The reports also analyze common-funded military requirements and costs associated with integrating the country into NATO. In 2006, Senator Richard Lugar introduced a bill supporting NATO enlargement for Albania, Croatia, Georgia, and Macedonia. The bill passed the Senate but was not taken up by the House International Relations Committee before the end of the 109th Congress. In the 110th Congress, successor bills were passed in both chambers to support NATO enlargement. The NATO Freedom Consolidation Act of 2007, introduced by Senator Lugar, passed both the Senate and the House in the 110th Congress. It reaffirmed the US commitment to NATO enlargement and called for the admission of Albania, Croatia, Georgia, Macedonia, and Ukraine to NATO. President Bush signed it into law on April 9, 2007. The NATO Freedom Consolidation Act of 2007 supports the admission of Albania, Croatia, Georgia, Macedonia, and Ukraine into NATO, contingent upon their democratic, defense, and economic reforms. It also authorizes security assistance for these countries in line with NATO conditions. The NATO Participation Act supports security assistance for prospective NATO member states, including the transfer of defense articles, military education and training, and military financing. It aims to promote joint planning, training, and interoperability with NATO forces. The Senate and House passed resolutions expressing strong support for Georgia and Ukraine to enter a Membership Action Plan with NATO, highlighting their contributions to collective security. The resolutions supported Georgia and Ukraine's entry into a Membership Action Plan with NATO, emphasizing their contributions to collective security. Despite US support, some European allies opposed extending an invitation due to uncertainty over Georgia's political situation. The uncertainty over the Georgian political situation and internal turmoil in the Ukrainian government were cited as reasons for not extending a Membership Action Plan (MAP) to either country in 2008 or 2009. Concerns about burden-sharing within NATO and the impact of further enlargement on relations with Russia were discussed by Members of Congress and the US delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly."
