    "content": "The USDA enforces the Animal Welfare Act for certain animals, excluding farm animals for food. The Humane Methods of Slaughter Act governs livestock handling. The Twenty-Eight Hour Law limits animal confinement in transport. Some state laws address animal cruelty for farm animals. In some states, ballot measures have been passed to impose care standards on animal producers, such as outlawing gestation crates for pigs and veal stalls for calves. California's Proposition 2 requires better living conditions for veal calves, egg-laying hens, and pregnant pigs, with violators facing fines and jail time. Maine and Michigan have also enacted laws regulating the housing of farm animals. Many animal protection groups argue that current industrial farming practices are harmful. Industrial farming systems perpetuate harmful practices for animals' well-being, such as confining livestock in small spaces, performing surgeries on animals, and not fully stunning them before slaughter. Some groups also link intensive animal agriculture to soil and water pollution and food safety issues. Animal rights groups and farmers disagree on the impact of biotechnology on animal welfare. While farmers argue they understand and address animals' needs, critics fear future biotech applications like animal cloning and genetic alterations will compromise animal well-being. Some groups even argue against using animals for any purpose, including food. Agricultural and animal science groups advocate for science, education, and voluntary guidelines over potentially harmful regulations. Some major food retailers have developed humane animal care standards for suppliers to follow in response to customer concerns. Industry groups like the American Meat Institute and National Chicken Council have published voluntary care standards, along with third-party certification programs to assure consumers of animal welfare. However, some animal welfare groups argue that these voluntary standards may not be strong or specific enough. Some groups argue that voluntary industry standards for animal welfare are not strong or enforceable. Members of Congress have proposed changes in animal treatment on farms, during transport, and at slaughter. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees prefer voluntary approaches over regulatory ones. In the 110th Congress, the Farm Animals Anti-Cruelty Act aimed to prevent unjustified harm to animals held for commercial use. The Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act (H.R. 4733) imposes penalties for failing to provide necessary care to animals used for commercial purposes. Another bill, H.R. 1726, aimed to ensure products derived from animals met humane standards. The bill referred to the House Agriculture Committee's Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry would have prohibited federal agencies from purchasing food products derived from certain animals unless raised with adequate space. Exemptions were provided for various situations such as transport, slaughter, exhibitions, research, veterinary procedures, and pregnancy. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to phase out nontherapeutic use of antibiotic drugs in food animals to address concerns of antibiotic resistance. Hearings were held on antibiotic use in animals, emphasizing the importance of judicious antimicrobial drug use. FDA published draft guidance on antimicrobial use in June 2010. In June 2010, FDA published draft guidance on antimicrobial use in food animals, stating that using medically important antimicrobial drugs for non-therapeutic purposes in animals is not in the interest of public health. Witnesses at a July 2010 hearing discussed the importance of managing antibiotic use in animal agriculture through science-based policies and highlighted the increased reliance on therapeutic antibiotics in Denmark after banning growth-promoting antibiotics. Some advocated for following Denmark's example and banning the use of antibiotics in food animals. In February 2008, USDA announced the largest-ever meat recall by Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Co. due to violations of regulations on nonambulatory cattle and the Humane Slaughter Act. Animal welfare advocates exposed inhumane handling of downer cattle before slaughter. The Humane Slaughter Act requires humane handling during slaughter. Despite criticism for lack of enforcement, Congress has allocated funds for full-time inspectors and a tracking system. In 2010, a hearing reviewed FSIS performance in enforcing the law. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that FSIS inspectors were inconsistently enforcing the Humane Slaughter Act due to unclear guidance and inadequate training. FSIS announced the appointment of an ombudsman in January 2011 to address animal humane handling issues. FSIS is requesting an audit by USDA's Office of the Inspector General on industry appeals of noncompliance records and humane handling enforcement actions. In 2005, a Senate amendment aimed to ban nonambulatory livestock from human food, but it was removed before final passage. The proposal resurfaced in the 110th Congress as S. 394 and H.R. 661. In the 110th and 111th Congress, proposals were made to ban the slaughter of nonambulatory livestock and require their humane euthanization. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 also included a provision to prohibit federal funds for inspecting nonambulatory disabled cattle for human food. The House Agriculture Committee considered a measure to extend coverage beyond slaughter facilities to livestock markets, aiming to end the slaughter of horses for human food. Foreign-owned plants in Texas and Illinois were closed in 2007 due to legal bans on horsemeat commerce. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case regarding the constitutionality of a law banning equine slaughter. Congress considered measures to ban or limit horse slaughter, with amendments to ban funding for horse inspection. USDA allowed voluntary ante-mortem inspection services funded by user fees, which started in 2006. The FY2008 USDA appropriation also prohibited the use of appropriated funds for horse inspection. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 prohibited the use of funds for inspecting horses before slaughter for human consumption. Animal welfare groups push for legislation to permanently end horse slaughter. The American Veterinary Medical Association argues that banning horse slaughter in the US has led to an increase in horses being sent to Mexico and Canada for processing. The bills H.R. 503, H.R. 6598, and H.R. 6278 aimed to prevent horse exports and improve transportation safety. H.R. 503/S. 727 and H.R. 305 were reintroduced in the 111th Congress but did not progress further in committees."
