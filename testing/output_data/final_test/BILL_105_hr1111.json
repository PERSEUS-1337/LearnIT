The Congress recognizes lupus as a serious autoimmune disease that predominantly affects women, with three main types: systemic lupus, discoid lupus, and drug-induced lupus. Lupus can be fatal if not detected early and can affect various parts of the body. It disproportionately affects African-American women. African-American women are three times more likely to develop lupus compared to white women. Between 1,400,000 and 2,000,000 Americans have been diagnosed with the disease. Current treatments can have damaging side effects, leading to debilitating pain and fatigue for many sufferers. In fiscal year 1996, the National Institutes of Health allocated $33,000,000 for lupus research, less than half a percent of their budget. Expansion and intensification of activities for lupus research under Title I of the Public Health Service Act. The Director of the Institute will expand and intensify research on lupus, coordinating with other national research institutes. Research will focus on understanding the causes and finding a cure for lupus, including investigating the higher prevalence in women, especially African-American women.
