    "content": "Federal forestry assistance for nonfederal landowners has been a part of USDA programs for over a century, starting with the creation of the USDA Division of Forestry in 1881. The Division later merged with the Interior Department's Division of Forestry to become the USDA Forest Service in 1905. The State and Private Forestry branch, along with forestry research and management of the National Forest System, are the primary missions of the Forest Service. The Clarke-McNary Act of 1924 reestablished authority for forestry assistance programs. The Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 (CFAA) replaced the Clarke-McNary Act of 1924 and has been amended multiple times through various farm bills, such as the 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008 farm bills. These amendments added, rewrote, and modified provisions, creating over a dozen forestry assistance programs. The Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 replaced the Clarke-McNary Act of 1924 and has been amended multiple times through various farm bills, creating over a dozen forestry assistance programs primarily administered by the FS with authorized funding levels. These programs require annual funding and are listed in decreasing order of FY2013 appropriations. They provide aid to states for forestry practices to improve timber productivity or enhance resource values. The 2008 farm bill expanded conservation programs to include forestry practices, offering financial assistance to private forest landowners for protection from wildfire, insects, diseases, and preventing forest conversion. Forest health and fire protection activities can be implemented on private lands with landowner cooperation. Other programs provide financial and technical assistance to government entities for forest protection. Protection programs offer financial and technical assistance to government entities, including states, local governments, communities, volunteer fire departments, and Indian tribes. Nonprofit organizations can also receive grants through the Community Forestry and Open Space Conservation program. Two forest recovery programs provide funding to private landowners in response to disasters. The Emergency Reforestation Program, created in 1990, has not been funded since 1993. The Emergency Forest Restoration Program, established in the 2008 farm bill, aids landowners in recovering from natural disasters. International Forestry, which offers technical assistance to other nations, is also funded through S&PF appropriations. Several forestry assistance programs offer technical and financial aid for planning and implementing forestry practices, including grants and cost-sharing options. Some programs focus on providing only technical assistance, while others offer financial assistance such as grants or cost-sharing with recipients. Additionally, there are programs like Forest Health Protection and Forest Legacy that provide specific financial provisions for activities like surveying and controlling insects or diseases on private lands, as well as federal purchase of lands or easements. The Forest Stewardship program, funded through the Rural Assistance and Assistance to States programs, aims to improve timber production and environmental protection on nonfederal forest lands by encouraging long-term stewardship of private forest lands. The Forest Land Enhancement Program, a forestry-specific landowner assistance program, was not reauthorized in the 2008 farm bill and may be repealed in the 2014 farm bill. The Forest Stewardship program focuses on improving timber production and environmental protection on nonfederal private forest lands. National priorities for Forest Stewardship include conserving working forests, protecting forests from threats, and enhancing public benefits. The Forest Stewardship program aims to restore appropriate forest types, enhance public benefits from private forests, and provide technical assistance to private landowners for managing timber, wildlife habitat, water quality, and recreational resources. Practices such as afforestation, reforestation, and timber stand improvement are encouraged to sustain the long-term productivity of forest resources. The Forest Stewardship program aims to enhance public benefits from private forests by providing technical and financial aid to states for managing timber and non-timber resources, protecting forests from damage, and addressing threats to forest lands. States must prepare assessments and strategies to be eligible for funds. The Forest Stewardship program, added to the CFAA in 1990, aims to enhance public benefits from private forests by providing aid to states for managing resources and protecting forests. States must update assessments and strategies as needed, coordinating with relevant agencies. Funding for Forest Stewardship is authorized annually, with no expiration, while funding for statewide assessments was authorized for FY2008-FY2012. The Rural Forestry Assistance program under the CFAA provides financial, technical, and educational assistance to private forest landowners and managers for managing and protecting nonfederal forests from various threats. This includes support for establishing timber stands, improving soils, and water yields. The Rural Forestry Assistance program provides financial, technical, and related assistance to private forest landowners for managing and protecting nonfederal forests. Assistance includes distributing tree seeds, assisting with forest management practices, and protecting soil fertility and water quality. The program is authorized for annual appropriations and is part of the Forest Stewardship program. The State Assistance program aims to coordinate state and federal organizations to assist private landowners. It provides financial, technical, and related assistance to state foresters for improving organizational management and forest data collection. This includes assistance in organizational management, program planning, budgeting, personnel training, information services, and recordkeeping. The program provides assistance to state foresters in the assembly, analysis, display, and reporting of State forest resources data, as well as in training State forest resources planners. It also includes a program of technology implementation and financial, technical, and related assistance to states. The funding authorization is indefinite, and the program has been integrated into the Forest Stewardship program since FY1993. Additionally, the Urban and Community Forestry Assistance program aims to promote the value of urban trees and support their maintenance and expansion. The Urban and Community Forestry Assistance program aims to improve understanding of the benefits of preserving existing tree cover in urban areas, encourage tree maintenance and expansion on private properties, provide education and technical assistance, offer competitive grants for forestry projects, implement tree planting programs for urban open spaces, promote demonstration projects, enhance technical skills in tree maintenance, and expand research and educational efforts. The Urban and Community Forestry program aims to assist urban areas and communities in inventorying forest resources, identifying tree planting opportunities, organizing forestry projects, improving education and technical support for tree species selection, and cooperating with local governments and the public to promote urban forestry programs. The Urban and Community Forestry program aims to improve education and technical support for tree planting, maintenance, and protection in urban areas. It also seeks to increase public understanding of the values of trees and open spaces in urban environments. Additionally, the program establishes a cost-share program for competitive grants to eligible communities and organizations for up to 50% of project costs. State foresters make recommendations on project proposals, and grants are awarded based on criteria developed in consultation with the National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council. The Urban and Community Forestry program, established under the CFAA, allows any community, private nonprofit organization, or individual to apply for assistance. It is authorized for annual appropriations and includes five programs for financial and technical assistance in protecting nonfederal forests. Two programs receive funding through S&PF and Wildland Fire Management appropriations. The Forest Health Protection program aims to protect trees and wood products on national forests and other lands. It focuses on enhancing tree growth, promoting forest-related industries, aiding in fire prevention, conserving forest cover, and extending timber supplies. The Forest Service aims to protect trees and wood products by conducting surveys, monitoring insect infestations and diseases, and providing assistance for maintaining healthy forests. They also develop technologies, promote management techniques, and coordinate the use of pesticides. Operations on other lands require consent and cooperation. The Forest Service requires consent and cooperation for operations on other lands, including financial contributions. Appropriations may not be used for cutting or removing dead trees unless necessary to prevent the spread of disease. Financial assistance may be provided to monitor forest health and protect forest lands. Cost shares may be provided for integrated pest management strategies for insect infestations. The Forest Health Protection program, originally created as Section 5 of the CFAA, is now codified at 16 U.S.C. 2104. Annual appropriations are authorized at \"such sums as may be necessary,\" with a $10 million annual authorization for cost-sharing on integrated pest management strategies. Funding has increased significantly since the 1990s, with over $100 million annually in recent years, but has decreased by nearly 25% since FY2010. Rural Fire Protection was created to prevent and control wildfires in rural areas, with two components: state fire assistance and rural volunteer fire assistance. The program aims to coordinate efforts and provide assistance during rural fire emergencies. Funding has decreased by nearly 25% since FY2010. The Rural Fire Protection program aims to assist rural volunteer fire departments by providing cost-share assistance for preparedness and mobilization activities. The program also cooperates with the General Services Administration to encourage the use of excess personal property by state and local fire forces. The Secretary is authorized to provide financial, technical, and related assistance to state foresters and rural volunteer fire departments. The Rural Fire Protection program, established under the CFAA, provides cost-share assistance to rural volunteer fire departments. Annual appropriations have varied, with funding authorization not expiring. Congress also appropriates funds for Volunteer Fire Assistance grants. The Rural Community Fire Protection program, initially authorized under the Agriculture Act of 1973, was replaced by an unrelated program in the 1996 farm bill. Funding for the program shifted to the Cooperative Fire Protection in the S&PF branch under the Rural Housing Service. Appropriations have increased significantly, averaging around $14 million annually in recent years. The Forest Legacy program aims to protect forests threatened by non-forest uses, such as agriculture or residences. The program allows the Forest Service to acquire lands and conservation easements from willing landowners to preserve important ecological values. The Forest Service is authorized to acquire lands and conservation easements to protect forests from non-forest uses. Landowners must manage acquired property in line with program purposes, allowing for recreational activities. Acquisition process involves consultation with state committees. The Forest Service establishes criteria for identifying eligible areas with significant environmental values or threatened by nonforest uses. Priority is given to lands with important scenic, recreational, wildlife, and ecological values. Private landowners in eligible areas can apply for participation, and grants may be provided to states for program implementation. The Forest Legacy program was added to the CFAA in 1990. The Community Forest and Open Space Conservation program, established under the CFAA, provides financial assistance to prevent forestland conversion. Grants are awarded to purchase threatened private forestlands for public benefits. Appropriations have varied over the years, with a peak of $76 million in FY2010. The Community Forest and Open Space Conservation program, established under the CFAA, provides financial assistance to prevent forestland conversion by awarding grants to purchase threatened private forestlands for public benefits. Grant recipients must provide at least 50% of the appraised cost and manage the lands for public access. Eligible entities apply to state foresters for grants with a description of the lands to be acquired and a management plan. The program was established in the 2008 farm bill and is codified at 16 U.S.C. 2103d with no expiration date for appropriations. The Community Fire Protection program, established under the CFAA, aims to reduce threats from wildfires by promoting firefighting efficiency, expanding outreach and education, and establishing defensible space around private homes. The program allows the FS to work on nonfederal lands with the landowner's consent for various activities such as fuel hazard mitigation, invasive species management, and community protection planning. The Community Fire Protection program, established under the CFAA, aims to reduce wildfire threats by promoting firefighting efficiency and establishing defensible space around private homes. Appropriations were authorized at $35 million annually for FY2002-FY2007, with no expiration date. Congress has not funded the program, but states can use Rural Fire Protection funds for its purposes. Two programs provide financial assistance to landowners for natural disaster damage, but neither has received funding in recent years. The Emergency Reforestation Assistance program, created in the 2008 farm bill, aims to reforest stands damaged by natural disasters. Eligible landowners can receive seedlings or reimbursement for up to 65% of reforestation costs for tree stands with significant mortality from various damaging weather conditions or related issues. Eligible landowners include those who produce annual commercial crops from up to 500 acres of trees, own up to 1,000 acres of forestland, or own 1,000-5,000 acres of forestland with approval from the Secretary. The Emergency Reforestation Assistance program, established in the 2008 farm bill, provides assistance to landowners with damaged tree stands from natural disasters. Eligible landowners can receive up to 65% reimbursement for reforestation costs. Landowners owning 1,000-5,000 acres of forestland may qualify if their gross revenues do not exceed $2 million. The program prohibits payments over $25,000 in a fiscal year and to those receiving other forestry assistance. Funding for the program has not been allocated since FY1993. The Emergency Forest Restoration program, administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency, provides financial assistance for emergency measures to restore forest health on nonindustrial private forest land after natural disasters. Requests for assistance up to $50,000 per person or legal entity are approved by the FSA county committee, while requests from $50,001 to $100,000 are approved by the FSA state committee. Assistance over $100,000 requires approval from the FSA national office, with a payment limitation of $500,000 per person or legal entity per disaster. The Emergency Forest Restoration program provides financial assistance for emergency measures to restore forest health on nonindustrial private forest land after natural disasters. Eligible recipients include owners of nonindustrial private forest land with existing tree cover that has been damaged by a natural disaster. The program was created by Section 8203 of the 2008 farm bill. The International Forestry Program, created under the 2008 farm bill, provides technical assistance to other nations on forest management for sustainable development and global environmental stability. Funding is authorized at \"such funds as may be necessary\" and typically provided through supplemental appropriations. Annual appropriations are detailed in Table 9. The International Forestry Program, established under the 2008 farm bill, offers technical assistance to other countries in managing forests sustainably for environmental stability. Assistance includes controlling damaging agents, conserving rangelands, and protecting wildlife habitats. Aid is provided upon request or with the approval of the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), focusing on key countries impacting greenhouse gas emissions. The program was created in the International Forestry Cooperation Act of 1990. The International Forestry Program, established under the 2008 farm bill, provides technical assistance to other countries in managing forests sustainably. Aid is given upon request or with the approval of the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, focusing on key countries impacting greenhouse gas emissions. The program was created in the International Forestry Cooperation Act of 1990, with appropriations authorized under the Related Programs Appropriations Act of FY1991. Annual appropriations for international forestry have been allocated separately since FY2001. The CFAA authorizes consolidated payments to states for cooperative forestry assistance programs and establishes oversight groups. The 2008 farm bill replaced an existing oversight committee with a new structure. States can request consolidated payments for all authorized programs. The National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council evaluates the national urban and community forestry action plan. The National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council evaluates the implementation of the national urban and community forestry action plan and develops criteria for the urban and community forestry challenge cost-share program. The Council is composed of 15 members representing various organizations and expertise in urban and community forestry. The Forest Resource Coordinating Committee, established in the 2008 farm bill, coordinates forestry assistance programs within USDA and advises on funding allocations. Chaired by the FS Chief, it includes representatives from various agencies and organizations. The State Forest Stewardship Coordinating Committees were created by the Secretary of Agriculture to consult with various representatives and make recommendations on forestry programs and priorities. Each committee is chaired by the state forester and includes federal representatives. The State Forest Stewardship Coordinating Committees, chaired by the state forester, include federal representatives from various agencies and other appointed members to represent different stakeholders. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, mainly through the Forest Service, administers programs to support forest management with financial and technical assistance. The U.S. Department of Agriculture administers programs to provide financial and technical assistance for forest management practices, including tree planting, thinning, prescribed burning, and restoring watersheds. These programs also support protecting nonfederal forests from wildfire, insects, diseases, and clearing for non-forest uses. Forest Legacy and Community Fire Protection programs help prevent forest clearing and assist communities in preparing for wildfires. The Community Fire Protection program assists communities in preparing for wildfires, while emergency programs help landowners restore forests after disasters. These programs aim to protect and restore state and private forestlands from catastrophic wildfires and other damaging agents. Forestry assistance funding has fluctuated since FY2000, with an average of around $367 million since FY2008. Most forestry assistance programs were reduced in FY2013 appropriations, except for the Forest Stewardship and International Forestry programs. Forestry programs, including forest protection programs like forest health, wildfire assistance, and forest legacy, have seen reduced funding since FY2010. Rural fire protection funding is 30% below FY2010 levels despite severe wildfire seasons in 2011 and 2012. Forest management assistance funding has remained relatively constant, with programs like Forest Stewardship and Urban and Community Forestry receiving around $30 million since FY2009. These forestry assistance programs make up less than 10% of the Forest Service's total $4.9 billion in discretionary appropriations. Overall Forest Service funding has also been declining, albeit at a slower rate. Forest Service funding has been declining, but at a slower rate than forestry assistance funds. The number, extent, and severity of wildfires are increasing, along with forest insect and disease infestations. Both federal and nonfederal forest owners are facing management challenges with decreasing dollars. Some argue that decreased funding encourages innovative management solutions."
