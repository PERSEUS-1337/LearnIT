Employers completing employment verification procedures should be responsible for unpaid emergency services provided to undocumented aliens. SEC. 3. CONDITIONS FOR RECEIPT OF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR UNDOCUMENTED ALIENS.

Hospital records must be maintained for at least 5 years and made available for examination. The Secretary of Homeland Security will provide technical support to hospitals under this section. The hospital receives software, training, and technical support services at no cost to comply with requirements. The Secretary of Homeland Security takes prompt action to review information, determine removability of aliens, and initiate removal proceedings. Undocumented aliens who obtain... An undocumented alien receiving services from a hospital without payment or providing accurate information may be considered removable under immigration law. Employers of such aliens making payments for services may also have responsibilities under the law. Employers may be liable to the Secretary for payments made to undocumented alien workers who meet specific criteria, as defined in subsection (c)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Conditions for exemption under subparagraph (A)(iii) require full compliance with employment verification system requirements outlined in section 274A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

The liability of an employer and alien is limited. The liability of an employer under this subsection is limited to employing an undocumented alien worker at the time eligible services are provided. Hospitals are not required to provide care to undocumented aliens if they can be transported to their country without significant medical deterioration. The text discusses the likelihood of medical deterioration for aliens in need of extraordinary medical treatment exceeding $50,000, with regulations effective as of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. The Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to issue interim regulations within 60 days and final regulations within one year. Additionally, an annual report on implementation is mandated. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, must submit an annual report on the implementation of section 1011 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. The report should include a cost analysis of Federal expenditures, a description of assistance provided to hospitals, and the number of undocumented aliens removed. The Secretary of State will analyze the feasibility of negotiating treaties with foreign states to provide payment for international medical evacuation for their nationals needing emergency healthcare in the US. The Secretary of State will submit a report to committees on the feasibility of imposing a surcharge on nationals of foreign states to cover medical costs and international medical evacuation, in cases where treaties for payment are not in effect."
