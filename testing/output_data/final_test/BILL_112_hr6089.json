The \"Healthy Forest Management Act of 2012\" includes definitions, congressional declaration of bark beetle epidemic, drought, deteriorating forest health conditions, and high risk of wildfires, state and Secretary designation of high-risk areas, use of emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects, and cooperation with States to reduce wildfires. The \"Healthy Forest Management Act of 2012\" includes cooperation with States to reduce wildfire risks and stewardship end result contracting project authority. The \"Healthy Forest Management Act of 2012\" includes cooperation with States to reduce wildfire risks and stewardship end result contracting project authority. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. The \"Healthy Forest Management Act of 2012\" defines terms related to emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects in high-risk areas on National Forest System land or public lands suffering from bark beetle epidemic, drought, or deteriorating forest health conditions. The term \"System\" is defined as per the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, while \"public lands\" is defined according to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. The term \"State\" includes states with National Forest System land or public lands, including Puerto Rico. Congress declares bark beetle epidemic, drought, and deteriorating forest health conditions as imminent threat, leading to high risk of wildfires in States. States can designate high-risk areas on National Forest System and public lands. The Governor of a State may designate high-risk areas in the National Forest System and public lands to address deteriorating forest health conditions due to bark beetle epidemic or drought, and prevent future insect infestations or disease outbreaks. Consultation with county governments and affected Indian tribes is required. Certain areas like National Wilderness Preservation System components are excluded from designation. Designation of high-risk areas in the National Forest System and public lands must adhere to standards and guidelines in land management plans. Initial designations should occur within 60 days of enactment, with a 20-year expiration unless terminated earlier by the State Governor. The Governor can redesignate high-risk areas in the National Forest System or public lands after 20 years if they still pose a risk. Designation of high-risk areas does not limit access for hunting, fishing, or other activities, nor does it affect valid existing rights on the land. SEC. 5. Designation of high-risk areas by the Secretary concerned. The Secretary concerned may designate high-risk areas in National Forest System and public lands to address deteriorating forest health conditions due to bark beetle epidemic or drought, and future risks of insect infestations or disease outbreaks. Consultation with Governors, county governments, and Indian tribes is required. Certain areas like National Wilderness Preservation cannot be designated as high-risk areas. Designation of high-risk areas in National Forest System and public lands to address forest health issues like bark beetle epidemic or drought.

The expiration of the 20-year period specified in subsection (f) does not prohibit the Secretary from redesignating a high-risk area if it continues to be subject to the terms of this section. Consultation with Governors, county governments, and Indian tribes is required for redesignation. The designation of a high-risk area does not limit access for hunting, fishing, and other related purposes, nor does it restrict valid and existing rights regarding the land. SEC. 6. USE OF EMERGENCY HAZARDOUS FUELS REDUCTION PROJECTS FOR HIGH-RISK AREAS. Upon designation of a high-risk area in a State, the Governor may develop proposed emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects, with criteria including managing rights of way, protecting watersheds, wildlife, and water resources, and safeguarding communities from wildfires. Thinning the forest is emphasized for optimal health and longevity. The Governor may develop emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects in high-risk areas to protect the forest's health and longevity. Clear cutting of timber is prohibited in these projects. Consultation with county governments and Indian tribes is required, and proposed projects must be submitted to the Secretary for implementation. The Secretary must implement hazardous fuels reduction projects proposed by Governors or the Secretary concerned within 60 days of receiving the finalized proposal. SEC. 7. APPLICABILITY OF EXPEDITED PROCEDURES AND AUTHORITIES OF HEALTHY FORESTS RESTORATION ACT OF 2003 TO EMERGENCY HAZARDOUS FUELS REDUCTION PROJECTS. Title I of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 applies to emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects under section 6, with modifications by the Secretary concerned. Public Law 102-381 does not apply to Forest Service projects. The authority for emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects in high-risk areas includes all land, regardless of eligibility criteria. Projects must comply with forest management plans and be considered authorized hazardous fuel reduction projects. The authority for emergency hazardous fuels reduction projects in high-risk areas includes compliance with forest management plans. The Secretary concerned may adjust standards and guidelines for specific high-risk area designations. NEPA responsibilities for projects in high-risk areas cannot be delegated to State officials. Removal of insect-infected trees may qualify for a categorical exclusion. In high-risk areas, the removal of insect-infected trees or hazardous fuels near infrastructure exempts the project from environmental assessment requirements under NEPA, as long as it follows agency procedures and management plans. SEC. 8. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management cooperation with states to reduce wildfire risks. The section defines terms like \"eligible State,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"State forester.\" It allows the Secretary of Agriculture to enter agreements with State foresters for forest restoration services on National Forest System land. The forest restoration and protection services include treating insect-infected trees, reducing hazardous fuels, and improving forest, rangeland, and watershed health. State foresters can serve as agents for the Secretary in providing these services through cooperative agreements or contracts. Subcontracts can be entered into by State foresters following applicable contract procedures. State foresters can enter subcontracts for restoration and protection services under cooperative agreements. Timber sales regulations do not apply to these services. NEPA responsibilities cannot be delegated to State foresters for services on National Forest System land. The restoration and protection services provided under this section will be carried out on a project-to-project basis by the Forest Service under existing authorities. SEC. 9. Stewardship End Result Contracting Project Authority is extended until 2017, and the duration of contracts is increased from 10 years to 20 years."
