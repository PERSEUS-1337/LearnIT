    "title": "SB 301",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 5600.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to prioritize serving seriously emotionally disturbed children or adolescents with mental disorders, excluding substance use or developmental disorders, using funds from the mental health account of the local health and welfare trust fund. Target populations are identified based on specific criteria. Children with mental disorders must have substantial impairment in key areas like self-care or school functioning, and be at risk of removal from home or have already been removed. They must also display psychotic features, risk of suicide, or violence due to the disorder. Adults with serious mental disorders are also covered, defined as severe and persistent conditions. Serious mental disorders include conditions that may cause significant impairment in daily activities, leading to an inability to function independently without treatment. This encompasses schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other severely disabling mental disorders. Individuals with serious mental disorders may also have co-occurring substance abuse, developmental disabilities, or other physical or mental health issues. Members of this target population must meet specific criteria to be included. Members of the target population must have a mental disorder as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, with substantial functional impairments or symptoms. Functional impairment includes difficulties in independent living, social relationships, vocational skills, or physical condition. Persons likely to require public assistance due to mental functional impairment include homeless individuals, those needing care in acute treatment facilities, persons arrested or convicted of crimes, and those with a first episode of mental illness with psychotic features. California veterans in need of mental health services will be provided services if they meet eligibility requirements. They should be informed about services available through the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. No veteran should be denied county mental health services based solely on their veteran status. Counties should refer veterans to determine eligibility for services provided by the VA or other federal healthcare providers. Counties may consider contracting with community-based veterans' services agencies. Veterans in California can receive mental health services if they meet eligibility criteria, including those with symptoms of psychosis, suicidality, or violence. Additionally, individuals affected by natural disasters or emergencies may also qualify for brief treatment."
