    "content": "The \"Chlorine Zero Discharge Act of 1993\" aims to eliminate the discharge of toxic persistent and bioaccumulative substances. The Congress finds that toxic substances that persist and bioaccumulate in the environment can cause various harmful effects at low doses, including reproductive failure, birth defects, developmental impairment, hormonal disruption, behavioral disorders, immune suppression, and cancer. Regulatory approaches allowing limited production and discharge of these substances lead to their accumulation. Persistent and bioaccumulative toxic substances can accumulate in the environment and food chain, causing harm to humans and other species. The best way to prevent further contamination is to phase out the production and use of these substances and replace them with safer alternatives. Organochlorines from pulp and paper production, particularly those involving chlorine, are of significant concern. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between the US and Canada aims to prohibit the discharge of toxic substances and virtually eliminate persistent toxic substances. The International Joint Commission on Great Lakes Water Quality supports the concept of virtual elimination and zero discharge to achieve this goal. Zero discharge of organochlorine compounds and byproducts is crucial to prevent further contamination. Title III of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include zero discharge of organochlorine compounds, byproducts, or metabolites. Title III of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include zero discharge of organochlorine compounds, byproducts, or metabolites. SEC. 519 addresses the discharge of these substances. Within 5 years of enactment, pulp and paper manufacturing facilities must achieve zero discharge of organochlorine compounds from chlorine or chlorinated oxidizing agents. Permits for mills using these agents must comply with this requirement. The Administrator will evaluate alternatives to organochlorines and publish a report on transitioning to chlorine-free technology in the industry. The pulp and paper industry is transitioning from organochlorine to chlorine-free technology to prevent pollution. The EPA will provide technical support to help permit applicants use alternatives to organochlorine compounds. A report to Congress will be completed on nonpoint sources and industrial discharges of organochlorine compounds within 18 months. The EPA will provide technical support for transitioning the pulp and paper industry from organochlorine to chlorine-free technology. A report to Congress will detail quantities of organochlorine compounds discharged into water and recommendations for achieving a zero discharge policy. An advisory panel will be convened to develop these recommendations, consisting of experts from various fields and stakeholders. The term 'zero discharge' in this section means no output or release into water, including nonpoint source discharge, without any exceptions."
