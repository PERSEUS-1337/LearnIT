The \"Guadalupe-Hidalgo Treaty Land Claims Act of 2009\" recognizes the unique history of land ownership in the western and southwestern United States due to Spanish and Mexican land grants. Congress finds that certain provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo have not been fully implemented, leading to questions about land ownership in these regions. Certain public lands in western and southwestern States still exist, and Congress has used land claim commissions in the past to examine disputed land possession questions successfully. Establishment of the Guadalupe-Hidalgo Treaty Land Claims Commission with seven members appointed by the President, including eligible descendants and a member of an Indian tribe. Members serve for the life of the Commission and receive compensation at the Executive Schedule level V. SEC. 4. EXAMINATION OF LAND CLAIMS.
