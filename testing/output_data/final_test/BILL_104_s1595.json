The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for activities in the National Forest System and the Secretary of the Interior for activities on Bureau of Land Management land. Section 2001 of Public Law 104-19 is repealed, and the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior must suspend activities previously authorized under that section. The Secretary concerned must suspend activities previously authorized under a specific section, unless it is determined that the activity would have been undertaken regardless. Resumption of suspended activities is contingent upon compliance with environmental and natural resource laws. SEC. 3. STUDIES. The purpose of this section is to provide factual information on forest health for setting funding levels. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a study on the nature and extent of forest health issues in the National Forest System, including overstocked stands and excessive fuel loads. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a study on forest health issues in the National Forest System, including overstocked stands, inappropriate tree species mix, and variations in severity. The report will use representative sample measurements and be reviewed by the scientific community before transmission. The Secretary of Agriculture will contract the National Academy of Sciences to study ecological consequences of activities to improve forest health within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Activities include site preparation, reforestation, thinning, and fertilization. The report will be transmitted to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The National Academy of Sciences will study the ecological consequences of forest health improvement activities, including thinning, fertilization, and salvage harvesting. The report will be transmitted to the Chief of the Forest Service and Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment. Additionally, the Comptroller General will conduct a study on the economic efficacy of these activities at the Federal, State, and local levels. The study will assess the fiscal and economic consequences of activities aimed at improving forest health at Federal, State, and local levels. Coordination with another study will ensure examination of the same activities in the same areas and analysis of historic and recent effects. The Comptroller General will differentiate the net effects on the Treasury from changes in special accounts and trust funds. The Forest Service will conduct a study on alternative systems for administering forests, with findings to be transmitted to Congress within 2 years. The Chief of the Forest Service will assess opportunities for improvement based on the National Academy of Sciences and Comptroller General's findings on ecological, economic, and fiscal consequences. The Forest Service will conduct a study on alternative systems for administering forest health-related activities, comparing ecological effects, forest health changes, economic consequences, and public involvement in decision-making. The study will assess the use of contracting for validity. The study will measure the effect of contracting on costs for health care, retirement, and benefits for contractors compared to public employees. The report will be transmitted to Congress within 1 year and made publicly available in summary and full form."
