    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park Establishment Act\" and defines terms such as National Heritage Corridor, Park, Secretary, and States. The Act establishes the Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park. The Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park is established in the States, including historic sites like Blackstone River State Park, Old Slater Mill National Historic Landmark District, Slatersville Historic District, Ashton Historic District, Whitinsville Historic District, Hopedale Village Historic District, Blackstone River, Blackstone Canal, and their tributaries. Land acquisition and park boundaries are also addressed. The Secretary may acquire land for the Blackstone Canal Park boundary through donation or exchange. Once enough land is acquired, a boundary map will be published in the Federal Register. Any additional land acquired will result in a boundary adjustment published in the Federal Register. The maps for the Blackstone Canal Park boundary are available for public inspection. Non-Federal property cannot be included without the owner's written consent. Land owned by States can only be acquired through donation. The Secretary administers the Park according to specific laws applicable to the National Park System. The Secretary must prepare a general management plan for Blackstone Canal Park within 3 years of funds availability, consulting with states and interested parties, and following specific laws. Recreational opportunities in the National Heritage Corridor include the Blackstone Valley Visitor Center in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, the Captain Wilbur Kelly House in Blackstone River State Park, Lincoln, Rhode Island, the Museum of Work and Culture in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, the River Bend Farm/Blackstone River and Canal Heritage State Park in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, and the Worcester Blackstone Visitor Center in Worcester, Massachusetts. The Secretary may provide technical assistance for the management, interpretation, and historic preservation of Blackstone River Valley resources not included within the Park. The Secretary may also enter into cooperative agreements to carry out this Act. The Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements for projects that must be matched with non-Federal funds. Reimbursement conditions apply if the project is used inconsistently with the agreement. Congress dedicates the Park to John H. Chafee, former United States Senator from Rhode Island, in recognition of his role in preserving the resources of the Blackstone River Valley and his decades of service to the people of Rhode Island and the United States. Public access to the resources covered by cooperative agreements must be provided. The Secretary will display a memorial at an appropriate location in the Park honoring John H. Chafee's preservation efforts in the Blackstone River Valley for the people of the United States. The Secretary is prohibited from acquiring land through condemnation for this purpose, and no buffer zones will be created outside the Park. Activities outside the Park will not be regulated based on their visibility or detection within the Park."
