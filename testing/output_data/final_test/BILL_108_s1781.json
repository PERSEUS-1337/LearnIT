    "content": "The Act titled \"Pharmaceutical Market Access Act of 2003\" is cited as the short title. Congress finds that Americans pay significantly more for prescriptions compared to other countries, despite being the largest pharmaceutical market. Affordable drugs are crucial for safety and effectiveness. Importing prescription drugs can provide access to affordable medication, potentially saving consumers billions annually. The purposes of this Act are to provide immediate relief from high pharmaceutical costs, reverse the economics of American pharmaceutical markets, allow importation of approved drugs, and require counterfeit-resistant packaging for imported prescription drugs. Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include pharmacists, wholesalers, and qualifying individuals in subsection (a) within 180 days of the Pharmaceutical Market Access Act of 2003. Subsection (b) now requires imported products to comply with specific sections of the Act. Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include pharmacists and wholesalers in subsection (a) and specifies requirements for imported products in subsection (b). Amendments in subsection (c) and (d) involve the insertion and striking of certain paragraphs. Amendments to Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act involve changes in labeling requirements, certification from importers or manufacturers, and redesignation of paragraphs. Subsection (e) is replaced with new testing regulations. The testing requirements for importers of covered products are outlined in subsection (e), with exceptions for wholesalers. Amendments to Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act involve changes in labeling requirements and certification. In subsection (i)(1), a study on imports permitted under subsection (a) is required, evaluating compliance and considering information received under subsection (d). The evaluation of importers' compliance with regulations under subsection (a) and the incidence of misbranded or adulterated shipments is required. This evaluation will contrast compliance with shipments of prescription drugs within the United States. The Pharmaceutical Market Access Act of 2003 requires compliance evaluation of importers and defines a qualifying individual as someone who is not a pharmacist or wholesaler. Subsections (l) and (m) are removed. SEC. 5 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires drug packaging to comply with counterfeit-resistant technologies to prevent counterfeiting. The Secretary must require drug packaging to incorporate overt optically variable counterfeit-resistant technologies or equivalent security technologies visible to the naked eye for product authenticity verification. These technologies should be similar to those used by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing for securing US currency. The drug packaging must be highly secure and incorporate nonvisible covert security features similar to those used by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing for US currency. Manufacturers must use these technologies in multiple elements of the packaging to make counterfeiting more difficult. The shipment of drugs must have a label on the shipping container with technologies to verify authenticity. Manufacturers must ensure chain-of-custody procedures apply to the label. The curr_chunk discusses procedures for contractual agreements, auditing methods, and database access related to the use and distribution of labels."
