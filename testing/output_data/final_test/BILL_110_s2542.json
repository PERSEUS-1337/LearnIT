A $5,000 balance takes 40 years and 2 months, costing $16,305.34. Based on the Truth in Lending Act amendment, credit card issuers must disclose the annual percentage rate of 17 percent and a minimum payment of 2 percent or ten dollars ($10), whichever is greater. Alternatively, they can provide this information for the 3 specified amounts at the applicable annual percentage rate and required minimum payment. Retail credit card issuers must provide a written 3-line statement disclosing the time and cost to pay off a $250 balance, as required by the Truth in Lending Act amendment. Based on the Truth in Lending Act amendment, a $500 balance will take 4 years and 5 months to pay off at a total cost of $709.90, while a $750 balance will take 5 years and 5 months to pay off at a total cost of $1,094.49. The retail credit card issuer must provide information on the annual percentage rate and minimum payment options. This information should be provided for the specified amounts at the applicable annual percentage rate and required minimum payment for the cardholder's account. A retail credit card issuer is not required to provide a statement if the cardholder has a balance of less than $500. Additionally, a written statement must provide individualized information estimating the time and cost to pay off the entire balance on an open-end credit card. The cardholder must pay the minimum amount due on an open-end credit card account. The creditor may disclose a variable rate for the entire balance and provide contact information for referrals or a '800' telephone number. The cardholder can contact the National Foundation for Credit Counseling via an '800' telephone number for credit counseling services in their county. The counseling service must be in good standing with the National Foundation or accredited by the Council on Accreditation for Children and Family Services. The creditor must provide the necessary information as required. The cardholder must provide specific information if they have not paid more than the minimum payment for 6 consecutive months starting after July 1, 2002. This includes a written statement with a toll-free telephone number for estimating repayment time and total payments. The credit card issuer is not required to provide a statement if the required disclosure has been given. The toll-free telephone number must be available from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., 7 days a week, allowing consumers to speak with a person for information. The Federal Trade Commission will create a table showing the approximate repayment time.

The creditor must respond to cardholder inquiries through a disclosed toll-free number. The creditor can disclose an estimate of the time and cost to repay the cardholder's balance by providing information in a specific table. Including the full chart in a billing statement does not fulfill this obligation. The term 'open-end credit card account' refers to a creditor granting consumer credit under a plan for repeated transactions with the ability to impose finance charges on unpaid balances. The amount of credit available is based on repayments and any set limits. A 'retail credit card' is issued by or on behalf of a retailer. A retail credit card is issued by a retailer or a private label credit card limited to specific retailer customers. Exemptions include a minimum payment of at least 10% of the outstanding balance and no finance charges in certain billing cycles."
