    "content": "In the years leading up to the 9/11 attacks, the US lacked a comprehensive aviation security policy. Past events like the Pan Am flight 103 bombing in 1988 influenced a reactive shift in strategy, focusing on preventing aircraft bombings. In April 2001, the FAA issued a strategic plan titled \"A Commitment to Security\" with the goal of being a global leader in aviation security. The strategic goal in the FAA's pre-9/11 plan was to prevent successful attacks on U.S. civil aviation, focusing on improving baggage and checkpoint screening, utilizing explosives detection systems, and ensuring Federal Air Marshals for high-risk flights. The FAA Civil Aviation Security Strategic Plan aimed to protect high-risk flights, ensure explosives canine teams at airports, and improve air cargo security. It focused on reducing transport of dangerous goods and enhancing industry training and inspections. However, it did not address the threat of bombs in air cargo or internal FAA security. The FAA's pre-9/11 strategic plan focused on internal security measures like handling sensitive information and maintaining employee clearances. It also aimed to improve external relationships with Congress, the aviation industry, and other government entities. However, it did not address potential threats to air traffic facilities or FAA information systems. The FAA's pre-9/11 strategic plan focused on internal security measures and improving external relationships. However, it did not address relationships with federal law enforcement agencies, the intelligence community, or coordination with the military for incident response, which were highlighted as deficiencies post-9/11. The 9/11 Commission criticized both the FAA and the U.S. intelligence community for failures in imagination, policy, capabilities, and management during the terrorist attacks. The 9/11 Commission faulted the FAA for not prioritizing the suicide hijacking threat, faulted Congress for not focusing on the terrorist threat to aviation, and criticized the FAA for lacking a comprehensive strategy to protect against terrorist threats. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was swiftly passed after the 9/11 attacks, giving specific authority to the TSA Administrator for assessing threats and developing security policies. However, ATSA primarily focused on passenger airline security, leading to the deployment of air marshals and federalization of airport security. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) focused on passenger airline security, including requirements for air marshals, federalization of airport security screeners, and explosives detection system screening. As these mandates were implemented, the Bush Administration began examining broader policies for protecting the homeland against terrorist attacks, issuing the National Strategy for Homeland Security in 2002 and the National Strategy for the Physical Protection in 2003. The President issued the National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets in February 2003. The 9/11 Commission found that the TSA lacked an integrated strategic plan for transportation security, recommending a risk-based approach for resource allocation. Following the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, requiring the DHS to develop a national strategy for transportation security. This strategy assigns risk-based priorities and deadlines for implementing security measures, involving federal, state, regional, and local authorities, as well as private sector cooperation. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated the development of a National Strategy for Transportation Security, involving various authorities and private sector cooperation. The strategy includes mode-specific security plans, with the aviation plan detailing threats and security measures. Updates to the strategy and mode-specific plans must be submitted to Congress every two years. President Bush issued policy guidance in June 2006 directing the DHS to establish a national strategy for aviation security and supporting plans. These plans, unlike previous ones, provide detailed information on aviation-specific security strategies and are not limited in distribution. The Presidential directive in June 2006 led to the development of comprehensive policy, strategy, and plans for aviation security by the DHS, which are publicly available. These documents offer a detailed insight into the strategic direction and approach to aviation security, surpassing previous strategy documents in their thorough consideration of security in the aviation domain. The report examines the National Aviation Security Policy, the National Strategy for Aviation Security, and mode-specific plans for implementation, providing a comprehensive overview of U.S. policy and strategy for mitigating aviation threats. Additionally, the report discusses considerations for congressional oversight and potential legislative actions related to securing the aviation domain. The National Aviation Security Policy is part of the U.S. strategy for securing the aviation domain, managed by the Department of Homeland Security. It addresses a wide range of threats to national security interests, both domestically and internationally. The policy involves DHS and TSA in ensuring homeland security and aviation security. The National Aviation Security Policy involves the DHS, TSA, Department of Defense, State, Justice, and other agencies, focusing on global airspace security. HSPD-16/NSPD-47 sets new U.S. policy to prevent terrorist acts in the air domain. The policy objectives outlined in HSPD-16 aim to prevent terrorist acts and hostile actions in the aviation domain, while also minimizing the impact on air commerce and promoting economic growth. The United States must utilize its assets to prevent the Air Domain from being used for terrorism and unlawful acts, while facilitating trade and commerce. These efforts are crucial for global stability and economic growth, and are in the best interests of the United States. The United States, in cooperation with international partners, will take necessary actions to enhance security and protect U.S. interests in the air domain. This includes prioritizing aviation security strategies, protecting critical transportation networks, improving situational awareness, and sharing information to detect threats. The United States, along with international partners, will enhance aviation security by improving information sharing, coordinating efforts among various agencies, enhancing system resilience, countering the proliferation of standoff weapons, and strengthening international relationships. Coordination of this policy will be through the President's Homeland Security Council. The President's Homeland Security Council will coordinate aviation security policy through the Border and Transportation Security Policy Coordination Committee. The policy requires the development of a national strategy for aviation security that is adaptable to changing threats and based on risk assessment. This strategy must address threats such as attacks using aircraft against ground-based targets. The directive outlines various threats to aviation security, including attacks using aircraft to deliver CBRNE weapons, stand-off weapons, on-board explosive devices, hijackings, air piracy, and physical or cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure. Specific action items are identified to support mode-specific plans for implementing the national strategy for aviation security. The National Strategy for Aviation Security, released in 2007, identifies terrorist groups, hostile nation-states, and criminals as threats to the air domain. It highlights the use of criminal tactics by terrorists to move operatives and weapons through aviation. The National Strategy for Aviation Security in 2007 identifies terrorist groups, hostile nation-states, and criminals as threats to aviation. These threats include the movement of operatives, weapons, and explosives through the aviation system, with the potential for attacks by international terrorists or domestic groups exploiting weaknesses in aviation security. The National Strategy for Aviation Security in 2007 identifies terrorist groups, hostile nation-states, and criminals as threats to aviation, which may combine in various forms to carry out attacks directly against aviation assets or exploit elements of the air domain for attacks against the homeland or U.S. interests abroad. Three primary categories of threats against the aviation domain are defined based on the target of the threat: threats involving aircraft, threats to aviation infrastructure, and threats involving hostile exploitation of air cargo. Various tactics like hijackings, bombings, shootings, and criminal activities such as smuggling of persons and weapons may be used to attack these targets. The National Strategy for Aviation Security in 2007 identifies threats to aviation from terrorist groups, hostile nation-states, and criminals. These threats include attacks on aircraft, aviation infrastructure, and exploitation of air cargo. Large passenger aircraft are at high risk for terrorist attacks due to their potential for catastrophic damage. All-cargo aircraft are also vulnerable targets for attacks or as a means of transporting weapons and explosives. Small aircraft, including passenger airliners and cargo planes, are vulnerable to attacks using shoulder-fired missiles or other weapons. They can be used as weapons to target ground assets. Terrorists may utilize various small aircraft like business jets and helicopters for attacks, especially to transport or deliver weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, small aircraft are used by criminal elements for illegal activities like smuggling drugs and weapons, posing a significant challenge. The strategy recognizes the threat posed by non-traditional aircraft like unmanned aircraft, ultra-lights, and crop dusters being used for illegal activities or as conveyance for weapons of mass destruction. Terrorists may use these aircraft for limited range missions with specific targets, such as dispersing chemical or biological agents. Hostile nation-states' military aircraft and missiles are more of a concern for national defense and the Department of Defense rather than homeland security. The aviation security strategy focuses on threats to aviation infrastructure, noting that air navigation facilities are resilient to attack due to their robust design. However, there is a wide variety of potential threats, including attacks on major airport passenger terminals with explosives. The aviation security strategy highlights the threat of attacks on passenger terminal buildings with explosives, as seen in historical incidents. Attacks on other aviation infrastructure like general aviation airports and air cargo areas are deemed less likely due to limited impact. However, a plot to bomb jet fuel storage tanks at JFK Airport and fuel distribution pipelines in NYC raised concerns about vulnerabilities in this infrastructure. The potential threat to aviation jet fuel storage facilities and distribution systems at major U.S. airports, highlighted by a plot, may deserve further attention from policy makers and aviation security strategists. The air cargo industry's large scale, diversity, and complexity make it vulnerable to exploitation by terrorists, but post-9/11 actions have been effective in reducing certain threats. The U.S. National Strategy for Aviation Security acknowledges the threat of terrorist infiltration in air cargo handling operations and facilities, which could be exploited for conveying terrorist operatives and weapons. Criminal activities, including cargo-related crimes, could provide revenue sources for terrorist organizations. The U.S. National Strategy for Aviation Security focuses on a risk-based, global approach to detect, deter, and prevent attacks against aviation. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) and Transportation Sector Specific Plan (TSSP) outline the risk-based methodology for identifying critical assets and implementing risk reduction initiatives. The Transportation Sector Specific Plan (TSSP) applies a risk-based framework to the entire transportation sector, including aviation. It describes risk as a function of threat, vulnerability, and consequences, prioritizing resources based on risk to prevent terrorist acts, enhance system resilience, and improve cost-effective security resource allocation. The Transportation Sector Specific Plan (TSSP) applies a risk-based framework to prioritize resources based on risk in the transportation sector, including aviation. It involves extensive participation from global, state, local, and private sector entities with specific domain expertise, relying on inputs from the intelligence community, expert judgment, and futures analysis. Various risk-based transportation sector security assessment tools have been developed, including self-assessment tools, government site evaluations, and analytic tools examining threat, vulnerability, and consequence. Specific tools for assessing risk in aviation include government site assistance visits and web-based Vulnerability Identification Self Assessment Tool (VISAT) modules for airports. The National Strategy for Aviation Security focuses on deterring and preventing terrorist attacks, protecting the homeland, mitigating damage from attacks, minimizing impact on the aviation system and economy, and engaging domestic and international partners. The strategy includes the development of risk-based tools like VISAT modules for airports and the FAA's ISSP for air traffic control systems. Communication with sector stakeholders is crucial for implementing the risk-based approach. The strategy for aviation security aims to deter and prevent terrorist attacks by maximizing shared awareness of domestic and international airspace and infrastructure. It seeks to establish a system of protection considering connections and interdependencies within the aviation system. The strategy also focuses on preparing for contingencies, mitigating damage, and expediting recovery, with diverse response options such as selective air traffic restrictions. The aviation security strategy aims to prevent terrorist attacks by implementing security measures to protect the aviation system. Cooperation among government entities, international agreements, and industry stakeholders is crucial to prevent, respond to, and recover from potential attacks involving aviation assets. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for coordinating national aviation security programs, including risk analysis, law enforcement operations, border protection, and developing security technologies to protect against threats. The Secretary of Homeland Security oversees these efforts at the highest levels of government. The TSA, under the DHS, is responsible for aviation security, including protecting against threats like explosives and weapons, coordinating security measures, and sharing information. They work closely with the FAA on aviation security programs and administer the National Explosives Detection Canine Team program for explosives detection. The TSA is responsible for aviation security, including training canine teams for explosives detection, deputizing armed pilots, checkpoint screening, regulatory compliance, air marshals, and intelligence coordination for transportation threats. The TSA Office of Intelligence (OI) is crucial for transportation threat assessment during national emergencies, coordinating with other agencies and producing various threat assessment products based on intelligence from the NCTC and the intelligence community. The TSA Office of Intelligence produces threat assessments for specific events, weekly intelligence reports, suspicious incident reports, and transportation-related terrorist trends. Customs and Border Protection focuses on preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the US, while the US Coast Guard conducts aviation operations for national defense and security. The Department of Defense (DoD) is responsible for deterring, defending against, and defeating aviation threats within the United States and globally. They operate as part of NORAD to monitor and respond to potential hostile actions, maintaining fighter aircraft on alert and deploying missile defense systems. Law enforcement handles criminal and terror threats to aviation by individuals or groups. The FBI's Civil Aviation Security Program and counterterrorism units work to prevent terrorist attacks on civil aviation in the US. They deploy airport liaison agents to respond to incidents and threats at airports. Other agencies like DHS S&T Directorate focus on research and development for enhancing aviation security, especially against explosives and shoulder-fired missiles. The Department of State and Department of Commerce are involved in international aviation security efforts, including data sharing for passenger prescreening and reducing stockpiles of shoulder-fired missiles. The integration of future aviation security plans by the JPDO with DHS initiatives has not been fully assessed. The Department of Commerce and Department of State are involved in international aviation security efforts, including data sharing for passenger prescreening and reducing stockpiles of shoulder-fired missiles. The DOT, in coordination with the Department of State, negotiates international agreements regarding airline and other commercial aviation activities. The intelligence community, through the ODNI, assesses threats exploiting aviation security measures. Other DHS components, such as FEMA, DNDO, and OIP, have responsibilities related to infrastructure protection and critical incident response in the aviation domain. The Department of Energy provides expertise on nuclear weapons and radiation detection at airports for possible attacks. Industry advisory groups like the Aviation Security Advisory Committee support TSA in improving aviation security methods. The TSA is supported by various entities in its role as the lead federal agency for aviation security. The National Research Council and Transportation Research Board facilitate information sharing among experts. Aviation industry stakeholders, state and local security entities, and law enforcement play a crucial role in shaping and implementing national aviation security policies in collaboration with the TSA. The DHS has developed aviation mode-specific plans as a framework for implementing the national strategy under normal conditions. The Aviation Transportation System Security Plan focuses on day-to-day security measures to reduce vulnerability to terrorist actions. It is supported by the Air Domain Surveillance and Intelligence Integration Plan for intelligence coordination. The International Aviation Threat Reduction Plan and International Outreach Plan aim to enhance global aviation security through collaboration with other nations. The Aviation Operational Threat Response Plan is activated in case of terrorist or criminal attacks on aviation assets, with specific actions for mitigating consequences. The plan is supported by the Domestic Outreach Plan for coordination with government and private entities. The DHS is also developing an Aviation Transportation System Recovery Plan for rapid recovery after a terrorist attack or disruption. The Aviation Transportation System Recovery Plan aims to mitigate the impacts of terrorist attacks on the aviation system. It is important to critically evaluate the national policy and strategy for aviation security to identify any potential shortcomings in assumptions and approaches. Congressional oversight and legislative debate may raise questions about the validity of risk assumptions and the adequacy of security policies and plans. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation of aviation security policy and strategy, focusing on sustainability, forward-looking approach, comprehensive framework, alignment with budgetary processes, and risk models. It highlights the challenges in determining the validity of risk models and assumptions used in setting aviation security policy and strategy. Some critics argue that risk determinations in aviation security policy may be based on inaccurate analysis due to limited access to intelligence information. There are concerns about the lack of statistical expertise in federal agencies and the need for reliable methods to assess terrorism data. Security agencies are criticized for advancing policies without empirical evidence. Security agencies are criticized for advancing policies without empirical evidence, relying on anecdotal evidence or \"gut feelings.\" This can lead to inappropriate risk estimates in homeland security and aviation security. More comprehensive efforts are needed to analyze risks in the aviation domain to improve security policies. Congress should examine DHS efforts to use statistical tools to validate risk assumptions for aviation security policies. The 9/11 Commission recommendations and subsequent legislation have shaped aviation security policies by emphasizing the need for capabilities to detect explosives on passengers and improve screening technologies. Congress has prioritized implementing these recommendations to enhance aviation security. The DHS is urged to prioritize checkpoint screening technologies for detecting various threats and develop a strategic plan for deploying explosives detection technologies. Progress in implementing these technologies has been slow, prompting Congress to require the DHS to finalize and begin implementing a checkpoint screening strategic plan. The DHS has faced technology hurdles in implementing its checkpoint screening strategic plan, including issues with explosives detection portals and shoe scanners. The TSA is exploring new technologies for liquids explosives screening, with positive results from handheld sensors. However, a clear strategic deployment plan for these emerging technologies is still needed. The recent mandate in P.L. 110-53 aims to develop and implement a strategy for enhancing screening checkpoints. Congressional oversight of TSA's progress in implementing the strategic plan for emerging checkpoint screening technologies may be necessary. The 9/11 Commission highlighted the importance of federal government involvement in passenger name checks for thorough vetting against terrorist watchlists. Deployment of a federal prescreening system for domestic flights has been delayed due to privacy concerns. Flights have faced delays due to privacy concerns and issues with personal data protection. Congress supports passenger prescreening but is also focused on privacy rights and redress for individuals. Legislation has placed contingencies on system implementation and directed the GAO to monitor TSA's progress. Congressional oversight may be needed for the TSA's implementation of federally run passenger prescreening on domestic flights in 2008. The strategic plan aims to implement an initiative in 2008, recommended by the 9/11 Commission to integrate checked baggage explosives detection systems with airport baggage handling systems. Congress has emphasized funding for this integration through the Aviation Security Capital Fund. The GAO estimates that full integration at all US airports will not be completed until 2024 with consistent funding levels. Congress has reauthorized funding for in-line baggage system deployment for 20 years to address this ongoing need. The TSA has been directed to prioritize airport EDS integration projects through 2028 as part of the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007. Congress is interested in overseeing TSA strategies and funding for EDS integration due to the initiative's size, complexity, and cost. Additionally, the TSA is working on increasing air cargo security and implementing risk-based targeting capabilities. The TSA has been directed to prioritize airport EDS integration projects through 2028 as part of the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007. Congress passed legislation requiring the TSA to establish a system to screen 100% of cargo transported on passenger aircraft by 2010, using various screening methods approved by the TSA. The TSA must swiftly develop a strategy to screen all cargo on passenger airlines within three years. Congressional oversight will monitor progress on air cargo security. The alignment of DHS efforts with legislative mandates is a topic for ongoing analysis. The demand for air travel and shipping continues to grow. The anticipated growth in air travel and air cargo demand poses challenges for aviation security. The FAA predicts a steady increase in airline passengers and cargo volume, necessitating strategies to enhance security measures to accommodate this growth. Additionally, air traffic and general aviation operations are expected to rise, requiring airspace security strategies to be implemented. The anticipated growth in general aviation operations of about 3.7% poses challenges for airspace security strategies and approaches. It remains unclear whether this growth is adequately planned for in national strategies and aviation security plans. Policymakers and aviation security strategists are concerned about the changing nature, size, and scope of aviation and air travel not being fully considered in risk assessments. The sustainability of aviation security technologies and strategies for maintaining deployed technologies are also key issues. The roadmap for enhancing aviation security under the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) initiative by 2025 is not fully defined. Future security transformations include dynamic risk management, biometric technologies for access control, multi-threat detection for screening, and environmental sensors for detecting CBRNE threats at airports. Deployable screening systems are also being considered. The strategic plan includes deployable screening systems, on-board aircraft safety modifications, and network-centric information sharing capabilities for aviation security. Congress may be interested in how the plan aligns with NGATS plans. Concerns have been raised about DHS relying too heavily on anecdotal evidence for decision-making. Some critics question if the DHS and TSA's reactive approach to aviation security is influenced by media and public reactions, rather than strategic risk analysis. For instance, the TSA's response to the 2006 liquid explosives plot has been criticized for allowing single events to shape policy decisions. The TSA has defended its actions by highlighting the threat posed by improvised liquid explosives. The TSA's response to the 2006 liquid explosives plot has been criticized for not including specific near-term measures to screen passengers for liquid explosives. Critics argue that reactive approaches go against proactive strategies in assessing threats. Adaptive strategies should be able to shift rapidly in response to changing threat levels. The TSA's response to the 2006 liquid explosives plot has been questioned for its reactive nature. Further examination of the decision-making process before and after the incident could provide valuable insights for improving security strategies. Critics argue that the government must replace its practices of responding to single threats with more systematic approaches for improving homeland security, as a reactionary approach may make the system more vulnerable to attack. Terrorists could exploit this by providing misinformation to trigger haphazard resource allocation, leading to inefficiency and potential security risks. The GAO issued recommendations in 2004 for national strategies to combat terrorism, emphasizing elements such as purpose, risk assessment, goals, resources, organizational roles, and coordination. The GAO issued recommendations in 2004 for national strategies to combat terrorism, emphasizing elements such as purpose, risk assessment, goals, resources, organizational roles, and coordination. The National Strategy for Aviation Security has not been evaluated against these desired elements, lacking in fully defining risk evaluation methodology, cost estimates, resource requirements, and detailing roles and coordination among non-federal entities. The National Strategy for Aviation Security needs to improve coordination among non-federal entities and integrate with national security and counterterrorism strategies. It should also be adaptive to evolving threats and tactics. The national strategy for aviation security must be adaptable to changing threats, intelligence, and technologies. Congress and the Administration should assess its robustness and alignment with budgetary decisions, especially considering potential expansions of TSA roles. The TSA is expected to take on additional responsibilities such as passenger identification and behavioral observation, which may require more resources. There is a push for technology advancements in screening processes, and new statutory requirements could expand TSA functions. For example, the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act mandates 100% air cargo inspections within three years, leading to significant cost implications. The TSA is facing significant cost implications due to new mandates, including 100% air cargo inspections within three years. This will impact both the federal government and the airline industry, with a focus on risk-based profiling and cargo screening technologies in the federal budget process. The TSA's Strategic Context documents provide a general framework for understanding programs but lack in-depth discussion on specific initiatives and risk management practices. The TSA's Strategic Context documents offer a general framework for understanding aviation security programs, but lack detail on setting priorities and aligning initiatives with risk-based strategies. As Congress considers modifying U.S. aviation security approaches, discussions may focus on substantive issues in security policy and planning documents. The evolving nature of threats and vulnerabilities suggests the need for continual adaptation in security strategies. Funding and resource allocation to address shifting risks will be a key consideration in future budget planning. The strategy is a significant issue for future budget planning and debate."
