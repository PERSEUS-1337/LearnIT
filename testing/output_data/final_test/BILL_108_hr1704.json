    "content": "Transitional housing assistance grants for child victims of domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault are being added to the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. This new chapter will provide support for children affected by these crimes. The Attorney General will award grants to provide housing assistance to individuals fleeing domestic violence situations where emergency shelter services are unavailable. Grants may be used for short-term housing assistance and related expenses. The grants awarded by the Attorney General provide utilities payments assistance, support services for relocation to transitional housing, and integration support for individuals fleeing domestic violence situations. Services include transportation, counseling, child care, case management, and employment counseling. The grants provided by the Attorney General offer assistance for up to 18 months to minors, adults, or dependents. Recipients can request a waiver for an additional 6 months if they have tried to secure permanent housing but have been unsuccessful. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Attorney General with the required information to be considered for a grant. Each application for assistance under this section must describe the activities sought and provide assurances deemed essential by the Attorney General. Victims are not required to participate in the criminal justice system to receive services, and domestic violence advocates must not breach client confidentiality. Recipients of grants must annually submit a report to the Attorney General detailing their activities. The report required under this section must detail the number of minors, adults, and dependents assisted, types of housing assistance provided, amount of assistance given, duration of assistance received, and the eligibility of recipients. The Attorney General, along with the Director of the Violence Against Women Office, must annually prepare and submit a report to Congress containing information on the assistance provided to minors, adults, and dependents under this section. This report aims to coordinate efforts to assist victims of domestic violence. The Attorney General, in coordination with the Director of the Violence Against Women Office, transmits a report to the Office of Community Planning and Development at HUD and the Office of Women's Health at HHS. $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2004-2008 for this section, with limitations on the use of funds for salaries. The Attorney General may use funds for salaries and administrative expenses. States, local governments, Indian tribes, and organizations must receive a minimum allocation of 0.75% of the total grant amount, except for certain territories which receive 0.25%. Each entity shall receive a minimum allocation of 0.25% of the total grant amount appropriated in the fiscal year."
