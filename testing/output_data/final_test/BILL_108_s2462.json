    "content": "The Act titled \"21st Century Federal Pell Grant Plus Act\" allows recipients of Federal Pell Grants pursuing programs in engineering, mathematics, science, or foreign languages. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to increase Federal Pell Grants for students pursuing degrees in engineering, mathematics, science, or foreign languages. The Secretary will develop and update a list of eligible programs every two years. The Secretary will update a list of engineering, mathematics, and science programs every two years based on national security and workforce needs. The Secretary, in consultation with other key departments, will develop and update a list of foreign language programs that may qualify students for increased Federal Pell Grants based on national security needs. The Secretary will assess the foreign language needs of the United States for national security, homeland security, and economic security. They will also evaluate if higher education institutions are producing enough graduates to meet these needs now and in the future. Additionally, students who receive increased Federal Pell Grants will be included in this assessment. Each student who received an increased Federal Pell Grant amount for specific programs will remain eligible even if the program is removed from the list. If a student changes their course of study to a program not on the list, their Pell Grant assistance will be reduced in subsequent years. The Secretary will reduce the student's Federal Pell Grant assistance in subsequent academic years based on the total amount to be reduced and the number of years the student received an increased grant amount."
