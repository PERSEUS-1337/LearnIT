    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial was established in the 1930s to preserve St. Louis's role as the \"Gateway to the West\". The Memorial commemorates the daring spirit of pioneers who moved westward after the Louisiana Purchase, with the iconic Arch completed in 1965 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987. The Memorial should connect with urban population and the river, commemorating migration history with educational programs on diversity, policies, impact, and African-American migration patterns. The project described in paragraph (3) aims to be completed by October 28, 2015, in time for the 50th anniversary of the Arch's completion, to engage the American public for the Centennial of the National Park Service in 2016. The Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Act of 1954 authorized the construction of the Memorial, recognizing the importance of visible cultural facilities. The importance of visible cultural facilities at the Memorial is recognized for promoting the connection of the St. Louis riverfront to the region and the Nation. The Museum of Westward Expansion should be improved before the National Park Service Centennial in 2016. The Act defines key terms such as \"Memorial,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"Trust.\" It designates the Gateway Arch and Old St. Louis Courthouse as National Historic Landmarks and the Memorial grounds for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The Secretary is granted authority under the Act. The Secretary has the authority to enter agreements with the Trust for the development of the St. Louis riverfront and Memorial grounds, including conducting design competitions. Additionally, they can facilitate the planning and construction of a cultural facility on Federal land within the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial. The Trust can enhance the visitor experience at the National Expansion Memorial by occupying cultural facilities and assisting in implementing the General Management Plan. They can also transfer portions of the Memorial grounds to the Trust and enter agreements for other facilities and services. The Trust can enhance the visitor experience at the National Expansion Memorial by providing facilities and services in design competitions to complete the project by October 28, 2015."
