    "content": "Within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), aerial assets are operated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP's) Office of Air & Marine (A&M), utilizing advanced technology like sensors, UAVs, and other surveillance systems to enhance border patrol. These \"force multipliers\" enable the USBP to detect intrusions with fewer agents. DHS is exploring the use of UAVs, including drones and RPVs, to support USBP's mission. UAVs, including drones and RPVs, are pilotless aerial vehicles used for autonomous or remote-controlled flight. They can carry lethal or nonlethal payloads and have been crucial in recent conflicts. CBP utilizes RPVs, specifically the Predator B UAVs, for border patrol operations. The CBP is modifying UAVs for maritime operations, including a new ground control station. The modified UAV, called \"Guardian,\" will be based at Corpus Christi Naval Air Station for border and Gulf region flights. The FAA granted authorization for UAV flights in the Texas border and Gulf region, with plans to expand UAV resources and airspace for border operations. Requests for increased domestic use of UAVs have faced delays due to safety concerns stemming from previous incidents. The National Transportation Safety Board addressed safety issues in 2007 after a Predator crash in Arizona, attributing it to a ground operator cutting off the plane's fuel. In 2010, the FAA and CBP grounded UAV flights for six days due to a communication failure in Texas. Despite these incidents, policymakers continue to push for expanded UAV use, with Congress directing DHS to study and implement UAV technology for border surveillance. In the 108th and 109th Congress, legislation was passed to study and implement the use of UAVs for border surveillance. The 2003 DOD Authorization Act required a report on UAVs for homeland security missions. Funding was provided in the FY2006 DHS Appropriations Act for this purpose. The FY2006 DHS Appropriations Act allocated funds for establishing a Northern Border air wing and using UAVs for border security. Subsequent acts provided additional funding for UAVs in border surveillance, with Congress mandating specific amounts for their acquisition and operation. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed DHS to explore the use of UAVs in the marine environment and allocated $15 million for the UAV program. Additionally, DHS was directed to work with other federal agencies to evaluate FAA exemptions for UAV technology. UAV technology can improve border surveillance by providing real-time imagery with Electro-Optical sensors, allowing for informed decisions on deploying border patrol agents quickly. UAVs like the Predator B can fly for over 30 hours without refueling, offering longer flight times and improved coverage compared to manned aircraft. Using UAVs for border security can be beneficial due to their extended range and endurance, which can reduce the burden on human resources. However, rough terrain and dense foliage may degrade the effectiveness of UAVs' sensory equipment. Despite the potential benefits, past problems may hinder UAV implementation on the border. The implementation of UAVs for border security may be hindered by past problems, such as high accident rates and lack of redundancy in their operating systems compared to manned aircraft. Control system failures and difficult weather conditions pose challenges for ground control pilots of UAVs, as they lack the physical proximity and sensory information available to manned pilots. The use of UAVs for border security can be affected by inclement weather conditions, which can distort imagery produced by EO and FLIR equipment. Adding SAR and MTI systems to UAVs like the Predator B could enhance their operational capability for border missions, but would also increase costs. The costs of operating UAVs for border security are more than double that of manned aircraft due to logistical support and specialized training requirements. Each UAV requires a crew of up to 20 support personnel. Despite higher costs, UAVs have lower unit costs compared to manned aircraft. Unit costs range from $350,000 for the Shadow UAV to $4.5 million for the Predator, while manned aircraft costs range from $8.6 million to $36 million. The FAA, DHS, and DOD are addressing the integration of UAVs into civilian airspace in the United States. Regulatory guidelines and technical developments are needed for safe operation. FAA requires UAVs to detect and avoid other aircraft, with licensed pilots as operators. Guidelines for integrating UAVs into the national airspace are being developed by the FAA. The FAA, DHS, and DOD are working on integrating UAVs into civilian airspace in the US. The FAA has developed a certificate of authority for government users to block off airspace for UAV testing. Concerns include collision-avoidance, communication, and weather issues. Congress supports using UAVs for border security, but cost comparisons with manned aircraft are complex. The cost of UAVs may be higher than manned aircraft in terms of procurement and operation. However, UAVs offer longer airtime and potential cost advantages with new command and control systems. Despite some praising their effectiveness in border security operations, questions remain about the overall efficiency of UAVs. T. J. Bonner, president of the Border Patrol union, stated that UAVs are not cost-effective for civilian law enforcement compared to other technologies. The DHS Inspector General found UAVs less effective than manned aircraft in apprehending unauthorized aliens, but noted their advantage of long airtime. Congress may need to consider the effectiveness of UAVs in border security. Testing of UAVs along the border has been limited, and a robust program to test multiple UAVs on the borders might ascertain their effectiveness. Interference and loss of control issues have been observed when multiple UAVs are piloted in close proximity. Congress may need to consider expanding testing before deciding on wide-scale UAV deployment for border security. While UAVs may help detect unauthorized entries, border patrol agents are still needed to apprehend individuals. The issue of whether there are enough border patrol resources to investigate all UAV detections may need to be addressed. The technical capabilities of UAVs have been tested in a military context, but safety and technical issues need to be addressed for potential domestic expansion. Concerns about UAV integration into the crowded national airspace, as well as accident rates compared to manned aircraft, need to be considered. The lack of a timeline for regular UAV use in U.S. airspace raises questions about their deployment along the border by CBP or other agencies. The use of UAVs in civil roles has been implemented in countries like Japan, South Korea, Israel, and Europe. Congress may need to consider a more aggressive plan for UAV integration into U.S. airspace."
