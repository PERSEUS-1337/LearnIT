    "content": "The \"Financial Technology Innovation and Defense Act\" prioritizes investigating terrorist and illicit use of new financial technology, including digital currencies, through an Independent Financial Technology Task Force. The Independent Financial Technology Task Force is established with key members from government agencies and the private sector to conduct research on terrorist and illicit use of new financial technologies, including digital currencies. The Independent Financial Technology Task Force will research terrorist and illicit use of new financial technologies, including digital currencies, and develop legislative and regulatory proposals to improve counter-terrorist and counter-illicit financing efforts. The Task Force will issue an annual report to Congress containing findings, determinations, and proposals. SEC. 4. REWARDS FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO TERRORIST USE OF DIGITAL CURRENCIES. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General, will establish a program to pay rewards for information leading to the conviction of individuals involved in terrorist use of digital currencies. Appropriated funds may be used if fines and forfeitures are insufficient. Fines and forfeitures related to such convictions will be used to pay rewards without further appropriation. The Secretary of the Treasury will use fines and forfeitures related to terrorist use of digital currencies to pay rewards for convictions. Any remaining amounts will be repaid to the Treasury and deposited into the FinTech Leadership in Innovation Fund. The FinTech Leadership in Innovation Fund will receive funds from fines and forfeitures related to terrorist use of digital currencies. The \"FinTech Leadership in Innovation Fund\" is established by the Secretary of the Treasury to detect terrorist and illicit use of digital currencies through grants to various entities in the United States. The Secretary may make grants for the development of tools and programs, pilot programs, test cases, and research related to such tools. Preferences are given to non-proprietary technology, open-source computer code, and proactive tools meeting regulatory requirements. The Secretary may make grants for the development of tools and programs based on global standards like IETF and W3C, supporting existing laws like the Bank Secrecy Act, and requiring open access. Tools and programs developed with a grant under this subsection must be freely accessible to the public, which can be achieved by providing application programming interfaces or software development kits. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Act, the term \"Bank Secrecy Act\" refers to specific sections of various laws. The term \"digital currency\" is defined as a digital representation of value used for exchange, account, or value storage, excluding certain merchant transactions. The term \"terrorist\" includes individuals involved in domestic or international terrorism, as defined in section 2331 of title 18, United States Code."
