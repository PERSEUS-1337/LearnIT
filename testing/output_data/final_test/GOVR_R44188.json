    "content": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant was created in the 1996 welfare reform law to provide grants to states, territories, and Indian tribes for benefits and services to address childhood economic disadvantage. This report discusses the financing of the TANF block grant, including national funding levels, distribution among states, allowable uses of funds, actual usage by states, and policy issues related to funding. The TANF funding is based on historical expenditures from predecessor programs, such as AFDC, EA, and JOBS. These programs provided matching grants to states for cash assistance for needy families, dating back to the Social Security Act of 1935. The TANF funding is based on historical expenditures from predecessor programs like AFDC, EA, and JOBS. Federal funding under AFDC was provided at the Medicaid matching rate, with varying rates based on per-capita income. AFDC benefits, administration, and EA were not capped, while JOBS had annual caps with a minimum matching rate of 60%. The predecessor programs determined state funding based on expenditures, with states having discretion in defining financial need. There was variation in income thresholds and benefits under AFDC, leading to differences in state grants. Figure 1 shows the relationship between AFDC benefits and federal funding per poor child. The 1996 welfare reform law changed state cash assistance programs, imposing time limits and work requirements. Funding shifted from matching grants to a block grant under TANF, consolidating AFDC, EA, and JOBS into a single stream. The size of AFDC benefits correlated with federal funding per poor child. The 1996 welfare reform law consolidated AFDC, EA, and JOBS into a single funding stream through a basic block grant of $16.5 billion per year distributed to states. This fixed funding does not adjust for changes in conditions like inflation or population, providing states with an incentive to help recipients leave welfare. The 1996 welfare reform law provided a fixed TANF block grant to states, not based on the number of recipients. States were \"held harmless\" for the change in financing, but this froze differences in federal funding among states. Federal funding per poor child varied greatly among states in FY1995. In FY1995, grants per poor child varied among states, with the South receiving lower grants compared to the Northeast, Midwest, Pacific Coast, Alaska, and Hawaii. These differences have persisted since FY1997, with funding per poor child being lower in FY2013 than in FY1995. States in the South continue to have lower grants per poor child compared to other regions. Under TANF, states have increased flexibility in spending block grants to address economic disadvantage and root causes of childhood disadvantage. The $16.5 billion basic block grant is the main source of federal funding, supplemented by additional grants listed below. Funding streams for TANF include Supplemental grants for states with high population growth and historically low welfare grants, discontinued after June 30, 2011, and Welfare-to-Work Grants proposed by President Clinton in 1997. In 1997, President Clinton proposed additional funding for \"welfare-to-work\" grants to augment TANF funds. Congress accepted the proposal in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, providing $3 billion over two years. These grants were administered through the Department of Labor and funding was split between formula grants to states and competitive grants. No new welfare-to-work funding was provided after FY1999. The 1996 welfare reform law established a $2 billion \"regular\" TANF contingency fund to address concerns about funding inadequacy during economic downturns. States can access the fund by meeting economic \"need\" criteria and exceeding spending levels from FY1994 on cash, emergency assistance, and job training. The original $2 billion was depleted in FY2010, with new appropriations for FY2011 through FY2015. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided an extra $5 billion for FY2009 and FY2010 to supplement the regular contingency fund and address economic changes. The ARRA \"Emergency Contingency Fund\" (ECF) financed increased spending on basic assistance, emergency aid, and subsidized employment. No ECF funding was provided after FY2010. The 1996 welfare reform law included accountability provisions with two bonus funds for states meeting TANF goals. One bonus was for reduced out-of-wedlock pregnancies, funded up to $100 million per year, and the other was a \"high-performance bonus\" providing an average of $200 million per year. The \"high-performance bonus\" provided an average of $200 million per year to states that qualified for it, but funds were discontinued after FY2005. Total TANF state grant funding has remained relatively stable since FY1998, with exceptions for spikes in funding from the \"Emergency Contingency Fund\" in FY2009 and FY2010. There were no additional emergency funds after FY2010, and supplemental grants ended after FY2011. The composition of federal TANF grants to states in FY2015 differs from earlier years. The composition of federal TANF grants to states has evolved over the years, with changes in funding sources and levels. Funding sources included welfare-to-work grants, supplemental grants, and bonus funds in earlier years, while in FY2012 through FY2015, funds were mainly from the contingency fund. Despite similar overall funding levels in FY2015 compared to the early 2000s, the states receiving contingency funds differed from those receiving supplemental grants and bonus funds. The contingency fund's responsiveness to economic improvements from FY2011 to FY2015 was also noted. The federal and state shares in financing pre-TANF programs varied by state, with higher Medicaid matching rates in states with lower per-capita incomes. TANF requires states to maintain spending on TANF or related activities, with a minimum of $10.4 billion in spending for needy families with children. This maintenance-of-effort level represents 75% of FY1994 state funds spent on predecessor programs. States failing to meet TANF work participation requirements face an increased MOE requirement of 80% of FY1994 spending. TANF law requires states to maintain spending on TANF or related activities, with incentives for exceeding minimum spending levels. States have flexibility in using federal TANF grants to address childhood economic disadvantage. States have broad discretion in using federal TANF grants to meet the block grant's statutory purpose, which includes providing assistance to needy families, promoting job preparation, work, and marriage, preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and encouraging two-parent families. States can also use TANF funds for activities financed by pre-TANF programs. Federal TANF grants allow states to fund various activities, including foster care and juvenile justice, even if they do not directly align with TANF goals. Up to 30% of the TANF block grant can be used for specific transfers or expenditures, such as for child care and social services. States can also reserve unused TANF funds for future fiscal years without any time limit. States can reserve unused TANF funds for future fiscal years without any time limit, allowing flexibility for potential economic downturns or emergencies. Expenditures towards the maintenance of effort requirement are broad and can include activities that benefit TANF-eligible families, such as cash assistance, child care, education, job training, and administrative costs. Additionally, states can count expenditures made by local governments towards this requirement. The rule of federal grants management allows states to include third-party in-kind donations as state expenditures for TANF-eligible families. TANF offers a wider range of activities than pre-1996 programs like AFDC and JOBS. The number of families receiving cash assistance peaked in 1994 but declined rapidly in the late 1990s. The number of families receiving cash assistance declined from FY1995 to FY2000, leading to a decrease in spending on cash assistance. In FY1995, AFDC cash assistance accounted for 70% of all spending, while in FY2014, cash assistance only accounted for 26% of all TANF and MOE dollars. Child care expenditures increased from 3% to 16% of total spending during the same period. Work, education, and training expenditures only grew slightly from 5% to 7% of total spending. From FY1995 to FY2014, work, education, and training expenditures increased from 5% to 7% of total spending. \"Other work supports\" accounted for $4.5 billion in FY2014, representing 14.3% of total TANF and MOE dollars. The largest expenditure growth was in \"other spending,\" which includes various benefits and social services for families with children. The expenditure reporting system in FY2014 lacked sufficient information to categorize much of this spending accurately. The Department of Health and Human Services implemented a new reporting system in FY2015 to better categorize TANF spending. The funding level for TANF has remained unchanged at $16.5 billion since FY2002, with no adjustments for inflation or changes in spending needs. Addressing TANF's financing issues would need to be done in the context of its long-standing funding freeze. In the federal budget process, TANF funding is considered \"mandatory\" spending subject to \"pay-as-you-go\" rules. Legislation to increase TANF spending must be offset by decreases in other mandatory programs or revenue increases. The $16.5 billion TANF block grant is set in authorizing law and represents an entitlement to states. The TANF block grant of $16.5 billion is statutorily determined and remains unchanged despite inflation or population changes. Unlike programs based on caseload estimates, TANF funding does not adjust for inflation annually. The $16.5 billion TANF block grant remains frozen despite inflation, leading to a gradual reduction in purchasing power over time. By FY2015, the block grant could buy 33% less than in FY1997, and if current funding levels persist, it may have only half its original purchasing power by FY2025. The TANF block grant's purchasing power is forecasted to decrease by 46% by FY2025 compared to FY1997 due to inflation. Adjusting for inflation would be seen as increased spending under current budget rules, with an estimated $22 billion increase in cumulative spending over 10 years. The block grant is not adjusted for changes in the relevant TANF population, leading to uncertainties about who should benefit from TANF funding. This report examines TANF funding in relation to the cash assistance population, highlighting that a significant portion of expenditures were not related to traditional cash assistance programs. The estimated number of families eligible for TANF-funded cash assistance declined significantly from 1997 to 2012, with only 30% of eligible families receiving aid in 2012 compared to 73% in 1997. The percentage of families eligible for TANF-funded cash assistance declined to 30% in 2012 from 73% in 1997. TANF basic funding per family increased from FY1997 to FY2000, despite a decrease in the cash assistance caseload and the number of poor families with children. In the post-2000 period, child poverty increased, leading to more families eligible for TANF cash assistance. However, the TANF cash assistance caseload continued to decline, with basic TANF funding per cash assistance family decreasing from 2000 to 2013. In 2013, TANF basic funding per family eligible for cash assistance declined significantly, being 35% below its 1997 level when adjusted for inflation. Additionally, TANF basic funding per poor family with children was 37% below its 1997 level when considering inflation effects. The total basic block grant is based on 1990s levels, and each state's funding is determined by past federal grants. The 1996 law froze historical state differences in federal TANF funds allocation. If the TANF block grant was changed to allocate funds based on the number of poor children in each state, rather than historical expenditures, there would be significant shifts in funding. States with lower than the national average grants per poor child would see increases in funding, while those with higher than average grants per poor child would experience decreases. This reallocation would result in a regional pattern, with states in the South receiving more funding, and states in the Northeast and Midwest receiving less. If TANF block grants were reallocated based on the number of poor children in each state, funding shifts would occur. States with lower grants per poor child would see increases, while those with higher grants would experience decreases. Texas would have the largest increase at 267%, while the District of Columbia would face a 64.5% cut. TANF law includes provisions for reserve and contingency funds to address concerns about funding adequacy during economic downturns. The TANF law allows states to reserve unused block grant funds for economic downturns. Unspent funds were at their lowest in FY2013 but slightly increased in FY2014. States accumulated unspent funds initially, but the value declined after FY2000. By FY2014, unspent funds were 66% lower than in FY2000. The TANF law created a $2 billion fund for extra funding during economic hardship. States must meet criteria of economic need to access the fund, including high unemployment rates and increased SNAP caseloads. The fund grants were not consistently used as a countercyclical source of funds. The TANF contingency fund, initially underused, saw increased grants during the 2007-2009 recession. The fund was exhausted by early FY2010, with the ARRA ECF providing the bulk of extra TANF funding. Congress then provided annual appropriations for the fund from FY2010 to FY2014, except for Wyoming. The TANF contingency fund may continue to spend most of its annual appropriations into the future despite the economic recovery. States tightened eligibility for cash assistance when the ECF expired in FY2010. Congress could opt to address the lack of a counter-cyclical funding source for TANF. States reduced cash assistance benefits and tightened eligibility. Congress could redesign the TANF contingency fund to be more responsive to economic changes, spending less during good times and more during recessions. However, developing such a fund poses challenges as each recession is unique. The use of TANF grants for various services beyond cash assistance raises questions. The TANF block grant raises questions about its primary purpose and flexibility. State organizations advocate for retaining flexibility but there are calls to focus more on cash assistance. There is interest in tightening rules on expenditures and counting third-party services towards the MOE. The bulk of TANF funding is based on pre-TANF program spending. The TANF block grant funding is based on pre-TANF program spending, with a freeze in funding for close to 20 years. Any increase in TANF funding would require offsetting spending reductions or revenue increases elsewhere. Different perspectives on TANF funding adequacy raise fundamental questions about its goals and financing. The TANF basic block grant funding is derived from pre-TANF program spending history. Each state receives a grant based on its peak funding in the early to mid-1990s. The formula for funding allocation considers federal expenditures in predecessor programs from FY1992 to FY1995. Table A-2 shows the federal funding amounts for each state through the TANF block grant. The TANF basic block grant is determined by state MOE levels at 75% and 80% rates of FY1994 predecessor program state expenditures. If a state fails to meet TANF work participation standards, the MOE increases to 80% of FY1994 expenditures. Table A-3 displays total TANF grants to states from FY1997 to FY2015. Federal and State Expenditures Under TANF and its Predecessor Programs are compared in terms of allocations based on poor children. Unspent TANF funds are also discussed."
