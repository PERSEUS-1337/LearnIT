This paper proposes leveraging the low-rank structure of the Q function for more efficient planning in control and deep RL tasks. The existence of low-rank Q functions is empirically verified, and a general framework using Matrix Estimation techniques is introduced to exploit this structure. Value-based methods are widely used in control, planning, and reinforcement learning. Value iteration is a common method to solve Markov Decision Processes by finding the optimal value function. However, for modern MDPs with high-dimensional data, a low-rank scheme can improve performance on tasks. Extensive experiments on control tasks and Atari games validate the effectiveness of this approach. In this work, the authors explore low-rank structures in Q-value functions, which are induced by system dynamics and can improve efficiency in deep reinforcement learning. They investigate whether low-rank Q matrices are common by examining benchmark Atari games. The authors examine low-rank Q matrices in Atari games and control tasks, finding that over 40 Atari games and all 4 control tasks exhibit this structure. They propose leveraging the low-rank structure to enhance performance in value-based techniques through a generic framework that incorporates Matrix Estimation (ME) for recovering low-rank matrices. SVP updates a small portion of Q(s, a) and uses ME to reconstruct the rest, benefiting planning problems with fewer samples. SV-RL extends this concept to deep RL tasks, focusing on a \"sub-matrix\" of states at each iteration and applying ME for structured deep Q learning targets. This approach reduces noise and variance in learning deep RL policies. The proposed framework leverages matrix estimation to exploit low-rank structures in deep reinforcement learning, improving performance on low-rank Atari games. It balances reconstruction error to maintain performance on high-rank games as well. This approach reduces noise and variance in learning deep RL policies. The proposed framework utilizes matrix estimation to leverage low-rank structures in deep reinforcement learning, improving performance on low-rank Atari games. It extends to deep RL, enhancing value-based techniques like DQN, double DQN, and dueling DQN. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvements with SV-RL, achieving higher scores on tasks with confirmed low-rank structures. The deterministic nature imposes a strong relationship among connected states. Our goal is to explore the structures of the Q function and how to exploit them effectively. The Q-value is represented as a 1000 \u00d7 100 matrix, and we analyze its structure through standard Q-value iteration. The approximate rank of Q (t) and the mean-square error (MSE) between Q (t) and the optimal Q * are shown in Fig. 1, demonstrating convergence to Q *. The standard theory guarantees convergence to Q * in a low-rank structure for this toy MDP. Exploiting this structure for efficient planning involves calculating Q (t+1) for select (s, a) pairs and recovering the matrix using the low-rank property. The framework utilizes matrix estimation to reconstruct the low-rank Q matrix efficiently. By randomly sampling 50% of (s, a) pairs for each iteration and reconstructing the Q matrix, comparable results to vanilla value iteration are achieved with reduced computation cost. The complexity of the method scales as O(p|S| 2 |A| 2 )+O M E, where p is the percentage of pairs sampled and O M E is the complexity of the matrix estimation method. The framework utilizes matrix estimation to reconstruct the low-rank Q matrix efficiently by randomly sampling pairs. The complexity of the method scales as O(p|S| 2 |A| 2 )+O M E, where p is the percentage of pairs sampled. Many ME methods employ SVD as a subroutine, with faster methods having linear complexity for low-rank matrices. This approach improves computational efficiency for high-dimensional applications by exploiting low-rank behavior effectively. The methodology is successful in tasks with such structures, with further empirical support provided. Matrix estimation (ME) focuses on recovering a full data matrix from incomplete and noisy observations. The goal is to produce an estimator M that approximates the unknown data matrix X. Recovery is guaranteed if X contains some global structure, with most attention on the low-rank structure. Various algorithms exist in this field, with provable results based on the Frobenius norm. Matrix estimation (ME) aims to recover a full data matrix from incomplete and noisy observations by focusing on the low-rank structure. Various algorithms, including convex optimization methods and spectral methods, are used to achieve this goal efficiently. ME is viewed as a principled reconstruction oracle for exploiting the low-rank structure effectively. The structured value-based planning (SVP) approach leverages low-rank structures for solving MDP with a known model. SVP randomly selects a subset of state-action pairs and computes intermediate Q-values using the Q-value iteration. The full Q matrix is then reconstructed from these observations. The structured value-based planning (SVP) approach leverages low-rank structures for solving MDP with a known model. It randomly selects a subset of state-action pairs and computes intermediate Q-values using Q-value iteration. The full Q matrix is reconstructed with matrix estimation from the set of observations in \u2126, reducing computation cost by roughly 1 \u2212 p. The pseudo-code and technical difficulty for theoretical analysis are provided in Appendix A. Empirical evaluation on classical stochastic control tasks shows the benefits of the approach, particularly in exploiting low-rank structure for efficient planning. The structured value-based planning (SVP) approach utilizes low-rank structures for solving MDP with a known model. It verifies the optimal Q * contains the desired low-rank structure by running vanilla value iteration until convergence, resulting in an approximate rank of 7. Further evidence is provided in Appendix C, showing that \"low-rank\" policies constructed from the converged Q matrix maintain desired performance. The SVP approach applies structured value-based planning to achieve effective performance in MDPs. By utilizing different observation probabilities and a fixed number of iterations, SVP demonstrates success in comparison to optimal policies. The approach requires fewer samples to achieve comparable performance and can be extended to deep RL by exploiting and regularizing structures in the Q-value function. This extension can seamlessly integrate into value-based RL techniques. The Q-value function can be incorporated into value-based RL techniques, including a Q-network, demonstrated on Atari games. Initially treating the Q-value as a matrix, the low-rank structure is verified for certain MDPs. Extending this reasoning to deep RL with images as states presents challenges due to the infinitely large state space. However, leveraging ME to enforce low-rank structures throughout iterations could lead to improved algorithms. The Q-value function in deep RL is explored by understanding the rank of randomly sampled batches of states. Evidence suggests a low-rank structure in learned Q functions on Atari games trained with standard DQN. The objective is the converged values of the algorithm, reflecting the eventually learned Q function. The Q-value function in deep RL is analyzed by randomly sampling batches of states and synthesizing them into a matrix. The rank of the matrix is at most 18, and after repeating the process 10,000 times, it is found that the approximate ranks are uniformly small, mostly around or smaller than 3. This suggests a highly structured low-rank Q function in some deep RL tasks, leading to the exploration of approaches that exploit this structure during training. The structured value-based RL (SV-RL) approach leverages the low-rank structure within batches of states during the SGD step of the learning process in deep RL. This method can be easily integrated into Q-value based RL algorithms, exploiting the structure of sampled batches to improve learning efficiency and performance. When updating the model via SGD, Q-value based methods sample a batch of transitions and form updating targets. The Q network is then updated using a gradient step for the loss function with respect to the parameter \u03b8. To exploit structure, a matrix Q \u2020 is reconstructed from Q via ME, replacing Q in forming the targets for the gradient step. The SV-RL alters the SGD update step by sampling state-action pairs from batches of states and actions, evaluating them via Q. SV-RL alters the SGD update step by sampling state-action pairs from batches of states and actions, evaluating them via Q. The procedure involves reconstructing a matrix Q \u2020 with ME to form new targets for the gradient step, replacing Q in the process. This method is applied to three representative value-based RL techniques in extensive experiments on Atari 2600. SV-RL is applied to DQN, double DQN, and dueling DQN on Atari 2600. Results show that games with structures benefit from the approach, outperforming vanilla algorithms consistently. The intrinsic structures play a crucial role, leading to improvements across different RL techniques. The intrinsic structures play a crucial role in the effectiveness of SV-RL approach on Atari 2600 games. Performance gains vary among games, with most benefiting and a few performing similarly or slightly worse. Four representative examples show SV-RL performing better on some tasks like FROSTBITE and KRULL, slightly better on ALIEN, and slightly worse on SEAQUEST. Further diagnosis is needed to understand the approach's scalability. The SV-RL approach shows varying performance gains on Atari 2600 games, with some games benefiting more than others. The approximate rank of each game influences the improvements, with low-rank structures leading to larger improvements, moderate ranks resulting in small improvements, and high ranks causing similar or slightly worse performances. The empirical results align with these expectations. The SV-RL approach shows varying performance gains on Atari 2600 games based on the rank of the Q-function. Low-rank structures lead to larger improvements, while high ranks result in similar or slightly worse performances. Recent work explores the structure of value function in control tasks. In contrast to decomposition approaches, this study focuses on \"completion\" of the value function to efficiently operate on the original space. The method can be applied to any framework using value-based methods in deep RL, offering a systematic and principled approach. Our approach focuses on general value-based RL methods, leveraging the low-rank structure in value functions using Matrix Estimation. This technique has been widely studied and applied in various domains, showing benefits in deep RL tasks with structured value functions.

The paper focuses on empirical analysis and generalizing the framework to modern deep RL contexts, with consistent benefits shown in experiments. The goal is to balance the inverted pendulum using torque input, with a reward function penalizing control effort. The paper discusses balancing an inverted pendulum using torque input with a reward function that penalizes control effort. It also evaluates the Mountain Car problem where an under-powered car tries to drive up a steep hill. The dynamics of the car are controlled by acceleration input u, with a reward function encouraging reaching the top of the mountain at x=0.5. State and action spaces are restricted, and evaluation is based on the time taken to reach the top. Another evaluation involves a Double Integrator system where a brick is controlled to x=[0,0]T on a frictionless surface. The Double Integrator system is controlled to x=[0,0]T on a frictionless surface. The state space is restricted to [-3, 3] for position and velocity, with input limited to [-1, 1]. The evaluation metric is the time taken to reach the target state. Another control problem chosen is the Cart-Pole, with a pole attached to a cart on a frictionless track, controlled by limited force within 10N. The Cart-Pole system involves controlling a pole attached to a cart with limited force within 10N to keep it in an upright position. The dynamics are described by the angle and angular speed of the pole, and the position and speed of the cart. The reward function favors the pole being upright, and the state space is limited to [-0.5] for the cart position. The simulation involves controlling a pole attached to a cart with limited force. The state space is limited to [-0.5] for the cart position. The Q-value function matrix has a low-rank structure, and \"low-rank\" policies are constructed from it with similar performance to the optimal policy. The Q-value function matrix has a low-rank structure, as shown in the inverted pendulum problem. \"Low-rank\" policies, reconstructed from the Q matrix, perform similarly to the optimal policy in terms of policy trajectory and input torque changes. Additionally, the SVP policy's performance is demonstrated with varying percentages of observed data. The SVP policies are demonstrated with 20% and 60% observation percentages, showing similar performance to the optimal policy. A \"low-rank\" policy is generated from the optimal value function, maintaining almost identical performance to the optimal one. The reconstructed policy shows small deviations in the trajectory but stabilizes in the upright position. The SVP policies demonstrate comparable results to the optimal policy with different amounts of observed data. The low-rank policy generated from the optimal value function shows visually identical performance. The SVP policies consistently show decent results, harnessing strong low-rank structure with only 20% observed data. Evaluation on the Cart-Pole system focuses on angle deviation, visualizing policy heatmaps with the first two dimensions. Results demonstrate that the reconstructed policy maintains almost identical performance with a small amount of sampled data. The SVP policies demonstrate efficient planning by leveraging strong low-rank structures with only 20% observed data. Training details include network architectures of DQN and dueling DQN, Adam optimizer, and hyper-parameters such as learning rate, discount coefficient, and minibatch size. The experiments involved updating the target network every 10,000 steps and using a linearly decreasing exploration policy. The Soft-Impute algorithm was mainly used with a sub-sample rate of p = 0.9. Results were shown for DQN, double DQN, and dueling DQN across various Atari games, with consistent benefits from SV-RL observed in tasks with low-rank structures. The performance of Atari games is associated with their approximate rank, with most games benefiting from SV-RL. When games have low-rank structures, SV-RL consistently improves performance in value-based RL techniques. However, for games with higher ranks like SEAQUEST, SV-RL may perform similarly or worse than vanilla DQN. The proposed SV-RL efficiently harnesses structures for better performance in deep RL tasks. The text discusses the discretization of state-action pairs in the Inverted Pendulum problem for value iteration. Three different discretization values are chosen to provide varying levels of granularity for both state and action values. The text discusses the effectiveness of different discretization values in the Inverted Pendulum problem for value iteration. Results show that as long as the discretization is fine enough to represent the optimal policy, the final Q matrix after value iteration will have a similar rank. The text discusses the impact of batch size on learning complex games with different rank properties. Results show that a small batch size may not be sufficient for games with higher rank, leading to a deviation from the original game structure. The ME oracle attempts to find the best rank structure for complex games with different properties. For games with high rank, a larger batch size is needed to balance reconstruction error and performance. Conversely, games with low rank can explore the structure with a small batch size, but a larger batch size wouldn't hurt. SV-RL is expected to perform better with the right batch size. In Frostbite (low rank) and Seaquest (high rank) games, varying batch sizes of 32, 64, and 128 show that vanilla DQN with SV-RL consistently outperforms vanilla DQN by a certain margin. This aligns with the expectation that SV-RL performs better with the right batch size."
