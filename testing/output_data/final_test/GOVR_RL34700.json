    "content": "Continuing appropriations acts, known as continuing resolutions (CRs), are crucial in the annual appropriations process when final decisions on regular appropriations acts are not reached. There are two types of CRs: \"interim\" CRs provide stopgap funding until final decisions are made, while \"full-year\" CRs provide funding for the remainder of the fiscal year. If CRs are not enacted, a funding gap and government shutdown can occur. This report examines the potential impacts of interim CRs on agency operations. Interim CRs are crucial in the federal budget process, providing stopgap funding until final decisions are made. Studies on their impacts are limited, as they vary in formulation and affect agencies differently. Generalizable statements are difficult without specific analysis. This report discusses potential impacts of interim CRs using three approaches. The report analyzes guidance from OMB and agencies on navigating interim CRs, mentions of impact in GAO reports, and a 2009 case study on the effects of interim CRs on federal agencies. This raises issues for Congress regarding the roles of the President, OMB, and agencies in dealing with interim CRs. The President, OMB, and agencies have roles in formulating, negotiating, and implementing interim CRs. Their involvement means Congress does not solely determine the impacts of CRs. Interim CRs result from high-stakes negotiations over fiscal and policy issues, with claims about their impacts used to push for changes in budget priorities or processes. Different assumptions about the outcomes without CRs can lead to varying perspectives on their necessity. The report discusses the significance of interim CRs in budget deliberations and how they can impact power relationships among participants. Full-year CRs are less common and effectively become regular appropriations acts for the fiscal year, providing certainty in funding decisions. The usage of the term \"continuing resolution\" has evolved to reflect changing budget practices. The report highlights how interim CRs impact agency operations and discusses terms related to CRs. The federal fiscal year starts on October 1, and appropriations must be enacted by then for government activities to continue. Delays in finalizing appropriations acts can occur due to negotiations between Congress and the President. Interim CRs are used when Congress and the President have not made final decisions on appropriations. They provide temporary funding for agencies until a specified date, new CR enactment, or full-year appropriations. The term \"continuing\" indicates funding will continue at a certain level pending further decisions. Interim CRs aim to preserve congressional prerogatives, prevent funding gaps, and avoid government shutdowns during budget negotiations. Interim CRs provide temporary funding for agencies to prevent a funding gap and government shutdown. They may have restrictive funding levels and intentional concessions to incentivize negotiations for final decisions. The structure of interim CRs has remained fairly constant in recent years. Interim CRs provide temporary funding for agencies to prevent a funding gap and government shutdown, with funding provided at a specified \"rate for operations\" for accounts covered by the CR. The funding rate is calculated using formulas based on annual spending levels. Interim CRs provide temporary funding for agencies to prevent a funding gap and government shutdown. Funding rates are determined based on formulas using previous fiscal year funding levels. OMB issues detailed instructions to agencies after an interim CR is enacted, typically through a bulletin. The bulletin announces an \"automatic apportionment\" of funds based on the annualized amount provided by the CR. Funds are apportioned either in proportion to the time period of the fiscal year covered by the CR or according to historical spending patterns. Interim CRs may also authorize OMB to allocate funds for personnel compensation and benefits at a higher rate to mitigate furloughs. Interim CRs impose paperwork burden on agencies and restrict agency activities to protect Congress's funding prerogative. They may prohibit new projects without available funds from the previous fiscal year and include provisions for programs with high initial rates of operation or distributions of funds. The joint resolution for fiscal year 2008 limits initial distribution of appropriations to prevent impinging on final funding prerogatives. Anomalies may be negotiated to address exceptional circumstances, ensuring the continuation of projects and activities with limited funding actions. CR negotiations involve addressing major programmatic, operational, and management problems that could arise from using a uniform funding approach. Anomalies in CRs are rare compared to typical coverage, and they can include substantive legislative provisions from various committees. A CR without anomalies or legislative provisions is called a \"clean\" CR, but they have also been described as clean at times. An interim CR, also known as a \"clean\" CR, may impact agency operations and prevent funding gaps and government shutdowns. Shutdowns prior to FY1996 were short-lived with modest effects, but partial shutdowns in FY1996 had more significant impacts. The partial shutdowns of the federal government in FY1996 had significant effects, with an estimated 800,000 federal employees furloughed during a five-day shutdown in November 1995. A 21-day shutdown a month later resulted in nearly 300,000 federal employees being furloughed. The shutdowns also impacted the delivery of services and had effects on agency administrative work. Interim CRs determine funding levels for agencies, which can result in less, more, or the same funding compared to a full-year appropriation. This can impact agency operations and budget planning, especially in cases of policy conflicts among the House, Senate, and President. Interim CRs can lead to funding discrepancies for agencies, impacting their operations and budget planning. Depending on the expected funding level, agencies may face constraints or flexibility in their actions such as hiring, contracts, and travel. Interim CRs may impact agencies' ability to undertake planned activities, delay new projects, and create uncertainty in funding levels and timing. This could affect hiring, contracts, and travel, depending on the agency's operations and the specifics of the CR. Interim CRs can cause agencies to adjust operations, spending rates, and patterns, potentially affecting internal management and program activities. OMB and agencies have developed guidance to navigate the impacts of interim CRs based on their extensive experience operating under them. The OMB has issued guidance documents like Circular No. A-11 to help agencies operate under interim CRs, focusing on fund calculations and compliance with the Antideficiency Act. There is a risk of agencies not correctly calculating funds without OMB supervision. During an interim CR, agencies must follow specific practices to avoid disruptions to essential government services. OMB guidance emphasizes the importance of determining funding availability, modifying contracts to meet fiscal constraints, providing notice of funding limitations to contractors, and using funds efficiently to minimize disruptions. During an interim CR, agencies must follow specific practices to avoid disruptions to essential government services. Agency documents provide guidance on how to operate under a CR, ranging from elaborate to ad hoc. NASA has integrated CRs and shutdowns into its budget execution process. Agencies issue documents advising on grant awards under a CR and providing advice to officials on making timely grant awards. The existence of agency-level documents highlights the risk of non-compliance with congressional directives without detailed guidance. Agency personnel need instructions on managing funds for military personnel, operation, maintenance, and other expenses to ensure spending stays within minimal amounts set by Congress. It is crucial to provide detailed guidance on expenditure limits for travel, training, and discretionary costs to prevent overspending. The agency must caution personnel to restrain spending despite potential increases in appropriations bills. Timely grant awards may be challenging under short continuing resolutions, but stakeholders must be informed of potential funding uncertainties. A GAO report focused on the impacts of interim CRs on program delivery. GAO studied the effects of interim CRs on agencies' operations, noting administrative inefficiencies like hiring delays and repetitive work. Longer-term CRs delayed contracts for projects and compressed time for grants. Some agencies shifted contract and grant cycles to later in the fiscal year to reduce additional work. Long-term CRs allow for better planning but may limit decision-making options. GAO reports suggest potential impacts of interim CRs on operations. Claims of impact associated with interim CRs were mentioned in GAO reports, with agency officials attributing them to funding levels or funding uncertainty. These claims included minimized travel expenses, delayed hiring and training, limitations on construction projects funding, suspension of loan guarantees, delayed contracts, and delayed delivery of funds to recipients. The GAO reports and testimonies cited alleged impacts of interim CRs on agency operations, including frozen hiring, reduced case processing, and delayed start-ups of initiatives. The potential impacts of interim CRs on various activities in agencies remain unclear without validation studies. The possibility of interim CR-related impacts may raise issues for Congress, with claims of impacts potentially leading to arguments for changes in budget priorities or the budget process. Anomalies may be included in interim CRs to address specific needs or modifications. Anomalies in interim CRs may modify funding for agencies to mimic regular appropriations acts, but are often not included. This rarity could be due to concerns that too many anomalies would hinder serious negotiations for full-year appropriations. Additionally, anomalies could weaken stakeholders' leverage unless consensus deems them necessary. An agency can request an anomaly during the fiscal year to undertake new projects or activities. The request can be made through the President and OMB or directly to Congress. Direct communications between agencies and Congress have been a contentious issue in budgetary contexts. Executive agencies have operated under statutory requirements since 1921 that require budget-related requests to be submitted through the President. The President, OMB, and agencies play a role in formulating interim CRs, influencing their potential impacts. Agencies and their employees have access to crucial information about these impacts, which Congress may not always have. Congress has prohibited executive branch officers and employees from submitting budget requests directly to Congress, requiring them to go through the President. The President, OMB, and agencies influence interim CRs' impacts. Congress restricts budget requests to go through the President. Some agencies have \"bypass authority\" exempting them from restrictions. OMB regulations advise agencies to align with Administration policies when communicating with Congress. The flow of information from agencies to Congress about interim CR impacts may vary. Claims about impacts rest on implicit assumptions comparing the change caused by an interim CR to what would have happened without it. The impact of an interim CR is determined by comparing the effects it caused to what would have happened without it. Claims about the impact of uncertainty caused by an interim CR assume that full-year appropriations would have been passed by October 1, eliminating funding uncertainty. However, it is also possible that the absence of a CR could lead to a government shutdown instead of the enactment of full-year appropriations. The impact of an interim CR is debatable, as it may prevent a government shutdown or hinder negotiations for full-year appropriations. Different observers may question the validity of assumptions and argue for changes in budget priorities. Interim CRs are products of negotiation with varying underlying values and assumptions. Participants in a negotiation may have opposing perspectives based on their aspirations and negotiating leverage, leading to contrasting viewpoints until decisions are made."
