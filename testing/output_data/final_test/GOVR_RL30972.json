    "content": "The Brownfields Economic Redevelopment Initiative, started in 1993 by the EPA, aims to address sites contaminated by hazardous substances that do not qualify for Superfund cleanup. It provides funding for activities before cleanup, focusing on abandoned industrial and commercial facilities with environmental contamination issues. These sites, ranging from gas stations to factories, are often found in economically distressed areas. Brownfield sites face challenges as they are not eligible for Superfund remediation funding due to low public health risk, leading developers to avoid them due to cleanup costs and potential liability issues. The brownfields program was created administratively by the EPA and has been recognized by Congress since FY1997. There is a push to establish the program by law to provide legislative guidance and structure. In the 106th Congress, several bills with brownfields provisions were introduced. In 2001, the Senate passed S. 350 (S.Rept.107-2) to provide statutory authority for the brownfields program, funding of $250 million per year, and relief from Superfund liability. The program has broad support from states, environmental groups, businesses, and community activists, who believe it can leverage funds to address low-level contamination and unlock economic potential of brownfield sites. The brownfields program aims to revitalize contaminated sites, creating economic opportunities and social benefits for communities. It provides grants to catalyze environmental cleanups and spur redevelopment efforts, filling a previously unmet need for a cleaner environment, new jobs, and economic recovery. States also use voluntary cleanup programs to address contaminated sites. States are addressing contaminated sites through voluntary cleanup programs, adopted by 44 states by 1997. These programs encourage cooperation with the state to avoid costs and delays of enforcement-driven cleanup. Incentives include liability release, streamlined processes, financial incentives, and technical assistance. States define brownfield sites differently but generally follow EPA's definition. States define brownfield sites differently but generally follow EPA's definition. Florida and North Carolina have specific cleanup approaches for brownfields, while Mississippi requires risk assessment. The distinction between brownfields and voluntary programs is often semantic, according to the Environmental Law Institute. The Environmental Law Institute distinguishes between voluntary programs and brownfield programs. Voluntary programs focus on cleaning up less contaminated sites without targeting redevelopment, while brownfield programs are more likely to focus on redevelopment in distressed urban areas. Congress tacitly approved the brownfields program by providing funding in Superfund appropriations, despite it not being mentioned in CERCLA. EPA has redefined and expanded the brownfields program multiple times. EPA has expanded the brownfields program by increasing grants for assessments, initiating cleanup revolving loan fund grants and job training grants, and establishing Brownfields Showcase Communities. They have also used targeted assessments and provided supplemental awards for greenspace enhancement to relieve cleanup liability uncertainty. EPA has issued guidances to clarify situations where enforcement discretion will be used, such as against prospective purchasers of brownfields. EPA provides funding for brownfields through cooperative agreements with various governmental entities and organizations. Grants of up to $200,000 over 2 years are awarded for brownfield assessment pilot projects, focusing on redevelopment plans and commitments to cleanup and redevelopment. The Targeted Brownfields Assessment program, managed by EPA's regional offices, awards funds for identifying contamination at sites with development potential and community support. Through FY2000, $32.8 million was awarded for 500 targeted assessments. In FY2000, $32.8 million was awarded for 500 targeted assessments. Supplemental awards of $150,000 are available for previous recipients of brownfield assessment funding. Greenspace awards of $50,000 can be granted for assessing contamination on brownfield sites intended for greenspace use. Brownfield Cleanup Revolving Loan Fund (BCRLF) grants are available for communities and governments that have received assessment grants. Assessment grants are eligible for Brownfields Cleanup Revolving Loan Fund pilot projects (BCRLF) for up to $500,000. BCRLF awards can now be up to $1 million over 5 years. Loans may be made to facility owners not liable for cleanup under CERCLA. Repaid loans replenish the fund for future use. Some sites are not eligible for loans, such as those on the National Priorities List or with pending enforcement actions. Through April 2001, 151 BCRLF grants totaling $64.8 million have been awarded. Job training grants of up to $200,000 over 2 years are available to train residents of brownfields communities in handling hazardous materials. Recipients must recruit participants from the neighborhoods, including the unemployed, welfare-to-work program participants, and disadvantaged groups, to clean up hazardous waste facilities. EPA made these grants available through December 2000. EPA provides funds for state voluntary cleanup programs, totaling $41.6 million through FY2000. In July 1996, EPA created a federal Interagency Working Group on Brownfields to coordinate agency efforts and resources. Showcase Communities and the Department of Housing and Urban Development program are visible outcomes of this collaboration. The Department of Housing and Urban Development program is part of the federal effort to address brownfields. Showcase Communities serve as national models for brownfield redevelopment, with collaborative support from multiple federal agencies. Coordination among federal agencies involved in brownfield activities has improved according to GAO. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has its Brownfields Economic Development Initiative (BEDI), which provides start-up funds to attract private financing for brownfield cleanup and redevelopment. BEDI works in conjunction with Community Development Block Grants and the Section 108 Loan Guarantee programs. EPA's loaned staff person under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act has been a major reason for the success of brownfield redevelopment efforts. The EPA revamped the CERCLIS database in 1995 to address cleanup issues for brownfields. The worst sites are placed on the National Priorities List for cleanup under the Superfund program, but procedures to remove less contaminated facilities, including brownfields, were lacking. The EPA updated the CERCLIS database in 1995 to address cleanup issues for brownfields. Over 32,000 CERCLIS sites have been archived, with procedures in place to remove sites where no further action is needed. EPA issued guidances on liability for prospective purchasers of contaminated property and property owners with groundwater contamination. Senate bill S. 350 aims to protect against liability and clarify CERCLA's innocent landowner defense. Other guidances covered federally owned property transfer, underground storage tank cleanup, soil testing, and the RCRA corrective action program. The EPA is working on improving communication with minority communities and increasing their involvement in the brownfields effort. The National Environmental Justice Advisory Council held public hearings and released recommendations for creating healthy and sustainable communities. The 104th Congress enacted the Asset Conservation, Lender Liability, and Deposit Insurance Protection Act in December 1996 to clarify enforcement policy regarding lenders and governmental entities acquiring contaminated property involuntarily. The popularity of the brownfields program led to its rapid expansion from $8 million in FY1996 to $87.4 million 2 years later. Legislative proposals aimed to provide the program with funding outside the Superfund framework. EPA funded brownfield activities initially from Superfund appropriations before receiving a specific line item allocation of $37.7 million in FY1997. In FY1997, EPA allocated $37.7 million specifically for brownfields, which was 2.6% of the Superfund appropriation. The funding supported grants for site assessment and pre-remedial activities, as well as revolving loan funds for cleanups. The FY1998 appropriation increased the brownfields program by $50 million to $87.4 million (5.8% of Superfund appropriation) and provided $25 million for HUD's Brownfield Economic Development Initiative. However, the conference committee questioned EPA's authority to use Superfund money for revolving loan funds for non-emergency sites, denying the request unless authorized in subsequent legislation. In FY1997, EPA allocated $37.7 million for brownfields, supporting grants for site assessment and revolving loan funds. FY1998 saw an increase to $87.4 million, with $25 million for HUD's Brownfield Economic Development Initiative. Congress approved $91 million for brownfields in FY1999, with plans to capitalize RLFs in 100 communities. Funding remained steady for HUD at $25 million. EPA requested $200 million for FY2003, while the administration sought $25 million for HUD's brownfields program. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 introduced a tax break for brownfields, initially valid for 3 years and later extended to 2003. Eligibility was limited to specific criteria, including poverty rates and designated zones. Subsequent acts further extended the incentive until December 31, 2003. The administration aims to make this provision permanent. The brownfields tax incentive was extended for an additional 2 years until December 31, 2003, broadening eligibility to include sites with hazardous substances certified by state agencies. This incentive was enacted to address tax treatment issues related to cleaning up contaminated land, allowing for immediate deduction of costs instead of capitalizing them over time. The brownfields tax incentive encourages development by deferring tax liability through recapture provision, which taxes gains as ordinary income when property is sold. Factors affecting the value of the tax break include project cost, cleanup expenses, holding period, and individual tax situation. In the 107th Congress, eleven brownfields bills were introduced, with S. 350 (later H.R. 2869) being enacted as P.L.107-118. Senator Lincoln Chafee introduced S. 350 in February 2001, addressing concerns about cleanup and development barriers at brownfield sites. S. 350, enacted as P.L.107-118, includes finality language but allows EPA to intervene for public health or environmental threats. Senators negotiated exceptions to the finality language, leading to a managers' amendment adopted in Senate debate. Title I of S. 350 directs EPA to establish programs for grants at brownfield sites. The bill, authorized for 5 years, includes grants for brownfield site assessments and remediation. Grants are limited to $200,000 for characterization and $1 million for remediation. $50 million per year is allocated for low-risk site cleanup. Title II provides liability protection for landowners of contaminated sites. Title III of S. 350 authorizes $50 million per year for 5 years to assist states in establishing or enhancing their voluntary cleanup programs for contaminated sites. States can use these grants for various purposes, including capitalizing revolving loan funds and developing risk-sharing pools or insurance mechanisms for financing response actions. The bill also clarifies the \"innocent landowner\" defense under the Superfund law, outlining the requirements for a purchaser to qualify as an innocent landowner. Additionally, the provisions apply to all contaminated sites, not just brownfields. Title III of S. 350 addresses the finality issue in cleaning up contaminated sites under state programs. Federal enforcement is prohibited unless certain conditions are met, such as state request for assistance, contamination crossing state lines, or EPA determining imminent endangerment. The federal ban is dependent on states maintaining public records of completed response actions and upcoming cleanups. The Environment and Public Works Committee emphasized the importance of this in the bill report. The Environment and Public Works Committee expects Title I funding to be separate from Superfund funding. H.R. 2869 merged bills addressing Superfund liability for small businesses. Two issues delayed passage of the bill. The passage of H.R. 2869 was delayed due to two main issues: the \"state finality\" question regarding EPA intervention in state cleanup programs, and the application of the Davis-Bacon Act to brownfield cleanups. House Speaker Dennis Hastert played a role in persuading members to pass the bill. Additionally, ten other bills have been introduced on related topics. Ten other bills have been introduced in the 107th Congress, including S. 23 and H.R. 324, which would provide statutory authority for the brownfields program. S. 23, introduced by Senator Specter, is an urban economic development bill that approves EPA's existing program. H.R. 324, introduced by Representative Boehlert, is a Superfund reauthorization bill addressing the state finality issue and containing liability relief provisions. Another bill, H.R. 2064 by Representative Quinn, would give statutory authority to three agencies for funding brownfields within their existing programs. Three bills in the 107th Congress address brownfields programs, focusing on HUD, the Small Business Administration, and the Economic Development Administration. These bills aim to expand the list of eligible sites for brownfield grants to include former illegal drug labs, petroleum-contaminated sites, and mine-scarred lands. The criteria for eligibility include low risk, no viable responsible party, and not being subject to a cleanup order. The Quinn bill and three others, S. 1082, H.R. 2264, and H.R. 1439, address the expensing of cleanup costs for brownfields. These bills aim to make the tax break permanent and expand the definition of hazardous substances eligible for cleanup. Additionally, H.R. 2064 would add new tax breaks to stimulate brownfields development. H.R. 2064 proposes four new tax breaks to incentivize brownfields redevelopment: a 50% tax credit for cleanup costs up to $50,000 per site, establishment of \"Brownfield IRAs\" for up to $1 million annually tax-free, tax exemption on interest earned from brownfield loans up to $100,000 per year, and a 20% tax credit for research and development costs. The fourth tax break proposed in H.R. 2064 offers a 20% tax credit for research and development of environmental remediation technology. Representative Andrews's H.R. 3170 suggests a tax credit for qualified brownfields cleanup bonds issued by state or local governments. The administration supports making the brownfields tax incentive permanent and will include it in the budget request. S. 23 in the 107th Congress bans federal enforcement without exceptions for substances like asbestos, oil, pesticides, radon, and lead-based paint."
