    "content": "Coal mining in the United States in the 20th century led to the enactment of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act in 1977. This law established the Abandoned Mine Lands program to address environmental hazards at abandoned coal mining sites by restoring affected lands and waters. The objective is to mitigate potential hazards to public health, safety, and the environment through reclamation efforts tailored to each site's specific needs. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund provides funding for reclamation activities to mitigate hazards at abandoned coal mining sites. Reclamation activities include removing waste piles, re-vegetating lands, and treating acid mine drainage. Funding prioritization depends on hazard severity and technical feasibility. Title IV of SMCRA applies to abandoned coal mining sites prior to August 3, 1977. OSMRE administers SMCRA with states and tribes. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund is funded by fees from coal mining operators. Grants are provided to states and tribes for reclamation efforts. Title IV of SMCRA authorizes federal financial assistance to UMWA coal mineworker health benefits plans and the UMWA pension plan. General Fund payments support these plans, with additional funding authorized in the 116th Congress. The coal reclamation fee collection authorization is set to expire in FY2021, with remaining funds to be distributed among states and tribes for reclamation efforts. The FY2022 grant amounts from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund would be distributed to states and tribes based on fees collected in FY2021. Payments would start in FY2023 and continue annually until the balance is used up. This report covers funding for states and tribes, reclamation priorities, receipts, appropriations, reauthorization issues, and related bills. It does not address Title V of SMCRA, which deals with financial assurance for reclamation of coal mining sites. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, established under SMCRA, does not provide grants for coal mining sites regulated after August 3, 1977. If financial assurances are insufficient for reclamation, federal funding availability depends on legislation enactment. The fund was initially non-interest bearing but was amended in 1990 to allow investment in U.S. Treasury securities. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund receives fees from coal mining operators based on coal production rates authorized by SMCRA. The fees vary for surface mining, underground mining, and lignite coal, with rates determined annually by the Secretary of the Interior. Congress decreased fee rates authorized in the original enactment of SMCRA to those in the 2006 amendments. Annual receipts to the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund depend on fee rates applied to coal production. Receipts fluctuate annually with changes in coal production. Coal reclamation fees increased until FY2007, then decreased from FY2008 to FY2019 by approximately 49% in nominal dollars. U.S. coal production declined by approximately 34% during the same period. The inflation-adjusted value of coal reclamation fees has generally decreased since FY1979, with reduced fee rates in 2006 contributing to the decline in fee receipts. Section 404 of SMCRA limits eligible lands affected by coal mining to those abandoned before August 3, 1977. U.S. territories, states, and tribes without such lands are excluded from grants from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. The reclamation programs authorized in SMCRA apply only to coal production states and tribal lands. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund provides grants for reclamation projects on lands where coal mining occurred before August 3, 1977. These projects include addressing land subsidence, hazardous equipment, dangerous highways, and acid mine drainage. Projects are prioritized based on public health and safety concerns, with Priority 1 projects focusing on extreme dangers. Priority 2 and 3 projects involve reclaiming lands and waters degraded by coal mining for public health and safety, conservation, and development purposes. Priority 2 projects are similar to Priority 1 but with lesser danger, while proximity to communities can increase risks. The geographic scope of a mining site may extend beyond its location, affecting lands and waters. Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) results from minerals in coal reacting with oxygen and water, creating sulfuric acid. This acid can contaminate water, impacting ecosystems and impairing water quality. Reclamation projects may be prioritized to address AMD issues and prevent harm to communities. States receiving grants from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund can allocate up to 30% of their funds to an acid mine drainage abatement fund, which is not subject to time limitations and can accrue interest. This is important because water quality issues associated with AMD can persist for decades. Annual grants from the fund support the reclamation of abandoned coal mining sites within states and tribes' jurisdictions. OSMRE approval of state and tribal reclamation programs is necessary to access federal funds. Programs must meet federal requirements and can be more stringent. OSMRE has approved programs for 25 states and three tribes. Certification by OSMRE requires reclaiming all priority abandoned coal mining sites. States and tribes can apply for certification, subject to public comment. Certified entities can use grants for reclamation efforts. OSMRE has certified five states and three tribes for reclaiming abandoned coal mining sites. Section 411 limits the use of annual grants for reclamation purposes. Uncertified states can receive grants for reclamation efforts from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. OSMRE administers grants from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund for uncertified states, while certified states and tribes receive annual payments from the General Fund. Grants are distributed based on a statutory formula, with summaries published annually. Grant distribution for FY2019 is detailed in Table 1 and Table 2. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2006 authorized General Fund payments to certified states and tribes. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2006 authorized General Fund payments to certified states and tribes for coal reclamation. Over 80% of annual coal reclamation fee collections are distributed to eligible uncertified states based on a statutory formula. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2006 authorized General Fund payments to certified states and tribes for coal reclamation. 30% of fee collections are based on historic coal production before August 3, 1977. Fees collected in certified states and on tribal lands affect the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund for annual grants to uncertified states. Minimum Program Make Up Funds ensure each uncertified state receives at least $3 million annually. 20% of fee collections are available for this purpose and discretionary spending. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2006 authorized General Fund payments to certified states and tribes for coal reclamation. 30% of fee collections are based on historic coal production before August 3, 1977. Minimum Program Make Up Funds ensure each uncertified state receives at least $3 million annually. Any unspent 50% state share grant after three years becomes historic coal payments. Interest from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund supports UMWA health benefit plans. General Fund payments supplement interest for UMWA health benefit plans and UMWA pension plans are also eligible for General Fund payments. The UMWA pension plan is eligible for General Fund payments but not from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. Section 401(f)(5)(B) of SMCRA authorized a four-year \"phase-in\" period for mandatory payments to uncertified states. Grants to uncertified states were reduced during FY2008-FY2011. Certified states and tribes can receive annual payments from the General Fund equivalent to 50% of annual coal reclamation fees collected within their jurisdictions. Fees collected from coal mining operations in certified states are credited to the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. Certified states and tribes receive payments from the General Fund instead of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, and can use these funds for non-coal mineral development impacts. They did not receive historic coal payments or minimum program make up funds. A three-year \"phase-in\" period for annual payments occurred between FY2009 and FY2011, with payments reduced to 25% in FY2009, 50% in FY2010, and 75% in FY2011. OSMRE paid the total reduced amount in FY2018 and FY2019. In FY2018 and FY2019, two equal payments were made from the General Fund to certified states and tribes. However, starting in FY2020, these payments will no longer be received as they have been fully paid out. Congress imposed a $15 million cap on annual payments to each certified state or tribe in 2012, which was later increased to $28 million in FY2014 and $75 million in FY2015. Wyoming was the only state affected by the caps in FY2013 and FY2014. In 2015, Congress removed the caps on payments to certified states and tribes. The amendment to Section 411(h) of SMCRA authorized a retroactive payment of $242 million to Wyoming in FY2016. This payment was part of the total payment to Wyoming in FY2016, which also included annual in lieu payments to certified states and tribes. The unappropriated balance of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund mainly accumulated before the 2006 amendments to SMCRA. Prior to these amendments, OSMRE distributed payments to both certified and uncertified states and tribes from the Fund, resulting in an accumulation of unappropriated balance. The 2006 amendments led to an accumulation in the unappropriated balance of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. Section 411(h)(1) of SMCRA authorized \"Prior Balance\" payments to states and tribes from FY2008 through FY2014. These payments were fully distributed by the end of FY2014, except for Wyoming, which received a retroactive payment in FY2016. States and tribes no longer receive these prior balance payments, but the accumulated balance of past coal reclamation fees continues to accrue interest annually. The Mine Reclamation Fund accrues interest annually from investments in U.S. Treasury securities. States and tribes report site-specific information to OSMRE about eligible AML projects. OSMRE tracks AML reclamation project costs under three separate categories to estimate funding needs for future projects. According to AMLIS, the total unfunded costs for uncertified and certified states and tribes was approximately $12.4 billion as of January 21, 2020. The total unfunded cost estimates for uncertified states were approximately $12 billion, representing roughly 97% of the remaining unfunded reclamation needs. Unfunded reclamation cost estimates depend on the number of unreclaimed sites and on the severity of the reclamation problems as defined by the \"Priority\" level for each unclaimed site in the state. Uncertified states reported Priority 2 costs as approximately $7.5 billion. Uncertified states reported Priority 2 costs of approximately $7.5 billion, making up 62% of the total unfunded reclamation costs. Priority 1 issues, representing the most severe hazards, were reported as the smallest portion of unfunded costs at roughly $1.8 billion. Pennsylvania and West Virginia combined reported unfunded reclamation costs of $8.4 billion, with Pennsylvania having the highest costs exceeding $5 billion. Future funding requirements for Abandoned Mine Land (AML) sites may change as unforeseen contamination and remediation needs arise. The scale and depth of the AML problem have become better understood over time, but new sites are still being discovered, especially those associated with abandoned underground mines. Estimates for AML sites in the AMLIS inventory exceed $5 billion, with funding categories periodically updated. Challenges in cataloging AML issues were highlighted in recent congressional testimony by a Pennsylvania state official. The AML inventory continues to grow due to new sites, including those linked to abandoned underground mines. Advancements in technology and increased awareness by local residents have led to the identification of additional AML hazards. Annual reclamation grants to states and tribes are not based on reclamation needs, with some states reporting unfunded costs. Funding disparities exist, with FY2020 grants varying between states despite similar reclamation needs. Some states or tribes may need annual grants for years to fully fund reclamation costs. For instance, Kansas reported $810 million in unfunded costs while receiving $2.82 million in FY2020. Wyoming faces ongoing reclamation challenges under their AML program since becoming certified in 1984. The AML inventory in the state has grown as our understanding of historic mining has improved. UMWA members receive post-retirement health and pension benefits from various multiemployer plans funded by employer contributions and federal financial assistance authorized under SMCRA. Annual transfers from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and supplemental payments from the U.S. Treasury are made to the UMWA health plans if employer contributions are insufficient. The U.S. Treasury makes annual payments to the UMWA health plans and certified states and tribes from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and the General Fund. These payments are authorized by SMCRA as permanent appropriations, resulting in direct federal spending. The Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 addressed concerns about the potential insolvency of UMWA health benefit plans. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund receives interest from coal reclamation fees invested in U.S. Treasury securities, which is transferred to UMWA health benefit plans annually starting in FY1996. The interest does not increase total receipts in the U.S. Treasury and is supplemented by payments from the General Fund. The General Fund supplements payments to UMWA health plans if interest is insufficient, sourced from individual and corporate income taxes. Coal reclamation fees do not fund UMWA benefit plans. Amendments allow for permanent appropriations from the General Fund for supplemental payments if needed. The Bipartisan American Miners Act of 2019 increased federal financial assistance for UMWA health and pension benefit plans, with a new funding cap to control spending. This act amended Section 402(h) of SMCRA to address solvency issues. The Bipartisan American Miners Act of 2019 increased federal financial assistance for UMWA health and pension benefit plans, with a new funding cap to control spending. It expanded eligibility for UMWA health benefit plans and authorized General Fund payments for the 1974 UMWA pension plan. The amendments limited federal funding for health benefit plans based on beneficiaries enrolled by December 31, 2006. The Bipartisan American Miners Act of 2019 increased federal financial assistance for UMWA health and pension benefit plans, with a new funding cap to control spending. It expanded eligibility for UMWA health benefit plans and authorized General Fund payments for the 1974 UMWA pension plan. Certain coal mining company bankruptcies after 2006 also affected health benefit coverage for other retirees. Subsequent amendments to SMCRA in the 114th and 115th Congresses expanded the populations of beneficiaries eligible for federal payments to the UMWA health benefit plans. Funding needs to cover health benefits for additional populations of retirees have increased since then. The Bipartisan American Miners Act of 2019 expanded eligibility for UMWA health benefit plans and authorized General Fund payments for the 1974 UMWA pension plan. This may lead to increased General Fund supplemental payments for retirees affected by coal mining company bankruptcies. The act also established a new cap on annual General Fund payments to address the solvency of the pension plan. The Bipartisan American Miners Act of 2019 expanded UMWA health benefit plan eligibility and authorized General Fund payments for the 1974 UMWA pension plan. A cap of $750 million annually controls federal spending, with priority given to certified state and tribal payments. If payments exceed the cap, UMWA health plans are reduced, and the pension plan may not receive federal payment that year. The $750 million annual cap controls federal spending, with priority given to certified state and tribal payments. Supplemental payments to UMWA health plans and General Fund payments to the 1974 UMWA pension plan depend on available funds within the cap after certified state and tribal payments. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund includes various funding sources such as uncertified state shares, historic coal funds, and interest transfers to UMWA health benefit plans. Total appropriations from FY2008 to FY2020 amount to approximately $3.1 billion. Permanent appropriations from the General Fund include payments to certified states and tribes, UMWA supplemental payments, and prior balance payments. In FY2016, Wyoming received payments from the General Fund totaling $6.0 billion from FY2008 to FY2020. The Bipartisan American Miners Act of 2019 authorized annual payments to the UMWA pension plan retroactively back to FY2017. The FY2020 payment of $1.6 billion included cumulative payments from FY2017 through FY2020, subject to a $750 million annual cap. The $1.6 billion payment to the UMWA pension plan in FY2020 was the largest annual General Fund payment authorized under Title IV of SMCRA. General Fund payments to certified states and tribes and the UMWA health and pension benefit plans will remain subject to the $750 million annual cap for FY2021 and subsequent fiscal years. Certified state and tribal payments would cease after FY2022 without the reauthorization of coal reclamation fees. Supplemental payments to UMWA health benefit plans from the General Fund have exceeded interest transfers from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund since FY2008. The UMWA health and pension plans received $3.91 billion from the General Fund from FY2008 to FY2020, which was nearly twice the amount of grants paid to uncertified states for coal mine reclamation. As the balance from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund is paid down after FY2023, interest payments will decrease, leading to larger contributions from the General Fund for UMWA health plans. The UMWA health and pension plans received $3.91 billion from the General Fund from FY2008 to FY2020, nearly twice the amount of grants paid to uncertified states for coal mine reclamation. Funding for reclamation grants is tied to coal reclamation fee collections, while most of the UMWA plan funding is tied to the $750 million annual cap on General Fund payments. OMB estimates coal reclamation fee receipts will decline through FY2021, with the fee collection authority expiring in current law. Sequestration reductions apply to permanent appropriations from General Fund and Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund permanent appropriations as of FY2013. Congress has appropriated funds for the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Economic Development Pilot Program from the General Fund. The reauthorization of the coal reclamation fee under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2006 is set to expire in FY2021. Legislation in the 116th Congress aims to reauthorize the fee and allocate funds for economic and community development from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. With the fund's balance insufficient to cover estimated reclamation needs, Congress may need to address how to fund remaining coal reclamation needs. If the coal reclamation fees are not reauthorized beyond FY2021, the unappropriated balance of the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund would be distributed among eligible states over several fiscal years starting in FY2023. The fund's balance was approximately $2.2 billion in FY2020, ensuring reclamation grants to states for several years even without fee reauthorization. If coal reclamation fees are not reauthorized after FY2021, fees collected in FY2022 will determine grants to states from FY2023 until the fund is depleted. Congress may need to appropriate from the General Fund if reclamation fees are not reauthorized, similar to the Superfund Trust Fund reauthorization debate. The Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fee Extension Act (S. 1193) in the 116th Congress aims to extend fee collection authorization for coal reclamation until September 30, 2036. Additionally, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2019 (H.R. 4248) would make changes to fee collection under SMCRA. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2019 (H.R. 4248) would extend fee collection authorization until September 30, 2036. It would increase minimum payments to uncertified states and authorize compensation from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. In FY2020, 11 uncertified states received approximately $21.9 million in minimum program make up funds. Raising the cap could increase payments to uncertified states and change eligibility criteria. The extension of fee collection authorization until September 30, 2036 under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act Amendments of 2019 would impact the eligibility for minimum program make up funds. The future eligibility of uncertified states would depend on coal production, historic payments, and the value of coal generated. The adequacy of receipts to pay for unfunded reclamation costs would rely on domestic coal production, fee extension duration, and emerging reclamation needs. Predicting the duration to reauthorize fees is challenging due to potential updates in unfunded costs estimates and new health, safety, or environmental issues. Eligible states and tribes continuously update unfunded costs estimates as new problems arise. Some legislation in the 116th Congress aims to use funds from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund for projects promoting economic and community development, which some argue deviates from the original intent of prioritizing health and safety issues related to historic coal mining sites. The Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Economic Development Pilot Program was established to explore reclaiming abandoned coal mining sites for economic and community development. Congress provides funding for this pilot program. The AML pilot program receives funding from Congress through annual appropriations from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, totaling $540 million from FY2016 to FY2020. These funds are separate from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund and are used for reclamation projects in Appalachian counties to promote economic and community development. The RECLAIM Act in the 116th Congress aims to use grants from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund for reclamation projects in eligible states, distributing $195 million annually to uncertified states. House and Senate versions differ in fund allocation for AML projects. The RECLAIM Act in the 116th Congress would distribute funds to uncertified states for AML projects that meet reclamation priorities and contribute to economic development. Certified states and tribes would receive $5 million annually through an application process, with funds distributed based on needs. The Act does not reauthorize coal reclamation fees but provides additional grants to eligible states and tribes. If enacted without fee reauthorization, the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund balance would be paid out sooner. The RECLAIM Act in the 116th Congress would increase funds to uncertified states for AML projects, with House and Senate versions raising the minimum program funds from $3 million to $5 million annually from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund."
