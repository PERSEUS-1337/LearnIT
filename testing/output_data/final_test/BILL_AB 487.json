    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 3041.5 of the Penal Code is amended to allow prisoners to review their files before parole hearings, enter written responses, and speak on their own behalf during the hearing. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation must ensure all relevant facts are presented at parole hearings, with the prisoner having the right to request a stenographic record. If the hearing is to postpone or rescind parole dates, the prisoner has additional rights. The board must set a date for reconsideration of parole release to ensure a meaningful review of the inmate's suitability. The Board of Parole must inform the prisoner of their parole date and conditions within 10 days of setting a date. If a date is not set, the board must provide reasons and suggest beneficial activities. The next hearing must consider the victim's views and interests. After a parole hearing, parole may be denied for up to 15 years unless clear and convincing evidence shows that a shorter period is sufficient for public and victim safety. If parole is denied, a new hearing can be held after 10 years, with the possibility of a maximum of 7 additional years of incarceration. After a parole hearing, parole may be denied for up to 15 years unless clear and convincing evidence shows that a shorter period is sufficient for public and victim safety. The board may advance a hearing to an earlier date if new information suggests that a shorter period of incarceration is appropriate for public and victim safety. Within 10 days of a board action resulting in the postponement or rescinding of a parole date, the prisoner will receive a written statement with the new date or reasons for the action. The board will also offer the prisoner an opportunity for review or schedule the next hearing accordingly. The parole board conducts de novo hearings, considering prior findings but not binding on future hearings. Testimony of victims or witnesses may be admitted. The board determines actions based on specific criteria. An inmate may request an earlier parole hearing by providing new information or changed circumstances to the parole board. The board must notify the district attorney and victim at least 30 days before considering the request. The parole board has the authority to grant or deny an inmate's request for an earlier parole hearing, taking into account the views of the district attorney and the victim. The decision of the board can only be reviewed by a court for a manifest abuse of discretion. The board can reject a request that does not meet the requirements or provide sufficient justification for the action described in the request. An inmate can only request a parole hearing once every three years after a denial or decision by the board. The Penal Code is amended to specify the rules for parole suitability hearings. Before a parole hearing, the inmate has the right to review the file, respond in writing, be present, ask and answer questions, and speak on their own behalf. A representative from the Department of Corrections must ensure all relevant facts are presented, including any unresolved contradictory assertions. The inmate and a designated person can request a stenographic record of proceedings. If a parole hearing is to postpone or rescind parole, the inmate has specific rights. The board must set a date for reconsideration of parole release. Within 10 days of granting parole, the board must provide a written statement outlining reasons for parole, conditions, and consequences of non-compliance. The parole board must provide a written statement to the inmate within 20 days of denying parole, stating the reasons for the decision and suggesting beneficial activities. The board must schedule the next hearing 15 years after a denial, unless clear evidence shows a need for up to 10 additional years of incarceration for public and victim safety. After denying parole, the inmate may have a hearing ten years later unless clear evidence shows a need for up to seven additional years of incarceration for public and victim safety. Alternatively, a hearing may be scheduled three, five, or seven years later if a more lengthy period of incarceration is required, but not exceeding seven additional years. The parole board may advance a hearing date if new information suggests that the prisoner's continued incarceration is not necessary for public and victim safety. The board must provide a written statement to the inmate within 10 days of rescinding parole, stating the reasons for the decision and scheduling the next hearing. The parole board conducts de novo hearings, considering prior findings but not binding by them. Prior victim or witness testimony can be admitted upon request. The board determines actions based on specific criteria. An inmate may request an earlier parole hearing by providing new information or changed circumstances to the parole board. The board must notify the district attorney and victim at least 30 days before considering the request. The parole board has the authority to grant or deny an inmate's request for an earlier parole hearing, taking into account input from the district attorney and victim. The decision of the board can only be reviewed by a court for a clear abuse of discretion. The board can reject requests that do not meet the requirements or do not provide sufficient justification for early parole consideration. An inmate may only submit one written request for a parole hearing every three years. If a request is summarily denied or the board denies parole after a hearing, the inmate must wait three years before submitting another request. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to Penal Code Section 3041.5, contingent on the enactment of Senate Bill 230 before January 1, 2016."
