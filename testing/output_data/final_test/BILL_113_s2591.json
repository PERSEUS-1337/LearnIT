    "content": "The \"Girls Count Act of 2014\" may be cited as such. According to Congress findings, 12 percent of the world's population are girls or young women aged 10-24. Young people are the fastest growing segment in developing countries. 51 million children under 5 are not registered at birth, mostly girls. A proof of birth system is crucial for determining citizenship and obtaining identification documents. Without proper documentation, women and girls are unable to participate in formal sectors, leading to unpaid domestic work and hindering accurate assessments of education and poverty levels. To ensure women and girls are fully integrated into foreign assistance policies, their specific needs should be addressed in development programs, and they should have the power to make decisions affecting their lives by having access to official documentation like birth certificates. The statement of policy in Section 3 emphasizes the importance of addressing the specific needs of women and girls in development programs and ensuring they have access to official documentation like birth certificates. The policy of the United States aims to promote the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by ensuring equal participation of girls and boys in society through birth certifications and national identity cards. Training and capacity-building efforts will focus on countries where girls are undercounted, involving organizations representing children and families in program design and implementation. The evaluation of policies and programs at all levels includes understanding their impact on girls. The United States provides assistance to support counting of girls in the developing world. The Secretary and the Administrator are authorized to support programs that improve Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems, prevent discrimination against girls, increase property rights and social security for women, and ensure equitable access to social programs for girls from poor households in developing countries. The Secretary and the Administrator will coordinate with various organizations to advocate for laws collecting data on girls and ensuring their active participation in society. They will also work with private sector and civil society organizations to promote the registration of all children in developing countries to prevent exploitation and abuse. SEC. 5.
