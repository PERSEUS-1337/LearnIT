Congress finds that it is in the national interest for public lands to continue producing water and soil conservation benefits, livestock forage, wildlife forage, and recreation opportunities. Rangelands will be stabilized and improved through cooperative agreements and flexible management programs. Charging a reasonable fee for forage is essential for sound resource management. The interdependence between public and private lands for forage, water, and habitat is recognized. The social and economic infrastructure of rural communities relies heavily on the protection of privately held production units on Federal lands. The protection of privately held production units on Federal lands is crucial for the social and economic infrastructure of rural communities. Environmental and land use requirements are outlined in Section 2. All grazing operations on Federal lands must comply with various Federal, State, and local laws, including the Animal Damage Control Act, Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, Clean Air Act, Endangered Species Act, Federal Advisory Committee Act, Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act, Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The curr_chunk lists various acts including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act, National Environmental Policy Act, and Wilderness Act. The fee schedule is outlined in Section 3. The terms defined in this section include \"Sixteen Western States,\" \"AUM,\" \"Authorized Federal AUMs,\" and \"WAPLLR.\" These terms are crucial for understanding the fee schedule outlined in Section 3. The weighted average private land lease rate for the sixteen Western States is calculated by dividing the individual State results by the total number of authorized Federal AUMs and then dividing by 16. The \"Report\" refers to the document titled \"Grazing Fee Review and Evaluation Update of the 1986 Final Report\" dated April 30, 1992. The \"Nonfee cost differential\" is a value calculated annually by multiplying the weighted difference in nonfee costs per AUM between public and private land by the Input Cost Index. Private AUM nonfee costs are calculated by subtracting private AUM nonfee costs from public AUM nonfee costs for cattle times 4, then subtracting private AUM nonfee costs from public AUM nonfee costs for sheep times 1, and dividing the result by 5. \"Net production differential\" is the annual percentage calculated by comparing cash receipts per cow for Federal permittee livestock producers to western non-Federal livestock producers. \"PLFVR\" is the private lease forage value ratio determined by dividing the average private land lease rate from 1964-1968 into the forage value portion of the private land lease rate. The Federal forage fee is calculated annually based on the average of the WALLPR for the preceding three years, multiplied by the PLFVR, with deductions for nonfee cost differentials and net production differentials. This fee applies to all authorized Federal AUMs under the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior. The Federal forage fee is calculated annually based on the average of the WALLPR for the preceding three years, multiplied by the PLFVR, with deductions for nonfee cost differentials and net production differentials. The fee is capped at 125 percent and cannot be lower than 75 percent of the previous year's fee. The survey of nonfee costs used to calculate the nonfee cost differential will be periodically updated to reflect actual costs incurred by the cattle and sheep industry on public lands in the sixteen Western States."
