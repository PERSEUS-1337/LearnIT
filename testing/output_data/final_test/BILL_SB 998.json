    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 21655.1 of the Vehicle Code prohibits operating a motor vehicle on a highway designated for public transit buses, unless following officer directions or traffic control devices. Exceptions include making turns or entering/exiting the highway where allowed. A public transit agency must place signs indicating a highway lane is for public transit buses only. Section 22500 of the Vehicle Code prohibits stopping or parking in certain areas, except when necessary to avoid traffic conflicts or as directed by a peace officer or traffic control device. The Vehicle Code prohibits stopping or parking in specific areas, such as within an intersection, on a crosswalk (except for authorized vehicles), near a fire station driveway entrance, or in front of a driveway, unless authorized by local ordinances. In unincorporated territory, a private road or driveway entrance is defined by paved or marked surfaces. Vehicles are prohibited from extending over sidewalks, except for electric carts with authorization. Parking alongside or opposite street excavations or obstructions that obstruct traffic is also prohibited. (h) Vehicles cannot park on the roadway side of a vehicle stopped at the curb in a business or residence district with a speed limit of 25 miles per hour or less, except for school buses loading or unloading pupils. (i) Parking alongside curb space designated for bus passenger loading is only allowed when indicated by a sign or red paint on the curb. (j) Vehicles are not allowed in tubes or tunnels, except for those used by authorities for repair, maintenance, or inspection. (k) Vehicles, except for authorized authorities and local transportation buses, are generally not allowed to park on bridges. However, local authorities or the Department of Transportation may permit parking on bridges with sidewalks and shoulders wide enough to not disrupt traffic flow, with prior approval. Signs must be in place for parking to be allowed. Parking is only allowed with signs indicating local ordinances or Department of Transportation orders. The curr_chunk states that parking is allowed in specific designated areas, such as those with wheelchair accessibility or for public transit buses. It also mentions that no reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts due to the changes in penalties or definitions of crimes."
