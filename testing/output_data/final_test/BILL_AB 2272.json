    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 144.9 of the Labor Code defines terms related to medical devices used for therapeutic purposes in health facilities. This includes electrocautery devices, electrosurgical devices, and energy-based devices such as lasers and ultrasound instruments. The Division of Occupational Safety and Health oversees the implementation of this section. \"Plume refers to harmful airborne contaminants produced during medical procedures using energy-based or mechanical devices. A plume scavenging system captures and neutralizes plume before it can harm employees' eyes or respiratory tracts.\" The division will convene an advisory committee to develop a regulation by June 1, 2017, requiring health facilities to use a plume scavenging system in settings that create plume. The committee will include various stakeholders, and by June 1, 2018, the division will submit the proposed regulation to the board. The division will develop a regulation requiring health facilities to use a plume scavenging system, considering standards from ISO and CSA, as well as recommendations from OSHA and NIOSH. The regulation requires employers to provide training on plume hazards and scavenging equipment to workers involved in plume-generating procedures. Health facilities must implement a plume scavenging system by July 1, 2019. The regulation mandates the implementation of a plume scavenging system in health facilities by July 1, 2019. Compliance with general room ventilation standards does not satisfy the requirements of this section. Evidence of system conformity must be provided by the manufacturer. Surgical masks and respirators do not meet the requirements, except when the system cannot effectively capture plume due to medical necessity. The division and board have authority to develop and adopt regulations broader than required by this section. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts under this act as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
