White supremacists and right-wing extremists are identified as the most significant domestic terrorism threat in the United States. Reports from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI highlight the danger posed by these groups, with white supremacists responsible for the highest number of homicides compared to other domestic extremist movements. Since 2000, white supremacists and far-right extremists have been responsible for the most domestic terrorist attacks in the United States, with 76 Americans killed by domestic extremists since September 11, 2001. 89 percent of these fatalities were caused by far-right-wing extremists, including incidents like the 2012 Sikh gurdwara shooting in Wisconsin and the 2014 Jewish community center shooting in Kansas. The June 8, 2014, ambush in Las Vegas resulted in the killing of 2 police officers and a civilian by far-right supporters. The June 17, 2015, mass shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston led to the death of 9 church members by a White supremacist. The November 27, 2015, mass shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs resulted in the killing of a police officer and 2 civilians by an anti-abortion extremist. The March 20, 2017, murder of an African-American man in New York City was allegedly committed by a White supremacist with racist motives. The Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism reported that right-wing extremists were responsible for 150 terrorist attacks, including incidents in Portland, Oregon, and Charlottesville, Virginia, where White supremacists killed multiple individuals in acts of domestic terrorism. Attorney General Jeff Sessions confirmed the Charlottesville attack met the definition of domestic terrorism. Between 1993 and 2017, right-wing extremists carried out 150 terrorist acts in the United States, resulting in 255 deaths and over 600 injuries. In 2015, hate groups in the US increased by 14%, including a significant rise in Ku Klux Klan chapters. The number of anti-government militias and \"patriot\" groups also grew by 14% that year. In 2016, hate crimes increased by almost 5%, with a 19% rise in hate crimes against Americans according to the FBI's annual report. In 2017, hate crimes against American Muslims rose by 19%, with a significant increase in attacks on mosques. A right-wing extremist was charged with murder for a shooting rampage at a mosque in Quebec City. Additionally, between January and July 2017, 63 incidents targeted American mosques with threats, vandalism, or arson. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
