    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Choose Act of 2008\" allows Medicare beneficiaries to use private contracts for professional services. The Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Choose Act of 2008 allows beneficiaries to enter private contracts with physicians for covered professional services without submitting claims for payment under Medicare Parts A or B. The Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Choose Act of 2008 allows beneficiaries to enter private contracts with physicians for covered professional services without submitting claims for payment under Medicare Parts A or B, section 1876, or an MA plan. The Secretary must be provided with the necessary information to avoid any payment under the contract, or the eligible organization or MA organization must have the minimum information to prevent payment for services covered under the contract. The Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Choose Act of 2008 allows beneficiaries to enter private contracts with physicians for covered professional services without submitting claims for payment under Medicare Parts A or B, section 1876, or an MA plan. The contract must be in writing, signed by the Medicare beneficiary, and no claims can be submitted for services covered under the contract. The contract for medicare covered professional services must clearly disclose terms, including the agreement not to submit claims for services provided before the contract or for emergency medical conditions. The contract for Medicare covered professional services requires the individual to submit a claim for services covered under the contract, be responsible for payment, understand no reimbursement will be provided, and acknowledge that there are no limits on the amounts that may be charged for the services. The Medicare contract for professional services requires the individual to acknowledge that supplemental policies may not cover certain services and that the beneficiary has the right to seek services from other providers. The contract must also indicate if the physician or practitioner is excluded from Medicare participation. The parties to a private contract may mutually agree to modify or terminate the contract. The requirements do not apply to services provided to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in an MA plan. Definitions include 'health care practitioner' and 'Medicare beneficiary'. The term 'beneficiary' refers to an individual enrolled in part B of Medicare, and 'medicare covered professional services' include physicians' services and professional services of healthcare practitioners eligible for payment under part A or B, a contract under section 1876, or a Medicare+Choice plan. The terms 'MA plan' and 'MSA plan' are also defined. The terms 'MA plan' and 'MSA plan' are defined in section 1859. Section 1848(g) of the Social Security Act is amended to clarify exemption from limiting charge and submission of claims requirements. Exemption from requirements for physicians' services under private contracts, including services to individuals enrolled in MSA plans under part C, without restrictions. Exemption from limitations on charges and billing requirements for health care practitioners under private contracts, including those enrolled in MSA plans under part C. The amendments in this section apply to health care practitioners under private contracts, including those enrolled in MA organizations under part C. The effective date for these changes is 6 months after the enactment of the Act. Individuals can choose to opt out of Medicare Part A benefits and be eligible for Health Savings Accounts. Individuals entitled to Medicare Part A benefits can choose to waive their rights to such benefits and opt out of receiving them. This allows them to be eligible for Health Savings Accounts under certain conditions."
