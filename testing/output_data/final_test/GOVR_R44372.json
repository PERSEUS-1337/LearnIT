    "content": "Volkswagen Automotive Group (VW) admitted to using a software algorithm in diesel vehicles to cheat emissions tests, resulting in higher pollution levels. Regulators in the US and EU are investigating the issue, with a $14.7 billion settlement announced in June 2016. The European Union and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are investigating Volkswagen for using software to cheat emissions tests in their diesel vehicles. The EPA issued a notice of violation to VW for vehicles with 2.0 liter diesel engines, stating that NOx emissions are up to 40 times greater than the standard when emissions equipment is disabled. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) also initiated an investigation. The allegations cover roughly 499,000 diesel passenger cars sold in the United States. EPA issued a second notice of violation for vehicles with 3.0 liter engines. VW installed defeat devices in light-duty diesel vehicles with 3.0 liter engines for MY2014-MY2016, emitting NOx nine times the EPA standard. The U.S. DOJ filed a civil complaint on Jan 4, 2016, alleging nearly 600,000 vehicles had illegal defeat devices, violating the Clean Air Act. Legal remedies include injunctive relief, civil penalties, and potential criminal charges. Settlements have been reached on some issues, while others remain unresolved. EPA and CARB were alerted to the situation. The EPA and CARB were alerted to emissions violations in VW vehicles by researchers at West Virginia University working with the International Council on Clean Transportation. The study found some vehicles exceeded U.S. certification standards, leading to a larger investigation by ICCT. VW initially blamed a software problem for the excess emissions. The excess emissions in VW vehicles were due to a software problem that triggered a lower-emissions mode during testing. This allowed for higher on-road performance and fuel economy. While other diesel vehicles have also exceeded emissions standards, VW is the only manufacturer accused of using defeat devices. Diesel engines use fuel compression to ignite combustion. Diesel engines use fuel compression to ignite diesel fuel, which is more energy-efficient and powerful than gasoline engines. New technology has improved diesel engine performance, reduced noise and emissions, and increased fuel efficiency. Diesel fuel contains 10-15% more energy per gallon than gasoline, and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuels help reduce emissions. Diesel engines generally last longer than gasoline engines. Diesel engines are more expensive to manufacture than gasoline engines and emit greater quantities of NO x and particulate matter. Recent technology advancements aim to improve fuel economy and reduce emissions, such as direct injection of fuel and turbocharging. VW's Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) technology is an example of these advancements. Volkswagen, a German company established in 1933, is the world's second-largest automaker after Toyota. They manufacture passenger vehicles in the United States at their Chattanooga, TN plant, with a history of a Pennsylvania plant that operated from 1978 to 1987. About 584,000 diesel passenger cars sold in the US since MY2009 are equipped with defeat devices, leading to halted sales of VW's MY2016 diesel vehicles. Volkswagen reconfigured a larger vehicle for the U.S. market with gasoline and diesel engines at the Tennessee plant to increase U.S. sales. In 2014, VW Group sold nearly 600,000 vehicles in the U.S., with 48% produced locally. EPA will expand testing protocols for diesel vehicles to assess compliance with CAA standards. DOJ alleged VW violated provisions in a civil complaint filed on January 4, 2016. The DOJ filed a civil complaint on January 4, 2016, alleging that VW violated CAA Section 203 by selling vehicles not meeting emissions standards. EPA is to establish and update emissions standards for pollutants affecting public health under the CAA. The DOJ alleged that VW violated CAA Section 203 by selling vehicles not meeting emissions standards, including the installation of defeat devices and tampering with emission control devices. Emissions standards for new motor vehicles have been strengthened over the years, with the most recent Tier 2 standards requiring vehicle manufacturers to reduce tailpipe emissions of various pollutants. Diesel fuel combustion emissions contribute to air pollution, including NO2, O3, and PM 2.5, leading to health issues like asthma attacks and premature death. Diesel engines offer high efficiency and fuel economy but emit NOx and PM pollutants. Children, the elderly, and those with respiratory diseases are especially vulnerable. The \"diesel dilemma\" involves a tradeoff between emissions of NOx and particulates in diesel vehicles. Engine manufacturers aim to reduce both pollutants while maintaining fuel efficiency. Earlier U.S. standards allowed higher NOx emissions for diesel vehicles, but in 1999, the EPA implemented a \"fuel neutral\" approach requiring all vehicles to meet the same emissions standards regardless of fuel type. Cost-effective reductions in emissions are achieved through efficient combustion processes. Cost-effective reductions in emissions are achieved through efficient combustion processes and tailpipe emissions controls. Specific processes depend on engine design and involve lubrication, fuel delivery systems, turbochargers, and aftertreatment technologies like selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and nitrogen oxide traps. SCR technology adds urea and water to break down NOx into nitrogen and carbon dioxide, requiring additional equipment on diesel vehicles sold in the United States. Nitrogen oxide traps chemically bind NOx during lean engine operation and are regenerated with an injection of diesel fuel. VW allegedly used defeat devices to bypass emissions standards, compromising vehicle performance and fuel economy. Automakers must certify emissions compliance to sell vehicles in the US, with post-production testing through the In-Use Verification Program (IUVP). EPA would address issues found in IUVP testing through voluntary action or ordered recalls. In addition to manufacturer-controlled IUVP, EPA conducts limited \"surveillance testing\" at its laboratory in Ann Arbor, MI, selecting vehicles from various sources. Following VW allegations, EPA issued guidance for additional testing. Disengaging pollution controls on diesel cars can improve performance and fuel economy. VW's motive for installing defeat devices remains unclear. Consumer Reports found that VW may have used defeat devices to improve fuel economy and vehicle performance. DOJ filed a civil complaint against VW for installing defeat devices in 2.0L diesel vehicles, alleging violations of U.S. NOx regulations. Volkswagen violated CAA regulations by manufacturing vehicles that did not conform to specifications, installing parts to bypass emissions controls, and failing to disclose auxiliary emission control devices in COC applications. Volkswagen violated CAA regulations by failing to disclose auxiliary emission control devices in COC applications, potentially leading to criminal charges under federal fraud laws and civil penalties under the CAA. Volkswagen could face civil penalties of up to $32,500 per vehicle for violations of COC requirements and up to $2,750 per part for installation of a \"defeat device\" before January 13, 2009, with higher penalties for violations occurring after that date. The complaint stated that Volkswagen could face civil penalties of up to $3,750 per part for violations of tampering prohibition and up to $37,500 per vehicle for violations occurring after January 13, 2009. Additionally, for violations of reporting requirements, VW could be liable for civil penalties of up to $32,500 per day. VW could face civil penalties of up to $32,500 per day for violations before January 13, 2009, and up to $37,500 per day for violations after that date. Injunctive relief may also be imposed to restrain VW from further violations. Automakers often negotiate lower penalties with the EPA, as seen in the case of Toyota settling for a $34 million penalty despite being sued for $58 billion in environmental violations. Section 205 of the Clean Air Act requires courts to consider a violator's ability to pay a penalty and remain in business when assessing a civil penalty. Factors include the gravity of the violation, economic benefit, business size, compliance history, actions taken to remedy the violation, and the penalty's impact on the violator's ability to continue operating.

On January 15, 2016, DOJ's litigation regarding VW's alleged wrongdoing was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to consolidate with ongoing litigation. VW reached settlements to resolve liability issues related to defeat devices in 2.0L diesel vehicles, including violations of FTC regulations and CAA requirements. A Proposed Partial Consent Decree filed on June 28, 2016, appears to resolve VW's potential liability for the violations. The DOJ issued a Notice of Lodging of Proposed Partial Consent Decree on July 6, 2016, resolving VW's liability for violations of the California Health and Safety Code and Regulations. The settlements offer coordinated relief, including options for buyback or lease termination, emissions modifications, and funding a trust of $2.7 billion over three years. VW must achieve an 85% recall rate for specified NOx mitigation projects, with penalties for falling short. In California, a separate 85% recall rate is required, with additional penalties for non-compliance. Owners must be compensated for eligible vehicles affected by defeat devices. The Decree requires VW to offer payments equal to retail value for eligible vehicles affected by defeat devices. The buyback/lease termination program will be open for two years. If emissions modification is approved, VW must offer it indefinitely. VW must invest $2 billion over 10 years to support zero emission vehicle technology in the US. The proposed consent decree does not absolve VW of potential civil penalties. The federal government is seeking civil penalties in a Complaint from January 2016. The Proposed Consent Decree triggered a 30-day public comment period, and if approved, it will become binding. EPA has found manufacturers using defeat devices in violation of the Clean Air Act since the 1970s, leading to enforcement proceedings and settlements with automakers. Automakers have been accused of installing defeat devices by EPA since the 1970s, leading to fines and settlements. Examples include Honda and Ford in 1998, VW, Chrysler, and General Motors in the 1970s, and other manufacturers in more recent years. Congress established anti-defeat device provisions in the 1970 amendments to the Clean Air Act. In 2015, VW and EPA testified before Congress on the issue. Congress may wish to conduct further oversight on VW's use of defeat devices, including EPA's resources for monitoring vehicle emissions, the adequacy of the penalty structure, and why EPA failed to detect VW's defeat device. Additionally, Congress may consider providing more oversight of EPA rulemaking for motor vehicle emissions standards. The issues with VW's diesel emissions controls are also relevant to the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the US and EU. The discussion includes harmonization of U.S. and EU vehicle regulations to simplify selling vehicles between the two regions, focusing on environmental regulations and testing procedures."
