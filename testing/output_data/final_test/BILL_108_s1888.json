    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Saudi Arabia Accountability Act of 2003\". The findings of Congress highlight the importance of refraining from supporting terrorist acts, denying safe haven to terrorists, and addressing the issue of terrorist financing, particularly from Saudi Arabia. The report from July 3, 2003, reveals that the Saudi royal family has been a major financial supporter of Palestinian groups fighting Israel, funneling over $4 billion to finance the Palestinian intifada. Much of this money has gone to Hamas and the families of suicide bombers, directly funding their activities. Former Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas even complained to the Saudis about their support for Hamas. The New York Times reported that 50% of Hamas's current operating budget comes from sources in the United States and Israel. Hamas receives a significant portion of its operating budget from sources in Saudi Arabia, which fund religious institutions promoting hate and intolerance. This support has links to anti-Western terrorism, as seen with Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 hijackers who were Saudi citizens. Saudi Arabia also hindered US investigations into the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing. During hearings in 2002 and 2003, officials testified that Saudi Arabia was a significant source of financing for terrorism, with little progress made in stopping it. A joint committee report highlighted Saudi Arabia's role in funding terrorist activities. The House of Representatives report from July 24, 2003, quoted US Government personnel complaining about Saudi Arabia's lack of cooperation in investigating Osama bin Laden and his network before and after 9/11. Following the May 12, 2003, bombings in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia showed increased efforts in combating terrorism. The Sense of Congress is stated in Section 3. The Sense of Congress in Section 3 emphasizes the urgent need for the Government of Saudi Arabia to provide complete cooperation to the United States in investigating groups and individuals suspected of terrorism. This includes sharing relevant intelligence promptly and closing down any organizations that support or incite terrorism. The Act calls for Saudi Arabia to cease support for terrorist organizations, including funding offshore groups that incite terrorism and provide support for families of terrorists. The Act requires Saudi Arabia to stop supporting terrorist organizations, block funding from private Saudi citizens to terror groups, and expand efforts to combat terrorism. The Act imposes sanctions on Saudi Arabia to stop supporting terrorist organizations and block funding from private citizens to terror groups. The Act imposes restrictions on exports and diplomatic travel to Saudi Arabia unless the President certifies otherwise. This includes prohibiting the export of defense articles and services, as well as restricting the travel of Saudi diplomats in specific locations. The Act imposes restrictions on exports and diplomatic travel to Saudi Arabia within a 25-mile radius of specific locations unless waived by the President for national security reasons. The President must provide a report to Congress for any waiver and certify Saudi Arabia's cooperation with the United States. The Government of Saudi Arabia is fully cooperating with the United States to investigate and prevent terrorist attacks. They have closed all Saudi-based terror organizations, stopped funding offshore terror groups, and are blocking funding from private Saudi citizens to offshore terrorist organizations. SEC. 5. REPORT.\n\nThe Secretary of State must submit a report every 12 months on Saudi Arabia's progress towards meeting specified conditions. The report will be unclassified but may include a classified annex.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITION OF APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES.\n\nThe term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
