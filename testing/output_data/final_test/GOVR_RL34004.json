    "content": "The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-161) was signed into law on December 26, 2007, providing $38.7 billion in net budget authority for FY2008. It includes $2,710 million in emergency funding for border security. The funding tables do not include $2,900 million in emergency funding for FEMA enacted by another act. DHS operated under a continuing resolution before the passage of P.L. 110-161. The passage of P.L. 110-161 in FY2007 provided budget authority for DHS at FY2007 levels. Three sequential CRs extended funding, with the first CR, P.L. 110-92, containing provisions for DHS, including funding for hiring and training new border patrol agents and sustaining detention bed spaces. The second continuing resolution (CR) extended funding for DHS detention bed spaces until December 14, 2007, amending the expiration date from November 16, 2007. The third CR, P.L. 110-137, provided additional emergency funding to FEMA for disaster relief. The third continuing resolution (CR) was passed by Congress on December 14, 2007, extending budget authority provided by P.L. 110-92 through December 21, 2007. The Senate passed H.R. 2638 on July 26, 2007, providing $40.6 billion in net budget authority for DHS for FY2008, $5.1 billion more than requested. The House passed H.R. 2638 with $37.4 billion in net budget authority for DHS for FY2008, $1.9 billion more than the Administration's request. This is an 8% increase from the FY2007 budget. The President's budget request for DHS for FY2008 was $46.4 billion in gross budget authority, including $42.8 billion in gross appropriations. The revised request in November 2007 was $43.0 billion in gross budget authority and $35.5 billion in net budget authority for DHS. The tables in the report reflect revised budget request totals from various sources including the President's Budget Documents, Congressional Budget Justifications, House and Senate Reports, and the Congressional Record. Data in Table 19 is from the FY2008 President's Budget Analytical Perspectives volume. Amounts in the report are rounded except for total bill amounts. The report describes the President's FY2008 funding request for DHS programs, comparing it to FY2007 amounts and tracking legislative action. It focuses on discretionary funding and does not cover mandatory funding or legislation related to DHS programs. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the new Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are organized into five titles. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the new Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS have been organized into five titles: Title I Departmental Management and Operations; Title II Security, Enforcement, and Investigations; Title III Preparedness and Recovery; Title IV Research and Development, Training, Assessments, and Services; and Title V general provisions. Title I contains appropriations for various offices, while Title II includes funding for agencies like Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, and Secret Service. The President's FY2008 request for the US-VISIT program proposes moving it to the National Protection & Programs Directorate (NPPD) in Title III. The FY2008 request includes appropriations for NPPD, FEMA, and the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) in Title III, and USCIS, S&T in Title IV. The budget authority for annual appropriations is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process involving various agencies such as USCIS, S&T, and FLETC. Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, which are then allocated among appropriations committees for enactment in annual appropriations bills. This process involves 302(a) allocations of discretionary funds to subcommittees responsible for developing the bills. The 302(b) allocations are used to distribute discretionary funds among subcommittees for appropriations bills, ensuring budget discipline. The House and Senate passed resolutions for FY2008 with different budget authority amounts, which were reconciled through a conference agreement. The House and Senate reconciled differences in budget resolutions through a conference agreement on May 16, 2007, adopting a conference report the next day. The report provides $954 billion in discretionary budget authority for FY2008. Federal government spending involves a multi-step process starting with budget authority enactment by Congress, followed by fund obligation and payment. Budget authority is determined by appropriations acts or direct spending legislation, setting available amounts for federal agencies. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than budgeted. The Antideficiency Act limits federal agencies from obligating more funds than authorized by Congress. Budget authority can be one-year, multi-year, or no-year, with obligations incurred through personnel, contracts, and services. Outlays represent actual spending during the fiscal year. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. Discretionary agencies and programs are funded each year in appropriations acts, with gross budget authority consisting of discretionary and mandatory spending. In FY2008, 82% of the $46.4 billion gross budget authority for DHS is discretionary spending, while 18% is mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is not mandated by existing law. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriation acts, excluding entitlements. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority provided in laws other than appropriation acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offset funds are collected by the federal government as part of business-type transactions. The Department of Homeland Security's net discretionary budget authority is determined by subtracting any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. This includes entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts, which are funded by permanent or annual appropriations. Offset funds collected by the government are part of business-type transactions. Entitlements within the Department of Homeland Security's budget are funded by permanent or annual appropriations. The Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while the Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. Additionally, the DHS budget includes offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are available for obligation. Tables 3 and 4 detail the offsets and appropriations for FY2007 through FY2008. The FY2008 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security were detailed in Table 5, comparing the enacted amounts for FY2007 and the requested, recommended, and enacted amounts for FY2008. The Administration requested $46.4 billion in gross budget authority for FY2008, with a net appropriation of $35.5 billion. The House and Senate passed bills for FY2008 included $37.4 billion and $37.6 billion respectively. The FY2008 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security included $38.7 billion in net appropriated budget authority, with additional emergency funding. Title I covers general administrative expenses, including various offices within DHS. The FY2008 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security included $38.7 billion in net appropriated budget authority for Title I, covering general administrative expenses for various offices within DHS. The total FY2008 request for Title I was $1,092 million, representing an increase of $68 million (+6%) over the FY2007 enacted level. Key offices such as OS&EM, USM, OCFO, AOO saw increases in funding, while OCIO saw a decrease in funding. The House would have provided $779 million for DHS management and operations. The House proposed $779 million for DHS management and operations in FY2007, which was $313 million less than requested. The allocations for various entities within Title I were decreased, with some offices seeing significant cuts in funding. The Senate approved slightly more funding for Title I accounts, with different allocations compared to the House. In FY2007, DHS management and operations funding saw reductions in various offices within Title I accounts. The final appropriations for Title I were $975 million, $2 million less than requested by the President and $129 million less than approved by the Senate, but more than approved by the House. In FY2007, DHS management and operations funding saw reductions in various offices within Title I accounts. The final allocations for the title were as follows: OS&EM, $97 million (-6%); USM, $150 million (-46%); OCFO, $31 million (-6%); OCIO, $295 million (+13%); AOO, $297 million (-6%); OFCGCR, $3 million (0%); and OIG, $109 million (+10%). The Office of Human Capital (OHC) activities may be of interest to Congress during the current appropriations cycle. The Office of Human Capital (OHC) in DHS is responsible for managing human resources, establishing policies, providing oversight, and ensuring organizational goals are met. The OHC organization focuses on creating and operating DHS' new HR system, recruiting and retaining top talent, providing leadership development, and fostering a performance culture. Funding and staff details for OHC are shown in Table 7. The DHS successfully manages its mission. Funding and staff details for the OHC are outlined in Table 7, including expenditures for the HRMS system. The contractor NGIT received a contract worth nearly $3 million for HRMS enhancements in FY2007. Grumman Information Technology (NGIT) received a $3 million contract for program management, pay, performance, and training services at DHS. Another contract worth over $16 million was awarded for labor relations and organizational change management. The transfer of FLETA to OHC led to a $1 million increase in funding and 7 new employees. The majority of the FY2008 budget request is for salaries, benefits, and advisory services. The FY2008 budget request for the Department of Homeland Security includes funding for advisory and assistance services, employee training, and development of a new pay system pilot project. The majority of the funding under the \"OHC\u2014Operational Initiatives and HR Management System\" account is allocated for advisory and assistance services. No funding is requested for salaries and benefits in this appropriation. The FY2008 budget for the Department of Homeland Security includes funding for advisory services, employee training, and a pilot pay system. The Culture Task Force recommended changes in how DHS staff are referred to and emphasized the importance of engaging with employees and outside groups. The Culture Task Force recommended developing a blended culture based on common values and goals within the Department of Homeland Security. They suggested bringing in contract employees from the private sector to help create a Homeland Security Mission Culture and support progress towards an operationally focused and innovative environment. The morale of DHS employees has been low, with concerns about job satisfaction, leadership, and workplace performance. Legislation proposed to repeal the new personnel system and provide employees with the same protections as other civil service employees. No further action has been taken on the proposed bill. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $5 million for human capital operational initiatives, instead of the requested $15 million, due to issues with DHS regulations and personnel system delays. The funding for training accreditation of law enforcement officers was retained by the committee, and Section 507 of H.R. 2638 designated the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center to lead the accreditation process. The Senate report in P.L. 110-161 directed the Secretary to submit an updated Human Capital Operational expenditure plan within 90 days. The plan must include definitions, milestones, yearly costs, contract obligations, efforts to improve results, performance metrics, funds for recruitment, retention, training, and analysis of internship programs for young professionals. Coordination is needed for these programs, with the Chief Human Capital Officer directed to review goals, milestones, and program needs. The Chief Human Capital Officer is directed to review goals, milestones, and program needs for DHS human resources initiatives. Funding for MAX-HR or any follow-on personnel system is not provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. Section 533 prohibits funds for related human resources management projects until pending litigation is resolved. The law allocates $10 million to a \"human resources\" account for programs addressing identified shortcomings. The Secretary must submit a plan for fund usage. Section 538 reduces the appropriation for the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management by $5 million for management efficiencies. The law allocates $10 million to a \"human resources\" account for programs addressing identified shortcomings, with a plan for fund usage required. Section 538 reduces the appropriation for the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management by $5 million for management efficiencies. The Secretary must notify the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations of efficiency savings within 30 days, and the Chief Financial Officer must submit reports on budget execution and staffing within 45 days after each month. The Senate-passed bill included a provision for reporting on staffing levels and attrition rates at DHS. A 2007 evaluation by the Government Accountability Office found a 3.3% average attrition rate for permanent DHS employees. P.L. 110-161 continues provisions related to FLETA and FLETC accreditation processes. Several executive positions within the Department of Homeland Security have new incumbents. Michael Jackson resigned as Deputy Secretary, with Paul Schneider serving as the acting deputy secretary. FLETC is directed to schedule law enforcement training at all facilities to maximize capacity, and FLETC instructors' functions are classified as inherently governmental. On December 6, 2006, during a hearing, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs was informed that DHS officials are working on evaluating employees' job performance. Paul Schneider is overseeing the transition to a new Administration, focusing on ensuring career civil service employees hold key positions. Marta Brito Perez resigned as the Human Capital Officer on January 6, 2008, with Gregg Pelowski now serving as the acting HCO. Changes have been made to DHS's intelligence mission, functions, and budget as outlined in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate at DHS, with functions including assessing terrorist threats, developing national security plans, and analyzing law enforcement and intelligence information. Secretary Chertoff's Second Stage Review of the Department resulted in significant changes to the DHS intelligence structure, including disbanding the IAIP and renaming the Office of Information Analysis to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. The Office of Infrastructure Protection was placed within the Directorate for Preparedness, and the Assistant Secretary for Intelligence Analysis was given the title of the Department's Chief Intelligence Officer. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 made amendments to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, giving statutory standing to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Office of Infrastructure Protection. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis is led by an Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, who also serves as the Department's Chief Intelligence Officer. The FY2008 budget request for the Analysis and Operations account was $315 million, a 5% increase from FY2007. These funds support both the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Office of Operations Coordination. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis, under the Office of Operations Coordination, integrates and analyzes DHS, state, local, and Intelligence Community information to produce threat assessments. The budget is classified, and the National Operations Center disseminates threat information and provides situational awareness. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $302 million for FY2008, a decrease from the President's request. The Committee expressed concern about unobligated balances in the Office of Operations Coordination and the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. They also raised concerns about the potential relocation of the Homeland Security Operations Center and its funding for upgrades at the Nebraska Avenue Complex. The Committee is concerned about DHS's attitude towards capital investments for the HSOC and requests a coherent plan for consolidating operations centers. They recommend doubling funding for DHS presence at State and local fusion centers in 2008 and direct the OIA to review unobligated balances for potential reallocation. Quarterly updates on placing DHS intelligence professionals in fusion centers are also required. The Senate recommended $306 million for DHS presence at State and local fusion centers, requiring details on qualification criteria, Federal expenditures, and locations. The Committee expressed concern about the possible movement of the National Operations Center and requested a briefing from the Office of Operations Coordination. The Committee required a briefing from the Office of Operations Coordination justifying the relocation of the National Operations Center. They also requested a \"DHS Intelligence Expenditure Plan\" from the Secretary for the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, including FY2008 expenditures, staffing details, and explanations for maintaining contract staff. Additionally, the Committee mandated quarterly reports on placing DHS intelligence professionals in State and local fusion centers, with a directive for the Director of Operations to encourage rotating State and local fire service representation. The Director of Operations is required to promote rotating State and local fire service representation at the National Operations Center. $306 million is allocated to Analysis and Operations in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, with a decrease from the President's request and an increase from FY2007. Funds for the National Immigration Information Sharing Office and National Applications Office are restricted until compliance with laws and standards is certified. Other elements related to Analysis and Operations funding are also included in the Act. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 included funding for Analysis and Operations. The Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis must provide an expenditure plan for the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, including costs for new requirements. Congress appropriated funding for state and local fusion centers at the Senate level. Information on the relocation of the National Operations Center was not required. The amended bill rescinds $8.7 million in unobligated balances from prior-year appropriations made for Analysis and Operations, equal to the proposed reallocation to fund the relocation of the National Operations Center (NOC). The Committees also encourage the rotation of State and local fire service representation to the NOC. Title II contains appropriations for various agencies including Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, and Secret Service. CBP's primary mission since 9/11 is to prevent the entry of terrorists and terrorism instruments. CBP's responsibilities include inspecting people and goods for entry into the US, interdicting terrorists and contraband, and enforcing laws at the border. It is comprised of various inspection functions and agencies. See Table 8 for agency details and Table 9 for CBP Salaries and Expenses. The Administration requested an appropriation of $10,150 million in gross budget authority for CBP for FY2008, a 9% increase over FY2007. House-passed H.R. 2638 included $8,922 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2008, an 11% increase over FY2007. Senate-passed H.R. 2638 included $8,841 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2008, a 10% increase over FY2007. The FY2007 enacted amount was $8,036 million, with a $76 million increase compared to the FY2008 request. The Senate-passed bill included a $3,000 million emergency appropriation for CBP. P.L. 110-161 provided $9,423 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2008, an increase of $658 million over the request and $1,387 million over FY2007. $2,710 million in emergency funding for border security purposes was also included. Several issues arose during the congressional debate over appropriations for CBP, including the Secure Border Initiative (SBI). The Administration requested $1,000 million for the deployment of SBInet related technologies and infrastructures in FY2008 for CBP. SBInet will focus on the southwest land border between POE and deploy personnel, technology, infrastructure, and response assets. CBP plans to construct an SBInet command center for all DHS agencies and external stakeholders. In FY2007, DHS awarded a prime integrator contract to Boeing for SBInet deployment. Congress may need to assess responsible contracting and funding allocation for technology, infrastructure, and fencing components. H.R. 2638 fully funds SBInet but withholds $700 million pending an expenditure plan submission. The Senate-passed H.R. 2638 fully funds the President's request for SBInet, including an emergency supplemental appropriation for deploying unmanned aerial vehicles and camera and radar towers. The Senate Committee on Appropriations will closely monitor SBInet's performance to ensure it meets objectives. The Senate-passed H.R. 2638 fully funds the President's request for SBInet, including an emergency supplemental appropriation for deploying unmanned aerial vehicles and camera and radar towers. The bill expresses concern with the overall coordination of the SBI program and directs DHS to provide a briefing within 120 days on how the program is being effectively coordinated. It would provide $1,225 million for SBInet, but would withhold $650 million until an expenditure plan is received and approved. The Secure Fence Act directed DHS to construct two-layered reinforced fencing and additional physical barriers along five stretches of the southwest border totaling roughly 850 miles. DHS's FY2008 request aims to fund the completion of 370 miles of fencing along the southern border, with a combination of primary and two-layer fencing. Construction will be in strategic areas supervised by private contractors and the National Guard. Funding details and maintenance costs remain unspecified, raising concerns for Congress regarding compliance with legislative directives. The issue of border fencing includes compliance with legislative mandates, total costs, oversight of contracting, and funding for constructing 700 miles of fencing along the southern border. DHS has discretion on where to construct the fencing, with a mandate for 370 miles of reinforced fencing. The Secure Fence Act mandates 370 miles of fencing to be completed by December 31, 2008. DHS must consult with various entities to minimize impact on border communities and the environment. Congress debates staffing levels for CBP, including Border Patrol Agents, officers at ports of entry, and other positions. Issues include training resources, infrastructure demands, and absorption of new staff. The Security and Accountability for Every (SAFE) Port Act of 2006 required CBP to submit a resource allocation model (RAM) addressing staffing levels at all ports of entry. The House Appropriations Committee noted CBP's delay in submitting the staffing model, particularly at airports, and directed CBP to submit it by October 15. The House Appropriations Committee directed CBP to submit its staffing model for airports by October 15, 2007. CBP has satisfied the requirements through briefings and letters on the Workload Staffing Model. DHS is urged to comply with increasing Border Patrol agents and CBP officers on the northern border. The Administration requested an increase of $481 million to hire 3,000 new USBP agents by the end of 2008, doubling the USBP size since 2001. Congress may question the attainability of this hiring goal. In FY2006, Congress funded 1,500 additional border patrol agents, but only 1,051 were hired, falling short of the goal by 30%. Attrition rate of 7% made hiring more challenging. In FY2007, DHS received funding for 2,500 more agents. Congress debated offering incentives to recruit and retain agents. House and Senate bills fully funded the President's request, with the House directing 500 agents to the northern border in FY2008. The Administration's request for increased funding for border patrol agents was fully funded, with a directive to assign 20% of new agents to the northern border. Additionally, a $3 billion emergency supplemental appropriation was included to potentially increase the USBP workforce to 23,000 agents. The Administration also requested additional funding for the WHTI program, which requires certain individuals to present specific documents for entry into the country. The legislative mandate for expanding the WHTI program to all POE is set for June 1, 2009 or three months after certain requirements are met. Congress may need to address implementation deadlines, interface with existing traveler programs, and potential infrastructure modifications. H.R. 2638 included $225 million for WHTI, with $100 million withheld until CBP reports on pilot program findings. The Senate-passed H.R. 2638 would fully fund the WHTI program and delay its implementation date to June 1, 2009, or three months after certain requirements are met. H.R. 2764 includes $225 million for WHTI but withholds $75 million until CBP submits a report on pilot program findings. The House-passed H.R. 2638 included a provision to extend federal law enforcement officer status to CBP officers for retirement purposes, with a directive for DHS to offer voluntary conversions by July 1, 2008. $50 million was allocated for FY2008 costs. The Senate-passed H.R. 2638 did not include a similar provision, but Division E of P.L. 110-161 authorized CBP to develop an international registered traveler program. CBP is authorized to develop an international registered traveler program and enhance screening of incoming international air passengers with $45 million in funding. An additional $36 million is provided for implementing the electronic travel authorization program for visa-waiver countries. The Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) aims to improve supply chain security, with no funding increases requested in the FY2008 budget. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the C-TPAT validation process and the pace of CBP's validations. The SAFE Port Act requires DHS to launch a pilot program for 3rd party validations of C-TPAT certified applicants. Senate report S.Rept. 110-84 expresses concerns about C-TPAT security inspections and validations. Funding for C-TPAT in FY2008 included $62 million in Senate-passed H.R. 2638 and $61 million in House-passed H.R. 2638. Additional funds were allocated for CBP to hire more supply chain security specialists. The FY2008 funding for C-TPAT included $62 million, with plans to hire 50 SCSS. CSI operates in 50 ports, expanding to 58 by FY2007 and more in FY2008. An increase of $17 million was requested for CSI, with $15 million for SFI. Congress may question why additional funding for CSI was not requested despite plans for expansion. The Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) is a DHS program aimed at securing cargo from foreign countries to the US. Both House-passed H.R. 2638 and Senate-passed H.R. 2638 fully funded the request for CSI at $156 million for FY2008. Division E of P.L. 110-161 provides $156 million for CSI. The first iteration of SFI involves scanning all U.S.-bound containers for radiation, image, and information risk factors. The Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) is a DHS program aimed at securing cargo from foreign countries to the US. The current iteration of SFI is being operated as a part of CSI and involves scanning, imaging, and secure communications equipment at selected ports to develop an integrated scan of all U.S.-bound containers. Ports in Pakistan, Honduras, and the UK are fully operational with SFI, while other ports like Oman, Singapore, and South Korea will have limited deployment. Hong Kong is also testing the integrated cargo inspection system. The Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) aims to secure cargo from foreign countries to the US by scanning all U.S.-bound containers at selected ports. The port of Hong Kong is testing the integrated cargo inspection system, with 24.5% of U.S.-bound containers originating from there. Implementing SFI will require additional resources for both host country governments and CBP, with a $15 million request for SFI in the FY2008 CBP budget. This strategy raises questions about workload, resolving alarms, and equipment for scanning all containers. The Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) aims to secure cargo from foreign countries to the US by scanning all U.S.-bound containers at selected ports. Funding of $15 million for SFI in the FY2008 CBP budget is being questioned for its sufficiency. Both House-passed H.R. 2638 and Senate-passed H.R. 2638 would fully fund the request for CSI at $156 million for FY2008. ICE focuses on enforcement of immigration and customs laws within the United States, developing intelligence to reduce illegal entry and enforcing violations of immigration laws. ICE is responsible for locating and removing aliens who have overstayed their visas or entered illegally. They also combat terrorist financing, money laundering, and enforce export laws. Additionally, ICE oversees building security activities and the Federal Air Marshals Service. The Office of Air and Marine Interdiction was transferred from ICE to CBP. The Administration requested a 6% increase in gross budget authority for ICE in FY2008, totaling $5,015 million. This included program increases for various initiatives such as the Office of Professional Responsibility, BEST Task Forces, and ICE Mutual Agreement between Government and Employers. The FY2008 budget for ICE included funding for various initiatives such as worksite enforcement, Trade Transparency Unit, anti-gang initiative, 287(g) agreements, information technology investments, additional detention beds, Criminal Alien Program, and centralized ticketing operation for alien removals. House-passed H.R. 2638 would have appropriated $4,192 million for ICE, representing a $24 million increase. House-passed H.R. 2638 would have appropriated $4,192 million for ICE, with $4,155 million allocated for Salaries and Expenses. The decrease in Salaries and Expenses funding was due to a reallocation of funds to the \"Automatization Modernization\" account. Specific allocations included $10 million for special operations, $11 million for care and repatriation of smuggled aliens, and $16 million for enforcement against forced child labor. H.Rept. 110-181 recommended an increase over FY2007 funding of $43 million for the Criminal. H.Rept. 110-181 recommended increased funding for various ICE programs, including $43 million for the Criminal Alien Program, $11 million for Alternatives to Detention, $7 million for Office of Professional Responsibility, $111 million for Border Enforcement Security Task Forces, $32 million for ICE programs supporting State and local law enforcement, and $4 million for the Trade Transparency Unit. Additionally, funding was recommended to increase detention space by 950 beds. The Senate-passed H.R. 2638 would have appropriated $4,433 million for ICE, including funding for special operations, informants, child pornography tipline, project alert, agreements under INA, care of smuggled aliens, enforcement against forced child labor, and Salaries and Expenses. H.R. 2638 would appropriate $4,402 million for Salaries and Expenses, $240 million more than the Administration's request. S.Rept. 110-84 recommended increases for detention beds, transportation, establishment of an \"Office of Policy and Planning,\" Fugitive Operations Teams, CAP teams, immigration enforcement positions, training program development, BEST Task Forces, and anti-gang initiatives. Congress appropriated $4,734 million for ICE, including funding for BEST Task Forces, ICE's anti-gang initiative, worksite enforcement efforts, and fully staffing Document and Benefit Fraud Task Forces. This represented a 14% increase over the Administration's request and a 20% increase over the FY2007 appropriation. Additionally, funds were allocated for special operations, informants' compensation awards, public awareness campaigns, project alert, agreements under \u00a7287(g) of the INA, care and repatriation of smuggled aliens. The appropriations for ICE include funding for various operations such as detention and removal, enforcement of laws against forced child labor, and improving efforts to identify and remove criminal aliens. ICE's mission involves diverse activities, and resource allocation is a continuous challenge. ICE's mission involves locating and removing deportable aliens, identifying criminal aliens while incarcerated, and collaborating with state and local law enforcement. The Office of Investigations focuses on criminal and civil violations affecting national security. ICE's Office of Investigations focuses on criminal and civil violations related to national security, including enforcement of immigration laws and combating fraud. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated investigative functions from the INS and Customs Service to ICE. Concerns have been raised about resource allocation towards investigating civil immigration violations versus terrorism and former Customs Service investigations. In FY2008, Congress allocated $1,530 million for ICE's investigative efforts. ICE's Office of Investigations received $1,530 million for its operations, exceeding the President's budget request of $1,480 million. House-passed H.R. 2638 allocated $1,478 million, while Senate-passed H.R. 2638 allocated $1,519 million for ICE. Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) manage aliens in removal proceedings or ordered removed from the US, facing challenges due to limited detention space. A study by DOJ's Inspector General showed that detained individuals with final removal orders had a higher deportation rate compared to those not detained. Concerns have been raised about the decision-making process for releasing aliens based on detention space availability rather than merit. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 authorized an increase in DRO bed space, with funding allocated for detention and removal operations. The President's budget requested additional funding for more detention beds, support personnel, and transportation for alien removals. This funding increase aims to address challenges in managing aliens in removal proceedings and concerns about inequities in the decision-making process for releasing aliens. The request includes an increase in funding for 350 beds and personnel for 287(g) agreements. H.R. 2638 would have appropriated $2,118 for DRO, while Senate-passed H.R. 2638 allocated $2,306 for DRO, including funds for 3,050 additional beds. The emergency supplemental in Senate-passed H.R. 2638 aimed to provide resources for detaining 45,000 aliens per day, with $3,000 million for additional detention beds. ICE has developed alternatives to detention for non-detained aliens with final removal orders, including the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program and electronic monitoring. Congress appropriated $54 million for alternatives to detention in FY2008, with a focus on removable criminal aliens, some of whom are incarcerated while others are free in the U.S. The DHS' CAP aims to locate criminal aliens released after serving their sentences for removal from the US. It targets identifying such aliens in federal, state, and local prisons to ensure they are taken into ICE custody post-sentence completion. Notification systems vary among prisons, leading to some criminal aliens being released instead of being deported, posing a risk of reoffending.ICE and INS have historically struggled to identify all removable imprisoned aliens. The DHS' CAP aims to locate criminal aliens released after serving their sentences for removal from the US. P.L. 110-161 appropriated funds for CAP and to improve efforts to identify and remove criminal aliens. The President's FY2008 budget requested funds for CAP, and there are limited avenues for state enforcement of immigration laws. The debate over the role of state and local law enforcement in enforcing federal immigration laws has raised concerns about training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. Some localities provide sanctuary for illegal aliens, refusing to turn them over to federal authorities. Critics argue that the federal government lacks resources to enforce immigration law effectively. The government has limited resources for enforcing immigration law, leading to a debate on utilizing state and local law enforcement. Funding for \u00a7287(g) agreements in FY2008 was $5 million, with proposed increases to $78 million. Senate-passed H.R. 2638 allocated $52 million, while House-passed H.R. 2638 allocated $32 million for ICE programs supporting law enforcement. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) under ICE is responsible for security of federal buildings and personnel. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) under ICE is responsible for daily monitoring of federal building entry and exit points, investigating threats, and protecting federal facilities from criminal and terrorist threats. The Administration requested $613 million in FY2008 for security policy, building assessments, and agency compliance. FPS currently employs 15,000 contract security guards and 950 uniformed law enforcement officers, with plans to move officers to other ICE offices or reduce numbers through attrition. The House approved legislation aimed to prevent any reduction in officer numbers. The House provision requires the FPS director to provide information before reducing the number of FPS police officers, negotiate agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies, and submit reports to Congress prior to any reductions. The House provision mandates that the FPS director must inform Congress and negotiate agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies before reducing the number of FPS police officers. The Senate-approved legislation requires the DHS Secretary to ensure a minimum of 1,200 FPS law enforcement officers protecting federal buildings and adjust security fees to fund this requirement. Division E of FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act mandates FPS to maintain at least 1,200 full-time staff and 900 police officers engaged in protecting federal buildings daily. The TSA, created by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, is responsible for protecting air, land, and rail transportation systems in the US. It was transferred to DHS in 2002 and is tasked with safeguarding against terrorist threats through various security measures. The TSA is responsible for assessing terrorist risks to non-aviation transportation assets, issuing security regulations, and enforcing them. It serves as the primary liaison for transportation security to law enforcement and intelligence communities. The proposed funding level for TSA is $6,564 million, roughly 15% of the DHS budget request. The President's FY2008 DHS budget request includes $2,793 million in offsetting collections, mainly from airline passenger security fees, resulting in a net total requested amount of $3,771 million for TSA. There are no proposed changes to the existing passenger security fee structure. The gross funding level for TSA is $6,564 million, similar to the FY2007 level, but does not include $250 million in mandatory funding for the Aviation Security Capital Fund. The President's FY2008 DHS budget request includes $2,793 million in offsetting collections for TSA, with a net total requested amount of $3,771 million. Funding for aviation security, the Federal Air Marshal Service, and aviation-related vetting functions make up 90% of the proposed TSA budget. The President's proposal includes decreases in funding for certain aviation security activities to trim overhead costs, while notable increases are proposed for Explosives Detection System and Explosives Trace Detection equipment. The President's FY2008 DHS budget request includes increases in funding for Explosives Detection System (EDS) and Explosives Trace Detection (ETD) equipment purchase, installation, and maintenance compared to FY2007 levels. The budget also proposes a net increase of 955 full-time equivalent screeners to support a new travel document screening initiative, while trimming support staff by about 351 FTEs. Additionally, the Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing (TTAC) function would almost double compared to FY2007 levels, with a $38 million increase going toward security measures. In FY2008, funding for surface transportation security is proposed to increase by $10 million to $47 million. This additional funding would be used to hire more canine teams and inspectors for rail and mass transit security. The Secure Flight program, aimed at prescreening airline passengers against terrorist watchlists, is set to become operational in the summer of 2008 with a $38 million increase in funding. The Registered Traveler program is expanding nationwide, and the TWIC program is scheduled to be fully operational at seaports in FY2008. In FY2008, funding for surface transportation security is proposed to increase by $10 million to $47 million, with additional funding for hiring canine teams and inspectors for rail and mass transit security. The House bill would provide $6,636 million for the TSA, with $5,199 million designated for aviation security programs, including procurement of explosives detection equipment and screening technologies. Total TSA funding specified in the House bill is $235 million more than the Administration request and $329 million above FY2007 enacted levels. Aviation security funding specified in the House bill is $246 million more than the Administration request and $467 million above FY2007 enacted levels. In FY2008, funding for surface transportation security is proposed to increase by $10 million to $47 million, with additional funding for hiring canine teams and inspectors for rail and mass transit security. The House bill would provide $6,636 million for the TSA, with $5,199 million designated for aviation security programs, including procurement of explosives detection equipment and screening technologies. Total TSA funding specified in the House bill is $235 million more than the Administration request and $329 million above FY2007 enacted levels. Aviation security funding specified in the House bill is $246 million more than the Administration request and $467 million above FY2007 enacted levels. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 allocated $560 million for explosives detection equipment procurement, $120 million above the Administration request. The Aviation Security Capital Fund's authorization was extended through 2028 in P.L. 110-53, providing additional funds for explosives detection equipment procurement and installation to expedite deployment at airports. The House report expresses concern over long-term spending needs for equipment refurbishing, replacement, and infrastructure modifications. The House report recommends expanding the use of Explosive Trace Detection (ETD) machines at airports, including small airports and heliports. It also allocates $250 million for advanced checkpoint technologies and pilot programs, with an additional $5 million for labor costs. Total funding for screener workforce is slightly less than the Administration's request. The bill provides funding for screener workforce initiatives, including travel document checkers and behavior detection screeners. It lifts the cap on full-time equivalent screeners but expresses concern about potential issues. Additionally, there is funding for private screening at small airports, air cargo security, canine teams, and security inspectors. The bill includes funding for airport perimeter security, doubling air cargo screening, and the Secure Flight program. It also provides funding for canine teams and security inspectors. The bill prohibits the use of commercial data or algorithms to evaluate passenger risk if not on terrorist watch lists. The Assistant Secretary for Transportation Security must certify that checking against a subset of the watchlist poses no security risks. Funding for Transportation Threat Assessment programs, surface transportation security, and the Federal Air Marshal Service is provided at requested levels. The TSA is allocated $6,478 million for FY2008 in the Senate-passed bill, $171 million above FY2007 enacted. The Senate bill provides $6,478 million to the TSA for FY2008, $171 million above FY2007 levels. It includes $5,043 million for aviation security, with additional funding for explosives detection equipment but no funding for checkpoint screening technologies. The Senate bill would consolidate maintenance costs for baggage and checkpoint screening technologies as requested in the President's request, but provides $7 million less than requested for screening technologies maintenance. The Senate committee expressed concern over TSA's failure to submit a strategy for deployment of checkpoint screening technologies and the large unobligated balance of appropriations for checkpoint technologies. The Senate committee report allocates funds for checkpoint support functions, including checkpoint technologies, at $114 million less than the House's amount. $20 million is withheld from TSA's headquarters spending until a strategic plan for checkpoint screening technology deployment is received. $15 million is designated for a pilot test on screening airport employees, $59 million for workers compensation payments, and $200 million for screener training. The TSA is directed to provide a detailed report on its behavioral screening initiatives. The Senate bill allocates funds for air cargo security, including $66 million for deploying canine teams, hiring cargo inspectors, and procuring screening technologies. The TSA is instructed to complete vulnerability assessments for Category X airports by March 1, 2008, and develop an action plan for inbound international air cargo by February 5, 2008. The bill also includes a $4 million appropriation amount. The Senate bill includes a $4 million appropriation for airport perimeter security pilot programs and shifts $3 million to Aviation Security for law enforcement presence at passenger screening checkpoints. It allocates $28 million for the Secure Flight program, expressing frustration with TSA's lack of clarity on program goals despite years of development. The Senate bill includes provisions for funding airport perimeter security pilot programs, law enforcement presence at passenger screening checkpoints, and the Secure Flight program. It also addresses the need for clarity on program goals and restrictions on the use of commercial databases for vetting airline passengers. The TSA received $6,814 million in funding for surface transportation security and support in FY2008, which includes $4,809 million for aviation security. This amount is slightly lower than the previous year's funding, but additional funds from passenger security fees bring the total to $5,309 million. In FY2008, funding for aviation security saw a slight decrease compared to FY2007, with $770 million allocated to the Federal Air Marshal Service. Differences in budget amounts for specific activities reflect shifts due to the reauthorization of the Aviation Security Capital Fund and creation of the Checkpoint Screening Security Fund. EDS/ETD installation and purchase received $294 million, less than the amounts specified in the House-passed and Senate-passed bills. In FY2008, funding for aviation security decreased slightly compared to FY2007. The total budget compromise between the House and Senate amounts is $544 million, with $250 million allocated to the Aviation Security Capital Fund. The Checkpoint Screening Security Fund was created, resulting in the elimination of funding for the Checkpoint Support activity. The TSA's budget for checkpoint-related technologies aligns with the House-passed funding amount. Additional funding was provided for screener PC&B and training to support hiring and training of Behavioral Detection Officers. The funding for aviation security in FY2008 decreased slightly compared to FY2007. The budget compromise is $544 million, with $73 million allocated for air cargo security. This increase is for additional canine teams, inspectors, and cargo screening technologies. The DHS is directed to research screening methods for cargo and utilize existing checked baggage equipment for screening. An additional $30 million was appropriated for implementation. An additional $30 million was appropriated for implementing requirements in P.L. 110-53 for aviation and surface transportation security activities. Section 513 of Division E in P.L. 110-161 continues appropriations requirements for DHS to certify privacy protection, data security, and redress before implementing Secure Flight or any successor program. TSA plans to implement Secure Flight in FY2008. In FY2008, TSA plans to implement Secure Flight with an appropriation of $50 million. Section 521 allocates deobligated funds for explosives detection systems. Section 542 imposes civil penalties for airport vendors not collecting security badges. Section 565 mandates DHS to establish an international registered traveler program incorporating biometrics and e-passports. The FY2008 appropriations process aims to enhance TSA's security measures by incorporating biometrics and e-passports, aligning acquisition management with DHS regulations, and allowing Registered Traveler participants to use biometric cards for identification. Identified issues for TSA focus on funding and program implementation. Issues for the TSA in the FY2008 appropriations process include aviation security, screener workforce, screening technology, air cargo security, and the planned nationwide roll-out of the TWIC program at seaports. The Administration raised concerns over bill language cutting funding for the Secure Flight program and subjecting TSA decisions to judicial review, but these provisions were not included in the enacted appropriations. The total number of full-time equivalent TSOs has been capped at 45,000, and a GAO assessment found issues with the TSA's screener staffing allocation methodology. The GAO found discrepancies in TSA staffing levels at medium and smaller airports, with some above or below allocation. Small and medium airports met the 10-minute wait time goal, while major airports exceeded it. Large airports mostly aligned with staffing models, with wait times slightly above target. The GAO found discrepancies in TSA staffing levels at medium and smaller airports, with some above or below allocation. Small and medium airports met the 10-minute wait time goal, while major airports exceeded it. Observations include the difficulty in predicting staffing needs at smaller and medium airports, and the need to examine persisting difficulties in achieving passenger wait time targets at large airports. TSA directed to submit quarterly wait time data for airports with \"above average wait times\" and the 40 busiest airports. President's FY2008 budget proposed to eliminate the 45,000 FTE cap for TSOs and add 955 screeners to support new travel document screening initiative. The FY2008 appropriations debate focuses on screener staffing needs to address passenger wait time issues. The Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 removes the screener cap and directs TSA to hire as many personnel as necessary to enhance security and reduce wait times. Despite initiatives to reduce workplace injuries, worker compensation remains a significant expense for the TSA, accounting for $59 million in FY2008. The Senate report requested briefings on the effectiveness of TSA's strategies to mitigate on-the-job injuries and costs, but the final appropriations measure did not address this issue. The House and Senate versions of the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 aimed to give TSA screeners collective bargaining rights, but this was excluded from the final bill. TSA Administrator had warned that setting up collective bargaining for screeners would cost $160 million. TSA's performance-based accountability system for employees has also been a point of contention. In 2006, TSA implemented a performance-based management system for employees, compensating them based on factors like performance, technical proficiency, and training. H.R. 2638 includes a provision for a report on performance ratings and pay increases, comparing managers and non-managers. The President's FY2008 budget estimates $35 million for the Registered Traveler program. The Traveler program is expanding to more airports with potential nationwide implementation in FY2008 or later. A new international registered traveler program is being established, coordinated with US-VISIT and Visa Waiver programs, funded by participant fees. The TSA plans to launch the Secure Flight program in summer 2008. Funding in P.L. 110-161 reflects anticipation of these milestones. TSA is also working to reduce false matches in passenger prescreening lists. The TSA is facing challenges in maintaining and upgrading baggage explosives detection systems. Evaluating the impact of initiatives for passenger prescreening is of interest to appropriators. The TSA developed a Strategic Plan in 2006 to optimize screening solutions. The Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP) Strategic Plan aims to optimize screening solutions at the busiest airports, reducing life cycle costs for baggage screening technologies. Both House and Senate bills propose increased funding for explosives detection equipment procurement and installation. The reauthorization of the Aviation Security Capital Fund provides $544 million for the deployment of explosives detection systems, exceeding the President's request by $114 million. The TSA is testing various passenger checkpoint screening technologies to enhance security and efficiency. These technologies include advanced x-ray systems, whole body imaging, explosive trace detection machines, and liquid scanners. The effectiveness of these technologies and their alignment with the TSA's strategy will be a topic of discussion during the FY2008 DHS appropriations debate. The House bill proposes additional funding for checkpoint technologies, while the Senate bill supports funding at the requested level. The Checkpoint Screening Security Fund provides a non-discretionary funding source for these technologies. The Checkpoint Screening Security Fund, established as a $250 million nondiscretionary funding source for checkpoint screening technologies, aligns with the TSA's strategy. Division E of P.L. 110-161 eliminates special rules for TSA acquisition practices, aiming for commonality in acquisition procedures across DHS. This new system applies to all technology acquisitions, including passenger screening technologies. The TSA's air cargo security program includes 325 FTE air cargo security inspectors ensuring compliance with regulations. Security threat assessments for cargo workers are fee-based. The program is based on a risk-based system and relies on the known shipper program. A new Air Cargo Risk Based Targeting program is planned for FY2008, incorporating freight forwarder management information and a certified shipper program. Implementation of a risk-based freight assessment system and a certified shipper program is a key issue for the appropriations debate. A provision in P.L. 110-53 mandates physical inspections of cargo on passenger airplanes, with 50% to be inspected within 18 months and 100% within three years. The impact on appropriations is unclear as it is uncertain whether the screening would be a federal function or carried out by airlines. Critics argue that the necessary explosives detection technologies are not yet available, potentially requiring additional appropriations. The House and Senate bills propose increased funding for air cargo security activities, including deploying more canine units and increasing regulatory compliance inspectors. The House bill includes a provision to double the amount of cargo inspected on passenger aircraft, which the Administration opposes due to resource constraints. Additional appropriations may be necessary to accelerate technology development for air cargo security. The TSA is directed to increase cargo screening with air carriers and airports, sponsor research for screening methods, and implement the TWIC program for seaport workers. TWIC enrollment began in 54 ports with a fee of $132 for a five-year card. The TWIC program will be valid for five years, with vessel and port facility owners required to provide card readers after a pilot program. The President's budget anticipates fee collections of $27 million in FY2008, compared to $10 million in FY2007. TSA is seeking comments on using TWIC cards in all transportation modes, with potential issues in the DHS FY2008 appropriations debate. The House bill includes a $15 million direct appropriation for a pilot program to test TWIC card readers at maritime facilities. The Senate bill includes provisions related to the TWIC card reader pilot program, funding restrictions, and resolving differences with states like Florida. Division E of P.L. 110-161 provides $8 million for the local cost share and program evaluation. TSA is directed to resolve differences with states that have existing port worker ID programs. The Senate bill includes provisions related to the TWIC card reader pilot program, funding restrictions, and resolving differences with states like Florida. It does not include the provision that would have prohibited TSA from modifying the list of criminal offenses disqualifying an applicant from obtaining a card. The long-delayed initiatives for government prescreening of airline passengers against terrorist watchlists remain at issue. The Administration argues that the GAO review requirement for the Secure Flight system constitutes a \"legislative veto\" violating the separation of powers. OMB has concerns that cuts in the appropriations debate could further delay the program beyond a target deployment in 2010. Division E of P.L. 110-161 provides $50 million. The Senate bill includes provisions related to the TWIC card reader pilot program, funding restrictions, and resolving differences with states like Florida. It does not include the provision that would have prohibited TSA from modifying the list of criminal offenses disqualifying an applicant from obtaining a card. The Act provides $50 million for Secure Flight, assuming initial deployment in FY2008, with restrictions on deployment until specific issues are addressed. TSA has final authority in setting security fees for airlines, ensuring total fee collections do not exceed 2000 levels. The TSA has final authority in setting security fees for airlines, with no carrier limits in place since FY2004. The TSA's determinations are not subject to judicial review, but a provision in the House bill may change this, allowing airlines to challenge fee determinations in court. The Administration opposes this change, citing concerns about undermining the TSA's ability to adjust fees based on market share and prolonging the fee collection process. The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for maritime homeland security, responsible for U.S. port and waterway security. They also conduct non-homeland security missions like search and rescue and environmental protection. The Coast Guard, transferred to the DHS in 2003, is responsible for maritime security, search and rescue, environmental protection, and fisheries enforcement. The President requested $8,457 million for the Coast Guard in FY2008, with allocations for operating expenses, acquisition, training, research, and environmental compliance. The President requested $12 million for environmental compliance and restoration in FY2008, an increase of 9% from FY2007. Additionally, $223 million in supplemental funding was requested for the Coast Guard to support security operations in Iraq. H.R. 2638 provided $8,352 million in net budget authority for the Coast Guard, $102 million less than the President's request. The House and Senate provided funding for the Coast Guard, with the House allocating $16 million for the bridge alteration program and denying the President's request to transfer ACI personnel funding. The Senate allocated $8,559 million for the Coast Guard, including $5,931 million for operating expenses and $991 million for acquisition, construction, and improvements. The Senate Committee allocated $16 million for the bridge alteration program, $26 million for research and development, and $8,522 million for the Coast Guard in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, which is $65 million more than the President requested. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 allocated $16 million for the bridge alteration program, $26 million for research and development, and $8,522 million for the Coast Guard, which is $65 million more than the President requested. P.L. 110-161 provides $16 million for the bridge alteration program, allowing the Coast Guard to transfer funds for personnel costs. Concerns have been raised by Congress regarding the Coast Guard's operational response to increased duties in homeland security, including plans to replace aging vessels and aircraft through the criticized Deepwater program. The Coast Guard's management of the Deepwater program has faced criticism, with hearings held in 2007. For FY2008, the President requested $788 million, but the House allocated $591 million, withholding $400 million until a detailed expenditure plan is approved. The Senate provided $770 million, requiring an expenditure plan within 60 days. An independent third party must conduct an \"alternative analysis\" before acquiring additional major assets. The Coast Guard's Deepwater program funding under P.L. 110-161 is $651 million, $137 million less than requested. Congress requires a detailed expenditure plan and GAO review. Concerns include program management, cost, and timeline. Members of Congress worry about resource sufficiency for homeland security. The Coast Guard faces concerns about resource sufficiency for its homeland security mission, particularly in securing energy tankers. The PWCS mission consumes a significant portion of the budget, with a notable increase in resource hours post-9/11. The President's FY2008 request includes funding for the deployment of the Automatic Identification System in U.S. harbors. The Coast Guard has partnered with private entities to develop AIS facilities in U.S. ports, with the system being implemented in three phases. By 2014, the Coast Guard aims to track ships up to 2,000 nautical miles from shore and communicate with them within 24 nautical miles. The House and Senate committees recommended additional funds for the Coast Guard to implement security-related requirements from the SAFE Port Act. This includes establishing interagency port security operational centers, enhancing security for hazardous materials shipping, and doubling the number of existing centers. The House and Senate committees recommended additional funds for the Coast Guard to implement security-related requirements from the SAFE Port Act, including establishing interagency port security operational centers, enhancing security for hazardous materials shipping, and doubling the number of existing centers. The funding includes $59 million for port and cargo security, $29 million for small boats and crews for ship escorts and boardings, security zone enforcement, and marine inspectors, and $5 million for long-range vessel tracking. Additionally, $60 million is allocated for interagency port security operational centers as proposed by the Senate. The Coast Guard plans to establish port security operational centers at high-priority ports, costing $260 million. The President's budget includes a \"Deployable Operations Group\" to coordinate specialized teams for improved response capability. This reorganization will impact around 2,500 personnel. The Coast Guard is undergoing a reorganization that may face challenges in obtaining buy-in from affected personnel. Concerns have been raised about the agency's ability to sustain non-homeland security missions amidst its focus on maritime security. The DHS Inspector General's review found an increase in resource hours for non-homeland security missions in FY2005, largely due to Hurricane Katrina response efforts. In FY2005, the Coast Guard's non-homeland security resource hours were close to pre-9/11 levels. Despite increased homeland security activities, the agency has still met its non-homeland security mission goals. Congress expressed concern over the management of the Rescue 21 program, with costs tripling from the original estimate and delays in project completion. The President's FY2008 budget requested $81 million for Rescue 21, with the Senate agreeing to this amount. P.L. 110-161 provides $80 million for the project and expresses concern over recorded system outages. The GAO's FY2008 Coast Guard budget review notes an expansion in coverage gap targets for Rescue-21. The FY2008 budget proposed terminating the LORAN-C system. The Coast Guard is considering decommissioning the LORAN-C system, a ground-based navigation aid, in favor of GPS technology. Congress funded the system in FY2007 and required public notification before termination. Proponents argue that LORAN is a valuable backup to GPS, especially in cases where terrain obstructs GPS signals. The committees deny the President's request to terminate LORAN-C, citing its importance as a backup system to GPS. The President's FY2008 request includes transferring the Bridge Alteration Program from the Coast Guard to the Maritime Administration, with no new funding requested. Congress previously appropriated $16 million for the program in FY2007. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) has two main missions - criminal investigations and protection. Criminal investigations involve financial crimes, identity theft, counterfeiting, and computer fraud. The protection mission covers the President, Vice President, their families, candidates for office, and designated individuals. The Secret Service is responsible for security at National Special Security Events (NSSEs), including major party conventions and international events in the US. The President's budget for FY2008 requested $1,399 million for the Service, a $123 million increase from FY2007. The House, Senate, and Congress proposed appropriations for the Secret Service in FY2008, with increases ranging from $109 million to $120 million over FY2007 totals. Title III also includes funding for FEMA, NPPD, and OHA. In response to statutory exclusions, DHS officials created the NPPD to house functions not transferred to FEMA, and the OHA was established for the Office of the Chief Medical Officer. Congress passed the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act to address shortcomings identified in reports after Hurricane Katrina. The Post-Katrina Act expanded FEMA's responsibilities within the Department of Homeland Security and increased funding for FEMA in FY2008 to implement provisions of the Act. This reflects Congress's intent to enhance FEMA's authority and disaster response capabilities. The FY2008 budget for FEMA includes a significant increase in funding to support preparedness grant programs and operational changes. This includes a $668 million increase in the Operations and Support section. Additionally, there is a $4 million decrease in the Flood Map Modernization Fund and the removal of funding for the National Disaster Medical System, which was transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. The Post-Katrina Act resulted in changes to FEMA's funding, including a $11 million reduction in the Emergency Food and Shelter Program and decreased funding for the U.S. Fire Administration. The House approved an appropriations total exceeding the request by $2,197 million, with increased funding for state and local programs. This included $4,307 million for state and local programs, $20 million for pre-disaster mitigation, $35 million for flood map modernization, and $13 million for other areas. The House approved $7,239 million for FEMA, exceeding the Administration's request of $5,043 million. The Senate approved $7,017 million, with a significant increase in funding for state and local programs. This includes $4,136 million for state and local programs, $452 million more than the previous year. The funding levels for FEMA in P.L. 110-161 included a $5 million increase for flood map modernization, $153 million for emergency food and shelter (which was $13 million more than requested), and $20 million more than requested for pre-disaster mitigation. The total appropriation of $6,807 million was less than the Senate and House approvals but larger than the President's request. Increases were allocated for various assistance programs, such as $220 million for flood map modernization, $114 million for pre-disaster mitigation, and $153 million for the emergency food and shelter program. The response to Hurricane Katrina and the slow recovery from the storm, along with concerns about delays in FEMA operations and outdated technology, are ongoing issues for Members of Congress. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is a key source of funding for FEMA's assistance programs under the Stafford Act, with Congress providing supplemental funding when needed for recovery projects. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is a key source of funding for FEMA's assistance programs under the Stafford Act. Congress has provided supplemental appropriations for projects associated with disasters from previous years, current disaster activity, and hazard mitigation efforts. The issue before Congress is the use of supplemental appropriations legislation to meet climbing costs of emergency assistance instead of requesting sufficient funds at the start of the process. The final amount enacted for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was $1,324 million, slightly below FEMA's historical average of DRF spending. The smaller amount was due to the recent DOD Appropriations Act of November 11, 2007, which added $2.9 billion to the DRF. The Senate Committee emphasized accountability by requiring detailed estimates of DRF funding needed through September 30, 2008 and establishing measurable thresholds for transparent decision making. The Omnibus Act requests transparency in federal fiscal expenditures for disaster response, including a list of contracts awarded and estimates on fund exhaustion. Concerns arise regarding accountability for DRF expenditures, especially when expertise lies outside FEMA, such as with the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) shared with SAMHSA. The Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) funded through the DRF has faced challenges with unclear agency responsibility. Questions also surround FEMA's administration of the temporary housing program. Congress has transferred funds from the DRF to address needs, with differing views on the impact. The Office of Inspector General has received funds for audits and investigations. The Senate version of the legislation includes a $14 million transfer to the OIG. The legislation transfers $14 million to the OIG, with the Omnibus Act approving $16 million for the same purpose. Additionally, up to $48 million can be transferred to fill agency vacancies and enhance workforce skills. The House Appropriations Committee disapproves of transferring $48 million for converting temporary disaster employees to permanent positions. The Omnibus Act approves $48 million for 250 positions and an extra $12 million for activities related to the Stafford Act. However, $30 million of the $60 million total cannot be used for management and administration functions until FEMA submits an expenditure plan to the Senate and House Appropriations Committee. The Agency submits an expenditure plan to the Senate and House Appropriations Committee regarding 250 positions. The Post-Katrina Reform Act expands FEMA's coverage and areas of responsibility, potentially leading to increased costs for disaster activities. Changes include modifying the Federal contributions for the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program to 15%. The Post-Katrina Act modifies the HMGP provision to provide varying percentages based on the total damages of disasters. The House Committee report highlights the underutilization of HMGP assistance after Hurricane Katrina and directs FEMA to report on needed policy changes. The Senate Committee report emphasizes the cost savings of mitigation activities and encourages incentives for such actions. The Senate-approved legislation exempts certain hazard mitigation projects from pre-certification requirements and increases funding for map modernization and the pre-disaster mitigation fund. The 2006 amendment to the Public Assistance (PA) program expands eligibility criteria, allowing for increased federal disaster spending. It includes provisions for education facilities to apply directly for assistance, a Pilot Program for Public Assistance to incentivize state and local involvement in disaster work, and expands the list of eligible applicants. The 2006 amendment to the Public Assistance (PA) program encourages state and local governments to be more involved in disaster work, such as debris removal and repair projects. This could increase Federal cost share and reimbursement for base wages for local hires. Additionally, P.L. 110-28 waived state and local cost-share for Gulf Coast states affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Dennis, and Rita, leading to increased Public Assistance costs from the Disaster Relief Fund. Accelerated FEMA involvement in expedited federal assistance may also raise costs. The Post-Katrina Act includes provisions for expedited federal assistance, such as earlier technical assistance, logistics support, and communication help for precautionary evacuation measures. It also aims to improve administrative services, outreach efforts for disabled and limited English proficiency individuals, reunification of families after disasters, and transportation assistance for victims. The Act addresses deficiencies in FEMA's information systems by requiring the adoption of cutting-edge technology. The Senate Committee allocated $6 million for competitive awards to enhance technology effectiveness. The Senate Committee allocated $6 million for competitive awards to enhance technology effectiveness, including funding for a Document Management and Records Tracking System. The Post-Katrina Act authorizes case management as an eligible cost for disaster victims, with potential higher costs associated with providing this assistance. Concerns remain about the surplus trailers used by FEMA for temporary shelters. The Post-Katrina Act addressed concerns about temporary housing provisions in the Stafford Act. It directs the agency to consider providing surplus housing units to homeless veterans and requires training on health concerns for disaster victims. The Congress' Explanatory Statement for the Omnibus Act mandates reports on FEMA's decision-making. The Senate bill includes a mandate for consultation with West Virginia and Pennsylvania officials on evacuations from the National Capital Region. The Office of Grant Programs in FEMA administers grant programs for state and local homeland security capabilities. Post-Katrina reforms separated the Office of Grant Programs from FEMA training activities. FEMA's National Integration Center provides training and assistance for states and localities. The Office of Grant Programs in FEMA administers training, exercises, and technical assistance for states and localities. Table 15 shows appropriations for state and local homeland security grant programs. The President's FY2008 requested $2,196 million for state and local programs, $1,191 million less than FY2007. The Administration proposed reallocating funds from LETPP to SHSGP and UASI, potentially reducing funds for states. The House-passed appropriation was $4,307 million for state and local programs. The House and Senate proposed increased funding for state and local programs, with the House allocating $4,307 million and the Senate $4,136 million. Both chambers included funding for LETPP, Metropolitan Medical Response System, Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Grants, Interoperable Communications Grants, and Real ID Grants, despite the Administration's request for no line item funding for some programs. Congress appropriated $4,228 million for state and local programs, including funding for LETPP, Metropolitan Medical Response System, Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Grants, Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grants, and Interoperable Communications Grants. Grant recipients are required to allocate at least 25% of their allocations on law enforcement terrorism prevention activities. Additionally, $15 million was allocated for Emergency Operation Centers, and $60 million in emergency funding was included in the total allocation. The FY2008 homeland security grant funds include $60 million for Operation Stonegarden and $50 million for the Real ID program. Congressional debate focused on fund allocation among states and proposed cuts to the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. Discussions on distribution methods have been ongoing since the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. The 9/11 Commission recommended distributing security grant funds based on threat and risk assessments. Funds have been distributed according to the formula in the USA Patriot Act, guaranteeing each state a minimum percentage of total appropriations. The Administration proposed distributing FY2008 funds for EMPG and CCP programs based on the Section 1014 formula, with SHSGP as a discretionary program. Some Members of Congress disagreed with this proposal, leading to debate in H.R. 2638. With the enactment of legislation (P.L. 110-53), FY2008 funding allocations for SHSGP grants will be based on a different formula, guaranteeing each state a minimum percentage of total appropriations. Some argue that this resolves a long-standing debate in Congress, while others believe it undermines the discretionary nature of the program. Administration budget proposals have included significant cuts for fire grants and zero funding for SAFER grants, which opponents argue are inadequate. The Administration proposed a 45% cut in funding for fire grants in FY2008, with no funding for SAFER grants. The total request for Assistance to Firefighters Grants was 55% below the FY2007 level. Grants for wellness/fitness activities and modifications to facilities for firefighter safety were eliminated in the budget proposal. The requested funding is aimed at enhancing critical capabilities for local response to fire-related hazards in the event of a terrorist attack or major disaster. The budget justification requested appropriate funding for first responder preparedness missions, citing availability of funding from other DHS grant programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $570 million for fire grants and $230 million for the SAFER program, directing FEMA to maintain an all-hazards focus and not limit eligible activities. The Committee expressed concern about the low number of fire grant applications reaching the peer review stage. Large numbers of fire grant applications never reach the peer review stage. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was directed to review the application and award process for fire and SAFER grants. The House passed H.R. 2638, adding $5 million to the SAFER account, providing $570 million for fire grants and $235 million for SAFER. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $560 million for fire grants and $140 million for SAFER, directing DHS to fund applications according to local and US Fire Administration priorities. The Senate-passed bill provided $560 million for fire grants and $145 million for SAFER grants in FY2008. $3 million was allocated for foam firefighter equipment in remote areas. GAO was tasked with reviewing the grant application process, and FEMA was directed to peer review all grants. The Post-Katrina Act established the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) position within DHS and proposed the creation of the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) in FY2008. The OHA would consist of three divisions: Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and Biodefense, Medical Readiness, and Component Services. The WMD and Biodefense Division would lead biodefense activities, including the BioShield and BioWatch programs. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) within DHS would consist of three divisions: Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and Biodefense, Medical Readiness, and Component Services. Dr. Jeffrey Runge was confirmed as the first DHS Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs on December 19, 2007, overseeing contingency planning, first responder readiness, WMD incident management support, medical readiness grant coordination, and occupational health and safety programs. The Administration requested $118 million for OHA for FY2008, including a funding increase of $17 million and transfers totaling $100 million. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) within DHS received funding from various directorates for programs such as BioWatch Operations, Biological Warning and Incident Characterization (BWIC), and Rapidly Deployable Chemical Defense System (RDCDS). The House recommended $118 million for OHA, with a directive to allocate $2 million for an evaluation by the National Academy of Sciences. The Senate recommended $115 million for OHA, including full funding for BioWatch Operations. The enacted FY2008 appropriation provided $117 million for the Office of Health Affairs (OHA), slightly more than requested for salaries and expenses, and up to $2 million for an NAS evaluation of the BioWatch program. The National Protection and Programs (NPP) Directorate was formed in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, transferring preparedness activities back to a new Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The Radiological Emergency Preparedness Program and the Office of the National Capital Region Coordination were transferred to the new FEMA. The old Preparedness Directorate's functions related to critical infrastructure protection were not transferred. The Office of the Chief Medical Officer was moved to a new Office of Health Affairs. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act established the Office of Emergency Communications under the Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications. The Secretary established the Office of Emergency Communications under the Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications, transferred the US-VISIT program to a new directorate, and elevated the Risk Management Division into a separate Office of Risk Management and Analysis. US-VISIT was previously coordinated out of the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security. DHS Secretary Chertoff's review proposed placing US-VISIT within a new Screening Coordination Office. The US-VISIT program was initially proposed to be part of the Screening Coordination Office (SCO) within DHS but ended up as a stand-alone office. In FY2008, DHS planned to move US-VISIT to the National Protection Programs Directorate (NPPD) for better coordination and oversight. The Administration requested $462 million for US-VISIT in FY2008, with a focus on enhancing fingerprint capabilities for entry and reducing funding for exit pilot programs. The House fully funded the Administration's request for US-VISIT in FY2008, including $228 million for 10 finger-print capability for entry purposes. The House also withheld $232 million pending approval of an expenditure plan for a biometric exit component within five years. The Senate recommended $362 million for US-VISIT in FY2008, $100 million less than requested, citing large unobligated balances. $100 million was withheld pending a comprehensive expenditure plan. H.R. 2764 provides $475 million for the US-VISIT system, including $275 million in emergency funding. $13 million is allocated for the expedited implementation of an air and sea exit component. $125 million is withheld until an expenditure plan is reviewed and approved. DHS must provide quarterly briefings on US-VISIT implementation and coordination with other border security efforts. Congress may face issues regarding funding for the exit component and proposed transfer to the NPPD. The focus is on funding for the US-VISIT system, specifically the debate over decreasing funding for the exit component and expanding the entry component. Questions arise about the administrative placement of US-VISIT within the NPPD and whether the current infrastructure can support a 10 fingerprint system. Some argue that US-VISIT supports critical infrastructure protection by preventing terrorists from entering, while others believe its primary role is immigration-related. The US-VISIT program's primary role is immigration-related, focusing on screening individuals entering the country. Concerns have been raised about the program's management oversight and strategic planning. There is debate over whether US-VISIT should be placed within the NPPD or other administrative placements within DHS. Options include leaving US-VISIT as a stand-alone entity reporting to the Undersecretary or placing it within CBP to enhance immigration control aspects. In FY2008, DHS is considering implementing a 10 fingerprint entry component for the US-VISIT system instead of the exit component. Testing for the exit component has been halted, with a $31 million reduction in funding for exit pilot programs. DHS is focusing on expanding the entry component to include 10 fingerprint enrollment and interoperability with other federal fingerprint databases. Congress may need to address whether these goals conflict and if DHS should continue working on the exit component while expanding the entry component. The House and Senate fully funded the Administration's request for a 10 fingerprint entry capability in H.R. 2638. Concerns were raised about the lack of a clear plan for addressing an exit strategy, especially regarding the termination of existing air pilots instead of utilizing them as a temporary solution. The House noted that while implementing the exit component at the land border may not be feasible with current technology, failing to explore air exit solutions is incomprehensible. The Senate-passed H.R. 2638 would withhold $100 million pending approval of a comprehensive US-VISIT plan. P.L. 110-161 supports a 10 fingerprint entry-system and directs US-VISIT to oversee efforts for interoperability with the FBI's IAFIS. The conference report expresses disappointment with the lack of an exit solution and allocates $13 million for implementation at air and sea ports of entry by the end of 2008. DHS is directed to assess the feasibility of an exit solution. The Senate-passed H.R. 2638 supports a 10 fingerprint entry-system and directs US-VISIT to oversee efforts for interoperability with the FBI's IAFIS. The conference report allocates $13 million for implementation of an exit solution at air and sea ports of entry by the end of 2008, with DHS directed to assess feasibility. The Infrastructure Protection and Information Security (IPIS) Program coordinates national efforts to identify critical infrastructure assets and prioritize risk reduction activities. The President's FY2008 request for the IPIS program was $653 million, with some changes made that complicate comparisons. The FY2008 budget request for the IPIS program combined several program activities into a single PPA called Infrastructure Protection (IP). Certain expenses were transferred to NPPD's Management and Administration account, while sub-programs were required to cover their own salaries and benefits. Tracking these transfers is not covered in the document. The FY2007 enacted figures in Table 16 are based on House and Senate reports. The President's budget identified programmatic increases totaling $38 million, with the largest being $15 million for the Chemical Site Security Program. There were also program reductions of $30 million in various IP PPA activities. In FY2007, there were reductions of $30 million in various IP PPA activities, including management and implementation of the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, capabilities of the Automated Critical Asset Management System, Bomb Prevention Program, and Infrastructure Planning, Training, and Exercise Programs. The House appropriated $533 million for the IPIS program, allocating more funds for Infrastructure Protection and the Office of Emergency Communications, and less for Computer Security and National Security/Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications. The House provided $20 million more than requested for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. The House increased funding for administrative support for Sector Coordinating Councils and the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center. They also provided additional funds for interoperability integration and technical assistance. However, the House did not approve the large increase requested for a Next Generation Network, allocating $18 million instead of the $52 million requested. The House provided $18 million for security at chemical facilities, less than the $52 million requested. The Senate bill allocated $522 million for IPIS, with additional funding recommended for IP and OEC programs. Increases were recommended for security regulations at chemical facilities and the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center. The Interoperable Communications Integration and Technical Assistance program received a $12 million increase. Funding for the Next Generation Network was less than requested. The Senate recommended less funding for the Next Generation Network within the NS/EP PPA, allocating $30 million instead of the $52 million requested. Amendments were made to allocate $10 million to the Office of Bombing Prevention and not more than $26 million for the Next Generation Network. The Senate also approved amendments authorizing the Secretary to regulate the sale of ammonium nitrate and providing $2 million for implementation. Additionally, $5 million was allocated to firefighter assistance grants. The Senate-passed H.R. 2638 includes $522 million for the IPIS program, reducing funding for firefighter assistance grants by $5 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, provided $655 million for IPIS, including an additional $115 million for Cyber Security. The Act also allocated $50 million for chemical facility security regulations and $20 million for the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 allocated $20 million for the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center, $31 million for NIPP implementation, and $21 million for the NS/EP Next Generation Network project. The Act also addressed IPIS-related issues such as budget quality, chemical facility regulations, and risk management funding. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees criticized the lack of detail and clarity in the NPPD budget justification document and questioned fund transfers without their knowledge. The Senate committee expressed concerns about consolidation efforts to obfuscate and specified lower-level funding for individual program areas within the IP and NS/EP PPAs. They also cut $16 million from the NPPD's Management and Administration account and withheld $15 million until an approved expenditure plan is reviewed by the Government Accountability Office. Congressional concerns were reiterated in the Act, which reduced fenced off funds to $5 million. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about chemical facility security regulations developed by DHS. The House bill prevents federal regulations from preempting stronger State and local regulations, while the Senate included similar language unless there is an actual conflict with federal law. The Senate's response seems to be in opposition to the White House's statement on the matter. The White House expressed concerns about the Department's ability to protect information from disclosure, while industry worries about state-level freedom of information laws. The Act included the Senate provision and reorganized the National Protection and Programs Directorate. The President requested $9 million for the Office of Risk Management and Analysis. The Act provided $9 million for the Office of Risk Management and Analysis from the NPPD's Management and Administration account. Title IV includes appropriations for USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and DNDO. USCIS focuses on adjudicating immigration petitions. Table 17 provides account-level details of Title IV appropriations. USCIS is responsible for processing various petitions, naturalization applications, refugee and asylum claims, and citizenship benefits. The agency is primarily funded through the Examinations Fee Account. USCIS has transformed its revenue structure and received some direct appropriations for specific projects in the past decade. In the past decade, USCIS has received direct appropriations for specific projects like backlog reduction initiatives. The agency's main revenue source is adjudication fees from immigration benefit applications. In the FY2008 budget request, USCIS asked for $30 million in direct appropriations, with the rest of the $2,569 million budget coming from collected fees. This budget request represents a $583 million increase from FY2007, with $1,981 million allocated for adjudication services. In FY2008, $1,981 million, or roughly 77%, would fund USCIS adjudication services. The funds would be allocated towards pay and expenses, district operating expenses, service center operating expenses, and business transformation initiatives. The President's budget request also includes funding levels for information and customer services, administration, and the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program. The House-passed version of the USCIS appropriations is identical to the agency's request. The House-passed USCIS appropriations are identical to the agency's request, but H.Rept. 110-181 expressed concerns about fee increases and operations. Members directed USCIS to review fees regularly and submit a report on service improvements resulting from fee increases. Senate adopted H.R. 2638 with language from S. 1644. Members supported USCIS' transformation and security improvements, urging immediate publication of U-Visas regulation rule. The Senate appropriations proposal for USCIS includes an additional $80.5 million in direct appropriations, with $20 million for FBI background checks and $523,000 for benefit parole programs. The committee expressed concerns about FBI backlogs and required a plan to address them, along with quarterly reports on USCIS application processing. The Senate adopted amendments for USCIS funding, including $60 million for the EEV program and $1 million for a benefits fraud assessment of the H-1B Visa Program. These funds aim to enhance state and local program access to the EEV system, ensure system capacity, and develop privacy and security policies. The H-1B Visa Program underwent a benefits fraud assessment as part of the appropriations cycle for FY2008. Division E of P.L. 110-161 allocated $80.9 million in direct appropriations for USCIS, including funds for the EEV program, reducing the FBI name check backlog, benefit parole programs, and expanding immigration services in underserved areas. The 110th Congress faced various issues related to legal immigration and USCIS during this time. During the FY2008 appropriations cycle, issues related to legal immigration and USCIS were discussed, including proposed fee increases for visa applicants, USCIS' adjudication backlog, and funding for eliminating the backlog. USCIS published a new fee schedule in May 2007, with fee adjustments set to take effect in July 2007, increasing application fees by an average of 96%. Congressional reactions to the proposed fees varied. Opponents of proposed USCIS fee increases call for congressional action to prevent implementation. They suggest a sliding scale fee structure or direct appropriations to offset costs for lower income families. Supporters argue the fees would deter public charges from applying for immigration benefits and are a good deal globally. The fee increase has also raised concerns about USCIS' adjudications backlog. Emilio T. Gonzalez stated that the backlog of immigration benefit applications has been reduced, with approximately 65,000 due to USCIS factors. Critics are concerned about over 1 million pending applications not counted in the backlog, and delays attributed to the FBI's National Name Check Program. Congress has allocated $574 million since FY2002 for backlog reduction at USCIS, aiming to reduce processing time to six months. USCIS aims to reduce processing time to six months by adjusting fee structure to reflect costs. Fee increases may be necessary to handle potential future application surges. Comprehensive immigration reform could lead to a significant increase in applications. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) provides training for various law enforcement entities, both domestic and international. FLETC maintains four training sites in the US with over 1,000 employees. The FY2008 budget for FLETC is $263 million, with a proposed creation of a FLETC Fund to replace the Salaries and Expenses account. This fund would be capitalized with $220 million and include funding for 1,077 positions. The new fund for FLETC includes funding for 1,077 positions, with an increase of seven new instructors for the Secure Border Initiative. FLETC estimates the need to train 4,350 USBP agents to add a net total of 3,000 agents. The House fully funded FLETC for FY2008 but did not approve the proposal to replace the salaries and expenses account. The Senate recommended $266 million for FLETC, including $1 million for a detention training facility in Artesia, New Mexico. P.L. 110-161 provides $289 million for FLETC but rejects the Administration's fund proposal. The Act provides $289 million for FLETC, rejecting the Administration's fund proposal. The Directorate of Science and Technology is the primary DHS organization for research and development, managing operational systems and funding R&D in various laboratories. The Administration requested $799 million for S&T for FY2008, with a proposed reduction in operational programs transferred to other parts of the department. The FY2007 enacted amount for the Science and Technology Directorate was $758 million, with reductions in the Explosives and Infrastructure programs. The House provided less funding for Management and Administration due to unfilled staff positions and rejected procurement of third-generation BioWatch units. The House provided $10 million more than the request for University Programs and instructed the S&T Directorate to report on how it selects university Centers of Excellence. No funding was provided for the ADVISE program, and several smaller changes resulted in a net decrease of $10 million in Research, Development, Acquisition, and Operations. The Senate provided an increase of $41 million in Research, Development, Acquisition, and Operations for FY2008. The Senate allocated $13 million for the Biological and Chemical program, $14 million for Innovation, and no funding for ADVISE. Increases were provided for Explosives, Infrastructure, Geophysical, and Laboratory Facilities. There was a reduction in Management and Administration. Research, Development, Acquisition, and Operations saw an increase, while Management and Administration saw a decrease. The Chemical and Biological program received $21 million less than requested, with reductions in third-generation BioWatch procurement and Innovation funding. The Senate allocated funds for various programs, with increases for Explosives and reductions in Management and Administration. Congress criticized the S&T Directorate's performance and raised concerns about its mission, organization, priorities, financial management, and transparency. The Directorate's management structure and budget presentation have been realigned, with progress reported in obligating FY2007 funding. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is responsible for nuclear threat detection within DHS, with a proposed $562 million budget for FY2008, a 17% increase from FY2007. The FY2008 budget proposal includes a $47 million increase in Research, Development, and Operations for the Transformational R&D program. Additionally, a $30 million increase in Systems Acquisition is allocated for the Securing the Cities initiative in New York City. The House recommended reductions in Management and Administration and Research, Development, and Operations, and directed DNDO not to procure Advanced Spectroscopic Portal systems without certification of their effectiveness. The Senate bill for FY2008 budget includes changes in funding allocations, with reductions in Management and Administration and Systems Acquisition, and an increase in Research, Development, and Operations. There is a shift of funds towards screening general aviation aircraft for illicit nuclear materials. The final appropriation provided $90 million, with restrictions on full-scale procurement of ASP monitors until DHS provides a required report and certification. The final appropriation for FY2007 provided $90 million less than the request for Systems Acquisition, with restrictions on full-scale procurement of ASP monitors until certified by the Secretary. Funds were allocated for the National Academy of Sciences to assist in certification decisions, and separate certifications were required for primary and secondary deployments. Congressional focus has been on criticism of DNDO's cost-benefit analysis for next-generation ASP technology. In FY2007, DNDO funding increased while S&T funding decreased, leading to congressional interest in the relative roles of the two organizations. The House and Senate committees directed S&T and DNDO to collaborate on R&D needs instead of duplicative programs. The congressional budget resolution proposed $955 billion in discretionary budget authority for FY2008. The Senate and House passed a budget resolution for FY2008, providing $954 billion in discretionary budget authority. Homeland security budget amounts are included in major functional categories. Appendix A of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 allocated $3 billion in emergency funds for border security. The funding was distributed among various DHS accounts, including Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Coast Guard. Additional funds were included in different divisions of the Act. In FY2008, $2.7 billion in emergency funding was allocated for border security in various DHS accounts. The funds were distributed among CBP, ICE, U.S. Coast Guard, USVISIT, S&L programs, USCIS, and FLETC. CBP received $1.5 billion, including funding for hiring additional officers at international airports. $45 million allocated for terrorist prevention system enhancements for passenger screening at U.S. international airports, $36 million for implementing the electronic travel authorization program, $150 million for the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, $25 million for Border Patrol ground transportation vehicles, $13 million for Border Patrol vehicles, $14 million for Air and Marine Personnel Compensation and Benefits, and $1.1 billion for Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology development and deployment. In FY2008, emergency funding for ICE and U.S. Coast Guard was allocated as follows: ICE received $527 million, with $516 million for salaries and expenses, $4 million for vehicle replacements, $50 million for investigations, $186 million for custody operations, $33 million for fugitive operations, $10 million for alternatives to detention, $33 million for transportation and removal, and $200 million for criminal alien identification and removal. U.S. Coast Guard received $166 million, with $70 million for operating expenses and $11 million for construction. In FY2008, emergency funding for U.S. Coast Guard is disbursed as follows: Operating Expenses: $70 million for port and maritime security enhancements; Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements: $96 million for medium response boat replacement and interagency operational centers for port security. Additionally, $275 million is allocated for US-VISIT, $110 million for State and Local Programs, and $80 million for USCIS, with specific allocations for various programs within each account. In FY2008, emergency funding for USCIS includes $60 million for the E-Verify program and $20 million for the FBI background check backlog. FLETC receives $21 million, with $17 million for law enforcement training and $4 million for construction. DOJ is allocated $40 million for border security-related resources. In FY2008, $40 million in emergency funding for DOJ is allocated for various purposes including additional attorneys and judges for immigration appeals, addressing appeals from increased immigration enforcement actions, and funding for criminal and civil litigation. $15 million is designated for the US Marshals Service for prisoner transportation and courthouse security related to immigration-related Federal court proceedings. In FY2008, emergency border security funding of $225 million is allocated for construction at select land ports of entry to address increased immigration enforcement actions. This funding is part of the General Services Administration (GSA) and Judiciary services. In FY2008, $25 million in emergency funding is allocated for border security initiatives within Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services to address increased immigration enforcement along the Southwest border. This includes funding for salaries, expenses, and defender services. The Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 provided supplemental appropriations for FY2007, with a total of $5,190 million allocated for DHS agencies and accounts. Provisions included funding for FEMA disaster relief and various other DHS programs. Title III of H.R. 2206 allocates various amounts to different DHS agencies and programs, totaling $710 million. This includes funding for CBP, ICE, TSA, FEMA, USCIS, S&T, DNDO, and other departments. Additionally, Title IV provides $706 million for FEMA disaster relief, and Title V makes $30 million available for USCG Retired Pay balances. Section 5404(a) of Title IV of H.R. 2206 rescinds funds totaling approximately $31 million from various DHS accounts. Section 5404(b) reallocates $30 million to the USCG Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements account, and $1 million to the Office of the Under Secretary for Management. H.R. 1591, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veteran's Health, and Iraq Accountability Act, was introduced in March 2007 and passed by the House and Senate. The President vetoed the bill in May 2007, and the House failed to override the veto. The conference version of H.R. 1591 would have provided a total of $6,851 million for DHS, which was $141 million more than the House-passed version and $541 million more than the Senate-passed version. Title I included funding for various DHS accounts such as CBP, ICE, TSA, FEMA, and NPPD. The conference version of H.R. 1591 allocated $4,610 million to DHS, with funds for FEMA disaster relief and other DHS accounts. Additionally, $31 million was rescinded from various DHS accounts, while $30 million was provided to the USCG Acquisition account and $1 million to the Office of the Under Secretary for Management. Since the 9/11 attacks, there has been a growing focus on funding for homeland security. The Office of Management and Budget started reporting to Congress on combating terrorism in 1998, with homeland security funding analysis included since 2002. The analysis has become more detailed over the years, making year-to-year comparisons challenging. It's important to note that DHS funding doesn't cover all federal spending on homeland security efforts. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding for FY2008 accounts for 49% of total federal funding for homeland security. The Department of Defense follows at 29%, with other agencies like Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy making up the top five agencies in spending. Not all DHS funding is solely for homeland security activities, as legacy agencies also conduct other non-homeland security related activities. The FY2008 request for DHS included $29.7 billion for homeland security, out of a total gross budget authority of $43.0 billion for the agency and other listed agencies."
