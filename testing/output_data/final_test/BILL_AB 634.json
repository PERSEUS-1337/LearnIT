    "title": "AB 634",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 881 of the Probate Code is amended to require custodians to comply with requests to disclose digital assets or terminate accounts within 60 days. Failure to comply may result in a court order for compliance, with a provision that it does not violate federal law. Custodians can also notify users of such requests. A custodian may deny a fiduciary's request for disclosure of digital assets or account termination if lawful access to the account is known post-user's death. The custodian can seek a court order confirming ownership, consent, and compliance with relevant laws. Custodians and their personnel are immune from liability for their actions. Membership lists on the open market are valuable to unscrupulous parties targeting time-share owners, necessitating legislation for privacy protection. Section 11273 of the Business and Professions Code allows inspection of time-share plan records by members for membership-related purposes. Members of a time-share association can request to inspect records by submitting a written request and paying a fee for reproduction costs. The governing body sets rules for notice, inspection hours, and payment for copies. Every governing body member has the right to inspect all association records and properties. The association must maintain a list of time-share owners' names and addresses, update it every six months, and not share it for commercial purposes. Members can request a copy for association-related purposes, but the association can refuse if misuse is suspected. If a time-share owner requests to communicate by mail with the association for a membership-related purpose, the mailing must be sent within 30 days upon request and payment of actual costs. If the board determines the mailing is not membership-related, they must notify the owner in writing with reasons for rejection. The owner requesting mail communication with the association must pay in advance for actual mailing costs. The association should try to minimize costs by using cheaper delivery methods like electronic delivery. If the board of administration or managing entity fails to distribute requested communication within 30 days, the superior court may order distribution upon owner's application. The court may also order the board to pay owner's costs if the refusal was not in good faith. It is illegal for the board of administration to deny distributing a requested communication related to association membership. Section 8330 of the Corporations Code does not apply to time-share associations under this chapter. For time-share plans located outside the state, the association must comply with the laws of that jurisdiction. If there is a conflict between the situs state laws and the requirements in this section, the situs state laws prevail. If the association and time-share instruments address the matters in this section, they are considered compliant and no revisions are needed."
