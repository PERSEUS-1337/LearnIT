    "content": "The \"Shellfish Safety Act of 1993\" aims to protect human health from shellfish consumption hazards and ensure public confidence in the quality and labeling of shellfish products in the United States through a national shellfish safety program. The \"Shellfish Safety Act of 1993\" mandates the establishment of a National Shellfish Safety Program within 9 months of enactment. The program includes guidelines for shellfish growers, harvesters, shippers, water quality monitoring, shellfish movement tracking, and controlling contaminants. The National Shellfish Safety Program established by the \"Shellfish Safety Act of 1993\" includes guidelines consistent with those adopted by the Conference and the FDA. The Secretary, in consultation with the Conference, will periodically review and revise the Program to ensure its alignment with the Act's purposes. SEC. 4. DOMESTIC SHELLFISH SAFETY. State Shellfish Safety Programs require each shellfish producing State to submit a proposed program to manage, monitor, classify, and enforce safety standards for shellfish growing and harvest areas. This includes procedures for closure and reopening of areas that do not meet safety standards, certifying compliant shellfish shippers, and ensuring adequate monitoring and enforcement. Each State must ensure that standards and procedures for the Program are met. Certified Shellfish Shippers List and Classified Waters List must be submitted monthly to the Secretary by each State. SEC. 5. IMPORTED SHELLFISH SAFETY. The Secretary may enter into a memorandum of understanding with foreign countries that have shellfish safety programs equivalent to the Program. The memorandum must include verification activities by the Secretary and require the foreign country to manage its program under equivalent standards and procedures. Shippers in foreign countries must comply with the Program and provide a list of shellfish harvesting waters meeting equivalent standards. Within 60 days of the Program's establishment, the Secretary will publish monthly lists of certified shellfish shippers and classified harvesting waters. Delisting of certified shippers is also addressed. SEC. 7. DELISTING OF CERTIFIED SHIPPERS. The Secretary may remove a shellfish shipper from the list if they are not in compliance with Program standards and procedures, and if the certifying State or country has not taken action on the noncompliance. SEC. 8. CERTAIN SHELLFISH DEEMED UNFIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. Shellfish is considered adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act if it is grown or harvested in a foreign country without a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary, grown in a State without an approved shellfish safety program, harvested from unclassified waters, or shipped by a non-listed shellfish shipper. Shellfish is considered adulterated if shipped by a non-listed shellfish shipper. The Secretary can cooperate with States to establish shellfish safety programs under the Program. Additionally, there is a provision for restoring shellfish growing and harvest waters. SEC. 10. RESTORATION OF SHELLFISH GROWING AND HARVEST WATERS. The Secretary of Commerce, in cooperation with the EPA and States, will evaluate, establish lists, determine causes, and assess potential for removing conditions and prohibitions in shellfish growing areas. Cooperative agreements with States may be entered into for restoration programs.\n\nSEC. 11. DEFINITIONS. For the purpose of this Act, key terms include \"Conference\" referring to the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference, \"Program\" as the National Shellfish Safety Program, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and \"shellfish\" encompassing various species of molluscan bivalves. The term \"State\" refers to different states and territories within the United States. A \"shellfish shipper\" is defined as a person involved in processing and shipping shellfish in interstate commerce. This definition applies to territories and possessions of the United States such as the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands."
