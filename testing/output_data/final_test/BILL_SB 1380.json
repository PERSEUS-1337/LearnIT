    "content": "The people of California enact the following. California leads the nation in homelessness, with 115,738 homeless residents, including 29,178 chronically homeless individuals and 10,416 homeless youth. This is costly to the state and local governments, with a homeless person in Los Angeles County costing $2,897 per month in crisis response services. Moving a chronically homeless Californian into \"supportive housing\" can reduce their costs by almost 80%. The Legislature aims to adopt a \"Housing First\" model for all state programs funding housing for homeless individuals, including unaccompanied youth under 25. Housing First is an evidence-based model recognized by the federal government as the most effective approach to ending chronic homelessness, yielding high-housing retention rates and significant reductions in crisis care. California lacks an entity to coordinate a Housing First-oriented response to homelessness. California participated in a federally funded policy academy to reduce chronic homelessness, resulting in program revisions by the Department of Housing and Community Development. A coordinating council on homelessness is deemed essential for further success. Core components of Housing First include tenant screening practices that accept applicants regardless of sobriety or substance use, no rejection based on credit or rental history, acceptance of referrals from various crisis response systems, tenant-driven service plans, and no requirement for participation in services for permanent housing tenancy. In communities with coordinated assessment and entry systems, funding incentives promote tenant selection plans for supportive housing based on criteria like duration of homelessness, vulnerability, or high crisis service utilization. Case managers use evidence-based practices for client engagement. Services in supportive housing are guided by a harm-reduction approach, acknowledging tenants' drug and alcohol use as part of their lives. Tenants receive nonjudgmental communication, education on safer practices, and access to evidence-based treatment if desired. Special physical features in the project promote health, independence, and community among tenants with disabilities. Assistance is provided for homeless individuals to move in. State programs in California agencies and departments collaborate with the coordinating council to adopt guidelines incorporating core components of Housing First for homeless individuals. The Governor shall create a Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council within 180 days of the effective date of the measure. The council's goals include overseeing the implementation of the chapter and identifying resources to prevent and end homelessness in California. Agencies and departments administering state programs must collaborate with the council to revise guidelines incorporating core components of Housing First by July 1, 2019. The Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council aims to create partnerships among various entities to develop strategies to end homelessness, promote systems integration, coordinate funding, and make policy recommendations to legislators and governmental entities. The Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council aims to make policy recommendations to legislators, identify funding opportunities, broker agreements between state agencies, serve as a statewide resource on ending homelessness, and report to the Governor and Legislature on efforts to reduce homelessness in California. The Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council's goals include ensuring accountability, implementing strategies to fight homelessness in small communities, and creating a statewide data system to match data on homelessness to state programs. The Governor appoints up to 15 members, including representatives from various state agencies. The Governor appoints up to 15 members to the Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council, including representatives from various state agencies, local organizations, a formerly homeless person, and state advocates or members of the public. The Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council appoints representatives from stakeholder organizations, invites stakeholders, individuals with homelessness experience, and experts to meetings, holds public meetings quarterly, members serve at the Governor's pleasure, and may establish working groups or task forces. The Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council appoints representatives from stakeholder organizations, individuals with homelessness experience, and experts to meetings. Members serve without compensation, but those who are homeless may receive reimbursement for expenses. The Department of Housing and Community Development provides staff for the council. Members can enter into memoranda of understanding to facilitate communication and cooperation."
