The guardian ad litem must fulfill duties related to asylum applications until the alien departs the US, a final asylum order is made, or the alien turns 18, whichever comes first. The Attorney General must notify the guardian of any relevant matters. The guardian ad litem appointed for alien children must conduct interviews and investigate relevant facts within 30 days. The guardian ad litem appointed for alien children must provide reports with investigation results, alien's wishes, and recommendations to all parties in immigration proceedings. They advise on voluntary departure and ensure the alien's best interests are promoted. The guardian ad litem appointed for alien children ensures the alien's best interests are promoted during immigration proceedings, asylum proceedings, or removal proceedings. They have the authority to be present at hearings, review records, and ensure the alien understands the determinations and proceedings. The guardian ad litem appointed for alien children has the authority to review records, seek independent evaluations, and be present at proceedings. They cannot file a petition against the wishes of a parent. Minors described are those under 18 years of age. The alien is considered an applicant for admission or a stowaway, not in the custody of a parent or legal guardian, and must not be a citizen of a state sponsor of terrorism. The alien, if indicating an intention to apply for asylum or fear of persecution, or if the Attorney General determines potential eligibility for asylum, may have a guardian ad litem who is qualified and not affiliated with the Service. The Service is not the alien's immigration attorney, relative, or have a conflict of interest. The Attorney General must stay proceedings and not induce voluntary departure until a guardian ad litem is appointed. Deference to decisions of the guardian is required. The guardian ad litem appointed under regulations by the Attorney General shall have decisions treated the same as a guardian ad litem for a minor child in a child welfare proceeding under State law, without superseding any international agreements or treaties."
