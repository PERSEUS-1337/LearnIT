    "title": "SB 476",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 18897 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define an \"organized camp\" as a resident or day camp providing group-based recreation and learning opportunities for children under 18. Excluded from this definition are various types of facilities such as hotels, correctional camps, and child day care facilities. An organized resident camp is a site with programs for group living experiences, providing three or more consecutive overnight stays. It excludes hotels, correctional camps, and child day care facilities. An organized day camp is a program for children under 18 that provides group experiences during the day. It can transport campers to various locations and have offsite field trips for up to three consecutive days. The camp must have adequate staff, including a qualified program director with experience in a similar setting. An organized day camp or resident camp for children under 18 must meet specific requirements, and certain organizations are exempt from licensing as a child day care center. An organized day camp or resident camp must issue a written notice of intent to operate, submit an operating plan, and meet specific regulations. Day camps without a fixed location must register with the local public health officer. (4) Install a carbon monoxide detector in buildings with fossil fuel heaters, fireplaces, or attached garages. (5) Store firearms in a locked cabinet when not in use at camp. (6) Obtain and display permits for camp operations. The local public health officer must acknowledge receipt of the operating plan or accreditation verification within 30 business days. A permit to operate will be issued to a day camp or resident camp if the operating plan meets health standards and an inspection confirms compliance. (B) The local public health officer will authorize an organized day camp to operate upon registration if it meets requirements. The officer may inspect the camp and charge a fee for the inspection. Any violations of health and safety standards will be summarized within 30 days. Camps cited for not meeting legal requirements can appeal to the local health department, which must issue a final decision within 30 business days. The local public health officer has the authority to inspect organized camps, issue citations, and investigate complaints of health violations. They may also charge a fee to cover the costs of oversight activities. Section 18897.4 of the Health and Safety Code mandates local health officers to enforce building standards for organized resident camps within their jurisdiction. They can delegate inspection responsibilities to other agencies for compliance. The State Department of Public Health must involve organizations in the field when creating or updating rules for day camps and resident camps. Participating organizations will cover their own costs, and the department will implement this in a cost-effective manner. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution. Local agencies or school districts have the authority to levy charges to cover mandated costs. Reimbursement for other state-mandated costs will be made to local agencies and school districts as determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
