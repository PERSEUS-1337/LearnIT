    "content": "The Act titled \"Consumer and Community Choice in Access Act of 1999\" is also known as the \"Short Title\". The Congress finds that cable operators are upgrading their systems to offer high-speed broadband Internet access, which is significantly faster than traditional phone lines. Some operators require customers to use their affiliated Internet service provider, leading to potential double payments for those who choose not to. Some cable operators require customers to pay twice for Internet access, once to the cable operator's ISP and once to their own ISP. This limits open access to unaffiliated ISPs and creates technological barriers that need to be addressed. Local communities are now faced with the decision of whether to allow cable operators to restrict unaffiliated ISPs from accessing their customers. In Oregon, Portland and Multnomah County have upheld a decision for open access on the cable network, despite concerns that it may delay broadband deployment. Local jurisdictions promoting open access serve as testing grounds for competition in cable Internet services, aiming to prevent a monopoly bottleneck in high-speed Internet access. The bottleneck to high-speed Internet access is a critical public policy issue that needs to be addressed by Congress, the Federal Communications Commission, and local franchising authorities. SEC. 3. NONDISCRIMINATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERCONNECTION TO THE INTERNET. The amendment to Section 624 of the Communications Act of 1934 allows the Commission to require cable operators to offer fair and nondiscriminatory interconnection with the Internet. This includes providing interconnection with any Internet service provider on equivalent terms, regardless of affiliation. The Commission can establish interconnection terms and conditions if a cable operator fails to comply with the obligation. SEC. 4. LEASED ACCESS AMENDMENT. This section amends the Communications Act of 1934 to include high-speed data services seeking channel capacity under certain conditions. SEC. 5. CLARIFICATION OF LIMITATION ON COMMON CARRIER REGULATION. This section clarifies limitations on common carrier regulation. SEC. 5. CLARIFICATION OF LIMITATION ON COMMON CARRIER REGULATION. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to subject telecommunications services provided by cable systems to regulation as common carrier services. SEC. 6. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. States that the Act does not restrict state or franchising authority and does not affect pending civil actions in Federal or State courts."
