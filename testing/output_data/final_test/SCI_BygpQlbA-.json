    "content": "We study optimal control of symmetric linear dynamical systems with unknown dynamics and a hidden state using spectral filtering. This approach formulates control as a convex program, avoiding the need for explicit system identification. An efficient algorithm is provided for finding optimal control with a polynomial sample complexity in relevant parameters. This contrasts with reinforcement learning using deep nets, lacking theoretical support and provable guarantees. Progress can be made by addressing simpler setups. In control theory, addressing simpler setups like linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs can lead to progress without the need for explicit system identification. The complexity of controlling an unknown linear system often results in non-convex optimization problems, making provable algorithms challenging to develop. In this paper, the focus is on developing a provably efficient control algorithm for linear dynamical systems with unknown latent states. The method is based on wave-filtering, a spectral representation technique for symmetric LDSs, and aims to find the optimal control signal in polynomial time with optimal sample complexity. The system converts input signals into output signals incurring a sequence of costs, and the goal is to control unknown dynamical systems with hidden states. The focus is on developing an efficient control algorithm for linear dynamical systems with unknown latent states. The algorithm aims to minimize quadratic output costs by finding the optimal control signal in polynomial time with optimal sample complexity. Previous algorithms for this problem have lacked provable guarantees and may take exponential time in the worst case. The algorithm aims to minimize quadratic output costs by finding the optimal control signal in polynomial time with optimal sample complexity. It combines regression and new variables to learn the -step dynamics efficiently. The algorithm aims to minimize output costs by finding optimal control signals with polynomial complexity. It samples trajectories from a linear dynamical system with Gaussian noise and runs in polynomial time. The field of optimal control for dynamical systems encompasses various disciplines like machine learning and system identification. The Kalman filter is an optimal solution for tracking a dynamical system under Gaussian perturbations. Efficient methods for recovering an unknown dynamical system are limited. The EM algorithm is commonly used for learning parameters of a linear dynamical system, but optimality is not guaranteed. A recent result provides a polynomial time algorithm for system recovery in the single-input-single-output case. Model-free tracking relies on a new algorithm for LDS sequence prediction, using a convex relaxation for tracking without explicit system identification. This method connects to the use of deep neural networks in reinforcement learning. Time-series analysis often uses ARMA models, focusing on the autoregressive form of a time series. The autoregressive form of a time series is key in online learning techniques for identifying models in the presence of noise. The linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problem is fundamental in control theory for minimizing quadratic costs in linear dynamical systems. The LQG controller combines Kalman filtering with a linear-quadratic regulator for optimal control. The text discusses a linear dynamical system with quadratic costs, related to the LQG setup. The main algorithm for control differs from standard LQR by formulating control as a one-shot convex program. Definition of a dynamical system is provided as a mapping from input vectors to output vectors and costs. Linear dynamical system (LDS) is defined by outputs and costs, with hidden states and matrices. The algorithm relies on orthonormal vectors as convolution filters. The wave-filtering matrix \u03a6 is constructed from eigenvectors of the Hankel matrix. The wave-filtering matrix \u03a6 is defined by stacked block matrices, giving a dimension-wise convolution of input time series by filters. Theorem 3.3 guarantees a concise representation of D in the basis of these filters. The main theorem proves a sequence of controls with high probability. The algorithm samples trajectories from the dynamical system and runs in polynomial time. Conditions ensure bounded loss in all directions. Tr(\u03a3) is crucial for the algorithm's performance. The algorithm utilizes the wave-filtering matrix \u03a6 for control robustness to uncertainty in dynamics. The minimization problem is convex and can be solved efficiently using the ellipsoid method. The algorithm uses the wave-filtering matrix \u03a6 for control robustness to uncertainty in dynamics and can be efficiently solved using the ellipsoid method. The proof involves structural results from BID7, showing a linear relationship and the projection of vectors onto a subspace defined by \u03a6. The system can be modified by replacing certain elements to achieve a specific result. The dependence of Theorem 3b is on \u03a6 and , but if = then it is only on \u03a6. The error under controls is bounded using the triangle inequality. The concentration of sums of random variables is used to bound certain terms. To bound the third term in (10), it is shown that concentrates around . By concentration, the third term of FORMULA2 is bounded by . Lemma 3.4 states that for a symmetric LDS D and an approximation D, the cost is bounded using Cauchy-Schwarz. Proof of Lemma 3.2 involves defining and minimizing certain elements. The algorithm presented finds optimal control inputs for a symmetric linear dynamical system with minimal queries and polynomial time complexity. It avoids non-convex optimization by using a new system representation, paving the way for efficient methods in control and reinforcement learning. The VARX(0, ) model is a key concept in time-series analysis, generating responses from inputs using memory parameters and noise vectors. It can be efficiently solved with linear regression when = 0. This model is related to approximating a linear dynamical system with an autoregressive model. The VARX(0, ) model relates to approximating linear dynamical systems with an autoregressive model. Theorem A.1 quantifies this relationship, stating that for a linear dynamical system D with operator norm < 1, there exists a VARX(0, ) model with specific parameters. The VARX(0, ) model serves as an approximation of a linear dynamical system with hidden state decay. Learning this model has linear time and sample complexity, growing with the parameter ."
