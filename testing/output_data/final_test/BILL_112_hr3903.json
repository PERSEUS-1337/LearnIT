    "content": "The \"Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012\" introduces a Fair Share Tax on high-income taxpayers, adding a new part to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This tax aims to ensure that high-income individuals contribute their fair share to the tax system. The \"Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012\" introduces a new tax on high-income taxpayers based on a fraction of their adjusted gross income exceeding a certain dollar amount. The tax determined under this paragraph is the excess of the tentative fair share tax for the taxable year over the sum of the regular tax liability, tax imposed by section 55, and payroll tax for the taxable year, minus the credits allowable under part IV of subchapter A. The tentative fair share tax is 30% of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income minus the modified charitable contribution deduction. The modified deduction is calculated based on the ratio of itemized deductions allowable under section 170 for the taxable year. The modified charitable contribution deduction is determined based on the ratio of itemized deductions allowable under the regular tax for the taxable year. If an individual does not itemize deductions, the deduction is zero. A high-income taxpayer is defined as someone with an adjusted gross income above a certain threshold. The adjusted gross income threshold for high-income taxpayers is $1,000,000, with a 50 percent limit for married individuals filing separately. This amount is subject to inflation adjustments for taxable years beginning after 2013. The adjusted gross income threshold for high-income taxpayers is $1,000,000, with a 50 percent limit for married individuals filing separately, subject to inflation adjustments for taxable years after 2013. Amounts adjusted under subparagraph (A) are rounded to the next lowest multiple of $10,000. Payroll tax for any taxable year is the excess of taxes imposed on the taxpayer under specific sections over the deduction allowable under section 164(f). For estates and trusts, adjusted gross income is computed as described in section 67(e). The tax imposed under section 59B is not considered tax imposed by this chapter for certain purposes, such as determining credits under this chapter or for section 55. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and a clerical amendment is added to the table of parts for subchapter A of chapter 1. The House of Representatives believes in enacting tax reform to eliminate unfair loopholes, simplify the system, and ensure the wealthy pay their fair share. This Act serves as an interim step to cut the deficit and encourage further tax system reform. Effective date for amendments is after December 31, 2012."
