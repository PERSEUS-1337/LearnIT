    "content": "The Act titled \"Palestinian Peace Promotion and Anti-Incitement Act\" emphasizes that the Palestinian Authority needs to fulfill its agreements with Israel to end incitement and promote peace. It also imposes limitations on assistance to the Palestinian Authority. The Act prohibits funds to the Palestinian Authority unless the President certifies it is important for national security. A report must be submitted detailing the waiver justification and fund usage. The Palestinian Authority must have accounting procedures in place to ensure proper fund disbursement, report steps taken against terrorism, and have a single treasury account for all financing. The Secretary of State must certify these conditions before funds are obligated. The Palestinian Authority must meet certain conditions, including ending incitement against the US and Israel and engaging in peace activities with Israel. Incitement is defined as statements or activities against any religion, ethnicity, or nationality, and advocating violence or terrorism. The Palestinian Authority must refrain from endorsing or memorializing individuals or groups involved in terrorism. Peace preparation activities involve Arabic-language communications and education sponsored by the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority must publicly acknowledge Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, endorse peaceful co-existence, display maps showing Israel and Palestine side-by-side, and renounce violence against Israel."
