    "content": "Medicaid is a federal-state program that finances primary and acute care services, long-term services, and supports. States have flexibility in covering mandatory and optional populations and services, leading to variation in eligibility, benefits, and provider payment rates. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and states, with states incurring costs for payments to service providers and administrative activities. Medicaid is a federal-state program that finances primary and acute care services, long-term services, and supports. The federal government reimburses states for a share of these costs through the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). FMAP rates vary by state and are inversely related to per capita income. Medicaid eligibility historically included low-income children, pregnant women, parents of dependent children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. However, since January 1, 2014, states have the option to extend coverage to most non-elderly, nonpregnant adults with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) under the ACA. The ACA (P.L. 111-148) made changes to the Medicaid program, known as the ACA Medicaid expansion. This report outlines the expansion's overview, impact of the Supreme Court decision, coverage details, rules, financing, enrollment, and expenditure estimates. It also discusses state decisions on implementing the expansion and their implications. Medicaid eligibility is limited to certain low-income individuals, not all. Medicaid eligibility is determined by membership in covered groups (e.g., children, pregnant women, etc.) and financial requirements. Federal and state criteria for residency, immigration status, and citizenship must also be met. The Medicaid statute outlines mandatory and optional eligibility groups for coverage, with states having the flexibility to extend coverage through waivers. The ACA expanded Medicaid, impacting enrollment, financing, and state decisions on implementation. Medicaid eligibility varies by state through Section 1115 demonstration waivers, with optional groups and income levels. The ACA allows states to expand Medicaid to 133% of FPL for certain adults. Prior to the ACA, income eligibility for parents was lower than for children and pregnant women. The ACA Medicaid expansion increased Medicaid coverage for low-income children and non-elderly adults. Prior to the ACA, income eligibility for parents was lower than for children and pregnant women. The uninsured rate for low-income, non-elderly adults was 42%, more than twice the national average. The ACA aims to increase access to affordable health insurance and make it more affordable for those already covered. The ACA Medicaid expansion increased coverage for low-income individuals, with an income disregard of 5% of FPL deducted for eligibility. The expansion made Medicaid available to adults without dependent children, parents with dependent children, and adults with disabilities in states that adopted it. The Supreme Court decision in NFIB v. Sebelius made the expansion optional, with an income eligibility threshold effectively at 138% of FPL. The ACA Medicaid expansion rules require states to comply, with the federal government funding most of the cost. The Supreme Court's decision in NFIB deemed the expansion unconstitutional, stating that withholding Medicaid reimbursement to enforce it exceeded Congress's powers. The Supreme Court ruled that states could not be penalized for not implementing the ACA Medicaid expansion, making participation voluntary. States have no deadline to decide on the expansion and can end it at any time. The ACA Medicaid expansion allows coverage for non-elderly adults without dependent children, parents with dependent children, and adults with disabilities. Before the expansion, only a few states provided Medicaid to adults without dependent children, and income eligibility levels were lower. States could cover these adults through waivers or state-funded programs. As of January 2013, eight states had implemented this expansion. The ACA Medicaid expansion allowed coverage for non-elderly adults without dependent children, parents with dependent children, and adults with disabilities. Before the expansion, only a few states provided Medicaid to adults without dependent children. Eight states and the District of Columbia provided full Medicaid coverage to adults without dependent children, with only two states and the District of Columbia covering them up to at least 133% of the Federal Poverty Level. Additionally, 18 states provided Medicaid coverage with limited benefits to adults without dependent children. Most states would see a significant increase in Medicaid coverage for adults without dependent children through the ACA expansion. The federally mandated eligibility threshold for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) varies by state but averages 41% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). States have the option to cover parents with incomes above the 1996 minimum levels, with most states choosing to do so. As of January 2013, some states provided full Medicaid coverage for parents with incomes at or above 133% of FPL, while others provided coverage with limited benefits. The ACA Medicaid expansion would extend coverage to a significant number of parents with dependent children. See Figure A-2 for state-by-state Medicaid income eligibility levels for parents with dependent children as of January 1, 2014. The eligibility pathway for non-elderly, disabled individuals is based on the program rules for the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. States have the option to use Medicaid eligibility criteria for adults with disabilities that are more restrictive than SSI but no more restrictive than those in effect in 1972. In 209(b) states, receipt of SSI does not guarantee Medicaid eligibility. States can also provide Medicaid coverage through other optional pathways like poverty level, medically needy, and special income level. The ACA Medicaid expansion increased income eligibility levels for non-elderly adults with disabilities. States accepting the expansion must follow new coverage rules, including using MAGI counting rules and providing alternative benefit plan coverage. As of January 1, 2014, MAGI counting rules determine Medicaid eligibility for most non-elderly populations, including the ACA Medicaid expansion. MAGI is based on adjusted gross income (AGI) with deductions, tax-exempt interest, and income earned abroad. States compare individual MAGI to income standards, deducting 5%, and provide Medicaid benefits through Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs) for ACA expansion enrollees. ABP coverage under the ACA may be less generous than traditional Medicaid but more generous than private insurance. It may cover fewer benefits but includes requirements like family planning and transportation services. Adults with disabilities may access different coverage through ACA Medicaid expansion eligibility compared to those with Medicaid through the SSI pathway. States must identify medically frail individuals and offer them a choice between ABP and traditional Medicaid benefits. The ACA Medicaid expansion provides different federal Medicaid matching rates for individuals gaining coverage. Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate have been made for certain states, populations, and services, including the \"newly eligible\" FMAP rate for non-elderly adults with family income below 133% of FPL. The ACA Medicaid expansion offers a higher federal matching rate for individuals with family income below 133% of FPL who were not eligible for Medicaid before. States will receive full federal financing for covering these \"newly eligible\" individuals from 2014 to 2016, with the rate gradually decreasing to 90% afterward. The FMAP rates are predetermined regardless of when a state implements the expansion. Prior to the ACA, some states used waivers to provide Medicaid coverage to adults without dependent children and parents with incomes above the threshold for the Section 1931 pathway. These states receive an increased FMAP rate, known as the \"expansion state\" FMAP rate. Expansion states are those that had already implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion by March 23, 2010. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) identified certain states as \"expansion states\" eligible for the FMAP rate if they implement the ACA Medicaid expansion. The FMAP rate is available for individuals in these states who were eligible for Medicaid before March 23, 2010, and fall within the new eligibility group for non-elderly, nonpregnant adults at or below 133% of FPL. The rates vary based on each state's regular FMAP rate. The FMAP rates for \"expansion states\" vary until CY2019, when they will be equal to the \"newly eligible\" FMAP rates. Populations in \"expansion states\" meeting the criteria for the \"newly eligible\" FMAP rate will receive it, including those who previously had limited Medicaid benefits. The ACA Medicaid expansion includes an FMAP rate increase of 2.2 percentage points for certain \"expansion states\" in 2014 and 2015. Vermont is the only state confirmed to meet the criteria for this increase. The ACA Medicaid expansion includes an FMAP rate increase for certain \"expansion states,\" expected to significantly increase Medicaid enrollment and federal expenditures. The CBO estimates a 13 million increase in Medicaid and CHIP enrollment by FY2024, mainly due to the ACA expansion. Other provisions also impact enrollment, such as Medicaid eligibility expansion for foster care children and children ages six to 18. Figure 2 shows year-by-year estimates of ACA effects on enrollment. The ACA insurance coverage provisions are expected to increase Medicaid and CHIP enrollment for non-elderly individuals by more than 25% in each year after FY2015. The \"woodwork\" effect will lead to an increase in Medicaid enrollment nationwide, as uninsured individuals eligible for Medicaid enroll due to increased media attention and outreach efforts associated with the ACA. An estimated 7.3 million to 9.0 million uninsured individuals were eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid prior to the expansion. Actual enrollment numbers for the ACA Medicaid expansion are not currently available. The CMS has been reporting monthly Medicaid and CHIP enrollment numbers since October 2013, but the data does not break out the enrollment for the ACA Medicaid expansion. The preliminary July 2014 data is the first month for which all states reported enrollment data, showing approximately 9.2 million additional individuals enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP in September 2014 compared to the baseline period. The CMS reported a 16% increase in Medicaid and CHIP enrollment in 2014 compared to the baseline period. States that implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion saw a 23% increase, while states that did not reported a 6% increase. CMS is working on reports to specify the number of newly eligible individuals due to the expansion. The federal budgetary effect of ACA insurance coverage provisions on Medicaid and CHIP outlays is mainly due to the Medicaid expansion. The ACA's Medicaid and CHIP insurance coverage provisions will increase federal outlays by almost 23% from FY2015 through FY2024. The federal government will cover 94% of the costs, totaling $792 billion, while states' costs are estimated at $46 billion. The impact of the ACA Medicaid expansion varies by state due to differences in income eligibility levels and demographics. The ACA's Medicaid expansion went into effect on January 1, 2014, with 24 states and the District of Columbia participating. Michigan and New Hampshire implemented the expansion in 2014, while Pennsylvania received approval for implementation in 2015. Some states are still debating the expansion. See Table B-1 for state estimates and Figure 4 for a map of expansion decisions as of December 2014. The ACA Medicaid expansion is currently being debated in states. States that have implemented the expansion tend to have low rates of uninsured individuals and provide Medicaid coverage to more non-elderly adults. States that have not implemented the expansion have higher rates of uninsured individuals. The status of the expansion in states remains uncertain as decisions can be made to implement or discontinue it at any time. States typically make decisions regarding the expansion during legislative sessions in the first half of the year. In response to a budget survey, Medicaid officials in several states noted that the ACA Medicaid expansion would be debated during their state's next legislative session. Even states that have already implemented the expansion could debate the issue. States have chosen not to implement the ACA Medicaid expansion for various reasons, including because they view the expansion as unaffordable to the state and the Medicaid program as \"broken.\" The ACA Medicaid expansion became more politically feasible for some states with CMS's approval of Arkansas's proposal to implement the expansion using the \"private option,\" which provides premium assistance for Medicaid enrollees to purchase private health insurance. Some states are implementing the ACA Medicaid expansion through alternative models like premium assistance and health savings accounts. Four states have received approval for waivers to implement their expansions. Iowa, Michigan, and Pennsylvania have been approved to charge premiums above Medicaid limits, with cost-sharing requirements tied to healthy behaviors. Iowa and Pennsylvania also received waivers from certain Medicaid rules. The decision for a state to opt out of the ACA Medicaid expansion could have implications for low-income individuals, large employers with low wage workers, and hospitals. It is expected to increase the number of individuals receiving premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies through health insurance exchanges, creating a coverage gap for some. Additionally, opting out may lead to more ACA employer penalties and lower Medicaid DSH reduction for that state. The ACA provides premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies for individuals with household incomes between 100% and 400% of the Federal Poverty Level who do not have access to minimum essential coverage. This could help uninsured individuals with incomes between 100% and 133% of FPL in states not expanding Medicaid to purchase insurance through health insurance exchanges. However, those with incomes under 100% of FPL in non-expansion states may remain uninsured as they are not eligible for these benefits. After the Supreme Court decision, some states considered a partial ACA Medicaid expansion for uninsured individuals not eligible for premium tax credits. Legal permanent residents within their first five years in the country can receive premium tax credits with incomes up to 400% of FPL. CMS informed states that partial expansion would not receive 100% federal funding for 2014-2016. The ACA was intended to provide health coverage for low-income individuals through Medicaid expansion and premium tax credits. However, the Supreme Court's decision made Medicaid expansion optional for states, creating a coverage gap for nearly 5 million uninsured adults. CMS allowed states to implement partial expansion with regular federal matching rates until 2016, after which enhanced federal matching rates could be considered through Section 1115 Medicaid demonstrations. The ACA created coverage gaps for 5 million uninsured adults due to the optional Medicaid expansion by states. Large employers in states without the expansion may face penalties under the ACA. Individuals not eligible for Medicaid may qualify for premium tax credits through an exchange. In states without the ACA Medicaid expansion, large employers with low-income workers may face penalties under the ACA as more low-income workers could qualify for premium tax credits. Medicaid requires states to make Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments to hospitals treating low-income patients who are often uninsured or Medicaid enrollees. This is to address the financial challenges faced by these hospitals. The ACA included provisions for reducing Medicaid DSH allotments to states, regardless of Medicaid expansion. Hospitals in non-expansion states are concerned about the impact on uncompensated care. Hospitals in non-expansion states are urging states to implement the ACA Medicaid expansion to reduce uncompensated care. Medicaid DSH payments to hospitals may decrease if the expansion is not adopted. Medicaid coverage under the expansion includes adults without dependent children, parents with dependent children, and adults with disabilities. Prior to the ACA Medicaid expansion, only a few states provided coverage to adults without dependent children, with income eligibility levels significantly lower than 133% of FPL. Figures A-1, A-2, and A-3 show state-by-state Medicaid income eligibility levels and coverage gaps for non-elderly adults. States that have not implemented the expansion have coverage gaps, while those that have do not. Coverage for adults without dependent children varies among states that have implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion. Most states provide Medicaid eligibility up to 133% of FPL, with some exceptions like the District of Columbia and Minnesota offering higher income eligibility levels. States that have not expanded Medicaid, except for Wisconsin, do not provide coverage for this population. Wisconsin offers coverage up to 95% of FPL. All states provide Medicaid coverage for parents with dependent children. States provide Medicaid coverage for parents with dependent children through Section 1931 coverage, which includes traditional Medicaid coverage for parents with incomes below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level. Some states also cover parents with incomes above this level under the ACA Medicaid expansion rules. States that have not implemented the Medicaid expansion have coverage gaps for parents with dependent children between the upper bound of their Section 1931 coverage and 100% of the Federal Poverty Level. Maine and Wisconsin provide Medicaid coverage to parents with dependent children up to 100% and 95% of the FPL, respectively. All states provide Medicaid coverage to adults with disabilities through mandatory Medicaid coverage for recipients of SSI or through optional eligibility pathways. In all states, Medicaid income eligibility levels for adults with disabilities are below 100% of FPL. States that have not implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion have coverage gaps for these adults. The potential impact of the expansion varies significantly from state to state. The ACA Medicaid expansion will have varying impacts on state expenditures and enrollment. States with existing Medicaid coverage may save money, while those with the largest coverage gains may see increased expenditures. Medicaid enrollment will increase at different rates due to varying income eligibility levels. A state-by-state analysis shows that if all states implement the expansion, Medicaid expenditures for 2022 would be $122.8 billion. If all states choose to implement the ACA Medicaid expansion, Medicaid expenditures for 2022 would increase by $122.8 billion, with federal funds accounting for $117.4 billion and state funds for $5.4 billion. Additionally, Medicaid enrollment in 2022 would be 15.5 million higher compared to if no states implemented the expansion."
