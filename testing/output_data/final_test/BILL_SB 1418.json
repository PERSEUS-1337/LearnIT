    "title": "SB 1418",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature expanded Medi-Cal eligibility for children in California regardless of immigration status to ensure access to health care coverage. It is intended to increase opportunities for adults to enroll in comprehensive health care coverage. Individuals 19 years or older who meet Medi-Cal eligibility requirements except for immigration status may enroll for full-scope benefits under a new section added to the Welfare and Institutions Code. Individuals 19 years or older who meet Medi-Cal eligibility requirements except for immigration status may enroll for full-scope benefits under a new section added to the Welfare and Institutions Code. When a county determines eligibility for such individuals, funding availability will determine if they receive full-scope or limited scope Medi-Cal benefits. Enrollees must join Medi-Cal managed care health plans as required. An individual eligible for coverage under subdivision (a) must pay copayments and premiums like other Medi-Cal recipients. Benefits will be funded with state-only funds if federal financial participation is unavailable. Full-scope Medi-Cal benefits for individuals 19 years and older are not guaranteed entitlements. The department has the authority to determine eligibility, enrollment limits, and waiting list processes to manage program expenditures within available funds. The department will implement this section through various instructions until regulations are adopted, with a deadline of July 1, 2018. Status reports will be provided to the Legislature semiannually starting July 1, 2016, until regulations are in place. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement for costs mandated by the state. This act is an urgency statute to expand health care coverage in California. Section 1246.5 of the Business and Professions Code is repealed and a new section is added. Section 1246.5 of the Business and Professions Code allows individuals to request and receive laboratory tests without a doctor's order. Test results must be provided to the individual, who is responsible for consulting with their healthcare provider for interpretation. A healing arts licensee is not required to review or act on a laboratory test result if they did not order the test. They are not liable for not reviewing results they did not order. This section does not mandate coverage of laboratory tests by health care plans. Section 1288 of the Business and Professions Code requires clear identification on laboratory test result reports. The act does not require reimbursement as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions, as defined by the Government Code and California Constitution."
