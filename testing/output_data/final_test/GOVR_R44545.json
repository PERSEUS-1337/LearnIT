    "content": "The World Health Organization reported that 60 countries had Zika transmission, with 46 being new cases. Zika causes microcephaly and is linked to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Latin America and the Caribbean are most affected. New cases in the region are decreasing, but an increase is expected in the Caribbean. The U.S. may see more travel-related cases and local transmission. Policymakers are concerned about Zika spreading in the U.S. The Zika virus has spread to the continental United States, with concerns about visitors contracting it at the Olympics in Brazil. The WHO declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in 2016. President Obama requested $1.9 billion for emergency response, which is pending in the Senate. Congress is considering funding and oversight for U.S. responses in Latin America and the Caribbean. Members may consider the balance between U.S. bilateral and multilateral Zika responses, including increased support for the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). U.S. health programs in Latin America, funded by the State Department and USAID, have focused on health programs. Congress may evaluate reproductive health and family planning funding in countries with local transmission of Zika. Congress may reexamine the apportionment of global health funding for Latin America, particularly focusing on reproductive health and family planning. Less than 5% of U.S. global health funds are allocated to the region, with the majority going towards HIV/AIDS programs. Investments in the region may need to be increased to address emerging health concerns and inequities. Additionally, the United States has committed to supporting pandemic preparedness in 30 countries, including Haiti and Peru, as well as the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Investments in research and development of neglected diseases, including addressing threats from new and reemerging diseases like dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Congress may consider funding levels for global health security programs and pandemic preparedness activities, as well as evaluating options for effective vector control tools. The report provides background information on the Zika virus, discusses challenges faced in controlling the outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean, and analyzes the U.S. Zika response. Zika was first discovered in Uganda in 1947 and caused mild symptoms until a large outbreak in Micronesia in 2007. Scientists are studying the virus's virulence and global spread. The Zika virus outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean has been linked to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly. WHO reported over 1,600 cases of Zika-related microcephaly worldwide, mostly in Brazil. Urbanization in the region has led to densely populated areas with poor sanitation, facilitating mosquito breeding. The Zika virus outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean has been linked to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly, with over 1,600 cases reported worldwide. Urbanization in the region has led to densely populated areas with poor sanitation, facilitating mosquito breeding. Lack of proper plumbing and poor sanitation also contribute to mosquito breeding, especially Aedes mosquitoes that thrive in standing water. The 2015-2016 El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern has exacerbated health threats in the region, with warm water in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean leading to droughts in some areas and flooding in others, creating favorable conditions for mosquito proliferation. Studies have linked climate change to increased health threats. Climate change has been linked to greater health threats like malaria, chikungunya, and dengue fever. Aedes mosquitoes have spread these diseases across the Americas, with Zika cases reported in many countries. Brazil and Colombia have recorded high numbers of suspected and confirmed Zika cases. Efforts to count Zika cases are complicated by the fact that 75% of infected individuals do not show symptoms. Efforts to count Zika cases are complicated by key factors: 75% of infected individuals do not show symptoms, and the virus is detectable for less than seven days in blood. As of June 16, 2016, all Zika cases in the continental United States were acquired abroad or sexually transmitted. Local transmission by mosquito has occurred in the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico. CDC and health experts are preparing for locally acquired Zika cases in the continental United States this summer, requiring U.S.-Latin American cooperation for surveillance, research, and response over several years. The capacity to address Zika cases varies widely across Latin America and the Caribbean, with weaknesses in health system capacity highlighted in several countries. Haiti lacks a functioning hospital system, Venezuela struggles to provide basic maternal and child health care, and assessments have shown weaknesses in core capacities in various countries. Experts are concerned that many countries are less equipped than Brazil and Colombia in responding to epidemiological emergencies like Zika. Inadequate laboratory and diagnostic capacity, poor access to sexual education and contraception, resistance to national mosquito control efforts, and gang violence have hindered Zika response in some Latin American and Caribbean countries. Health systems in the region may struggle to treat children with severe birth defects like microcephaly, as most countries lack the capacity and do not permit abortion. Lifetime care for a child with microcephaly can be costly, with the United States estimating up to $10 million for such care. Brazil has faced challenges in providing care for affected children. Brazil has been at the center of the Zika outbreak, with a significant increase in microcephaly cases. The country declared a Public Health Emergency of National Importance due to the rise in infants born with microcephaly. The cost of caring for these infants can be expensive, with limited access to hospitals for families living far away. Abortion is not permissible for microcephaly diagnoses in Brazil. Brazil's Ministry of Health issued guidelines for therapy for children with microcephaly, certifying hospitals for their care. A law provides a stipend to families caring for these children, many led by single mothers. Concerns arise about illegal abortions due to the increase in microcephaly diagnoses. The government launched a National Plan to Combat Aedes Mosquito and Microcephaly, focusing on research, prevention, and health assistance for pregnant women and children. Brazil is taking extensive control efforts to combat Zika, focusing on research, prevention, and health assistance for pregnant women and children. The government has deployed troops and health agents to educate the population and eliminate mosquito breeding grounds, with a particular focus on Rio de Janeiro for the upcoming Summer Olympic Games. Concerns exist about the adequacy of efforts in low-income areas despite Brazil's advanced public health system. Reports indicate disparities in prenatal care quality and child mortality rates between poor north and northeast regions, where Zika cases are concentrated, and wealthier south in Brazil. Fiscal challenges and political instability have hindered Zika responses. Colombia has the second-most reported Zika cases in the Western Hemisphere, with 82,935 suspected cases and an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 people may contract the disease by the end of 2016. Colombia's public health system is relatively sophisticated. Colombia's public health system is sophisticated, spending over $15 million annually on combating contagious pathogens. The Ministry of Health issued a Zika virus preparedness plan in 2016, focusing on surveillance, training health personnel, coordinating awareness activities, and improving healthcare services. The Minister of Health raised awareness about Zika in main cities to garner support from local officials. The Ministry of Health in Colombia released policy recommendations to prevent Zika transmission, advised contraceptive use in affected areas, and allocated $1.4 million for supplies. Experts predict a potential increase in microcephaly cases due to the Zika outbreak, with around 300 cases expected between May and September 2016. Abortion is legal under certain circumstances in Colombia, and some pregnant women may choose to abort after a microcephaly diagnosis. The government is collaborating with the U.S. CDC to monitor and treat Zika-infected women. In 2015, Brazil saw a rise in microcephaly cases linked to Zika. WHO declared Zika a PHEIC in February 2016 due to birth malformations, potential international spread, lack of immunity, and absence of vaccines. In February 2016, WHO declared Zika a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), prompting a coordinated global response. A Strategic Response Framework was released focusing on disease surveillance, laboratory capacity, mosquito control, care for infected persons, and priority research areas. Donors were asked to provide $25 million to WHO and PAHO for response coordination and implementation in the Americas, with additional funds requested for partner organizations like UNICEF. In May 2016, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon established a U.N. Zika Response Multi-Partner Trust Fund to support unfunded priorities outlined in the WHO strategic framework. Donors provided over $4 million (16%) to the WHO/PAHO portion of the request, with an additional $3.8 million in emergency support released by WHO for the Zika response. A revised $122 million Zika Strategic Response Plan was issued by WHO on June 16, 2016, to guide international efforts from July 2016 through December 2017, focusing on detection, prevention, care, support, and research on Zika and related complications. The plan prioritizes support for women of childbearing age and their partners in Zika-affected communities, urging investments in counseling, reproductive health services, abortions (where legal), and postnatal care. PAHO has been collaborating with various organizations to fill knowledge gaps about Zika, develop diagnostic tests, and work towards creating a vaccine. The World Bank, PAHO, and the IDB are collaborating with various organizations to address Zika outbreak in Latin America. The World Bank has scaled back health programs in the region but continues to support projects in Argentina, Brazil, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Panama. They are also analyzing the economic impact of Zika on affected countries, estimating costs to be $3.5 billion. The estimated cost of the Zika outbreak in Latin America is $3.5 billion, which could have a greater impact on Caribbean countries dependent on tourism. The World Bank has allocated $150 million for assistance, with funding available through restructuring existing projects or including Zika-related activities in new projects. Nine Latin American countries qualify for International Development Association aid, accessing a \"crisis response\" window for new money. Guyana requested $5 million, and El Salvador allocated $4 million for Zika response. The IDB has an active portfolio of loans and grants for health programs in Latin America totaling roughly $2.7 billion. Most programs focus on health system strengthening for maternal and child health care and noncommunicable diseases. Requests for funding have been made by various countries in the region. The IDB is working with four South American countries to improve compliance with International Health Regulations and assist in planning for health emergencies. In response to the Zika outbreak, the IDB has reoriented $19 million of its health financing to address Zika, focusing on family planning, training primary care workers, and distributing supplies to prevent mosquito bites. They are also supporting communication campaigns, surveillance capacity, and vector control efforts. Additionally, the IDB has collaborated with New York University on a crowdsourcing project for global health partnerships. In February 2016, President Barack Obama requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding to address the Zika outbreak, with a significant portion allocated to the Department of Health and Human Services. The Administration also reprogrammed $589 million in unspent Ebola funds to support Zika response efforts, including $215 million for short-term initiatives in Latin America. USAID transferred $78 million to CDC for Zika activities in the region. USAID transferred $78 million to CDC for Zika activities in the region, with the largest components being for vector control programs and a grand challenge for innovative responses. The funds will support surveillance, epidemiology, and public health studies in Central America and the Caribbean. Unlike the supplemental request, the reprogrammed funds will be implemented with existing staff and resources. In mid-May 2016, both the House and the Senate passed supplemental appropriations measures for Zika response. The House bill would provide $622.1 million in Zika funding and rescind an equal amount of budget authority. The Senate measure would provide $1.1 billion in Zika response funding without rescissions. On June 23, 2016, the House agreed to a conference agreement that would provide $1.1 billion for Zika response, including $175.1 million for State Department and USAID activities. On June 28, 2016, the Senate voted not to invoke cloture on the conference agreement. Congress is considering responses to the Zika outbreak, including discussions on U.S. global health investments in Latin America and the Caribbean. The outbreak may prompt debates on U.S. support for global pandemic preparedness and research for diagnostics, treatments, and prevention. Since the start of the Obama Administration, U.S. bilateral and regional health assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean has decreased by 34%. In contrast, U.S. contributions to PAHO have increased, now representing 37% of the organization's annual budget. Despite this, PAHO struggles to fund missions that bring experts to the region, which are crucial for training health workers and vector control. The U.S. government provides annual contributions to WHO, UNICEF, the World Bank, and the IDB for Zika responses in the region. WHO and PAHO have launched a revised plan to support countries in their response to the Zika outbreak through 2017, with $4 million received out of an estimated $122 million needed. Congress may discuss the appropriate mix of health investments in the region. Congress may discuss the appropriate mix of funds for multilateral Zika responses in the region. Some argue for increased funds to multilateral organizations, while others are concerned about controlling how the contributions are spent. Current U.S. policy in Latin America focuses on promoting economic and social opportunity, citizen safety, democratic institutions, and clean energy. USAID and the State Department lead foreign assistance programs in the region, with State Department assistance related to rule of law and security, and USAID focusing on poverty. USAID and State Department assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean has been declining since FY2011, following the release of the 2010 President's Policy Directive on Global Development. The directive aimed to elevate development as a core pillar of American foreign policy but also directed agencies to be more selective in their work. USAID conducted a review of its programs and found that many countries in the region had achieved significant progress and could sustain it without further assistance. Health assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean region has gradually decreased from $445.6 million in FY2010 to an estimated $231.3 million in FY2016, with USAID focusing on maternal and child health, reproductive health, and family planning in Guatemala and Haiti. Other countries in the region no longer receive such programs. Policymakers are urged to consider increasing health funding as inadequate access to health services can worsen poverty and inequality. The U.N. Development Program recommends addressing exclusion experienced by marginalized populations in the region. In Central America, USAID and other donors have helped improve primary health care services, leading to a decline in maternal and infant mortality rates, as well as fertility rates. Despite progress, USAID's global health engagement in the region has been decreasing steadily. In FY2009, USAID global health programs in Latin America operated in 14 countries, focusing on maternal and child health and reproductive health. By FY2016, programs were only in five countries, with a shift towards HIV/AIDS. Maternal and child health programs decreased from 23% to 8%, and family planning programs decreased from 13% to 7%. Health ministers in some countries advised women to delay pregnancy due to Zika, highlighting limited access to contraception and domestic violence issues. Affordable and reliable contraception is limited in Latin America, leading to unplanned pregnancies, especially among adolescents in poor communities. Health experts, including WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, have called for support for reproductive health services in the region. Some groups advocate for legalizing abortion for severe microcephaly cases, while others oppose it and suggest investing in effective treatments. The WHO/PAHO Zika Strategic Response Plan emphasizes the importance of reproductive health counseling and care for pregnant women affected by Zika and related birth defects. In 2016, Pope Francis suggested that birth control may be a \"lesser evil\" than allowing babies to be born with microcephaly, while still opposing abortion. Various infectious diseases like SARS, Avian Influenza, Ebola, and Zika have caused global outbreaks in recent years. The Global Health Security Agenda was launched in 2014 to improve health regulations implementation, especially in resource-poor countries. The International Health Regulations (2005) aim to strengthen global responses to public health events with international impact, highlighting weaknesses in Latin American countries' pandemic preparedness. PAHO identified only six countries prepared for a pandemic in 2012. The United States has committed to supporting 30 countries through GHSA, including Haiti and Peru. Congress allocated $597 million to CDC for GHSA without specifying fund usage. Policymakers may consider expanding U.S. support in light of growing disease threats from Aedes mosquitoes in the Western Hemisphere. In the Western Hemisphere, policymakers may expand U.S. support for GHSA implementation in Latin America. Congress needs to assess if current funding for pandemic preparedness is adequate, with annual appropriations of $72.5 million to USAID and $58 million to CDC since FY2014. The Administration is seeking $72.5 million for USAID and $65.2 million for CDC in FY2017 for global health security programs. Recent disease outbreaks like dengue, chikungunya, and Zika have spread from Latin America to the U.S., highlighting the need for vaccines, treatment, and vector control measures. The WHO and health experts are calling for increased investments in research and development for neglected tropical diseases like dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. A consortium estimates that global investments in health research for neglected diseases need to double from $3 billion in 2014 to $6 billion by 2020. The United States is a major contributor, providing 70% of public investment and 45% of global investment in global health research and development. US funding supports research for 26 of the 30 most neglected diseases and more than half of global health products in development. In 2016, Congress enacted P.L. 114-146 to add Zika virus to the FDA Priority Review Voucher Program, allowing fast-tracking of products through FDA regulatory process. U.S. government agencies are supporting development of Zika vaccines and treatments, with DOD conducting preclinical research on a vaccine candidate. BARDA has received proposals for new Zika vaccines. BARDA, NIH, and DOD are collaborating to develop a Zika vaccine at DOD's Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Health experts emphasize the need for research on Zika treatment, prevention, and vector control measures. WHO Director-General Chan criticizes past failures in mosquito control, leading to insecticide resistance and increased Aedes populations. The growth of Aedes populations in the Western Hemisphere has led to calls for increased U.S. investments in vector control. Brazil has approved the use of genetically modified mosquitoes for control programs, with the FDA considering trials in the U.S. The Zika budget request includes $100 million for vaccine development, diagnostics, and vector control. Uncertainty surrounds the future of Zika funding due to controversial measures in the conference report. The U.S. is reprogramming funds to support efforts in Latin America and the Caribbean to address the Zika outbreak. The size and scope of U.S.-funded initiatives are uncertain."
