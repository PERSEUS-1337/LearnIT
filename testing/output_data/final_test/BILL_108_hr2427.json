The Congress finds that Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs compared to other countries, despite being the largest market for pharmaceuticals. Importing drugs can provide affordable options and ensure safety for consumers. American seniors are projected to spend $1.8 trillion on pharmaceuticals in the next decade, and opening pharmaceutical markets could save consumers $635 billion annually. The purposes of this Act include providing immediate relief from high pharmaceutical costs, reversing market economics, allowing importation of FDA-approved drugs, and requiring counterfeit-resistant packaging for imported prescription drugs. Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include pharmacists, wholesalers, and qualifying individuals. Covered products imported must comply with specific sections of the Act.

The amendments to Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act focus on ensuring the public is protected from counterfeit and violative products being imported. The Secretary is required to conduct a study on imports permitted under subsection (a) to evaluate importer compliance with regulations and identify misbranded or adulterated shipments. The amendments to Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act aim to protect the public from counterfeit and violative imports. The Secretary must study importer compliance with regulations and identify misbranded or adulterated shipments within 18 months of the Pharmaceutical Market Access Act of 2003. The amendments to Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act define a 'qualifying individual' as someone who is not a pharmacist or a wholesaler, and remove subsections (l) and (m). SEC. 5 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires drugs to have packaging with counterfeit-resistant technologies to prevent counterfeiting. The Secretary must mandate drug packaging to include overt optically variable counterfeit-resistant technologies or equivalent secure technologies. These technologies must be visible to the naked eye, similar to those used for securing US currency, and easily identifiable without additional devices. Manufacturers must ensure drugs are produced in a secure environment and incorporate covert security features. Packaging of drugs should include multiple security elements like blister packs, labels, seals, bottles, and boxes. Shipments must have labels on the container with specified technologies. The shipping container must have labels with specified technologies for officials to determine authenticity. Chain of custody procedures apply to these labels, including auditing and database access for verification by governmental agencies. The House of Representatives passed the legislation on July 25, 2003, as attested by Clerk Jeff Trandahl."
