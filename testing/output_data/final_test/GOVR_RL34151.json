    "content": "Medicare is the health insurance program for the aged, disabled, and those with End Stage Renal Disease. Part A covers hospital, post-hospital, and hospice services, while Part B covers physician, laboratory, outpatient hospital services, and durable medical equipment. Beneficiaries can choose traditional fee-for-service Medicare or opt for a Medicare private plan under Part C (Medicare Advantage) to receive all required benefits except hospice services. Part D provides prescription drug coverage through stand-alone drug plans. Medicare has offered beneficiaries enrollment in private plans as an alternative to traditional fee-for-service since the 1970s. Congress has legislated an increasing number of private plan options for Medicare over the years, including the creation of Medicare Advantage (MA) in 2003. The Medicare Advantage program, established in 2003, was expanded with new private plan options such as regional preferred provider organizations. Modifications were made in 2005 and 2006. Congressional focus has shifted to PFFS plans due to rising enrollment and higher payments compared to other MA plans and FFS Medicare. In 2006, payments to PFFS plans were 119% of FFS expenditures, higher than payments to all MA plans (112%) and HMOs (110%). Complaints about aggressive marketing practices led to a suspension of marketing by seven health care organizations representing 90% of the non-group PFFS market. PFFS plans face different requirements than other Medicare private plans. PFFS plans have different statutory and administrative requirements compared to other Medicare private plans, particularly in areas such as access, quality, plan premiums, Medicare prescription drug benefits, and balance billing. There are concerns about whether beneficiaries understand these differences and how they impact spending, provider access, and benefit adequacy. This report focuses on comparing PFFS plans with local HMOs and regional PPOs, discussing enrollment, plan characteristics, and current issues. The appendix provides a comparison of major statutory differences between these plan types. Enrollment in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans varies by plan type and state. PFFS enrollment saw a significant increase from 2003 to 2007, with over 4,000% growth. Some states have low PFFS enrollment rates, while others have rates over 90%. Enrollment in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans varies by plan type and state. PFFS enrollment jumped to 1.5 million, an increase of over 4,000% in three years. Local HMOs, regional PPOs, and PFFS plans have differences that may impact enrollment, benefits, and payment. Local HMOs are public or private entities with contracts to provide health benefits mainly through their network. Regional PPO and PFFS plans in Medicare Advantage must meet specific requirements, including offering qualified Part D prescription drug coverage. Regional PPOs must cover an entire region and have unified deductibles and out-of-pocket expense caps. PFFS plans must reimburse providers on a fee-for-service basis without financial risk. PFFS plans in Medicare Advantage operate on a fee-for-service basis without financial risk, cannot vary rates based on provider utilization, and do not restrict provider selection. Enrollees are not limited to a network of providers, and PFFS plans are not required to offer prescription drug coverage. Unlike other MA plans, PFFS plans resemble traditional fee-for-service Medicare more closely. PFFS plans in Medicare Advantage offer enrollees flexibility in choosing providers without network restrictions or the need for referrals. Unlike HMOs, PFFS plans allow beneficiaries to see specialists without prior authorization and receive services from providers outside their service area. Regional PPOs offer a middle ground with in or out-of-network coverage options. Regional PPOs in Medicare Advantage offer members the choice of in or out-of-network coverage, with cost savings for in-network providers. These plans have low enrollment but are included in the analysis due to unique requirements and exceptions to network rules. Similar to PFFS plans, regional PPOs provide access to managed care in underserved areas. The appendix compares local HMOs, regional PPOs, and PFFS plans in terms of Medicare Advantage regulations and benefits. Enrollees in a PFFS plan have the flexibility to receive covered services from any Medicare eligible provider who accepts the plan's payment terms. The plan is not required to have a provider network but must meet access requirements by ensuring providers are willing to accept the plan's fee schedule. This can be achieved by establishing payment rates equal to traditional fee-for-service Medicare or by having contracts with a sufficient number of providers. Most PFFS plans ensure access by paying providers at Medicare rates and use deemed contracting providers. Deemed providers know the plan's terms and conditions and automatically become deemed providers when a PFFS enrollee notifies them. Non-contracting providers may arise in emergency situations. Non-contracting providers in Medicare Advantage plans receive the same payment as traditional Medicare. HMOs require provider networks for care coverage, while regional PPOs have less restrictive networks. Plans can use alternative methods to meet access requirements with CMS approval. Medicare Advantage health plans, excluding PFFS plans and MSAs, must have a quality improvement program. This program involves collecting, analyzing, and reporting data to measure health outcomes. Plans are required to design chronic care improvement programs, conduct quality improvement projects, and encourage provider participation in quality initiatives. CMS mandates annual assessment of program impact and effectiveness, with corrective action for any identified issues. Performance measures from NCQA's HEDIS, CAHPS, and HOS are collected and reported by MA plans. CMS uses data from the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (HOS) to develop report cards for beneficiaries to choose health plans. PFFS plans are encouraged to report HEDIS performance measures, and those that do not will not be included in the report cards. While PFFS plans must submit cost estimates for Medicare-covered benefits, CMS does not review these bids. Plans must demonstrate that the actuarial value of cost-sharing does not exceed the value of cost-sharing under Medicare. PFFS plans have the flexibility to set their own premiums without approval from the Secretary. While they must provide additional benefits if their bid for parts A and B benefits is lower than the benchmark amount, they are not required to offer part D prescription drug coverage. Premiums that are too high may deter enrollees from joining the plan. PFFS plans do not have to offer part D prescription drug coverage. Medicare beneficiaries in PFFS plans without drug coverage can enroll in a stand-alone Prescription Drug Plan. Providers in PFFS plans can bill up to 15% above the fee schedule. PFFS plans inform beneficiaries of balance billing amounts and hospitals must give advance notice of substantial charges. Payments to PFFS plans are higher than other MA plans, averaging 119% of expected FFS expenditures in 2006. PFFS plans operate in areas with historically higher Medicare payments, known as floor counties. PFFS plans have an advantage in floor counties, rural areas with high Medicare payments, as they are exempt from network requirements and face little competition. This allows them to offer coverage where local HMOs and regional PPOs struggle to establish provider networks due to limited resources and small populations. PFFS plans offer flexibility to Medicare beneficiaries by allowing them to visit any provider who accepts the plan's payment terms. However, the lack of written agreements may lead to access barriers in certain areas. These plans do not require provider networks but must pay all providers of a certain type the same amount, which can vary from traditional Medicare rates. PFFS plans offer flexibility to Medicare beneficiaries by allowing them to visit any provider who accepts the plan's payment terms. Providers who are unaware of a patient's PFFS enrollment may receive the Medicare rate. PFFS plans may be the only managed care option in some areas, attracting new beneficiaries with extra benefits and reduced cost sharing compared to traditional Medicare. The CMS reported that PFFS plans offer additional benefits averaging $756 per year for enrollees in 2007, compared to $1,032 for all MA plans. The availability of PFFS plans, especially in rural areas, has led to increased marketing and enrollment. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 allowed traditional Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in a PFFS plan or non-drug MA plan in 2007 and 2008. The availability of PFFS plans, especially in rural areas, has led to increased marketing and enrollment. PFFS plans pay medical providers on a fee-for-service basis and some growth may be due to questionable marketing practices. In response to concerns, CMS announced that seven health insurance plans offering PFFS options have agreed to suspend marketing until meeting CMS criteria. Providers under PFFS plans receive monthly payments for each enrollee regardless of service use, promoting efficient care. Unlike coordinated care plans, providers have flexibility to choose PFFS patients and services. PFFS plans operate under different rules, potentially confusing providers. Providers under PFFS plans must familiarize themselves with the plan's payment terms before treating patients. Compliance with the plan's terms is required post-service, which may differ from traditional Medicare. Despite potential disadvantages, PFFS plans offer advantages to beneficiaries, allowing them to choose any authorized provider. Enrollees in a PFFS plan have the flexibility to choose any authorized provider who accepts the plan's terms. Providers are compensated at least the same as traditional Medicare, ensuring a comparable choice of providers for PFFS plan enrollees. Enrollees in PFFS plans have the flexibility to choose any authorized provider who accepts the plan's terms, with benefits like a \"catastrophic cap\" on out-of-pocket spending and lower cost-sharing. They do not need prior authorization to see a specialist, offering more freedom of choice. However, PFFS plans may have limitations if providers choose not to serve enrollees, similar to network restrictions in other MA options. Enrollees in PFFS plans have the flexibility to choose any authorized provider who accepts the plan's terms. Providers can choose to participate on a service-by-service basis, leading to potential limitations in access to care. In contrast, local HMOs and Regional PPOs require providers to participate for the duration of their contract, ensuring consistent access to the same providers. Enrollment in Medicare Advantage PFFS plans is low, but increasing could raise Medicare costs. A CBO analysis suggests reducing payments to PFFS plans could save Medicare billions, but may impact plan availability for beneficiaries. Some beneficiaries rely on PFFS plans for coverage and reducing payments could result in plans leaving the MA program, potentially leaving some beneficiaries without access to any MA plan. Some Medicare beneficiaries may lose access to MA plans, especially in states like Alaska, Utah, Maine, Idaho, and New Hampshire where PFFS plans are the only MA option. PFFS plans were created to offer choice of providers, but providers are not required to accept PFFS beneficiaries, leading to difficulties in finding willing providers. Providers are hesitant to participate in PFFS plans due to confusion over payment rates, lower reimbursement compared to traditional Medicare, and administrative challenges. Enrollment in PFFS plans is increasing, leading to providers becoming more familiar with the plan rules. Many PFFS enrollees have more generous benefit structures and cost-sharing features than traditional Medicare. PFFS plans have a cap on out-of-pocket spending between $1,001 and $5,000, while traditional Medicare does not have a catastrophic cap. 68% of PFFS enrollees are in a plan covering a 90-day hospital stay for $1,000 or less out-of-pocket, much lower than traditional Medicare's $8,432 cost. Actuarial value of cost sharing in MA plans cannot exceed traditional Medicare. Cost sharing in PFFS plans may vary compared to traditional Medicare. HMOs also differ in cost sharing from traditional Medicare. PFFS plans can be more confusing for beneficiaries compared to traditional Medicare, as they may have unexpected variations in cost sharing. It is unclear if participating in PFFS plans actually saves money for beneficiaries, as costs can be higher for some enrollees. Medicare statutes allow providers to participate in PFFS plans. PFFS plans allow providers to balance bill enrollees up to 15% above the reimbursement rate set by the plan. Physicians are not currently allowed to balance bill beneficiaries in PFFS plans. Questionable marketing practices by PFFS plans have raised concerns among policy makers, with complaints of deceptive sales tactics. CMS received approximately 2,700 complaints between December 2006 and April 2007. Between December 2006 and April 2007, CMS received about 2,700 complaints regarding Medicare Advantage plan marketing. In response to these concerns, seven health insurance plans offering PFFS options voluntarily suspended their marketing. These plans, representing 90% of PFFS enrollment, must demonstrate compliance with various provisions before resuming marketing to beneficiaries. CMS has lifted the suspension for three plans, allowing them to resume marketing practices. Provisions include using CMS-developed disclaimer language, sales agents passing a product knowledge test, verification calls to beneficiaries, and a provider outreach and education program. CMS has the sole authority to sanction and discipline health insurance plans for marketing misconduct. Local HMOs and Regional PPOs form provider networks to manage care delivery. Without networks, PFFS plans have less control over services and quality. Traditional Medicare also pays providers on a fee-for-service basis. PFFS plans, like traditional Medicare, pay providers on a fee-for-service basis and do not have provider networks. PFFS plans are not required to establish a quality improvement program, making it challenging to assess if higher payments result in better quality. Enrollment in PFFS plans is growing, raising concerns about increased Medicare spending. In the next 10 years, payments to PFFS plans will increase Medicare spending. Policy makers need to assess if the benefits of these plans outweigh their costs. Various requirements and protections for beneficiaries are outlined in the eligibility and enrollment, benefits, and beneficiary protections sections. The text chunk discusses monthly payments, bids, benchmark calculation, adjustments, payment provisions, risk corridors, stabilization fund, essential hospitals, premiums, rebates, organization and financial requirements, state laws, Part D prescription drug benefits, access to MA prescription drug plans, payment and premiums for the prescription drug component, and Part D enrollment for MA plan enrollees."
