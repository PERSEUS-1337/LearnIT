    "content": "The U.S. immigration system is widely viewed as broken, but opinions diverge on how to reform it. Previous attempts at comprehensive reform have failed, leading to a stalemate. The number of foreign-born residents in the U.S. is at a historic high, with 16.4 million naturalized citizens and 21.6 million noncitizens. The Department of Homeland Security reported that 10.8 million out of 21.6 million noncitizens in the US in January 2010 were unauthorized aliens. Immigration reform is a major concern for the 112th Congress, with challenges in addressing the issue amidst high unemployment and budget constraints. The Department of State and DHS play key roles in immigration policies. The Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are key in administering immigration laws. DOS issues visas, while USCIS approves immigrant petitions, ICE operates the Visa Security Program, and CBP inspects all entering the US. Foreign nationals must undergo admissibility reviews by DOS consular officers to ensure eligibility under INA Section 212 criteria. Some argue for changes in the grounds for inadmissibility, such as waiving penalties for unlawful presence over 180 days. Concerns exist over DOS's power in visa issuances and the need for more scrutiny by special agents in the Visa Security Program. Border security involves controlling official ports of entry and patrolling land and maritime borders to interdict illegal entries. Congress has increased funding for strengthening immigration-related border security, aiming for an effective balance between protection and efficient flow of approved individuals. The U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) system is crucial for border control at ports of entry. The U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) system captures biometric data of foreign nationals entering the U.S. but is not fully deployed at land ports of entry. Less than one-quarter of nonimmigrant admissions are recorded in US-VISIT, making it difficult to identify visa overstays. The Secure Border Initiative Network (SBInet), a virtual fence, was cancelled due to cost overruns and technical issues after receiving $1 billion in appropriations from FY2006-FY2010. The oversight issue along the international land border involves determining the appropriate mix of technology, infrastructure, and personnel to detect and interdict illegal entries. The scope of legal immigration includes permanent and temporary admissions, with challenges in balancing the needs of employers, families, and stakeholders in improving immigration policies. The current U.S. policy on permanent immigration is based on four major principles: family reunification, admitting immigrants with needed skills, protecting refugees, and diversity of admissions by country of origin. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) sets numerical limits and preference categories for legal permanent residents (LPRs), with a flexible annual worldwide level of 675,000 LPRs. In FY2010, 1.0 million aliens became LPRs, with 66.3% entering based on family ties. In FY2010, 66.3% of immigrants entered the U.S. based on family ties. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens were the largest group of immigrants. Other major categories included employment-based LPRs and refugees/asylees adjusting to LPR status. Advocates are pushing for a reallocation from family-based to employment-based visa categories or an increase in legal immigration. The National Visa Center reported 4.7 million approved family-based petitions waiting for visas. Proponents of family-based migration highlight significant backlogs in family-based immigration due to the high number of eligible aliens. They argue that any proposal to increase immigration levels should address family-based backlog reduction. Citizens and LPRs often wait years for their relatives' petitions to be processed and visa numbers to become available. Some suggest scaling back immigration levels by limiting family-based LPRs to immediate relatives. Employers advocate for the need to attract the \"best and the brightest\" workers, regardless of their country of birth, to stay competitive in the global market. The diversity lottery offers 50,000 visas annually to countries with low immigrant admissions in the past five years. Each country is limited to 7% of the total visas. Eligibility requires a high school education or equivalent, or qualifications in a skilled occupation. Some argue for the elimination of the diversity lottery. Critics of the diversity lottery argue for its elimination due to concerns about fraud, misuse, and potential security risks. Supporters defend the program, stating that background checks are conducted on all prospective immigrants, including diversity visa winners. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for the temporary admission of nonimmigrants for various purposes. Temporary migration, including tourists, students, and temporary workers, is important for the U.S. economy and cultural life. Efforts to manage temporary migration more effectively are underway, sparking some controversies. The focus is on recruiting skilled foreign workers to the U.S., expanding beyond H-1B visas to include more sweeping revisions. The debate on legal immigration policies has expanded to include expedited pathways for foreign students in STEM fields to become LPRs. Opponents argue that there is no evidence of a labor shortage in these areas that cannot be met by U.S. students. CBP inspectors recorded 163 million temporary admissions in 2009, with Mexican and Canadian nationals making up the majority. In FY2009, the United States had 126.8 million entries, mostly from Mexico and Canada, while other countries contributed 36.2 million admissions. The U.S. had a $21.9 billion trade surplus in travel and tourism spending. Some argue that user fees from foreign nationals on temporary visas do not cover the costs of maintaining ports of entry for the 163 million annual admissions. In 2010, the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics estimated that 1.8 million resident nonimmigrants were in the United States in 2008, with 50.8% of them being nonimmigrants. These individuals include diplomats, students, and workers who establish residence during their stay. In 2008, there were 1.8 million nonimmigrants in the United States, with 50.8% being temporary workers and their families. Debates surround the impact of increasing foreign workers on U.S. workers' salaries and working conditions. Some argue for expedient access to temporary foreign workers to meet specialized workforce needs. Efforts to enhance the security of immigration documents have shifted towards document integrity and personal identification post-9/11. Congress has passed laws to address citizenship self-attestation loopholes. Biometric identifiers are included in documents issued to foreign nationals, prioritizing document integrity and personal identification. The official document for Legal Permanent Residents is the permanent resident card. The permanent resident card, commonly known as a \"green card,\" has evolved from being printed on green stock to a plastic card similar in size to a credit card. It now incorporates security features like digital images, holograms, micro-printing, and an optical memory stripe. Additionally, USCIS issues an employment authorization document (EAD) with similar security features. Nonimmigrant visas issued by the US also include biometric identifiers like finger scans. However, the challenge remains in the availability and location of scanners capable of reading these biometric documents. Employers can participate in paper-based or electronic employment eligibility verification systems to verify new hires' identity and work eligibility. The electronic system, E-Verify, checks employment authorization through databases. Critics argue that E-Verify is not accurate and may lead to discrimination. In FY2010, 98.3% of employees were confirmed as work-authorized. In FY2010, 98.3% of employees were automatically confirmed as work-authorized, with an additional 0.3% confirmed after an initial mismatch. Westat estimated that 54% of unauthorized aliens processed through E-Verify are erroneously found to be work-authorized due to identity fraud. The SAVE system provides government agencies access to immigration status data for determining noncitizen eligibility for public benefits. USCIS does not determine benefit eligibility; SAVE enables program administrators to ensure only eligible noncitizens and naturalized citizens receive benefits. SAVE draws on the Verification Information System (VIS) database, containing over 60 million records of immigration and naturalization status information. Congress is concerned about SAVE's inability to detect identity fraud in determining immigrant eligibility for federal benefits. Reassessing immigration control policies and agencies for more effective enforcement of the INA is crucial. Immigration control involves various enforcement tools to prevent and investigate violations of immigration laws, including apprehending unauthorized aliens, worksite enforcement, investigating immigration fraud, and identifying criminal aliens. In the 112th Congress, immigration enforcement activities focus on investigating aliens who violate immigration laws, including suspected criminal acts like fraudulent activities and smuggling of aliens. Worksite enforcement of illegal employment is also a priority, with penalties for employers who knowingly hire unauthorized aliens. The Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits employers from hiring unauthorized aliens, with ICE focusing on criminally investigating and prosecuting exploitative employers. There are concerns that stricter worksite enforcement may lead to discrimination. The INA prohibits alien smuggling across the U.S. border, posing risks to national security. Smuggling generates revenue for criminal enterprises and leads to collateral crimes. Efforts to tighten laws on alien smuggling have faced opposition. Efforts to tighten laws on alien smuggling have faced opposition from religious and humanitarian groups concerned about providing relief to aliens. Immigration-related document fraud involves counterfeiting identity documents like birth certificates and passports. The INA has civil enforcement provisions for individuals and entities engaged in immigration document fraud, while the U.S. Criminal Code criminalizes the production and use of fraudulent immigration documents. The issue of document fraud in immigration involves the integrity of identification documents and the distinction between identity theft and immigration fraud. Criminal aliens are foreign nationals convicted of certain offenses, which may trigger deportation. Immigration law covers violations of federal, state, or foreign criminal law, with crimes affecting immigration status falling under categories defined in the INA. Bipartisan agreement exists to allocate resources for locating and removing criminal aliens. The Secure Communities Program uses fingerprints to identify criminal aliens quickly. Proponents claim it enhances public safety, while opponents argue it leads to distrust in immigrant communities and increases costs for local jails. The INA mandates detention for certain categories of aliens during removal proceedings. Some foreign nationals are detained during removal proceedings, with critics questioning the fairness of mandatory detention for asylum seekers without documentation. The issue revolves around who should be detained and the necessary detention resources. The efficacy of alien removal proceedings relies on an efficient immigration court system. Increasing resources such as judges and law clerks could reduce detention times and improve the quality of judicial hearings. However, some argue that the problems with immigration caseloads are more related to the quality of immigration judges rather than funding shortages. The 112th Congress may consider legislative action to address concerns about the quality of immigration judges. There is a debate on state and local efforts to deter unlawfully present aliens, with supporters arguing for necessary state action and opponents raising concerns about expenses, civil rights violations, and undermining community policing. The 112th Congress may weigh three aspects of the issue of state and local police involvement in enforcing federal immigration law, including the ability of states to adopt legislation, the role of police in enforcement, and the effectiveness and propriety of such actions. The 112th Congress may consider the effectiveness and propriety of existing cooperative initiatives between the federal government and states regarding immigration enforcement. These agreements allow specially trained state or local officers to perform specific functions related to aliens. The debate over the rights and privileges of foreign nationals in the U.S. and their legal duties is likely to arise with any immigration legislation. All individuals in the U.S., whether nationals or foreign nationals, have certain rights under the Constitution. Foreign nationals in the U.S. have rights under the Constitution, but not as extensive as U.S. citizens. Children born in the U.S. to unlawfully present parents are citizens under jus soli. The debate surrounds whether children born to unauthorized aliens are subject to U.S. jurisdiction for citizenship. Some propose amendments to limit automatic citizenship. Some advocate for amendments to limit automatic citizenship in the U.S. for children born to unlawfully present parents or foreign nationals on nonimmigrant visas. Supporters of the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause argue for maintaining birthright citizenship principles regardless of parents' status. Immigrant integration in the U.S. includes language, history, government knowledge, labor market participation, and community involvement. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides naturalization opportunities for lawful permanent residents (LPRs) to become U.S. citizens by meeting residency, moral character, English proficiency, and knowledge of U.S. government requirements. The debate surrounds whether integration responsibility lies solely with immigrants or is shared with government and other institutions. Unauthorized aliens residing in the U.S. present a complex issue, with proposals for legalizing their status requiring consideration. To legalize their status, unauthorized aliens must meet specified conditions, pay penalty fees, and potentially use a point system based on equities in the U.S. Advocates argue that unauthorized residents contribute to the community and legalization would benefit employers. Opponents of legalization argue that it rewards illegal actions and could attract more unauthorized migrants in the future. They advocate for stricter enforcement of immigration laws instead. Additionally, there are more specific proposals like the DREAM Act that would help unauthorized alien students. The DREAM Act proposes to enable unauthorized alien students to become Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) in the United States under certain conditions. Supporters argue that these students should not be penalized for their parents' actions, while opponents believe it would encourage illegal behavior and attract more unauthorized migrants. Federal laws restrict noncitizens' access to public assistance, with exceptions for LPRs with a significant U.S. work history. The debate on federal public benefits for unauthorized migrants in the United States revolves around restrictions on access, exceptions for those with U.S. work history, and concerns about mixed-immigration status families. Despite legal restrictions, there is a perception that unauthorized migrants receive benefits. Temporary legal residents are subject to taxation similar to U.S. citizens, regardless of their immigration status. Noncitizen eligibility for federally funded public aid has been a contentious issue since the 1990s, intersecting with immigration, health, welfare, and income security policies. Some argue for further restrictions based on work history or narrower categories of legal permanent residents (LPRs), while others advocate for broader eligibility criteria. Noncitizen eligibility for federally funded public aid has been a contentious issue since the 1990s, intersecting with immigration, health, welfare, and income security policies. Some argue for further restrictions based on work history or narrower categories of legal permanent residents (LPRs), while others advocate for broader eligibility criteria. The debate also includes concerns about unintended consequences of verification systems and the complexities of denying benefits to U.S. citizens. The United States grants refugee status to aliens overseas and asylum to aliens in the United States based on persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. The U.S. refugee and asylum policy faces challenges in adapting to a changing world and the war on terrorism. Some argue for better protections for those fleeing persecution, while others are concerned about misuse of humanitarian relief for immigration. The Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration overseas processing of refugees, and USCIS makes final eligibility determinations. There are concerns about potential terrorists trying to enter the U.S. as refugees or asylees from certain regions. The U.S. refugee and asylum policy faces challenges in differentiating persecuted individuals from persecutors due to religious, ethnic, and political violence worldwide. Refugee resettlement programs' efficacy in the United States is a concern. Foreign nationals can apply for asylum with USCIS or seek asylum before an EOIR immigration judge. Aliens lacking proper immigration documents may undergo expedited removal, but can request a \"credible fear\" hearing if they fear persecution. Asylum issues in the 112th Congress include the one-year time limit on filing cases, mandatory detention of asylum seekers without proper documents, and thresholds for establishing religious persecution. The U.S. also offers temporary humanitarian relief through \"T\" and \"U\" visas for victims of trafficking or abuse. Debate surrounds the T visa application process and U.S. humanitarian policies. Revisions to the U visa and concerns about false claims for T status may impact victims' ability to obtain protection. Temporary protected status (TPS) is offered to foreign nationals in the US during civil unrest or disasters. Currently, over 300,000 individuals from seven countries receive TPS or deferred enforced departure (DED). The executive branch grants TPS or relief from removal to foreign nationals from seven countries: El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Liberia, Nicaragua, Somalia, and Sudan. Legislation may be enacted by Congress if the Administration is slow to grant TPS after a crisis or chooses not to provide TPS to certain individuals."
