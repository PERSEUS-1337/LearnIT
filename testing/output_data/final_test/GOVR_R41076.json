In contrast, other programs for lower-income households, such as Medicaid, Unemployment Insurance, SSI, and EITC, had higher federal outlays in the same year. In 2009, major changes were made to food assistance program policies, increasing federal funding for domestic food aid. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) saw significant growth in participation, providing benefits to low-income households to supplement food spending. The Administration's FY2011 budget requests continued growth in federal spending on food assistance. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) experienced a substantial increase in participation from 14.0 million households in November 2008 to 17.5 million households in November 2009. Monthly spending on SNAP benefits rose from $3.6 billion to $5.1 billion during the same period. Total SNAP spending for FY2010 is estimated to be at least $69 billion with an average monthly participation of almost 41 million persons. The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) provides food commodities to emergency feeding organizations and cash payments to help with distribution costs. In FY2009, TEFAP provided $710 million worth of commodities and $89 million in distribution cost assistance, up from $420 million in FY2008. Feeding America reported a 21% increase in food distribution between June 2008 and June 2009. TEFAP support may decrease in FY2010 without extra funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The School Lunch and School Breakfast programs provide cash subsidies and commodities to schools for providing meals to low-income children. The number of children receiving free lunches and breakfasts increased significantly between 2008 and 2009. In FY2009, child nutrition efforts cost $15.4 billion, expected to rise to $17 billion in FY2010. The WIC program provides nutrition vouchers to low-income pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and young children. Participation increased by 2.3% between 2008 and 2009, with costs totaling $6.5 billion in FY2009. The USDA reported that 14.6% of American households were \"food insecure\" in 2008. In 2008, 14.6% of American households experienced food insecurity, with 5.7% facing very low food security. These rates were the highest since 1995. By the end of 2008, food hardship for the nation rose to 19.5%. In 2008, food hardship for American households increased from 14.6% to 19.5% by the end of the year. In 2009, the rate slightly decreased, ranging between 17.9% and 18.8%. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 made significant changes to SNAP funding, benefits, and eligibility to address the economic downturn. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 increased SNAP benefits significantly by raising the base Thrifty Food Plan amounts used to calculate benefits by 13.6%. This boost in benefits was in response to rising food prices and other needs of recipient households. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 increased SNAP benefits by 13.6%, resulting in a monthly average household benefit increase of nearly 20%. In FY2009, ARRA-provided SNAP benefits accounted for $4.3 billion in spending, and in November 2009, benefits totaled over $800 million. For FY2010 and FY2011, ARRA-provided benefits were estimated to total $10.5 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 increased SNAP benefits by 13.6%, suspending work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents through FY2010. States share administrative costs with the federal government, with $3 billion annually covered by states. The ARRA provided additional federal funding of $145 million in FY2009 and $150 million in FY2010 for administrative expenses, without requiring state matching funds. In FY2009 and FY2010, the Agriculture Department appropriations laws set minimum funding for SNAP at $53 billion, with an additional $6 billion in contingency funds. The Defense Department appropriations act also allocated unlimited funding for SNAP emergency requirements and an extra $400 million for state administrative expenses. The Administration has taken steps to expand access to SNAP, building on pre-2009 policies. The USDA's Food and Nutrition Service encourages states to use \"categorical eligibility\" to expand SNAP eligibility by increasing asset and income limits. 27 states and two territories have utilized this option. Waivers for face-to-face interviews have been granted to states for initial eligibility and recertification. In FY2009, TEFAP had a budget of $250 million for commodities, $50 million for distribution/storage costs, and received nearly $400 million in \"bonus\" commodities from USDA stocks. The ARRA provided an additional $150 million through FY2010, with $100 million for commodities and $50 million for distribution/storage. The ARRA also allocated $6 million for infrastructure improvements for TEFAP recipient organizations. Additionally, $100 million was made available for competitive grants to schools for school food service equipment. The FY2010 Agriculture Department appropriations law (P.L. 111-80) allocated $25 million for grants to improve direct certification rates for free school meals and federal technical assistance. States operating the WIC program have requested support for new management information systems. The ARRA provides funding for WIC contingency reserve and management information system upgrades. The FY2011 budget projects increased participation and spending for USDA food assistance programs, including SNAP and child nutrition initiatives. The FY2011 budget estimates an increase in funding for child nutrition initiatives and the WIC program, while TEFAP funding is expected to slightly decrease. The budget also includes proposals to extend funding authority for SNAP and suspend eligibility rules for ABAWDs. The FY2011 budget proposes changes to SNAP law, including excluding refundable tax credits as countable assets and increasing the limit on countable assets to $10,000. It also aims to add $1 billion in new spending authority for child nutrition programs to end childhood hunger by 2015."
