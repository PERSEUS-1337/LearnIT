    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers various programs to support small businesses, including loan guaranty programs, venture capital programs like the New Markets Venture Capital (NMVC) program, federal contracting opportunities, direct loans for disaster recovery, and entrepreneurial education. The NMVC program, authorized by P.L. 106-554, aims to promote economic development and create job opportunities in low-income areas through venture capital investments in smaller enterprises. The NMVC program, modeled after the SBA's SBIC program, provides funding and operational assistance to small businesses in low-income areas. SBA guarantees debentures to NMVC companies, allowing them to leverage private capital for investments. NMVC companies must invest at least 80% of funds in small businesses located in low-income areas. The NMVC program provides funding and operational assistance to small businesses in low-income areas. SSBICs under the SBIC program are also eligible for NMVC grants. The program was appropriated $21.952 million in FY2001 to support SBA-guaranteed debentures and operational assistance grants. Additional leverage was provided in FY2002 and FY2003. In 2003, unobligated balances of $10.5 million for NMVC debenture subsidies and $13.75 million for operational assistance grants were rescinded. The NMVC program's active unpaid principal balance peaked at $698 million in FY2008, falling each year until reaching $0 in FY2018. No bills have been introduced since the 112th Congress regarding the NMVC program, but over 30 bills were introduced in previous Congresses to expand or amend the program. During the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to increase funding for the NMVC program, such as H.R. 2872 which aimed to guarantee $75 million of debentures and $15 million for operational assistance grants. The report discusses the program's legislative origins, eligibility requirements, regulations, and program statistics. No further action was taken on the bill. The report discusses efforts to eliminate the NMVC program due to concerns of duplication and high costs, as well as the rescission of unobligated funding in 2003. Senator Christopher Bond proposed an amendment to incorporate various acts into H.R. 3412 during a Senate Committee markup in 1998. In 1998, the committee debated and approved amendments to the Small Business Loan Enhancement Act, including a precursor of the NMVC program proposed by Senator Paul Wellstone. The program aimed to provide grants to CDVC firms investing in economically distressed areas for technical assistance and operating support. The committee approved the CDVC program, which aimed to create good jobs and wealth in economically distressed communities. President Bill Clinton later announced support for the \"New Markets Investment Initiative\" during his State of the Union Address in 1999. President Clinton supported the New Markets Investment Initiative, which included programs like the New Markets Tax Credit and New Markets Venture Capital to boost economic development in struggling areas. He highlighted the initiative during trips to underserved communities and announced a bipartisan legislative initiative with House Speaker Dennis Hastert to revitalize impoverished areas. The SBA proposed incentives to encourage market investments in economically distressed areas through the SBIC program. The LMI initiative aims to boost investment in small businesses in inner cities and rural areas with equity capital shortages. The SBA's LMI initiative offers incentives for businesses with employees or assets in low- or moderate-income areas. LMI debentures have 5 or 10-year maturities with a stub period, issued at a discount to cover interest costs, SBA fees, and leverage fees. In FY2018, SBICs made 609 investments totaling $1.026 billion in small businesses located in low- to moderate-income (LMI) zones, representing 18.6% of the total amount invested. Senator John Kerry introduced S. 1594, the Community Development and Venture Capital Act of 2000, which included provisions to encourage investment in economically distressed communities. The Capital Assistance Program and BusinessLINC aim to support community development venture capital firms and small businesses in economically distressed areas. The Senate Committee on Small Business reported the bill, emphasizing the success of the SBIC program and the new LMI initiative to encourage investments in low- to moderate-income zones. Senator Christopher Bond chaired the committee and highlighted the importance of public-private partnerships in supporting economic development. Senator Bond emphasized the need for smaller investments in low-income areas through the NMVC funds, as the SBIC program was not reaching areas that needed economic development the most. The bill aimed to fill the gap in access to capital for small businesses in impoverished areas, with NMVC funds typically ranging from $50,000 to $300,000 compared to the $300,000 to $5 million range in the SBIC program. The Senate did not take further action on the bill. On December 14, 2000, Representative Jim Talent introduced H.R. 5663, the New Markets Venture Capital Program Act of 2000, which included the current NMVC program and BusinessLINC. The bill became law on December 21, 2000, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001. The SBA published rules in January and May 2001 for venture capital companies to apply for the NMVC program. An NMVC company applying to the SBA must submit a business plan outlining their investment strategy in low-income areas, along with details on their management's qualifications in community development finance or venture capital. The company must be a newly formed for-profit entity or subsidiary, organized under state law, and demonstrate the expertise of its management team in relevant finance areas. The SBA solicited applications from venture capital companies and SSBICs for the NMVC program, aiming for economic development in low-income areas. The second round of applications was canceled due to funding rescission. 23 applicants were received, with 7 conditionally approved pending conditions like raising $5 million within 18 months. Applicants for the NMVC program must raise at least $5 million in private capital within 18 months of conditional approval. They also need binding commitments totaling 30% of the raised capital from sources other than the SBA. Six out of seven companies granted conditional approval met all program requirements and were accepted. Six out of seven companies were accepted into the NMVC program after meeting all requirements. These companies raised $48 million in private capital and received $72 million in leverage. They are located in various low-income areas across Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, District of Columbia, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. The NMVC program accepted companies in low-income areas across Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, District of Columbia, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Approved NMVC companies must file annual financial statements with SBA, including impact assessments on job creation, business revenues, profits, and taxes paid. NMVC companies must provide financial and operational assistance to small businesses meeting SBA criteria. They must submit a portfolio financing report within 30 days of each financing. The business must meet SBA size standards or have specific financial criteria. 80% of total financings must be directed towards concerns in low-income areas. The NMVC companies must allocate 80% of their total financings to small businesses in low-income areas. Failure to meet this requirement results in ineligibility for additional leverage from the SBA until compliance is achieved. Low-income areas are defined based on poverty rates, household incomes, and median household incomes. The NMVC companies invest their regulatory capital in small businesses located in low-income areas. They can receive up to 150% of their raised funds from the SBA. SBA funding comes from selling securities backed by the US government. The SBA guarantees timely payment of principal and interest on NMVC debentures, allowing for favorable interest rates. NMVC companies defer interest payments for the first five years, making semiannual payments in years 6 to 10 and paying the principal at maturity. NMVC companies receive leverage from the SBA by requesting a conditional commitment for future use. The SBA sells debentures to third parties or pools them with other requests. NMVC companies can draw against the SBA's leverage commitment at any time. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago holds all NMVC debentures, determining interest rates. After receiving leverage from the SBA, NMVC companies cannot prepay their debentures for 12 months. Prepayments are only allowed on March 1 or September 1 each year, with the cost being the present value of the debenture. NMVC companies then make equity investments in small businesses, typically in the form of common or preferred stock, subordinated debt with equity features, or other equity investment instruments. The SBA awards grants to NMVC companies and SSBICs for operational assistance to small businesses financed under the program. Grants must be used for management, marketing, and technical assistance with a matching requirement. Matching resources can be cash, in-kind contributions, binding commitments, or annuities payable over a multiyear period. NMVC companies and SSBICs are eligible for operational assistance grants from the SBA, with a matching requirement. The grants must be used for management, marketing, and technical assistance, with a maximum repayment period of 10 years. NMVC companies received grants in FY2002 and FY2003, investing over $81.4 million in small businesses since the program's inception. Since its inception, NMVC companies invested over $81.4 million in 71 small businesses. The program peaked in FY2007 with nearly $16.3 million invested in 35 small businesses. However, financings declined in subsequent years, reaching $0 in FY2018. The program's unpaid principal balance peaked at $698 million in FY2008 and has not received additional funding since 2001. Opposition to the program within Congress began to grow during President George W. Bush's administration. President George W. Bush recommended eliminating the NMVC program in his FY2002 budget request, citing its cost and duplication of other federal programs. The Administration believes the program's objectives can be achieved more efficiently through existing programs, such as community development financial institutions and the SBA's SBIC program. The NMVC program, with total capital resources of $17.7 billion, is costly compared to its expected impact. The program's cost in FY2001 is $52 million, with an expected investment activity of $150-$200 million. Critics argue that the program's focus on small businesses in distressed areas is too risky for government involvement. The NMVC program, with total capital resources of $17.7 billion, is aimed at small businesses in economically distressed areas. Advocates argue that mainstream venture capital firms avoid these investments, making the program necessary to revitalize struggling areas. They disagree with the Bush Administration's view that the program duplicates other federal efforts, stating it serves a unique clientele. Despite recommendations for elimination, the program continues to receive support in Congress. During congressional consideration of the FY2003 budget, unobligated balances for NMVC debenture subsidies and operational assistance grants were rescinded. Over 30 bills have been introduced to amend the NMVC program, including proposals to reduce capital requirements, eliminate matching funds, create an Office of New Markets Venture Capital, and provide increased financing to small manufacturers. Bills also aim to align the program's definition of low-income areas with the New Market Tax Credits program. During the 108th and 109th Congress, bills were introduced to provide additional funding for the NMVC program, but none were enacted. An amendment during the 109th Congress proposed funding for debenture guarantees and operational assistance grants using funds from the Small Business Administration. During the 110th Congress, bills were introduced in the House and Senate to expand the NMVC program for small businesses in Hurricane Katrina-affected areas, but none were enacted. During the 110th Congress, bills were introduced in the House and Senate to provide additional funding for the NMVC program, including guarantees for debentures and operational assistance grants. However, none of these bills were enacted. In the 111th Congress, two bills were introduced in the House for similar funding provisions. During the 112th Congress, Representative Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez introduced H.R. 2872, the Job Creation and Urban Revitalization Act of 2011, to provide additional funding for the NMVC program. The bill aimed to guarantee $75 million of debentures and $15 million for operational assistance grants for FY2012 through FY2013, but no further action was taken on the bill. No bills have been introduced since the 112th Congress concerning the NMVC program. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included provisions to encourage SBIC investments in low-income areas, allowing for increased leverage amounts for SBICs investing in these areas. Additionally, the SBA announced a $1 billion impact investment SBIC initiative on April 7, 2011. The SBA announced a $1 billion impact investment SBIC initiative on April 7, 2011, providing leverage for SBA-licensed impact investment debenture SBICs targeting underserved markets and communities. Small businesses eligible for this investment must meet specific criteria related to location and employee residency in low to moderate income zones or economically distressed areas. The SBA introduced an impact investment SBIC initiative in 2011, offering up to $150 million in leverage for SBICs focusing on underserved markets. Changes in 2014 expanded access to the program and removed the $200 million leverage cap. The SBA introduced an impact investment SBIC initiative in 2011, offering up to $150 million in leverage for SBICs focusing on underserved markets. In 2014, changes removed the $200 million leverage cap, added advanced manufacturing as an eligible sector, and allowed businesses receiving SBIR or STTR grants to qualify. Impact investment SBICs could customize their definition of \"impact investment\" with SBA approval. Proposed regulations in 2016 aimed to provide guidelines for licensing, leverage eligibility, fees, and reporting requirements for impact investment SBICs. By the end of FY2018, there were nine licensed impact investment SBICs. As of September 30, 2018, nine impact investment SBICs managed over $905 million in assets and invested $106.8 million in 35 small businesses during FY2018. The SBA announced the termination of new management assessment questionnaires for the impact investment SBIC initiative on September 28, 2017. The SBA terminated the impact investment SBIC initiative due to few qualified funds applying, lack of commensurate results, and high costs. The proposed regulations were withdrawn, and the LMI and impact investment initiatives aim to boost SBIC investments in LMI areas. Program investments in LMI zones have increased in recent years. The NMVC program, which is no longer active, had lower than expected financings in LMI areas. Some argue that increased SBIC investments in LMI areas may reduce the need for the NMVC program. In FY2018, SBICs provided $1.026 billion in financing to small businesses in LMI areas. Advocates of the NMVC program argue that it targets smaller investments than SBICs. The debate over the NMVC program's future reflects broader disagreements. The debate over the NMVC program's future reflects broader disagreements about the role of government in assisting small businesses. Some believe in increasing funding for the program to create jobs, while others worry about the long-term economic effects of the federal deficit. Some advocate business tax reduction, financial credit market regulation reform, and federal fiscal restraint to assist small businesses and stimulate economic growth. They aim to enhance government efficiency by eliminating duplicative federal spending programs like the NMVC program."
