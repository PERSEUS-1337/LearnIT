The Act \"Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998\" provides definitions for terms used, such as \"Internet\" and \"geographic penalty.\" The term \"Internet\" is defined as per section 230(e)(1) of the Communications Act of 1934, while \"geographic penalty\" refers to the disproportionate costs imposed on Internet users in rural or distant locations. The Act \"Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998\" amends section 102 by updating the definition of the network to include advanced computer networks of Federal agencies and departments. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that United States leadership in science and technology is crucial for the nation's prosperity, security, and competitiveness. Federal investment in research is essential for maintaining this leadership, as demonstrated by the creation of new industries and jobs through previous investments in computer networking technology. The Internet's role is increasingly significant. The Internet plays a crucial role in keeping citizens informed about government actions. Inter-agency cooperation is needed to prevent duplication in Federal networking research. A high-capacity national research and education computer network is necessary for researchers and educators to access resources and facilitate further research and development. Research in new networking technologies is essential for economic growth, improved healthcare, and educational opportunities. It can also help alleviate the economic challenges faced by rural internet users. Information security is a critical aspect of computing and communication systems that requires further research. The purpose of research in new networking technologies is to support economic growth, improve healthcare, enhance educational opportunities, and address economic challenges for rural internet users. Information security is also a critical aspect that requires further research. The purpose of this Act is to authorize computing, information, and communication technology initiatives outlined in the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991. It aims to focus on research programs related to high-end computing, human-centered systems, high confidence systems, and education, training, and human resources. The Act also aims to develop a comprehensive and integrated US research program focusing on creating a network infrastructure that can support greater speed. The Act aims to develop a network infrastructure for advanced computer networks of Federal agencies, focusing on high-speed data access and flexible networking technology solutions. The Act aims to develop a network infrastructure for advanced computer networks of Federal agencies, focusing on high-speed data access and flexible networking technology solutions. The purposes of the Act include promoting the further development of an information infrastructure, networking management tools, and open network standards. SEC. 5. DUTIES OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE. Title I of the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 is amended to include a new section on the establishment of an Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee on High-Performance Computing and Communications, Information Technology, and the Next Generation Internet, established by Executive Order No. 13035, is tasked with assessing the Next Generation Internet program's alignment with the Act's purposes, addressing concerns such as geographic penalties and technology transfer, and evaluating the role of Federal agencies. The Advisory Committee assesses the implementation of the Next Generation Internet program, ensuring clear roles for each Federal agency and department involved. Reports are submitted annually to the President and relevant congressional committees. The last report for the Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998 must be submitted by September 30, 2000, 6 months after its enactment. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS for the Next Generation Internet program under the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991. The table shows the funding allocated to various agencies for FY 1999 and FY 2000. The Department of Defense received $40,000,000 in FY 1999 and $42,500,000 in FY 2000. The Department of Energy received $20,000,000 in FY 1999 and $25,000,000 in FY 2000. The National Science Foundation received $25,000,000 in both years. The National Institutes of Health received $5,000,000 in FY 1999 and $7,500,000 in FY 2000. NASA received $10,000,000 in both years, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology received $5,000,000 in FY 1999 and $7,500,000 in FY 2000. The Department of Defense's authorized amount for fiscal year 1999 is determined by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. Additionally, a study on the impact of adding generic top-level domains on trademarks and intellectual property rights is mandated. The Secretary of Commerce will request a study by the National Research Council to assess the effects of adding new generic top-level domains on trademark and intellectual property rights holders. The study will also make recommendations for policy changes related to trademark and intellectual property rights clearance. The curr_chunk discusses processes for trademark and intellectual property rights clearance for domain names, including searchable databases, accessible information, and required registrant information. It also addresses dispute resolution mechanisms. The curr_chunk focuses on dispute resolution mechanisms for trademark and intellectual property rights related to domain names, including reducing conflicts through new technical approaches and determining choice of law or jurisdiction for disputes. It also addresses liability for infringement by registrars, registries, or technical management bodies. The curr_chunk discusses short-term and long-term technical and policy options for Internet addressing schemes and their impact on trademark and intellectual property rights. The Secretary of Commerce is required to ensure interagency cooperation for the study, involving various government entities. The National Research Council requests cooperation from government entities and private corporations managing the Internet root server system for a study on Internet addressing schemes' impact on trademark rights. A report with findings and recommendations is due to the Secretary of Commerce within 12 months. The National Research Council requests cooperation for a study on the impact of new generic top-level domains on trademark and intellectual property rights. A report must be submitted to the Secretary of Commerce and congressional committees within 30 days. $800,000 is authorized for the study. The Senate passed the bill on June 26, 1998."
