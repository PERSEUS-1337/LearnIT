    "content": "The term 'joint resolution' for section 822(a)(2) refers to a resolution of Congress concurs with the President's report on North Korea's compliance with international obligations under the North Korea Threat Reduction Act of 1999. Congressional review procedures are established for this purpose. The joint resolution described in subsection (a) is enacted by Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of Representatives and the Senate. It recognizes the constitutional right of either House to change the rules related to their procedures. The joint resolution must be introduced in the House of Representatives by the majority or minority leader, or a designated member, and in the Senate by the majority or minority leader, or a designated member. It will be referred to the Committee on International Relations in the House and the Committee on Foreign Relations in the Senate. If a committee to which the resolution is referred does not act on it, it can be discharged. If a committee does not report a joint resolution within 30 days of its introduction, the committee will be discharged from further consideration, and the resolution will be placed on the House calendar. After committee action or discharge, the resolution can be considered on the House floor. After a joint resolution is discharged from committee or not reported within 30 days, any Member of the House can move to proceed to its consideration. The motion is privileged, not debatable, and not amendable. If agreed to, the House will immediately consider the joint resolution as unfinished business. Debate on a joint resolution described in subsection (a) shall be limited to two hours, divided equally between those favoring and opposing it. Amendments are not allowed, but a motion to further limit debate is. Appeals from decisions are permitted. Appeals from decisions on joint resolutions described in subsection (a) are decided without debate. Floor consideration in the Senate follows specific provisions. If one House receives a joint resolution from the other House, certain procedures apply. The House receiving a joint resolution must follow specific procedures, including a vote on final passage of the resolution from the other House. Once the joint resolution from the other House is dealt with, the original House's resolution cannot be considered. In the computation of the 30-day period mentioned, days when either House of Congress is not in session due to an adjournment of more than 3 days or sine die are excluded. SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF RESTRICTIONS ON NUCLEAR COOPERATION WITH NORTH KOREA. Amendment to the North Korea Threat Reduction Act of 1999 to include controls under the Export Trigger List of the Nuclear Suppliers Group."
