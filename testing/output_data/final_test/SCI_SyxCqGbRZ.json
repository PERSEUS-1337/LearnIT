Early detection is crucial for better patient outcomes, but there is a lack of consensus on treatment guidelines. A new deep reinforcement learning method is introduced to learn personalized treatment policies for septic patients using multi-output Gaussian processes. This approach is evaluated on a dataset from a university health system, showing promising results in learning clinically interpretable treatment policies. Our algorithm, developed for septic patients in a university health system, could reduce patient mortality by 8.2\\%. It provides treatment recommendations to physicians and can be applied to other reinforcement learning problems with sparse and missing time series data. Sepsis, a complication of infection, is a leading cause of patient mortality and healthcare costs. Early detection and personalized treatment strategies are crucial for better outcomes. Previous guidelines focused on early goal-directed therapy and sepsis care bundles, but individualized approaches are needed. Landmark publication on early goal-directed therapy revolutionized severe sepsis and septic shock management. The study compared a 6-hour protocol of EGDT using central venous catheterization to guide treatment, significantly lowering mortality. Concerns arose about its external validity, resource requirements, and potential risks. Recent trials questioned the need for all elements of EGDT in severe septic shock patients. The study questioned the need for all elements of EGDT in severe septic shock patients, with recent trials showing no improvement in patient survival compared to usual care. The SSC guidelines are being reconsidered, with a focus on targeting treatment based on individual patient risk factors. Time to first antibiotics has been identified as a crucial factor in improving survival rates, while early antibiotic administration showed a mortality benefit in a study of 50,000 patients in New York. Emerging evidence suggests that a patient's baseline risk influences treatment response in sepsis. Poor performance of EGDT compared to standard care calls for rethinking treatment recommendations. Deep reinforcement learning is proposed to optimize sepsis treatments using clinical data. With Electronic Health Records, hospitals can collect data for such models. Real-world healthcare data poses challenges for learning models due to irregularly sampled clinical time series with missing values and high heterogeneity among patients. The use of Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) as a preprocessing step is a novel approach to address these issues. The use of a Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) as a preprocessing step in reinforcement learning models allows for interpolation and imputation of missing physiological time series values while maintaining uncertainty. The MGP hyperparameters are learned end-to-end during training, optimizing the Q-learning loss and enabling estimation of uncertainty in Q-values. The model architecture includes a deep recurrent Q-network to account for non-Markovian dynamics and memory of past states and actions. Experiments with EHR data from septic patients showed improved performance with the MGP and deep recurrent Q-network. Reinforcement learning involves agents learning policies in unknown environments, formulated as Markov decision processes. Agents observe states, take actions, and receive rewards to maximize return. Q-Learning is an off-policy algorithm for estimating expected returns from actions. In Q-learning, the Bellman equation is used to update the optimal action value function iteratively. Deep Q-learning utilizes a neural network to approximate Q-values, addressing the issue of infinitely many states in continuous state spaces. In deep Q-learning, Q-values are estimated by updating neural network parameters through a loss function and stochastic gradient descent. Markov decision processes assume the Markov property, but in real-world scenarios like medical applications, a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is more suitable. Deep Q-learning relies on observations to estimate the state in a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) extends Deep Q-networks (DQN) by using LSTM layers to capture long-term dependencies. LSTM recurrent neural networks have been used in medical time series applications. The experiment investigates replacing fully connected neural network layers with LSTM layers in the Q-network architecture to test the realism of the Markov assumption. The experiment investigates using Multi-output Gaussian processes (MGPs) to model patient physiological time series, allowing for variable spacing, missing values, and uncertainty estimates. MGPs are specified by mean and covariance functions for each series, with observations centered on latent functions. The linear model of coregionalization covariance function with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck base kernel is used to model temporal correlations and covariance structure between physiological variables in patient time series data. The full joint kernel incorporates a mixture of kernels to encode scale covariance between different time series, with P = 2 mixture kernels found to work well in practice. The MGP kernel hyperparameters are shared across all patients for collective learning. Multi-output Gaussian processes and recurrent neural networks can be combined and trained end-to-end (MGP-RNNs) to solve supervised learning problems for sequential data. This approach has shown superior predictive performance in early detection of sepsis from clinical time series data compared to vanilla RNNs. The MGP hyperparameters are learned discriminatively, optimizing an imputation and interpolation mechanism for the specific supervised task. The goal is to minimize the loss function by optimizing the MGP posterior distribution. This involves using the reparameterization trick and Monte Carlo sampling to compute gradients for MGP hyperparameters and RNN parameters, enabling stochastic gradient descent for minimizing the loss. The Monte Carlo sampling introduced in the learning procedure acts as regularization to prevent overfitting in RNN. Recent interest in healthcare data has focused on supervised tasks, but reinforcement learning is preferred for learning optimal treatment actions. Reinforcement learning methods are being used in healthcare to learn optimal treatment actions from data, with a focus on setting up the problem and rewards. The challenge lies in evaluating learned policies on retrospective data. Building off previous work, a more sophisticated network architecture incorporating DRQNs and MGPs is utilized for time series imputation and interpolation. MGP-DRQNs is a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for optimal treatment policies from clinical time series data. It utilizes a discrete action space and regularly spaced grid times for decision-making. The MGP-DRQNs algorithm learns optimal treatment decisions from clinical time series data using a posterior distribution for latent time series values. It optimizes a loss function similar to deep Q-learning, incorporating MGP expectations and computing the loss over patient trajectories. Parameters and hyperparameters are learned through a combination of DRQN and MGP techniques. The algorithm uses a Dueling Double-Deep Q-network architecture with Prioritized Experience Replay to speed up learning from clinical time series data. It includes 2 LSTM layers and a final fully connected layer before splitting into value and advantage streams. The study implemented methods in Tensorflow using Adam optimizers with minibatches of 50 encounters, a learning rate of 0.001, and L2 regularization. They used 25 Monte Carlo samples from the MGP for each encounter to approximate loss and compute gradients. The dataset included information from 9,255 septic patient encounters over 15 months at a university hospital. Source code will be released on Github after review. The study focused on sepsis patients at a university hospital over 15 months, defining sepsis based on abnormal vitals, suspicion of infection, and organ damage. The dataset was divided into training and testing sets, with actions learned in 4-hour windows using the MGP. Treatments in the RL setup included antibiotics, vasopressors, and IV fluids. The study on septic patients at a university hospital focused on treatments given, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and IV fluids. These treatments were categorized into different groups based on administration frequency. The data included various physiological variables, categorical variables, baseline information, and medications related to sepsis treatment. The model also considered informative sampling of lab results and vital signs. The study focuses on sepsis treatments and uses SARSA algorithm to estimate state-action values for physician policy. Different architectures for learning optimal sepsis treatments are compared, including MGP-DRQN and MGP-mean-DRQN. The reward function used is sparse, with a reward of \u00b110 at the end of a trajectory based on patient survival/death. The study compares different architectures for learning optimal sepsis treatments, including DRQN with posterior mean of MGP, last-one-carried-forward imputation, vanilla DQN, MGP-DQN, and MGP-mean-DQN. Doubly Robust Off-policy Value Evaluation is used to compute unbiased estimates of optimal policies. An MGP-RNN is trained to estimate action probabilities of physician policy. The study compares different architectures for learning optimal sepsis treatments, including DRQN with posterior mean of MGP. SARSA is used to estimate expected returns for the physician policy on test data. Q-values are well calibrated with mortality, showing patients with higher expected returns tend to have lower mortality. Policy value estimates for each algorithm are shown in Table 1, with the physician policy having an estimated value of 5.52 and corresponding mortality of 13.3%. The MGP-DRQN performs well and could reduce mortality by up to 8%. The study compares different architectures for learning optimal sepsis treatments, with DRQN architectures showing higher expected returns. The MGP consistently improved results, with the MGP-DRQN potentially reducing mortality by 8%. The policies using the full MGP posterior outperformed those using only the posterior mean. The expected returns for various policies are shown in Table 1, with the MGP-DRQN having the highest expected return of 7.51. The study evaluated the performance of the MGP-DRQN learning algorithm in recommending sepsis treatments. The algorithm tended to suggest more antibiotics and vasopressors than physicians used, but less IV fluids. Mortality rates were lowest when clinicians followed the algorithm's recommendations. The study evaluated the performance of the MGP-DRQN learning algorithm in recommending sepsis treatments. The algorithm suggested more antibiotics and vasopressors than physicians used, but less IV fluids. Mortality rates were lowest when clinicians followed the algorithm's recommendations. The patient's condition worsened in the Intensive Care Unit, with rising white blood cell count and falling blood pressure. The RL model recommended vasopressors at hour 14, but they were not administered until hour 30. Ultimately, care was withdrawn at hour 45, and the patient passed away at hour 50. This case highlights the potential benefits of using a learned treatment policy in decision support tools for earlier and more aggressive interventions. In this paper, a new framework combining multi-output Gaussian processes and deep reinforcement learning was presented for clinical problems. The approach performed well in estimating optimal treatment strategies for septic patients by using a recurrent structure in the Q-network architecture. The multi-output Gaussian process improved performance by offering a more principled method for interpolation and imputation. Treatment recommendations from learned policies could be included in a dashboard application for early detection of sepsis to help providers better care for septic patients. One potential future direction is to explore more complex reward functions for identifying and treating sepsis patients faster. The modeling framework used in this work is versatile and can be applied to other medical scenarios requiring data-driven decision support tools. Future plans include using similar methods to develop optimal treatment strategies for cardiogenic shock and insulin dosing for patients on high-dose steroids."
