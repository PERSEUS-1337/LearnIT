    "content": "The tax provisions aimed at short term fiscal stimulus, such as bonus depreciation, were expected to encourage early investment. Evaluating the effects of permanent tax changes on capital allocation involves measuring the effective tax rate on returns to different assets. Efficient capital allocation occurs when all returns are taxed at the same rate and financial decisions are not influenced by the tax code. This report focuses on estimating the effects of these proposals on the effective tax rate on earnings. The report focuses on estimating the effects of tax proposals on the effective tax rate on earnings from prospective investments, taking into account the timing of deductions and the time value of money. Effective tax rates can differ significantly from average tax rates due to the timing of deductions, impacting tax burdens on new investments. The effective tax rates on new investments can be negative even when average tax rates are positive. The main factor affecting the tax burden on new investment is how quickly the asset's cost is recovered through depreciation deductions. Matching tax depreciation with economic depreciation results in taxing investment income at the statutory rate. Depreciation can be influenced by historical acquisition cost, affecting effective tax rates. Higher inflation undermines the real value of depreciation deductions, leading to higher effective tax rates. Shorter-lived investments are more affected by inflation, resulting in a higher effective tax rate. Equipment assets are deducted quickly, lowering the effective tax rate. Buildings are deducted over a longer period. Tax rates can be measured in different ways, with the corporate level tax rate on equity financed investment being calculated next. The tax rate at the corporate level on equity financed investment reflects depreciation rules across asset types like computing equipment and buildings. It also considers the deductibility of interest by corporations and individual income taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains. This measure shows the total burden on corporate investment and the differential between corporate and noncorporate investment tax rates. Tax rates can be separated into debt and equity financed investment to analyze the distortion favoring debt finance. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to tax earnings from different types of capital investment more evenly. Before the act, effective tax rates on earnings varied significantly between equipment assets and buildings. After the act, equipment tax rates were only slightly below the statutory rate due to changes in depreciation rules and the repeal of the investment tax credit. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to equalize taxation on different types of capital investment. Equipment tax rates were slightly below the statutory rate, while buildings were slightly above it. The rationale for equal taxation is to ensure that private markets allocate investment efficiently to produce the highest after-tax returns. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to equalize taxation on different types of capital investment. Legislative changes in 1993 increased effective tax rates, especially for buildings, by raising the top corporate tax rate and extending the useful life for non-residential buildings. Bonus depreciation further favored capital allocation to equipment. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to equalize taxation on different types of capital investment. Legislative changes in 1993 increased effective tax rates, especially for buildings, by raising the top corporate tax rate and extending the useful life for non-residential buildings. The write-off period had a small effect on tax rates, with a slight increase for affected assets. The decline in inflation rates benefited all assets, with equipment and shorter-lived assets receiving the most benefit. Buildings are taxed slightly above the statutory rate, while equipment is taxed well below it. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to equalize taxation on different types of capital investment. Legislative changes in 1993 increased effective tax rates, especially for buildings, by raising the top corporate tax rate and extending the useful life for non-residential buildings. On average, equipment effective tax rates are only 26%, or about three quarters of the statutory rate. Structures overall are taxed at 32% but that average reflects favorable treatment for mining, farm, and public utility structures. Tables 1 and 2 illustrate the effects of bonus depreciation, reducing effective tax rates for equipment. Unlike investment credits, bonus depreciation cannot reduce tax rates on equity investment below zero. Capital gains relief favors debt at the corporate level and equity at the individual level due to lower tax rates and deferred taxes. Recent revisions lowered the tax rate on capital gains and extended lower rates to dividends, favoring equity investments. The recent revisions in tax rates favored equity investments by lowering the tax rate on capital gains and extending lower rates to dividends. The effective tax rate on debt vs. equity is complex due to tax favored forms of individual investment like pensions and IRAs, where individual tax rates are effectively zero. Incorporating these effects shows that current tax rates are lower and changes in individual tax rates are less significant. Table 3 presents estimated effective tax rates on debt and equity under various scenarios. Without tax favored forms of individual investment, debt and equity are compared under different tax rates, including those from the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. The reduction in debt-equity distortion is small due to lower individual tax rates and bonus depreciation benefits for both. A more meaningful comparison is the tax wedge, where a debt financed return must exceed the after tax return by 19% and an equity financed return by 82%. The difference between the two is 63%. The new tax rates reduce the difference between debt and equity returns by 11%, with bonus depreciation contributing an additional 7%. When considering pensions and IRAs, the impact on the gap is minimal, with a combined change of 15%. The distortion between debt and equity due to individual rate changes is very small, as they benefit both forms of investment. The corporate tax discourages investment in the corporate sector, with small changes in the effective tax rate compared to the non-corporate sector. Calculations consider individual tax rates for pensions and IRAs, but non-corporate investment may not be a viable alternative for passive entities like pension plans. The relevant measure may be tax rates without these effects for taxable accounts making investment choices. The analysis suggests a small reduction in the tax differential between corporate and non-corporate investments, regardless of bonus depreciation rules. All forms of business investment benefit from bonus depreciation, with dividend relief provisions and lower capital gains tax rates benefiting corporate equity. Lower individual tax rates benefit corporate and non-corporate debt and non-corporate equity. The dividend relief provision reduces the favorable treatment of retained earnings by lowering the tax rate on dividends to the tax rate on capital gains. The tax rate on dividends was previously as high as 39.6%, while the top tax on capital gains was fixed at 20%. However, with tax deferral and the dividend relief provision, both rates are lowered to 15%, reducing the tax rate on capital gains to about 7%. This narrows the gap between the two rates compared to previous law. The reduction in distortions and magnitude of the dividend rate would be halved if assets in non-taxable accounts like pensions and IRAs were included. Effective tax rates for new investments must consider tax rates on corporate and non-corporate investments, owner-occupied housing, and business inventories. Business inventories are taxed slightly higher, while owner-occupied housing is typically tax-free. The effective tax rates depend on individual tax rates on funds invested in pensions and IRAs, and how much individuals are willing to substitute between savings within and outside these plans. The effective tax rates on capital investments are significantly reduced by individual tax rate reductions, with a range of 10% to 15%. Bonus depreciation also lowers effective tax rates by 7% to 9%, regardless of the tax regime. Including assets in non-taxable accounts like pensions and IRAs further reduces distortions and the magnitude of the dividend rate. The reduction in effective tax rates for capital investments is significant, ranging from 10% to 15% due to individual tax rate reductions. Bonus depreciation further lowers rates by 7% to 9%. Proposed bills aim to repeal the illegal export subsidy provision, impacting corporate tax rates. Chairman Thomas's 2003 bill includes provisions for shorter recovery periods for manufacturing equipment and extending 50% bonus depreciation. The provision in Chairman Thomas's 2003 bill includes a shorter recovery period for manufacturing equipment and extends 50% bonus depreciation. This would increase the differences between equipment and structures within manufacturing, favoring manufacturing in general. The overall effects on tax burdens are small as these provisions only cover a portion of equipment assets. The overall rate reduction in the industry is about 1.5 percentage points with no bonus depreciation, affecting corporate tax rates by less than half a percentage point. H.R. 2896 and Senator Hatch's bill proposed provisions to lower effective tax rates, with a small overall effect due to corporate assets being half of the total capital stock. Senator Hatch's bill, S. 1495, proposed 100% expensing to reduce equipment investment tax rates to zero, similar to H.R. 2896. Another bill, H.R. 1769, co-sponsored by Representatives Crane and Rangel, aimed to provide a deduction of up to 10% of income from domestic production, multiplied by the share of total business that is domestic. This would result in an effective rate for domestic earnings of 5% and an overall deduction of 2.5%. Based on IRS data, controlled foreign manufacturing corporations accounted for 82% of receipts and 87% of assets of American manufacturing corporations in 1998. The proposed tax rate cut would lower the tax rate on manufacturing by 9%, resulting in an effective rate of 32%. This reduction would narrow the gap between equipment and structures in the industry. The proposed tax rate cut would narrow the gap between equipment and structures in the manufacturing industry, favoring investment in domestic manufacturing. It would result in a reduction in effective tax rate of about 1.5 percentage points for manufacturing plant and equipment investment, similar to the depreciation provisions in the 2003 Thomas bill. Additionally, investment in inventories would benefit from the reduction in tax rate. Overall, the reduction in the total tax rate in the economy would be less than a quarter of a percent. The final bill proposes a larger tax rate reduction for a broader range of productive activities, with a 9% deduction for qualified production income. Production property includes domestic film, energy, construction, and certain services, excluding specific activities like food sales and electricity distribution. The deduction is limited to 50% of wages and excludes sole proprietorships without wages. The Joint Tax Committee estimated that under the provision, three quarters of the benefit would go to corporations, 12% to Subchapter S firms, 9% to partnerships, and 4% to sole proprietorships. The overall effect on the economy is small, around \u00bd of one percent. The effects of faster depreciation of equipment and a rate cut are similar in size and impact on the economy. The provisions in the bills reduce taxes in the manufacturing sector and favor that industry over others. The accelerated depreciation for equipment increases favoritism for equipment but does not reduce debt-equity distortion. The corporate rate cut reduces differences between tax rates across assets and debt distortion. The Crane-Rangel bill encourages more investment in the United States. The 2003 House bill contained provisions aimed at reducing tax burdens, including a depreciation provision for new investments. It also included measures to lower tax rates for leasehold improvements and restaurants. Additionally, there were provisions for small businesses such as a lower corporate tax rate. The 2003 House bill aimed at small businesses with provisions like a lower corporate tax rate and temporary increase in equipment investment deduction. These measures would encourage investment in small corporations and favor equipment investment for certain small businesses. The bill also included provisions to reduce taxes on income from overseas investments. The 2001-2003 temporary tax cuts had mixed effects on the economy, with some provisions favoring certain businesses and investments. The final bill aimed to address tax shelter issues and included international provisions. H.R. 2896 lost $128 billion over 10 years, while S. 1637 was roughly revenue neutral. The tax cuts for capital income aimed to reduce distortions favoring consumption over investment. Tax cuts for capital income increase saving and debt-financed tax cuts could reduce the national savings rate. Capital income tax cuts also impact owner-occupied housing. Dividend relief provision is efficient for business capital allocation, while reducing individual tax rates favors debt finance and noncorporate investment. Bonus depreciation, if permanent, expands favorable treatment of equipment investments over structures without reducing distortions. The revisions in the bills addressing the ETI provision favor manufacturing and other eligible activities by expanding favorable treatment of equipment. However, the overall effects outside of that sector are minimal. Making temporary provisions permanent or enacting new ones may have other considerations aside from efficiency, such as credibility of the government and its ability to manage fiscal policy in the future. Temporary investment stimulus like bonus depreciation is more effective if temporary, as making it permanent could undermine government credibility. The effectiveness of a temporary investment stimulus depends on investors believing it to be temporary. Transforming a temporary stimulus into a permanent one may affect firm managers' beliefs in future temporary stimuli. Tax revisions can impact revenue base and tax burdens, with some adding to administrative costs. Tax rate cuts in manufacturing may create classification issues and opportunities for tax sheltering. The tax rates in this paper are calculated by determining the initial investment needed to break even, eliminating tax payments and deductions, and using pre-tax flows to find the pre-tax discount rate. Effective tax rate is calculated as pretax rate of return minus after tax rate of return, divided by pretax rate. Discounting involves dividing each flow by a discount factor based on the discount rate. The formula for calculating the pre-tax return in continuous compounding is (1) r = ( R + d )( 1 \u2013 u z ) / ( 1 \u2013 u ) - d, where R is the after-tax discount rate, d is the economic depreciation rate, u is the statutory tax rate, and z is the present value of depreciation deductions. The effective tax rate for equity at the firm level is ( r \u2013 R ) / r, and when individual level taxes and debt finance are included, the tax rate is determined by r = f ( i ( 1 \u2013 u ) \u2013 \u03c0) + ( 1 \u2013 f ) E, where f is the share debt financed, i is the nominal interest rate, and E is the real return to equity before individual tax but after corporate tax. The after-tax real return formula includes factors like effective tax rates and capital gains tax. Assumptions for analysis include interest rate, inflation, and corporate tax rate. Data sources and methodology details can be found in [author name scrubbed], The Economic Effects of Taxing Capital Income, MIT Press, 1994. The lower individual tax rates on dividends and capital gains decrease from 26% to 15%. Half of corporate stock is sold, with the remaining half held until death. Half of financial assets are held in tax-exempt forms. Data sources for analyzing the Crane-Rangel bill were taken from John Comisky and the IRS."
