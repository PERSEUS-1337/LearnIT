    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Public-Private Partnership Advisory Council to End Human Trafficking Act\". Congress finds that an estimated 20.9 million people are enslaved in human trafficking worldwide, with slavery being a $150 billion industry. The Department of State defines trafficking in persons as the act of recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining a person for compelled labor or commercial sex acts through force, fraud, or coercion. Approximately 2 million enslaved individuals are children forced into sex slavery, with child sex slaves facing rape as many as 10 to 15 times per night. Although many developed regions and countries meet the standards of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), there are developing countries that do not attempt to meet these standards or lack the necessary resources for effective anti-trafficking measures. Slavery is illegal worldwide, yet it persists in every country, with no country immune to the consequences of modern slavery. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
