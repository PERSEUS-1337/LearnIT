    "content": "The \"Election Infrastructure and Security Promotion Act of 2016\" establishes national standards for voting system security, transparency, and verification of ballot counting. It includes definitions of critical infrastructure, designation of voting systems as critical infrastructure, and requirements for states to comply with security standards in federal elections. The text outlines the development of standards for election infrastructure and security, including the definition of critical infrastructure and the designation of voting systems as critical infrastructure. It also includes requirements for states to comply with security standards in federal elections. SEC. 102. DESIGNATION OF VOTING SYSTEMS AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. The Secretary of Homeland Security designates voting systems as critical infrastructure, includes threats in national planning scenarios, and educates election officials about voting system threats. SEC. 103. VOTING SYSTEM THREAT AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with relevant agencies, will conduct research to mitigate voting systems threats. This includes analyzing risks, identifying vulnerable assets, and evaluating emergency planning and response. The Secretary of Homeland Security will evaluate emergency planning and response technologies to address threats to voting systems. This includes analyzing technology options to improve critical infrastructure resiliency and assessing restoration and recovery capabilities under different levels of damage. A comprehensive plan will be submitted to relevant committees in Congress. The Secretary of Homeland Security will submit a comprehensive plan to protect and prepare voting system infrastructure against threats, in consultation with relevant agencies and election officials. The plan will be updated biennially. National standards for voting system security will be developed under Title II, with a focus on the development of standards. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will develop standards for the operational security of voting systems used in Federal elections, including physical and cybersecurity measures. The standards will include specific security requirements for individual components of voting systems and interoperability based on established data standards. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will develop voting system standards, including security measures and data standards. Systems for casting or tabulating votes cannot be connected to the internet or have wireless communication devices. The Director must establish these standards within a year of the Act's enactment, with the ability to update them as needed. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 requires states to comply with security standards in the administration of elections for federal office. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will develop these standards, which must be followed by states operating voting systems. Additionally, the Act incorporates these standards into the certification and testing of voting systems. Section 231(a) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 is amended to ensure compliance with operational security standards for voting systems. Testing and certification will be conducted to determine if voting systems meet the security requirements developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology under the Election Infrastructure and Security Promotion Act of 2016. National standards for transparency and verification of ballot counting are outlined in Title III. Section 301 focuses on the development of these standards. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology is tasked with developing standards to ensure transparent ballot counting in Federal elections. These standards include providing evidence for public verification of election results and safeguarding voter anonymity. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology is responsible for developing standards for voting systems used in Federal elections. Election officials must make all relevant components of the voting system available for testing by other parties. The deadline for initial standards is one year after the enactment of the Act, with updates allowed as deemed necessary by the Director. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology is responsible for developing standards for voting systems used in Federal elections. Election officials must make all relevant components of the voting system available for testing by other parties, including source code, build tools, test plans, and software specifications. SEC. 302 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 requires states to comply with transparency and ballot verification standards in the administration of elections for federal office. The standards are developed by the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology under the Election Infrastructure and Security Promotion Act of 2016. SEC. 401 of TITLE IV focuses on innovative election technology research and development. The National Science Foundation, in collaboration with DARPA, will establish an election technology innovation program to develop hardware and software for various voting processes. This program may also support research on other election technology elements. The NSF will work with the EAC and NIST to ensure developed technologies meet requirements. Technologies developed under this program must adhere to standards set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and be available for use by government entities at no cost."
