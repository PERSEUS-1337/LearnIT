    "content": "The poverty rate among Americans aged 65 and older has decreased by nearly 70% in the last five decades, with 4.7 million individuals in this age group living below the federal poverty thresholds in 2017. Government programs like Social Security and Supplemental Security Income have helped increase incomes for older Americans. However, certain groups such as widows, divorced women, and never married individuals are still at risk of poverty. Congress may consider the impact of current poverty reduction programs and potential proposals to improve income for vulnerable older Americans. The report compares official aged poverty measures with the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) and analyzes the impact of federal cash benefits, taxes, and in-kind benefits on aged poverty. Poverty status is determined by comparing family resources against needs, with families below a certain dollar amount considered in poverty. The official poverty measure is based on poverty thresholds developed in the 1960s, reflecting deprivation based on a restrictive food budget. Family resources are measured in dollars based on cash income before taxes. Poverty data are estimates subject to sampling error, with limitations discussed by the poverty research community for decades. The official poverty measure has limitations due to its use of pretax income, not considering in-kind benefits, and not accurately reflecting current costs of basic needs. New data sources have provided more detail on family consumption, leading to the development of the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) was developed after decades of research and discussion to provide a more accurate measure of poverty in the United States. Despite limitations, the official poverty measure has shown a significant decline in the poverty rate among Americans aged 65 and older over the past 50 years. In 1966, 28.5% of older Americans lived in poverty, compared to 9.2% in 2017. The number of elderly people living in poverty has increased since the mid-1970s, with 4.7 million aged 65 and older below the poverty thresholds in 2017. The poverty rate for this age group is now the lowest among adults aged 18 to 64 and children under 18. In 1966, 28.5% of elderly persons were in poverty, compared to 10.5% for adults and 17.6% for children. By the early 1990s, the elderly poverty rate had fallen below the rates for adults and children. The poverty rate among Americans aged 65 and older was 9.2% in 2017, lower than the rates for adults aged 18 to 64 and children under 18. Poverty status among the elderly varies by demographic groups such as age, gender, marital status, and race. People aged 80 and older have a higher poverty rate than those under 80. In 1975, the poverty rate for the oldest age group (80 and older) was 21.5%, compared to 16.4% for those aged 75-79. In 2017, the poverty rate for individuals aged 80 and older was 11.6%, a decrease from 21.5% in 1975. Women in this age group had the highest poverty rate among elderly women and men. Older individuals face income risks due to lower earnings, retirement resource depletion, reduced pension purchasing power, and higher medical expenses. In 2017, the poverty rate among women aged 80 and older was 13.5%, compared to 8.7% for men in the same age group and 8.6% for women aged 65-69. Poverty rates for individuals aged 80 and older vary based on living arrangements, with lower rates for those living with family members. Married older Americans generally had a lower poverty rate than those who were not married. In 2017, married older Americans had a lower poverty rate compared to nonmarried individuals. The poverty rate among aged nonmarried Americans decreased from 23.4% to 15.5% between 1975 and 2017. Married couples generally have significantly lower poverty rates than nonmarried individuals, with widowed and divorced women aged 65 or older being more likely to be in poverty than their male counterparts. In 2017, poverty rates varied among older individuals based on marital status and presence of children. Among aged men and women, poverty rates were higher for never-married individuals with children compared to those without children. Married individuals with children also had higher poverty rates than those without children. In 2017, poverty rates among older individuals varied based on marital status, presence of children, race, and Hispanic origin. Widows and divorced women with children had higher poverty rates than those without children, while the pattern was reversed for men. Poverty rates decreased among Americans aged 65 and older identifying as black or African American alone, non-Hispanic white alone, and Hispanic from 1975 to 2017. The poverty rate among older individuals decreased from 36.3% in 1975 to 19.3% in 2017. Among different racial and Hispanic origin groups, poverty rates varied, with the lowest rate among aged non-Hispanic white individuals and the highest among aged black individuals. Social Security and Supplemental Security Income are the main federal programs providing cash benefits to the aged poor, with Social Security accounting for a significant portion of their income. Social Security is a federal program that provides benefits to insured workers and their eligible family members. It is not solely for the poor, but benefits are weighted to replace a greater share of earnings for low-paid workers. Increased Social Security benefits have been linked to a decline in poverty among the aged from 1967 to 2000. Social Security benefits alone are not enough to lift a significant number of older Americans out of poverty. The poverty rate among Social Security beneficiaries aged 65 and older was 6.5% in 2017. Without Social Security benefits, 30.0% of Americans aged 65 and older would live in poverty. SSI is a federal assistance program that provides cash benefits to aged, blind, and disabled individuals with limited income and assets. The SSI program provides income support to elderly and disabled individuals with limited income. However, studies show that the maximum SSI benefit may not effectively protect the oldest Americans from poverty. Restructuring the Social Security special minimum benefit provision could be more effective in alleviating poverty. The federal government offers noncash benefits like housing subsidies and SNAP to assist elderly individuals with limited income. Various programs, including tax credits and food assistance, provide additional support for individuals aged 65 and older. The official poverty measure, established in the 1960s, determines poverty based on pretax money income falling below a threshold. However, it does not account for noncash benefits like health insurance or SNAP, leading to criticisms of its accuracy. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) addresses these shortcomings and evaluates the impact of federal programs on poverty among the elderly population. The Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) was created in 2011 to address the limitations of the official poverty measure. It considers taxes, noncash benefits, and various expenses to determine poverty thresholds based on a family's standard of living. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) for persons aged 65 and older in 2017 showed a poverty rate of 14.1%, higher than the official measure of 9.2%, mainly due to higher medical out-of-pocket costs. Excluding certain resources like Social Security can significantly impact the poverty rate among the aged population. Excluding Social Security as a resource would increase the SPM aged poverty rate by over 34.6%. Other resources like SSI, housing subsidies, and SNAP also impact the poverty rate, but to a much lesser extent. Child-related resources and tax credits play a role, while medical out-of-pocket costs have the largest effect on the SPM poverty rate. Medical costs had the largest impact on the SPM poverty rate for the aged population, raising it by 5.4% when deducted from family income. Other costs related to work had a smaller effect, affecting the poverty rate by less than one percentage point. Approximately 1.2 million persons aged 65 or older are in nursing homes, but poverty status is not measured for this institutionalized population. Approximately 1.2 million persons aged 65 or older are in nursing homes, which is about one-fourth the number of elderly in poverty in 2017. Health status indirectly affects income and well-being, but the economic aspect is primarily measured in poverty rates. Medicaid plays a crucial role in providing long-term care for the aged population. Medicaid for the elderly goes beyond medical needs, also addressing economic value."
