    "content": "The \"PILT Fairness Act of 2002\" ensures full funding for Payments in Lieu of Taxes and protects the local tax base as part of federal land acquisition. The \"PILT Fairness Act of 2002\" guarantees full funding for Payments in Lieu of Taxes and safeguards the local tax base during federal land acquisition. When a Federal land management agency acquires private land, the local government can elect to receive a one-time payment to offset long-term revenue loss. If a unit of general local government receives a one-time payment for land acquired by a Federal agency, the land will not be considered entitlement land for financial purposes. This is in accordance with the PILT Fairness Act of 2002, which ensures full funding for Payments in Lieu of Taxes and protects the local tax base during federal land acquisitions. The PILT Fairness Act of 2002 ensures full funding for Payments in Lieu of Taxes and protects the local tax base during federal land acquisitions completed after September 30, 1998. The Act does not affect any right, title, or interest of the United States in or to the land acquired. SEC. 4. ONE-TIME PAYMENT. If a local government elects to receive a one-time payment for land acquired by a Federal agency, the payment must be made before the acquisition can occur. The payment amount should be enough to generate a perpetual revenue stream equal to the current property taxes for the land, calculated as an annuity based on the average yield on U.S. obligations with a 10-year maturity. The payment for land acquired by a Federal agency must generate a perpetual revenue stream equal to current property taxes, based on tax rates and land valuation at the time of acquisition. This includes offsets for property taxes related to improvements or business use on the acquired lands. If the lands are acquired from tax-exempt entities, the Federal agency must follow specific acquisition methods. The payment required for land acquired by a Federal agency must match current property taxes and be made before the acquisition. If the lands are acquired from tax-exempt entities, specific acquisition methods must be followed. Payments to local governments for acquired land may be deducted if payments were made after September 30, 1998. Before a Federal land management agency takes possession of land, a connection with land acquisition must be established. Amounts paid to a local government must be deposited into a trust fund, with the principal not to be expended but interest available for governmental purposes. One-time payments under this Act cannot be used to offset payments required under title 31, United States Code. Definitions are provided in section 6. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. This section defines terms such as \"donation,\" \"Federal land management agency,\" and \"unit of general local government.\""
