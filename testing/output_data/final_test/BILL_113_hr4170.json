Congress acknowledges that over 100 million Americans have brain-related conditions, including developmental delays, autism, and psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. These disorders lead to lifelong disabilities and are among the top causes of disability globally. Neuroscience research has the potential to improve the quality of life for those with brain diseases and injuries. The Federal Government is promoting neuroscience and mental health research due to their impact on health and the economy. Various agencies oversee research on the brain and nervous system. Congress directed the establishment of an Interagency Working Group on Neuroscience to make recommendations for future research. The Federal Government is interested in researching early detection, intervention, and prevention of psychosis in light of the role of mental illness in multiple shootings. This includes participation in research programs like the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study and the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia study. The Federal Government is involved in research programs such as the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) and the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) initiative. The Youth Mental Health Research Network is established. The Director of the National Institutes of Health may establish a Youth Mental Health Research Network for youth mental health research and intervention services in collaboration with other national research institutes and centers. The Director of NIH may award cooperative agreements, grants, and contracts for conducting youth mental health research and providing training for researchers. The Director of NIH awards agreements for youth mental health research and training. Research institutions collaborate with the National Institute of Mental Health for interventions and scientific findings. The Director of NIH may award up to 70 entities for conducting research and providing training. Support received should supplement, not replace, other funding. The support duration for an entity can be up to 5 years, extendable if needed. The Director of NIH can award up to 70 entities for research and training, with support lasting up to 5 years, extendable by the Director for additional periods. Coordination among recipients is required, along with periodic reports on activities. Additionally, awards under subsection (a)(3) must include entities focusing on intervention services for severe mental illness. Entities awarded must focus on early detection and intervention of severe mental illness in young people, conduct clinical trials, disseminate findings efficiently, and adhere to specific guidelines and protocols. The Director of NIH will establish a data coordinating center to distribute scientific findings, assist in collaborative research projects, conduct multisite monitoring activities, and help establish patient registries. The Director of NIH will require regular reports from the data coordinating center on research conducted by entities, including enrollment in clinical trials and resource allocation. This information may be included in the Director's biennial reports under the Public Health Service Act. The Public Health Service Act authorizes $25,000,000 for fiscal years 2015 through 2019 for the Director of NIH, national centers, and national research institutes."
