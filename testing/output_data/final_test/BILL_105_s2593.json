    "content": "The \"Worksite Child Care Development Center Act of 1998\" allows for a credit for employer expenses for child care assistance under the new section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The employer-provided child care credit under section 38 includes 50% of various qualified child care expenses incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year. Dollar limitations apply, with a maximum credit of $100,000 for start-up expenses, $25,000 for facility expenses, and unspecified limits for general child care expenses. The qualified child care expenses for the employer-provided child care credit are capped at $50,000 per taxable year. These expenses include reimbursement for child care enabling gainful employment, covering day care, transportation, before and after school care, and holiday programs. The qualified child care expenses for the employer-provided child care credit are capped at $50,000 per taxable year. Expenses must not exceed the fair market value of care provided by a qualified child care facility meeting state and local regulations. The qualified child care expenses for the employer-provided child care credit are capped at $50,000 per taxable year. Expenses must not exceed the fair market value of care provided by a qualified child care facility meeting state and local regulations, including licensing as a child care facility or back-up child care facility. Enrollment in the facility must be open to employees of the taxpayer during the taxable year. The taxpayer can claim a credit for qualified child care expenses if the facility is not their main business, does not favor highly compensated employees, and meets certain requirements. If a child care facility is sponsored by multiple taxpayers, it can still qualify. The term 'qualified child care facility expenses' refers to amounts paid for operating costs, contracts for child care services, and child care resource coordination services. 'Qualified child care facility start-up expenses' include costs for property acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, or expansion. The tax credit can be used to expand property for a qualified child care facility or to acquire equipment and supplies. If a child care facility is sponsored by multiple taxpayers, the credit is determined based on their contributions. The tax credit for a qualified child care facility can be apportioned among multiple taxpayers. If there is a recapture event with respect to the facility, the taxpayer's tax will be increased by a certain percentage of the decrease in credits allowed for prior years. The applicable recapture percentage for a qualified child care facility is determined from a table in subsection (c)(4) if there is a recapture event. The recapture percentage for a qualified child care facility varies depending on the year of the recapture event, starting at 100% in Years 1-3 and decreasing to 0% in Year 10 and thereafter. Year 1 begins on the first day of the taxable year when the qualified child care facility is put into service by the taxpayer. A recapture event includes the cessation of facility operation or a change in ownership of the facility with the credit allowable under subsection (a). The taxpayer acquiring an interest in a facility can avoid recapture liability if they agree in writing to assume the liability of the previous owner. The acquiring taxpayer will be treated as the taxpayer for recapture liability purposes. The tax for the taxable year will only be increased for credits allowed by this section. The increase in tax under this subsection will not affect credits not used to reduce tax liability, and adjustments will be made to carryforwards and carrybacks. Additionally, the increase in tax will not be considered for determining the amount of any credit under certain parts of the tax code. Furthermore, the increase in tax will not apply if a qualified child care facility ceases operation due to a casualty loss that is later restored. The tax credit for casualty losses can be restored by reconstruction or replacement within a set period. Special rules apply for single employers, estates, trusts, and partnerships. No double benefit is allowed through reduction in basis. The basis of property is reduced by the amount of any credit determined under this section. If there is a recapture amount for property with reduced basis, the basis is increased by that recapture amount. The term 'recapture amount' refers to any increase in tax determined under subsection (e). No other deductions or credits are allowed with respect to the credit determined under this section. This section does not apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2008. Amendments are made to Section 38(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The employer-provided child care credit under section 45D is added as a new paragraph. Amendments are made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The employer-provided child care credit under section 45D applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1998."
