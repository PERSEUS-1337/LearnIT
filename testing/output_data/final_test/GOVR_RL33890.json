    "content": "The United States has a \"classical\" system for taxing corporate income, with a separate corporate income tax of 35% on most corporate taxable income. Federal corporate tax revenue has varied between 1% and just over 2% of GDP since 1980, with an increase in FY 2005 and 2007 to 2.3% and 2.7% of GDP. Corporate tax receipts saw an increase in FY 2005 and 2007, reaching 2.3% and 2.7% of GDP, attributed to strong economic growth. However, projections show a decline in future years towards historical averages. Certain businesses, like partnerships and \"S\" corporations, are not subject to corporate income tax. Chairman Charles Rangel introduced H.R. 3970, the Tax Reduction and Reform Act, which includes provisions for individuals and businesses. The bill aims to reduce the alternative minimum tax for individuals and extend expiring tax benefits. For businesses, it proposes a cut in the corporate tax rate and an increase in the expensing benefit for small business investments. The bill's business provisions could reduce tax revenue by $8.7 billion over 5 years and $1.0 billion over 10 years. The bill proposes a reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate, replacing the top two rates with a single 30.5% rate. This rate cut would reduce revenue by an estimated $151.7 billion over five years. Another tax cut in the proposal would make permanent a temporary increase in the \"expensing\" benefit for equipment investment by small businesses. The bill proposes to extend temporary business tax benefits that expired in 2007, with revenue-raising items increasing business taxes by $164.0 billion over five years. The largest revenue-raising item is the repeal of the 9% deduction for domestic production. The proposal includes a 4.5 percentage-point tax-rate reduction, a revenue raiser for multinational firms deferring U.S. taxes on foreign-source income, and repealing the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) accounting method. Congress has a long-standing interest in small business tax policy, with tax cuts being considered to offset the cost burden of a higher minimum wage. The Senate approved a bill with tax benefits for small businesses to offset the cost of a higher minimum wage. The House later approved a smaller tax bill for small businesses. Both chambers included tax provisions in an appropriations bill, which was vetoed by President Bush. A modified appropriations bill was later approved with the tax provisions intact. The Small Business and Work Opportunity Tax Act, included in a modified appropriations bill (H.R. 2206), provided tax cuts totaling $7.1 billion over 5 years and $4.8 billion over 10 years. The revenue offsets amounted to $7.0 billion over 5 years and $4.4 billion over 10 years, resulting in a net revenue gain of $71 million over 5 years and $55 million over 10 years. The Senate version of the bill had larger tax cuts and revenue offsets compared to the House bill. The House bill included tax cuts targeted at small businesses, with a key provision being the extension of the \"expensing\" tax benefit for business investments in machines and equipment. This tax benefit allows firms to deduct a capped amount of investment outlays in the first year, benefiting small businesses with investments below a certain threshold. The expensing allowance is capped at $25,000 per year and begins to phase out when a firm's investment exceeds $200,000. Temporary rules enacted in 2003 increased the annual cap and threshold. The expensing tax benefit for business investments was increased in 2003 and extended multiple times, with the most recent extension in 2006 by TIPRA. The allowance was raised to $125,000 with a phase-out threshold of $500,000. Another temporary tax benefit addressed was the work opportunity tax credit (WOTC), which allows employers to claim a tax credit for hiring certain targeted groups. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) was extended through August 2011 by P.L. 110-28, with modifications to qualification criteria for targeted groups. The act adjusted the tax credit against FICA taxes for employees receiving tips to prevent the new minimum wage from reducing the credit. Despite the minimum wage increase to $7.25, the credit continued to be calculated based on the prior law's minimum wage to maintain its value. The Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act of 2008 (H.R. 5140) introduced provisions to offset alternative minimum tax with FICA credit and WOTC. It also raised the age for the \"kiddie tax\" provision and extended the period for unpaid taxes before interest and penalties are applied. This was in response to signs of economic slowdown and a possible recession. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (H.R. 5140) was passed into law as P.L. 110-185, providing tax cuts totaling $134 billion over 5 years and $124.5 billion over 10 years. The bill included rebates for retirees and business tax cuts estimated to reduce federal revenue by $17 billion over 5 years and $7.5 billion over 10 years. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (H.R. 5140) provided tax cuts totaling $134 billion over 5 years and $124.5 billion over 10 years. It included provisions for temporary increases in expensing of certain depreciable business assets and bonus depreciation for property acquired in 2008. The bill also renewed agriculture-related programs at a cost of $289 million. The Energy Act of 2008 renewed agriculture-related programs at a cost of $289 billion over 5 years and $605 billion over 10 years. It included tax credits for fuels from alternative sources, estimated to increase federal revenue by $1 billion over 10 years. The tax code has temporary tax benefits designed to encourage specific investments or activities. The R&E tax credit provides businesses with a tax benefit linked to their increase in research spending, based on the idea that free markets do not operate smoothly in research and development. The R&E tax credit, extended by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, provides firms with additional tax savings for research spending. There is interest in making the tax credit permanent, as temporary nature necessitates periodic action by Congress to prevent expiration. The R&E tax credit, extended by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, provides firms with additional tax savings for research spending. A one-year extension of expiring tax provisions, including the R&E tax credit, was proposed in the Tax Reduction and Reform Act. The Temporary Tax Relief Act aimed to extend expiring provisions and reduce the individual alternative minimum tax for one year. The Energy and Tax Extenders Act of 2008 continued to address extenders, passing in the House on May 21, 2008. The Energy and Tax Extenders Act of 2008, passed in the House on May 21, 2008, extends temporary tax provisions through 2008. S. 2886, the Alternative Minimum Tax and Extenders Tax Relief Act of 2008, proposes a two-year extension through 2009 for most provisions. Democratic leaders focused on energy taxation in 2007, aiming to scale back tax cuts for petroleum firms and promote energy conservation. H.R. 6, passed in January 2007, addressed these goals with tax and non-tax measures. The Energy and Tax Extenders Act of 2008 extended temporary tax provisions through 2008. The Senate considered its own version of H.R. 6, which included non-tax provisions related to energy efficiency and renewable energy. The Senate Finance Committee approved a tax package with revenue-raising items and provisions for conservation and alternative energy sources. The House Ways and Means Committee approved H.R. 2776, focused solely on energy tax provisions. The House bill, approved on August 4, 2007, contains a mix of revenue raisers and tax benefits, similar to the Finance Committee measure. Both bills aim for revenue neutrality over 10 years, with the Finance Committee bill totaling $32 billion in revenue effects and the House bill totaling $15 billion. The House bill and the Finance Committee's version both include tax benefits and revenue raisers, aiming for revenue neutrality over 10 years. The tax credit for energy production from renewable sources is extended and modified, with the Finance Committee's version resulting in a larger revenue loss. Both bills deny the Section 199 domestic production deduction to certain oil- and gas-related income. The House bill and the Finance Committee's version aim for revenue neutrality over 10 years. They deny the Section 199 domestic production deduction to certain oil and gas income. Congress may also target corporate tax shelters for increased revenues due to concerns about tax equity and fairness. Tax shelters are transactions that reduce taxes without reducing return or increasing risk. They can be legal tax avoidance or illegal tax evasion. Congress has enacted restrictions on tax shelters, such as the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 which targeted specific tax shelters like leasing activities and built-in losses. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act (TIPRA) in 2006 included provisions to restrict tax sheltering activities, such as clarifying the economic substance doctrine. This doctrine disallows tax benefits for transactions lacking economic substance. The Senate version of TIPRA aimed to integrate this doctrine into the tax code, but the provisions were not included in the final bill. Several bills in the 110th Congress have included codification of the economic substance doctrine as a revenue-raising \"offset\" for tax cuts. Congress may also consider the tax treatment of U.S. firms' foreign income to generate additional tax revenue, with a focus on international taxation to address concerns about promoting foreign \"outsourcing\" of U.S. jobs. Economic theory questions the long-term impact of tax policy on domestic employment by U.S. multinationals, but acknowledges short-term and localized effects. Taxes can impact firms' overseas operations. The tax benefit \"deferral\" incentivizes U.S. firms to invest overseas in countries with low tax rates. Deferral allows postponing U.S. tax on foreign income reinvested abroad. Proposals to restrict deferral may expand income subject to taxation. Recent legislation has focused on expanding deferral and cutting taxes for overseas operations. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and TIPRA in 2006 made changes to taxes on overseas operations, with analysts debating the effectiveness of taxing overseas operations in the modern economy. Tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 focused more on individual income taxes than corporate taxes. The tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 primarily targeted individual income taxes over corporate taxes, with measures such as reductions in tax rates, cuts for married couples, and expansion of the child tax credit. Business tax cuts in subsequent legislation aimed at spurring investment, capital formation, and competitiveness through provisions like bonus depreciation, capital gains reductions, and extenders. The impact of investment incentives on the economy's capital stock, the effectiveness of business tax cuts in stimulating the economy, and the overall fairness of the tax system were key questions raised. Enacted Legislation The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 (JCWA; P.L. 107-147) included temporary \"bonus\" depreciation provisions allowing firms to deduct an additional 30% of property costs in the first year of service. This provision applied to machines and equipment placed in service after September 11, 2001, and before January 1, 2005. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 (JCWA; P.L. 107-147) included temporary provisions for bonus depreciation, allowing firms to deduct an additional 30% of property costs in the first year of service. The act also extended the net operating loss carryback period to five years for losses in 2001 and 2002, and extended expiring tax benefits for business taxes. Additionally, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA; P.L. 108-27) contained business provisions, including tax cuts for dividends and capital gains to reduce the tax burden on stockholders' corporate-source income. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA) aimed to reduce double-taxation by cutting taxes on dividends and capital gains. It also increased bonus depreciation and small-business investment allowances temporarily. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) addressed a dispute with the EU over U.S. tax benefits for exporting. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) repealed the U.S. tax benefit for exporting (ETI provisions) to comply with WTO agreements. It introduced new business tax cuts, including a domestic production deduction and tax cuts for multinational firms. AJCA also extended the small business expensing allowance temporarily. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2006 extended reduced rates for dividends and capital gains through 2010, along with the $100,000 small-business expensing allowance through 2009. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 extended expiring provisions through 2007."
