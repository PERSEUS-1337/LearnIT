Eligible organizations affiliated with major sports leagues or golf associations in California can conduct raffles for charitable purposes if they meet specific qualifications. Raffles in California for charitable purposes must meet specific qualifications, including unique ticket identifiers, manual draw for winners, no use of random number generators, and prizes comprising 50% of gross receipts. In California, raffles for charitable purposes require unique ticket identifiers, manual draws supervised by a person affiliated with the organization, and registered with the Department of Justice. Fifty percent of raffle ticket sales must benefit charitable purposes in California, excluding benefits for organization members. Funds raised cannot be used outside of California, and other sources can cover raffle administration costs. An employee of an eligible organization selling raffle tickets is not considered an employee for workers' compensation if their pay is based on sales, not hours worked, and there is a written contract stating they are not an employee. The seller is classified as a direct seller under specific conditions. (e) Compensation for operating a raffle must be received by an employee of the eligible organization conducting the raffle, and cannot come from funds designated for charitable purposes. Raffle tickets cannot be sold in exchange for Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, and gaming machines defined as slot machines cannot be used in the raffle. Raffles permitted under this section cannot be conducted or sell tickets within certain licensed facilities or gambling establishments. Raffles cannot be operated over the Internet, including selling or redeeming tickets. Eligible organizations can advertise raffles online but must not accept entries through the Internet. Information that can be shared online includes prize details, winner lists, rules, FAQs, and downloadable entry forms for manual completion.

Eligible organizations must annually report gross receipts and direct costs from raffles for the last three fiscal years. The report must include details on the purposes of raffle proceeds, distributions to support charitable causes, distributions to raffle winners, distributions to other organizations or purposes, and a schedule of distributions to eligible recipient organizations not affiliated with the organization.

The department must make reports available to the public online via the Attorney General\u2019s Registry of Charitable Trusts. They will provide registrants with a form annually to collect necessary information. Legal action may be taken against registrants for violations or conduct not in the public's best interests. An action and hearing to deny, revoke, or suspend a registry must follow the Administrative Procedure Act. The department can impose fines for violations and seek recovery of investigation costs. Judicial review is available, and violations are not considered criminal offenses. The section will be in effect until December 31, 2018, and will be repealed unless a later statute extends the date before that."
