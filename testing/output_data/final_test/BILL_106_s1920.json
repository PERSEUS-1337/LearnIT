    "content": "The Money Laundering Abatement Act of 1999 may be cited as such. The purpose of the Act is to address findings related to money laundering. The Money Laundering Abatement Act of 1999 addresses the serious problem of money laundering, which allows criminals to hide the source of their profits. Money laundering through banks undermines the integrity of financial institutions. US financial institutions play a crucial role in combating money laundering. Corrupt officials worldwide use sophisticated schemes to conceal plundered wealth, weakening foreign states and international financial markets. The Money Laundering Abatement Act of 1999 aims to address weaknesses in Federal law that allow money laundering to thrive, especially in private banking activities. Private banking, a growing sector in US financial institutions, is susceptible to money laundering due to high profitability, competition, secrecy, and trust relationships with clients. US bankers using financial centers with weak regulations outside the country facilitate global money laundering. SEC. 3. IDENTIFICATION OF ACTUAL OR BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF ACCOUNTS.

Customers cannot be informed of the existence or means of identifying these accounts. SEC. 5A. DUE DILIGENCE REQUIRED FOR PRIVATE BANKING: An amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act now mandates due diligence procedures for private banking transactions. Private banking institutions must establish due diligence procedures for opening and reviewing accounts of private banking customers to comply with anti-money laundering regulations.
