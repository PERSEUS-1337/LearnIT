    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Railroad Grade Crossing Safety and Research Act of 1994\". An Institute for Railroad and Grade Crossing Safety is established. The Act establishes an Institute for Railroad and Grade Crossing Safety, which will focus on reducing fatalities and injuries in rail operations through research, development, and testing of safety measures. $1,000,000 is authorized for the Institute annually from 1996 to 2000, with reports to be submitted to the Secretary of Transportation and Congress. Railroad grade crossing, trespassing, and vandalism prevention strategy is outlined in Section 3 of the Act. The Secretary will evaluate current codes on trespass and vandalism on railroad property, develop model prevention and enforcement codes, and create an outreach program to improve communication among relevant parties for addressing these issues. The program aims to increase awareness of trespassing on railroad rights-of-way, develop prevention strategies, and enforce laws related to railroad trespass and vandalism. A trespasser is defined as someone on railroad property used in operations where their presence is prohibited. The Secretary will amend regulations to impose a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for vandalism of railroad grade crossing signal systems. Additionally, a civil penalty of up to $2,500 will be imposed for trespassing on railroad property. SEC. 6. The Secretary will allow railroads to warn the public about civil liability for violations related to vandalism and trespass on railroad property. SEC. 7. Prohibition on banning whistles. SEC. 7 prohibits states from imposing whistle bans at railroad crossings unless specific safety measures are in place or federal permission is granted. The Secretary will review rail car visibility rules and collect data from railroads with enhanced visibility measures. By June 30, 1996, regulations for improved visibility standards on newly manufactured and remanufactured rail cars will be initiated. Factors to be considered include visibility for drivers, paint colors, reflective materials, lettering visibility, and impact on train crew safety. The Secretary may exclude certain trains or rail operations from specific visibility requirements if it is in the public interest and consistent with rail safety. Railcar visibility refers to enhancing the ability of drivers, pedestrians, and railroad workers to observe trains for safety, especially at railroad grade crossings. SEC. 9. STATEWIDE RAILROAD GRADE CROSSING FREEZE. The Secretary must start a rulemaking process within two years to regulate railroad grade crossings, including a freeze on the total number in each state, requiring approval for new openings, closing existing crossings for new ones, and allowing waivers by the Federal Rail Administrator. The regulation applies once a State has made significant reductions in railroad grade crossings or has an optimal number for the entire State. The Secretary of Transportation will prioritize research on enhancing railroad grade crossing safety, preventing trespassing and vandalism on railroad property and equipment. Collaboration with other agencies on technology availability and affordability, especially defense-related, for rail safety initiatives is required. Additionally, emergency notification of grade crossing issues is mandated. SEC. 11. EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION OF GRADE CROSSING PROBLEMS. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a toll-free emergency notification system using an \"800\" telephone number for the public to report safety issues at railroad-highway grade crossings."
