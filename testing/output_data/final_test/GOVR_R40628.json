    "content": "The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and other incidents have prompted contingency planning in the government and private sector. This planning includes emergency preparedness and recovery plans to ensure the resumption of normal operations. In Congress, contingency planning involves succession options for leadership and filling vacancies in case of widespread member incapacitation or absence. Concerns exist about potential delays in seating new members or identifying those who can continue to serve after a catastrophic incident. Prior to the September 2001 attacks, congressional practice regarding disruptions of membership in either chamber was dependent on the type of disruption. The confirmed death of an individual Member in either chamber creates an automatic vacancy which could be filled under existing procedures. In the House, a special election is held to fill the seat pursuant to state law, while governors can make temporary appointments to the Senate in most states. Efforts to incorporate Member replacement activities into legislative branch emergency preparedness planning may raise constitutional issues. Procedures for addressing the death or incapacity of a Member of Congress are well established, but the potential implications of mass congressional casualties have not been fully addressed. Concerns about mass vacancies in membership are more pronounced in the House due to the requirement for Members to be elected. Questions have been raised about the House's ability to meet constitutionally mandated quorum requirements after an incident involving many Members. During the 109th Congress, the House established rules for a provisional quorum in case of mass casualties among Members. Legislation was also passed requiring special House elections in the event of mass vacancies. The constitutionality of a provisional quorum has not been determined. Following an announcement by the Speaker of the House that vacancies in the chamber have exceeded 100 seats, states with vacancies must hold a special election within 49 days. Candidates for the election must be determined within 10 days, absentee ballots must be sent to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters within 15 days, and all valid ballots must be accepted and processed. Some critics argue that holding special elections to seat new Representatives up to seven weeks after an announcement of extraordinary circumstances could deprive the nation of a functional, broadly representative legislative response at a time of great national challenge. Others raise constitutional concerns related to provisional quorum rules. Opponents of current House practices regarding provisional quorum procedures argue that it goes against longstanding House practice. Some argue that quorum requirements in the House and Senate are based on the number of seats authorized for each chamber, not on the number of Members present. Constitutional concerns arise if more than half of the seats are vacant due to Members being incapacitated or missing. This could potentially render actions taken by fewer than a majority of Members illegitimate and unconstitutional. Actions in the House have been taken to address this issue. Some argue that current policies may not adequately protect against sudden loss of membership in the House and Senate, raising constitutional concerns. Remedies may involve amending the Constitution to address issues related to quorum requirements and potential vacancies in either chamber. Several proposed constitutional amendments have been introduced since the 2001 attacks to address the consequences of catastrophic losses of congressional membership. The perceived need for such measures is based on the possibility of terrorists targeting Congress or the Washington, DC, region. The issue of filling congressional vacancies in the event of a national emergency gained considerable interest during the Cold War era. Representative Brian Baird introduced H.J.Res. 52 in 2009 to amend the Constitution for filling mass vacancies in Congress during emergencies. Elected officials would provide a list of designees to take their place if they die or become incapacitated. The Speaker, Vice President, or President pro tempore would fill vacancies in case of a catastrophe. The proposed amendment by Representative Brian Baird in 2009 would allow elected officials to designate individuals to fill their seats in Congress in case of emergencies. The Speaker, Vice President, or President pro tempore would appoint designees from a list provided by Members with vacant seats, who would then be treated as Representatives or Senators. If a designee fills a vacant seat, an election must be called promptly. Congress would establish criteria to determine the status of incapacitated or missing Members and enforce the amendment through legislation. In the 110th Congress, two constitutional amendment proposals were introduced to fill vacancies in Congress in case of mass loss of Members. H.J.Res. 56 and H.J.Res. 57 were introduced by Representatives Brian Baird and Dana Rohrabacher, respectively. H.J.Res. 56 aimed to amend the Constitution to require elected officials to provide a list of designees to fill their seats if they die, become incapacitated, or disappear. In the 110th Congress, Representative Dana Rohrabacher introduced H.J.Res. 57, proposing a constitutional amendment on congressional succession. The measure would require the simultaneous election of an alternate member with each Representative and Senator to fill vacancies in case of death, resignation, expulsion, or inability to discharge duties. The proposed constitutional amendment in the 110th Congress by Representative Dana Rohrabacher suggested the election of alternate members to fill vacancies in case of inability to discharge duties. States could authorize the appointment of an acting Senator in the absence of a qualified alternate. Members could resume their powers upon declaring their ability to serve, and alternates had to meet qualifications and could be punished for disorderly behavior. If a quorum couldn't be established for three days, Members not present could be declared unable to discharge their powers. In the 109th Congress, a proposed amendment on congressional succession was introduced by Representative Dana Rohrabacher. The amendment would have required candidates to select three alternates in rank order to stand for election with them. If the Member died, the first ranked alternate would assume office until a new Representative or Senator was elected. Members could declare their inability to discharge duties, and Congress would have the authority to enforce the amendment through legislation. In the 108th Congress, six constitutional amendment proposals were introduced to fill vacancies in case of catastrophic loss of Members. Only one measure, H.J.Res. 83, was considered and rejected by the House. Representative Brian Baird proposed two amendments, H.J.Res. 77 and H.J.Res. 83, allowing state Members to vacate their declaration of inability. In the 108th Congress, proposals were introduced to allow state governors to appoint successors for incapacitated or deceased Representatives. The proposals required Representatives-elect to provide a list of successors to the state's chief executive before taking office. If a majority of the House was unable to fulfill its duties, governors could appoint replacements within seven days. The appointee would serve until the original Member recovered or a special election was held.

If a majority of the House was unable to fulfill its duties, governors could appoint replacements within seven days. The appointee would serve until the original Member recovered or a special election was held. H.J.Res. 77 and H.J.Res. 83 authorized Congress to enact \"appropriate legislation\" to enforce them, with slight differences in language on determining Member status. H.J.Res. 89, introduced by Rep. John Larson, proposed allowing temporary appointees chosen by affected state legislatures or chief executives. Less than a majority of the House could declare a vacancy, prompting affected state legislatures to convene special sessions to appoint temporary replacements. H.J.Res. 89 proposed allowing temporary appointees chosen by affected state legislatures or chief executives to fill House vacancies until special elections are held. Appointees must meet constitutional qualifications and be from the same political party as their predecessors. If the state legislature fails to appoint within three days, the chief executive would make the appointments. Congress would be empowered to specify circumstances for vacancy occurrences. The proposed constitutional amendments aimed to address vacancies in the House of Representatives due to death or resignation by allowing for the appointment of temporary members or designated successors. Senator John Cornyn proposed a constitutional amendment, S.J.Res. 23, on November 5, 2003, to authorize Congress to address vacancies in the House of Representatives due to death or incapacity by appointing temporary successors. These successors would serve until the disabled Members regained ability to serve or new Members were elected, with procedures in effect for 120 days and extendable for additional periods. During the 107th Congress, three constitutional amendment proposals were introduced to fill vacancies in the event of catastrophic loss of Members. H.J.Res. 67, H.J.Res. 77, and S.J.Res. 30 were introduced, with H.J.Res. 67 allowing governors to appoint temporary replacements for Representatives who had died or become incapacitated when 25% or more of Representatives were unable to perform their duties. Appointees could serve for 90 days or less until a special election was held, but no further action was taken on the measure. During the 107th Congress, three proposed constitutional amendments were introduced to address filling vacancies in the event of catastrophic loss of Members. Senator Arlen Specter introduced S.J.Res. 30, which would have allowed governors to appoint temporary Representatives if 50% or more of Representatives died or were incapacitated. Representative Zoe Lofgren introduced H.J.Res. 77, which would have authorized Congress to provide for temporary appointment of Representatives if 30% or more of House seats became vacant due to death or resignation. Over 30 proposed constitutional amendments addressed temporarily filling House vacancies. During the period from the 79th to the 87th Congress, 30 proposed constitutional amendments were introduced to address temporarily filling House vacancies in case of a significant number of Representatives being disabled. The Senate passed three proposals between 1954 and 1960, allowing governors to make temporary appointments during national emergencies. During the 79th to the 87th Congress, 30 proposed constitutional amendments were introduced to address temporarily filling House vacancies in case of a significant number of Representatives being disabled. The Senate passed three proposals between 1954 and 1960, allowing governors to make temporary appointments during national emergencies. The House did not take action on the first proposal, while the second and third proposals were passed by the Senate but did not progress further in the House. The governor's appointive authority would have been limited to 60 days, and the appointee would have served until a successor was elected in a special election. Many proposals introduced since 2001 and between 1946 and 1962 aimed to address filling vacancies in the House or Senate under specific conditions, such as the number of vacancies needed to invoke the measure and the selecting agents. Some proposals required state legislatures to meet and select replacements if a majority of the House or Senate were unable to perform their duties. Some proposals aimed to address filling vacancies in the House or Senate under specific conditions, such as the number of vacancies needed to invoke the measure and the selecting agents. Later measures authorized governors to make temporary appointments to the House when vacancies exceeded half of the authorized membership. Post-2001 proposals limited potential appointees to those specified in advance by a Representative or those who were elected in their own right. Supporters of proposals to amend the Constitution argue for prearranged, temporary replenishment of congressional membership to ensure continuity during national emergencies. Advance directives for filling vacancies could help maintain state representation in Congress if Members were incapacitated or killed. Establishing provisions for an expedited response before an incident occurs could demonstrate the country's determination to continue a representative form of government, even in extraordinary times. Providing a predetermined mechanism to fill vacancies could eliminate the need for special expedited House elections under difficult conditions. Opponents argue that current approaches to address congressional continuity are sufficient. Opponents argue that current approaches to address congressional continuity, such as filling Senate seats by appointment, are sufficient. They believe that implementing changes through temporary appointments is less cumbersome than amending the Constitution and may not provide better assurance of continuity. They also express concerns that temporary appointments could create two classes of Members and potentially lead to a shift in legislative agenda or majority control. The debate over temporary appointments in Congress continues, with concerns about the potential long-term effects of using temporary members. Arguments for and against amending the Constitution to allow temporary appointments echo those from the Cold War era, but recent events like 9/11 have shifted the context. There are worries about the implications of allowing temporary appointments in response to new security threats. Some concerns have been raised about the possibility of independent suicidal terrorists using weapons of mass destruction against the United States Capitol and Congress. The debate over temporary appointments in Congress continues, with arguments for and against amending the Constitution in response to new security threats. Congress may need to consider additional statutory or constitutional approaches to address issues related to congressional representation in challenging circumstances, balancing the demands of representative government with the need to ensure the legislative branch can quickly fulfill its constitutional responsibilities. Developing plans for continuity of representation could better prepare Congress for potential interruptions."
