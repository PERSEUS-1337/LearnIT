    "content": "The Monaco Declaration, signed in January 2009 by over 150 marine scientists from 26 countries, urges policymakers to take immediate action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to prevent severe damage to marine ecosystems from ocean acidification. The United Nations Environment Programme highlighted concerns about the link between ocean acidification and food security in December 2010. The ecological and economic impacts of ocean acidification are not fully understood but could be significant. Congressional attention on ocean acidification is needed. Ocean acidification is a significant concern that Congress is focusing on by authorizing, funding, and coordinating research to understand its effects on marine ecosystems. The process involves rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere dissolving in seawater, altering its chemistry and decreasing pH levels. This ongoing process is named ocean acidification, where seawater becomes less alkaline as more anthropogenic CO2 dissolves in it. The dissolution of CO2 in the ocean forms carbonic acid, leading to a decrease in pH and making the water less alkaline. This change in seawater pH could disrupt marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. The oceans absorb about 2 billion metric tons of carbon annually, contributing to the concerns of ocean acidification. The ocean absorbs over 2 billion metric tons of CO2 annually, leading to a decrease in pH levels. This decrease in pH, although small, represents a significant increase in hydrogen ion concentration. Observational records show declining pH levels in the open ocean. As atmospheric CO2 levels rise, ocean pH will continue to decrease, potentially stabilizing at 5 billion metric tons per year by 2100. Continued burning of fossil fuels and future CO2 uptake by the ocean could reduce ocean pH by 0.3-0.5 units by 2100. Temperature affects CO2 solubility in water, with marine waters near the poles having a greater capacity for dissolving CO2. Other factors besides temperature also impact ocean acidification and its effects on marine waters. Factors such as cellular respiration, organic decomposition, and photosynthesis modulate the impact of CO2 on marine waters. Deep oceanic water enriched in CO2 can be brought to the surface by equatorial currents, leading to CO2 absorption from the atmosphere. Tropical coral reefs are vulnerable to near-term effects, and an increase in storm activity at higher latitudes could accelerate pH decrease in surface ocean waters. Scientific questions remain regarding the future rate of seawater pH decrease. The questions surrounding factors affecting seawater pH decrease include the relationship between CO2 levels in the atmosphere and the rate of pH change, the impact of rising ocean temperatures on CO2 absorption, and the time it takes for ocean acidification to slow or reverse in response to increasing water temperatures. Other inquiries focus on how ocean circulation influences these processes. The potential effects of increased CO2 in the ocean include lower pH levels affecting marine life and changes in ocean chemistry, with the production of more bicarbonate ions. Field studies are starting to provide a more direct view of potential ocean acidification issues. The abundance of carbonate ions in ocean waters is crucial for shell formation in marine organisms. As carbonic acid levels rise due to increased atmospheric CO2, pH levels decrease, leading to a decline in available carbonate ions. Marine organisms use calcium ions and carbonate ions to create calcium carbonate for their shells. Certain organisms produce aragonite, a type of calcium carbonate, for their shells. Marine organisms use different types of calcium carbonate for shell formation, such as aragonite, calcite, and high magnesium calcite. These forms are stable in ocean surface waters, but increased carbonic acid levels from higher CO2 levels can impact shell formation. Ocean acidification can lead to the dissolution of shells made from different forms of calcium carbonate, with high magnesium calcite shells being the most vulnerable. Organisms incorporating high magnesium calcite are likely to be the first affected by ocean acidification, as ocean waters at depths are undersaturated with biogenic calcite. Researchers have observed reductions in shell mass and thickness of Southern Ocean marine algae and animals due to increased CO2 levels and calcium carbonate solubility in cold water. Marine organisms have biochemical mechanisms to regulate internal pH and may be able to adapt to lower pH environments, although they may expend more energy. Understanding how marine life responds to less alkaline conditions is crucial for future adaptation. Some experts have questioned the potential harm of ocean acidification on coral reefs, suggesting that increased ocean temperature may have comparable or greater detrimental effects than increased CO2 levels. Studies have shown a decline in calcification rates of Porites coral in Australia's Great Barrier Reef due to elevated seawater temperatures and CO2 concentrations. Some studies show that ocean acidification and elevated seawater temperatures are affecting coral calcification. Concerns are raised for coral reefs in the eastern tropical Pacific. While coral death may not be immediate, decreasing seawater pH is slowing coral larvae development. It is projected that coral calcification in reef ecosystems will decrease by 30% by the end of the century. Calcareous algae will still grow under lower pH, but reef carbonate dissolution may increase by 50% by the end of the century. This could jeopardize coral reef maintenance and resilience. Emerging evidence suggests variability in coral response to acidification and past climate change, leading to heterogeneity in reef degradation. Some shallow-water coral reefs may mask acidification effects in downstream habitats. Stony and soft corals have been successfully grown in low pH conditions since the 1970s. However, some corals may be sensitive to pH changes due to adaptation to invariant pH levels. Increasing ocean acidification may have detrimental effects on coral reefs, impacting coral abundance and diversity. Some corals can survive at low pH levels by adapting similar to sea anemones, but predation may limit their viability in natural environments. Acidification could also alter marine microbial activity, potentially reducing nitrous oxide emissions. The curr_chunk discusses the potential impacts of rising CO2 concentrations on marine ecosystems, specifically on phytoplankton and coccolithophores. Some phytoplankton species may benefit from increased CO2, while coccolithophores may experience decreased calcification rates. However, some larger coccolithophore species could potentially increase their calcification in response to anthropogenic CO2 release. Studies have shown a pattern of decreasing calcification in coccolithophores with increasing CO2 levels. The potential indirect effects of decreasing seawater pH on marine organisms are not well understood. Concerns include harm to calcifying plankton species, potential shifts in ecological balances, and alterations to zooplankton communities. However, there appears to be no significant relationship between jellyfish abundance and lower pH conditions. The decreasing seawater pH could affect invertebrate organisms' essential processes. Sea urchin sperm swam slower at pH 7.7, leading to a 25% decrease in fertilization. Marine invertebrates, especially in early stages, are sensitive to environmental changes. In a study, calcification in pteropods decreased by 28% at pH levels expected in 2100. Animals continued to grow and produce shells under high CO2, but at a slower rate. Concerns exist for benthic calcareous organisms along the North American west coast, with projections of decreased shell strength by the end of the 21st century. Oyster growers in the Pacific Northwest are already experiencing impacts. Oyster growers in the Pacific Northwest are experiencing severe larval mortalities and reproductive failures possibly due to changing ocean chemistry. Laboratory experiments show mussels deteriorating under acidified conditions. Predictions suggest ocean acidification will impact commercial mollusc harvests, requiring interdisciplinary knowledge. Fish larvae and juveniles are more susceptible to pH changes, but fish are relatively tolerant to high CO2 levels. Fish are considered more tolerant to ocean acidification due to their high capacity for internal ion and acid-base regulation. However, studies show that acidification can impair the olfactory discrimination and homing ability of marine fish like the clown fish. Concerns have also been raised about the decrease in sound absorption in the ocean, which could impact environmental, military, and economic interests. The current decrease in pH may lead to a 12% decrease in sound absorption, with an anticipated further decrease resulting in a 40% reduction. The potential decrease in ocean pH by 0.3 units could lead to a 40% reduction in sound absorption, impacting marine mammals and their adaptation to a more transparent sound environment. Worst-case scenarios are difficult to predict due to unforeseen consequences and possible tipping points. Attention to these circumstances is crucial as past mass extinction events may have been linked to significant changes in ocean pH sensitivity of marine organisms. Mass extinctions in the geological record, such as the Late Triassic event 200 million years ago, may have been caused by disruptions in the carbon cycle, potentially including acidification. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts a worst-case scenario of ocean pH decreasing to 7.7 by 2100 if CO2 emissions are not controlled. Some caution that past events may not perfectly mirror current conditions. Ocean acidification could disrupt marine ecosystems and compromise food production from the ocean, affecting finfish, shellfish, and other invertebrates. Physiological changes caused by ocean acidification could significantly alter marine ecosystems by impacting primary productivity, such as phytoplankton. This could have broad dietary and economic consequences, as fisheries supply at least 15% of animal protein consumed by humans and generate $85 billion annually. Loss of coral reefs is also a potential consequence of a worst-case scenario. Loss of coral reefs due to ocean acidification could have significant impacts on ecosystems and economies. Reef fish provide subsistence for coastal residents, and reef tourism contributes billions to the economy in regions like Queensland, Australia, the Caribbean, and the Florida Keys. Natural feedback mechanisms may help moderate seawater pH change, but there are speculative questions about potential outcomes. The ability to reduce ocean acidification through artificial means is uncertain. Proposals include using iron compounds to stimulate algae growth for CO2 capture, using limestone to neutralize lower-pH water, or pumping calcium bicarbonate from limestone scrubbers into the ocean. Reducing ocean acidification through artificial means is uncertain. Techniques include stimulating algae growth with iron compounds, neutralizing lower-pH water with limestone, or pumping calcium bicarbonate from limestone scrubbers into the ocean. However, these methods may only be effective on a local scale and could potentially harm marine ecosystems. The most practical way to minimize pH changes in marine waters is by reducing CO2 emissions or implementing carbon sequestration. Despite efforts, ocean acidification is expected to continue for decades due to increasing atmospheric CO2 levels. The National Science Foundation (NSF) was the first federal agency to become involved in research related to ocean acidification, with modern concerns arising from a workshop in May 2004 chaired by Ralph Cicerone. Current federal attention focuses on understanding chemical processes and predicting ecosystem responses to decreasing pH levels. It could take tens of thousands of years for ocean chemistry to return to pre-industrial levels if CO2 levels were to decrease. In 2005, a workshop sponsored by NSF, NOAA, and USGS discussed the impacts of ocean acidification on marine life. Congress called for a national study on how CO2 emissions affect marine resources. The study was commissioned in 2008 and released in 2010. The Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act of 2009 established an interagency working group on ocean acidification. The interagency working group on ocean acidification (IWGOA) was established in 2009 to develop a strategic research and monitoring plan for federal research on ocean acidification. The plan, organized into seven themes, aims to coordinate activities of federal agencies in monitoring ocean chemistry and biological impacts. The IWGOA established in 2009 developed a strategic research plan with seven themes for federal research on ocean acidification. This plan includes monitoring ocean chemistry, understanding responses to acidification, predicting changes in the carbon cycle, technology development, assessing socioeconomic impacts, education and outreach, and data management. A report is submitted to Congress every two years summarizing federally funded activities, with approximately $29 million in funding for ocean acidification activities in FY2011. In the 110th Congress, legislative interest in ocean acidification increased significantly, focusing on addressing the cause of ocean acidification - increasing atmospheric CO2. FOARAM in the 111th Congress directed the establishment of an ocean acidification program within NOAA and authorized appropriations for research and monitoring through FY2012. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Subcommittee held discussions on ocean acidification on April 22, 2010. The Science, and Transportation Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard discussed the environmental and economic impacts of ocean acidification. The Coral Reef Conservation Act Amendments of 2013 (S. 839) was introduced in the 113th Congress to address ocean acidification by including it in project evaluation criteria. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation ordered S. 839 to be reported on July 30, 2013."
