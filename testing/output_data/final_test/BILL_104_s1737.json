    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Yellowstone Protection Act of 1996\". The Congress finds that Yellowstone National Park, the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River, and the Absaroka-Beartooth National Wilderness Area were designated to protect natural and scenic resources in the Yellowstone area. Yellowstone National Park was designated a World Heritage Site in 1978. Mining practices have degraded Henderson Mountain and adjacent lands upstream of the park, causing pollution in headwater sources of various rivers. In 1995, approximately 19,100 acres of Federal land were segregated upstream of Yellowstone National Park. The Absaroka-Beartooth National Wilderness Area was protected from mining for two years to safeguard watersheds and water quality in Yellowstone National Park. Proposed mining activities upstream of the park led to its inclusion in the \"List of World Heritage in Danger\" in 1995. Mining in the area poses a threat to the resources of Yellowstone National Park and surrounding areas. The Absaroka-Beartooth National Wilderness Area was protected from mining to safeguard watersheds and water quality in Yellowstone National Park. It is in the public interest to protect these lands and rivers from mining activities. The Act aims to permanently protect lands upstream of Yellowstone National Park, Absaroka-Beartooth National Wilderness Area, and the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone National Wild and Scenic River from mining activities. Approximately 24,000 acres of lands within the Gallatin and Custer National Forests are included in the protected area. Valid existing mineral rights are allowed, but must not threaten water quality, fisheries, and other resource values in the area. After enactment of this Act, lands upstream of Yellowstone National Park are permanently protected from mining activities. Approximately 24,000 acres within Gallatin and Custer National Forests are included in the protected area. No mining claims, leasing, or disposal of mineral materials are allowed in the designated area. No patents under the general mining laws shall be issued for any claim located in the protected area. (c) Prohibition prohibits any mining activities on Federal lands within the specified area, except for reclamation purposes. Federal departments or agencies are also prohibited from assisting in the development of certain mining-related facilities within the area. Reclamation requirements set by the Secretary of Agriculture must be followed for any mining activities in the area. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, must review the validity of all mining claims within a specified area. Invalid claims will be declared null and void. The Secretary of Agriculture is prohibited from approving mining plans that threaten to pollute water sources near Yellowstone National Park. The Secretary of Agriculture must send proposed mining plans to various agencies and governors for review before approval. The Secretary of the Interior and the EPA have 90 days to certify the plan does not threaten water sources near Yellowstone National Park or make recommendations for necessary actions. The Secretary of Agriculture must obtain certification from the Secretary of the Interior and the EPA before approving a mining plan near Yellowstone National Park. The plan must not require perpetual treatment of acid mine pollution of water resources. Governors of Montana and Wyoming's comments must also be considered before final approval. Before final approval of a mining plan near Yellowstone National Park, the Secretary of Agriculture must submit the proposed final plan to the President and Congress. They have 6 months to review it before any final approval can be granted."
