    "content": "The balance of payments accounts are based on double-entry bookkeeping, ensuring each credit has a corresponding debit. Surpluses or deficits in one account are offset by deficits or surpluses in another. A trade deficit doesn't always mean a debt, it depends on how it's financed. The accounts are divided into the current account (exports, imports, transfers), capital account (capital transfers), and financial account. The balance of payments accounts consist of the current account, capital account, and financial account. Exports are recorded as a positive amount while imports are recorded as a negative amount. Financial transactions in the capital account reflect payments and receipts corresponding to importing and exporting goods. Since the 1970s, private capital flows have increased due to countries liberalizing rules on overseas investing and adopting floating exchange rates. This has led to a higher demand for the dollar, which is now used as a vehicle for investment. The dollar is sought for investment purposes and serves as a major trade invoicing currency. Liberalized capital flows and floating exchange rates have increased autonomous capital flows between countries, leading to closer economic links and globalization. In 2013, global capital markets exceeded $900 trillion, over 50 times the size of the U.S. economy. Foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives were valued at $655 trillion, more than twice the total of all public and private bonds, equities, and bank assets. Capital flows impact the dollar's international exchange value, driven by demand for U.S. assets like financial securities. Demand for the dollar is influenced by the value of U.S. securities, leading to changes in the dollar's value. This, in turn, affects U.S. trade balance and global currency markets. Foreign governments and central banks may intervene to strengthen the dollar. The dollar plays a significant role in global financial markets and is used as a global currency. During the global financial crisis, the dollar's role as a global currency was disrupted, impacting the international financial system. Banks expanded their balance sheets with dollar-denominated assets, leading to financial distress transmitted through short-term dollar funding markets. During the global financial crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve took extraordinary measures to address the collapse of short-term dollar funding markets by providing nearly $300 billion through currency swap arrangements with central banks worldwide. The Federal Reserve expanded reciprocal currency arrangements with major central banks and announced a money market guarantee program to stabilize the financial system. The dollar's prominent role as a global currency played a crucial role in transmitting economic distress during the crisis. The dollar's exchange value acts as a mechanism for transmitting economic and political news across borders, impacting international economic activities. Daily trading of foreign currencies totaled $5.1 trillion in traditional markets in 2016, down from $5.3 trillion in 2013. The OTC foreign exchange derivatives market reported $2.7 trillion in daily turnover in April. The global foreign exchange market reached $8.0 trillion in daily trading in traditional and OTC markets in April 2016, with 88.0% of turnover in U.S. dollars. The U.S. current account balance remained in deficit throughout 2015 and the first two quarters of 2016, indicating more imports than exports. The U.S. current account balance represents trade in goods, services, and income flows. The balance worsened by 16% from 2014 to 2015. Economists argue that foreign capital inflows bridge the gap between domestic supplies and demand for capital, driving the international exchange value of the dollar. The international exchange value of the dollar is a major factor in determining the nation's trade deficit or surplus. Capital inflows push the dollar's exchange rate up, affecting the prices of exports and imports. Despite the drop in oil prices in 2014 and 2015, the U.S. trade deficit did not decline as expected. The average price of imported crude oil dropped sharply from $91 to $47 per barrel, falling below $40 by the end of 2015. Despite this, the quantity of imported crude oil only decreased by 1.4%. As a result, crude oil imports went from accounting for over 40% of the annual U.S. trade deficit in 2012 to about 10% in 2015. However, the U.S. merchandise deficit increased in 2015 despite the decline in the role of imported crude oil in the trade deficit. In 2014, the composition of the trade deficit changed, with non-petroleum products replacing petroleum products. The United States experienced deficits in merchandise trade goods accounts and a surplus in services accounts. The income accounts showed a net surplus, and the U.S. financial accounts were also in surplus throughout the period. The U.S. financial accounts were in surplus throughout the period, representing offsetting transactions to deficits in the current account. The surplus in the financial accounts equals the deficit in the combined balance in the capital account, statistical discrepancy, and the balance on the current account. It reflects the difference between capital outflows from U.S. investments abroad and capital inflows from foreign investment in the United States, including private and official investments. The balance on the financial account in 2015 decreased compared to 2014 due to an increase in U.S. net purchases of assets abroad and a decrease in foreign net purchases of assets in the United States. Foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets in 2015 dropped below 2014 levels, with a significant decline in foreign official purchases of U.S. portfolio assets. U.S. purchases of foreign equities and debt securities also decreased during the same period. In 2015, U.S. purchases of foreign equities and debt securities fell by 75% year-over-year. Foreign direct investment in the United States rose by 83% to reach $379 billion, while U.S. direct investment abroad slightly increased to $348.6 billion. The balance of payments data in Table 3 shows the net amount of flows in major accounts, with net inflows represented by positive numbers and net outflows by negative numbers. Total net capital inflows in 2015 were a negative $195.2 billion, reflecting the balance on the current account, capital account, and statistical discrepancy. Foreign investors' purchases of Treasury securities fluctuated, with private investors sharply increasing purchases during the financial crisis in 2009 and 2010. Between 2007 and 2015, there were significant fluctuations in foreign investment in Treasury securities. Foreign private net purchases fell to $52 billion in 2013, while foreign official entities liquidated over $200 billion in treasury securities in 2015. This shift in capital flows reflected the impact of the financial crisis, with net private inflows changing from $1.7 trillion in 2007 to a net outflow in 2008 and 2009. Between 2010 and 2015, there were fluctuations in capital flows due to the financial crisis. Net private inflows varied, with U.S. citizens resuming inflows in 2012-2014. Foreign official accumulations of U.S. financial assets increased from $188 billion in 2007 to $225 billion in 2012, but shifted to a net outflow of over $200 billion in 2015. Data from 2013-2015 show that net foreign private accumulation of U.S. securities tripled from $80 billion to $249 billion before dropping to $155 billion in 2015. The drop in net foreign purchases of U.S. securities in 2015 reflects adjustments by private investors in their portfolios, reducing holdings of U.S. corporate stocks and Treasury securities while increasing purchases of corporate bonds and bonds of U.S. government agencies. The trade deficit is accompanied by a capital inflow, representing an accumulation of dollar-denominated assets by foreigners. Some view this as a debt owed by the U.S. economy to foreigners, but it is more accurately described as foreign-owned assets rather than loans. Foreign investors hold claims on U.S. assets, not loans with fixed repayment schedules. Returns on these assets are not guaranteed and can be affected by market forces. Profits can be repatriated to the investor's home country, reducing returns in the U.S. Taxes may be owed on interest income from U.S. Treasury securities. The balance of payments is influenced by macroeconomic developments in the U.S. economy, driving capital flows due to favorable returns on investments, surplus savings globally, a well-developed financial system, stability of the U.S. economy, and the perception of U.S. securities as low risk. Net capital inflows bridge the gap in the U.S. between credit demand and domestic funds, keeping interest rates lower than they would be without foreign investment. The U.S. benefits from capital inflows, allowing for spending beyond its means and financing the trade deficit. Foreigners lend to the U.S. by exchanging goods for assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate. The Department of Commerce tracks this flow through the nation's net international investment position, representing U.S.-owned assets abroad and foreign-owned assets in the U.S. The U.S. net international investment position is not a debt but an accounting of assets. The Department of Commerce uses different methods to value direct investments, leading to varying estimates. U.S. residents had $22.0 trillion in overseas assets by 2015, while foreigners owned $28.0 trillion in U.S. assets. Foreign investors hold about $28.0 trillion in U.S. assets, resulting in a negative U.S. net international investment position of $5.6 trillion in 2015. Returns on these assets are not guaranteed, and investors face risks similar to domestic investors. Investments include corporate stocks, bonds, and government securities. The value of financial assets like stocks, bonds, and direct investments can change due to various factors such as purchases, sales, appreciation, depreciation, and market fluctuations. In 2015, U.S. holdings abroad increased to $22 trillion, reflecting an upward revaluation in the values of foreign corporate stocks. Foreign owned assets in the U.S. also rose to $27.2 trillion. In 2015, foreign investment in the United States rose to $27.2 trillion, with assets divided into official and private investments. Foreign official asset holdings were valued at about $6.0 trillion, representing 20% of the total foreign investment position. Foreign official asset holdings in the United States include monetary reserve assets like gold, IMF reserve position, and foreign currency. Acquisitions of U.S. Treasury securities by foreign governments are a significant component. Private asset holdings consist of direct investment, real estate, government securities, and stocks. Foreign currency holdings make up a small portion of total foreign investment. The composition of U.S. assets abroad and foreign-owned assets in the United States differs, with foreign official assets in the U.S. outweighing U.S. official assets abroad. Foreign investors are drawn to U.S. Treasury securities as a safe haven investment during economic uncertainty. Concerns arise over the persistent U.S. trade deficit and the potential risks it poses for long-term economic growth. Foreign investors may become unwilling to hold more dollar-denominated assets due to saturation in their portfolios, leading to concerns about capital outflows from profits generated by these assets. The shift in the balance of payments in 2004 raised speculation about foreign investors reaching their limit, but this trend reversed in 2005 with a rebound in foreign private investments. The trade deficit is driven by macroeconomic conditions within the domestic economy, where foreign capital inflows are needed to fill the gap between demand and supply of capital. The movement in the dollar's international exchange rate is influenced by the demand for and supply of credit in the economy. The trade deficit is influenced by macroeconomic conditions in the domestic economy. The United States is not in debt to foreign investors or governments due to trading assets with them. Foreign investors may choose to limit their investments in the future. Foreign investors, whether private or official, may decide to limit their acquisition of dollar-denominated assets in the future, but there is no current evidence of this happening."
