An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code allows for the exclusion of certain real property from the taxable estate if it is subject to an endangered species conservation agreement. The value of the taxable estate for tax purposes can be reduced by deducting the adjusted value of real property subject to an endangered species conservation agreement. Real property is considered subject to such an agreement if all owners have entered into the required agreements. The adjusted value of real property for tax purposes is reduced by any deductible amount under section 2053(a)(4). An endangered species conservation agreement is a written agreement entered into for this purpose. A conservation agreement is a written agreement that commits individuals to carry out activities on real property to assist in the conservation of endangered or threatened species designated by the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce. The executor must annually certify to the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce the status of endangered species conservation agreements for designated or candidate species. The additional tax will be imposed on any person who disposes of an interest in property subject to an endangered species conservation agreement or fails to comply with the agreement. The additional tax imposed on individuals who violate an endangered species conservation agreement is calculated based on the fair market value of the property at the time of the event, relative to the estate tax liability reduction obtained through the agreement. The additional tax imposed on individuals violating an endangered species conservation agreement can be offset by the fair market value of the property at the time of the event, unless the transferee assumes the transferor's obligations and personal liability for the tax. The additional tax imposed on individuals violating an endangered species conservation agreement can be offset by the fair market value of the property at the time of the event. The transferee must assume the transferor's obligations and personal liability for the tax. The due date for the additional tax is 6 months after the disposition or April 15 of the following year for certain events. The statute of limitations for assessing additional tax under subsection (d)(1)(A) is 3 years from the date the Secretary is notified of the tax liability. The tax can be assessed before the 3-year period expires, regardless of other laws preventing such assessment. The election for the endangered species conservation agreement must be made when filing the tax return under section 2001. Regulations will specify the process for making the election. Regulations will also address how this section applies to interests in partnerships, corporations, and trusts related to a closely held business. A discretionary trust where all beneficiaries are heirs of the decedent will be treated as a present interest. The table of sections for part IV of subchapter A of chapter 11 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding a new item related to present interest. The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying after the date of the enactment of this Act. Income tax incentives are provided to preserve land for the protection of endangered species, with a 75 percent exclusion for gain on sales of land to certain persons for the protection of habitat. The tax code provides a 75 percent exclusion for gains from selling land to conservation purchasers who aim to protect endangered species' habitats. Conservation purchasers include government agencies and qualified organizations."
