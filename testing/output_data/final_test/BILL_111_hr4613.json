    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Blackfoot River Land Settlement Act of 2010\". Congress finds that it is the policy of the United States to promote tribal self-determination and economic self-sufficiency. The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, a federally recognized Indian tribe, adopted a tribal constitution and bylaws in 1936 and has entered into various treaties with the United States. The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, a federally recognized Indian tribe, have a continuous government-to-government relationship with the United States since the earliest years of the Union. President Andrew Johnson designated the Fort Hall Reservation for the tribes in 1867, securing it as a \"permanent home\" for them according to the Second Treaty of Fort Bridger. The Reservation is located near Blackfoot and Pocatello in southeastern Idaho. The Blackfoot River serves as the northern boundary of the Reservation and flows westward. Land use in the River watershed includes rangeland, farming, and residential development. In 1964, a flood protection project was completed on the River, authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1950 and sponsored by the Blackfoot River Flood Control District No. 7, involving levee construction. The project involved building levees, replacing structures, bridges, and realigning the channel. This realignment resulted in Indian land north of the River and non-Indian land south of it. Surveys were conducted on parcels of both Indian and non-Indian land. In 1988, non-Indian landowners filed claims seeking water rights on Indian land. The Act aims to resolve disputes over water rights on Indian land resulting from a river realignment project in 1964. It seeks to reach a fair settlement among the Tribes, allottees, non-Indians acquiring Indian land, and non-Indian landowners. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

The term \"non-Indian acquiring Indian land\" refers to individuals or entities acquiring Indian land and listed in exhibit C of the survey. \"Non-Indian land\" is fee land located south of the Realigned River. The terms defined in this section include \"non-Indian landowner\" as an individual holding fee title to non-Indian land, \"Realigned River\" as the portion of the River realigned by the Corps of Engineers in 1964, \"Reservation\" as the Fort Hall Reservation established in 1867, \"River\" as the Blackfoot River in Idaho, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior.
