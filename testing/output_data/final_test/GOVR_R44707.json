The use of tariffs in trade negotiations was reconsidered, prompting debate post-election. Understanding the constitutional framework and historical role of tariffs in U.S. trade law is crucial for evaluating future executive actions on trade policy. The report describes Congress's tariff powers and the President's authority to act under specific legislation. It gives examples of statutory provisions delegating tariff powers to the President and explains how challenges to the President's use of these powers can be addressed in court. Congress is constitutionally authorized to raise revenue through taxes, tariffs, duties, and regulate international commerce. Congress has the authority to regulate international commerce and impose tariffs. The President can negotiate trade agreements but Congress has sole authority over tariff regulation. The President must find authority for tariff actions in statute as he does not have express constitutional power to modify tariffs. Congress used to set tariff rates until the 1930s. In the early 1930s, Congress delegated authority to the President to reduce tariffs through the Reciprocal Tariff Act. This authority was limited by time periods and subject to periodic review. From 1934 to 1974, Congress allowed the President to negotiate tariff rates with other countries and implement them through proclamation. However, as trade negotiations focused on non-tariff barriers, Congress was less willing to authorize the President to implement these measures through proclamation. In the Trade Act of 1974, Congress provided for legislative implementation of international trade agreements under an expedited procedure known as trade promotion authority. Congress has enacted provisions governing trade agreements but has not given the President general authority to modify tariff rates outside of specific agreements or the trade promotion authority framework. Congress has delegated tariff and trade-related powers to the President through various legislative wording. The President is required to make threshold findings before taking trade-related actions, as seen in examples like the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 and the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Recent statutes often start with \"Whenever\" to establish this requirement before outlining specific actions. The President's authority to take trade-related actions is usually accompanied by clearly defined conditions and time restrictions. For example, the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 grants the President broad powers during times of war. The President's authority to impose new duties on foreign countries is granted during times of war under the Tariff Act of 1930. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the Secretary of Commerce to take action if an article is being imported into the United States. The President has the authority to impose duties on foreign countries during times of war under the Tariff Act of 1930. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the Secretary of Commerce to take action if imports threaten national security or in cases of balance-of-payments deficits. The Tariff Act of 1930 grants the President the authority to impose temporary import surcharges or limitations for up to 150 days, not exceeding 15 percent ad valorem. Additionally, the President can also temporarily reduce duty rates by up to 5 percent ad valorem or increase the quantity of imported articles. The Trade Act of 1974 grants the President authority to modify tariff rates in response to various trade-related actions or agreements. The Trade Act of 1974 grants the President authority to modify tariff rates in response to trade-related actions or agreements, while the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 allows the President to declare a national emergency to address threats to national security. Under Section 202(a) (50 U.S.C. \u00a71701(a)), the President has the power to investigate, block, regulate, and prohibit any transactions involving property with foreign interests that may impact national security, foreign policy, or the economy of the United States. The President is required to consult with Congress before exercising these authorities, as specified in Section 204 (19 U.S.C. \u00a71703). The President has the authority to make modifications or impose duties as necessary to implement the North American Free Trade Agreement. This delegation allows the President to act within the confines of the Agreement and consult regularly with Congress. The President has the authority to make modifications or impose duties as necessary to implement trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. This delegation allows the President to act within the confines of the Agreement and consult regularly with Congress. Additionally, the President can proclaim modifications of duties or impose additional duties to maintain reciprocal concessions with Canada or Mexico as specified in the Agreement. The President has limited tariff-reduction authority under free trade agreements, allowing for modifications or continuation of duties as necessary. This delegation enables the President to act within the confines of the Agreement-specific provisions. The President has limited authority to modify or continue duties under trade agreements to promote the objectives of the chapter. This authority is subject to restrictions, including not reducing duty rates below certain levels set by previous agreements. The President has limited authority to modify or continue duties under trade agreements to promote the objectives of the chapter. The most recent trade promotion authority legislation includes tariff-modifying authority with set ranges and timelines. Legal challenges may arise regarding the President's exercise of delegated powers, including jurisdiction of federal courts, constitutional delegation of power by Congress, and the scope of specific powers delegated to the President. The courts address challenges to presidential proclamations to determine jurisdiction and the relation to delegated power. In Cornet Stores v. Morton, a challenge to a proclamation imposing a surcharge duty was dismissed for falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Customs Court. The U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) has jurisdiction over challenges to trade-related presidential proclamations. Challenges involving tariffs are filed at the CIT, with appeals going to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In U.S. Cane Sugar Refiners' Association v. Block, a challenge was brought against a presidential proclamation imposing quotas on sugar imports. The U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) had jurisdiction over a challenge to a presidential proclamation imposing quotas on sugar imports. The court found that the Association did not need to exhaust administrative options before seeking judicial review due to the need for an expeditious resolution. The former Customs Court affirmed the CIT's jurisdiction over a case involving injunctive powers and immediate harm to an industry. The CIT declined to exercise jurisdiction in a recent challenge to a presidential proclamation. The CIT recently declined jurisdiction over a challenge to a presidential proclamation in Michael Simon Design, Inc. v. United States. The plaintiffs challenged a proclamation adopting modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, but the CIT ruled that the proclamation itself was not subject to APA review. The Federal Circuit affirmed this decision. The U.S. Cane Sugar Refiners' Association sought relief under the CIT's jurisdictional statute, while the Michael Simon Design case challenged a presidential proclamation under the APA. The CIT has exclusive jurisdiction over Tariff Act matters and residual jurisdiction over trade issues. The Association established jurisdiction in the CIT, while the Michael Simon Design plaintiffs challenged administrative action. The Michael Simon Design plaintiffs challenged a presidential proclamation under the APA, but this type of challenge is likely to fail due to the President being considered the ultimate actor for jurisdictional purposes. The law underlying a claim for relief based on a trade-related executive action determines which court has jurisdiction to review the challenge. Early challenges to the President's exercise of tariff powers focused on the constitutionality of the delegation of powers from Congress to the President. One key case, Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, established principles for this inquiry. In Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649 (1892), the Tariff Act of 1890 allowed the President to suspend duties on certain products from countries imposing unequal tariffs on US goods. The Tariff Act of 1890 authorized the President to suspend duties on specific products from countries with unequal tariffs on US goods. This delegated power allowed the President to reinstate tariffs on duty-free items if deemed necessary. Importers of textile goods challenged the resulting duties, claiming they were unjust. The importers challenged the Tariff Act of 1890, claiming it was unconstitutional to authorize the President to suspend duties on certain products. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that the act did not delegate legislative power to the President. The Supreme Court upheld the Tariff Act of 1890, stating that Congress, not the President, determined the provisions of the act regarding duties on products from designated countries. In a similar case in 1928, the Customs Court ruled in favor of a presidential proclamation increasing duties on imported goods. The Tariff Act of 1922 allows the President to adjust duties based on differences in production costs between the US and foreign countries. Similar to a previous case, the Supreme Court rejected claims of unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers to the President. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of delegating tariff powers to the President as long as Congress provides an intelligible principle for guidance. The President acts as an \"agent\" of Congress and carries out its will expressed in the statute, rather than making laws. The Supreme Court upheld the delegation of tariff powers to the President, requiring Congress to provide an intelligible principle for guidance. In a case involving license fees on imported oil, the Court ruled that the President was carrying out the will of Congress as expressed in the statute, rejecting claims of an unconstitutional delegation of power. In United States v. Yoshida International, a court upheld a presidential proclamation imposing an import duty surcharge of 10% following a national emergency declaration. The court found that the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 delegated the power to regulate importation to the President during war or national emergency only. The court in United States v. Yoshida International upheld a presidential proclamation imposing an import duty surcharge of 10% after a national emergency declaration. The court emphasized that the delegated emergency powers must have a reasonable relation to the emergency and examined the permissibility of the means of execution of the delegated power. In U.S. Cane Sugar Refiners' Association, the court upheld a presidential proclamation imposing quotas on sugar imports under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The court stated that as long as the President's action is authorized by statute, his reasoning for the action will not be subject to judicial review. This shows that courts will not scrutinize the President's reasoning for a decision authorized by law. Courts will closely review whether the action taken by the President in response to a national emergency bears a reasonable relationship to that determination. Delegations of tariff-modifying powers to the President should not bestow law-making powers and must include an intelligible principle to be constitutional. The constitutionality of delegations of power to the President hinges on whether Congress has provided an \"intelligible principle\" for the President to follow. Courts do not typically scrutinize the President's decision-making process but focus on whether the conditions triggering the President's authority are clearly defined in the statute. The scope of the delegated power and the President's actions within that scope will be closely examined by the courts. The constitutionality of delegations of power to the President depends on whether Congress has provided a clear framework for the President to follow. Courts will closely scrutinize the President's selected means of executing delegated powers to ensure they are permissible. Congress can assist by setting clear limitations on authorized means of exercising powers in the statute itself. This can increase the likelihood of courts finding the President's actions authorized if he adheres to the conditions set forth. The President's actions are authorized as long as he follows the conditions in the statute."
