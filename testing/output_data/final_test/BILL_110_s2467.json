The Secretary then informs the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This process applies to vaccines approved by the Secretary instead of a separate notice program. Manufacturers can reduce the 12-month notification period for discontinuing vaccine production by certifying good cause to the Secretary, such as public health risks, biomaterial shortages, liability issues, economic hardship, or bankruptcy filing.
