    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 44272 of the Health and Safety Code is amended. The Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program is created and administered by the commission. It provides funding for innovative technologies to transform California's fuel and vehicle types to support climate change policies. Grants, loans, and other measures are available for public agencies, businesses, fleet owners, and academic institutions. The program aims to develop and deploy alternative and renewable fuels and technologies in the marketplace without favoring any specific fuel or technology. Projects receiving over $75,000 from the commission must be approved at a public meeting and align with established priorities. The executive director can approve agreements under $75,000 or amendments that do not increase funding or change the project scope. The commission gives preferences to projects that maximize the goals of the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program based on criteria such as transitioning from petroleum fuels to alternative fuels, aligning with state climate policies, and reducing air pollutants and environmental impacts. The project must reduce water pollutants and substances harmful to health and the environment compared to California Phase 2 Reformulated Gasoline or diesel fuel. It should not harm the sustainability of state natural resources, including state and federal lands. The project must reduce water pollutants and harmful substances compared to California Phase 2 Reformulated Gasoline or diesel fuel. It should not harm state natural resources. The project provides economic benefits for California by promoting technology firms, jobs, and businesses. It uses existing fueling infrastructure and aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 10 percent. The project aims to use alternative fuel blends of at least 20 percent, drive new technology advancement for vehicles and promote deployment in the marketplace. Funding preference is given to projects with higher benefit-cost scores. Eligibility for funding is limited to specific criteria. Projects eligible for funding include alternative and renewable fuel projects, demonstration and deployment projects for engine technologies, production of low-carbon fuels in California, and projects to reduce the carbon footprint of alternative fuels. Funding preference is given to projects with higher benefit-cost scores. Alternative and renewable fuel infrastructure, including electric vehicle charging in disadvantaged communities, is exempt from funding preference rules for renewable diesel or biodiesel infrastructure. Projects aim to enhance vehicle technologies for better fuel efficiency, lower emissions, and alternative fuel usage. This includes advancements in propulsion systems, lightweight materials, energy storage, intelligent transportation systems, and battery recycling. Additionally, it covers the development of design standards, testing protocols, and conversions to plug-in hybrid technology. Programs and projects focus on accelerating the commercialization of vehicles and alternative fuels, including buy-down programs, advanced technology warranty, and supply-chain development. Additionally, there are initiatives to retrofit medium- and heavy-duty vehicle fleets with fuel-efficient technologies and promote infrastructure development for alternative fuels in existing transportation corridors. Workforce training programs for alternative and renewable fuel production, high-performance vehicle technology, and mass transit fleet conversion. Block grants and incentive programs for projects promoting alternative fuel and vehicle technology centers in California. Commission may establish guidelines for program implementation. (12) State agency conducts analyses on low-carbon transportation fuels and technologies for investment plan. (13) Program offers funding for homeowners buying plug-in electric vehicles to install charging stations. The commission may award single or sole source contracts for applied research, following specific requirements. They can also contract with the Treasurer to allocate funds for programs, as long as it complies with the relevant regulations. The commission can contract with small business financial development corporations to use funds for the Small Business Loan Guarantee Program. They can also advance funds to public entities, recipients making advance payments to public entities, or administrators of block grant programs. Section 44268.2 of the Health and Safety Code is being amended. Section 44268.2 of the Health and Safety Code is being amended to ensure that users of electric vehicle charging stations that require payment are not required to pay a subscription fee or become members of any club. The total charges, including roaming fees, must be disclosed at the point of sale, and payment can be made via credit card or mobile technology. Electric vehicle charging stations must disclose location, fees, payment methods, and roaming charges. Stations should be labeled according to regulations and may have directional signage. Subscription-based services are allowed, but nonsubscribers must have payment options available. The state board may adopt interoperability billing standards for electric vehicle charging stations if no national standards are in place by January 1, 2016. Stations requiring payment must comply with these standards within six months. The adopted standards may consider other industry-developed standards and those from authoritative bodies."
