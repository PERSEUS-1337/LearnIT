    "content": "The THUD Appropriations Subcommittees draft bills for annual appropriations for DOT, HUD, and related agencies. DOT primarily provides grants for transportation infrastructure and oversees safety in various industries. FAA's budget is mainly for operating the air traffic control system. The Department of Transportation (DOT) primarily funds the operation of the U.S. air traffic control system, employing over 80% of DOT's workforce. Title II of the annual THUD appropriations bill funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which focuses on addressing housing issues for low-income households through various rental assistance programs and block grant initiatives. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers grant programs for low-income families and homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages for home buyers with low down payments and developers of affordable rental buildings. Title III of the THUD appropriations bill funds agencies involved in transportation, housing, and community development, such as the Access Board, National Transportation Safety Board, and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. The Surface Transportation Board was made independent of DOT in 2015 legislation and now appears in Title III of the THUD bill. Most programs in the THUD bill are funded through regular annual appropriations from the general fund of the Treasury. Congress may also provide emergency appropriations in response to disasters, often outside of regular appropriations acts. Emergency appropriations typically come from the general fund and may not be included in the discretionary appropriation total reported for an agency. Most of DOT's budget is in the form of contract authority, which controls spending from federal trust fund resources. Total annual discretionary budget authority for THUD is typically around half of the total funding provided in the bill, with the remainder made up of DOT's mandatory contract authority. Congressional appropriators are generally subject to limits on the amount of new nonemergency discretionary funding they can provide in a year. One way to stay within these limits is to appropriate no more than the allocated amount of discretionary funding in the regular annual appropriations act. The regular annual appropriations act allocates discretionary funding, which can be offset through rescissions or offsetting receipts. Funding trends for DOT and HUD from FY2010-FY2016 are shown in Table 1, excluding emergency and supplemental funding. Legislative action on the FY2017 THUD appropriations bill is outlined in Table 2. The annual budget resolution provides a framework for Congress to consider legislation affecting spending and revenue. It sets spending and revenue levels, enforceable by a point of order. House and Senate committees receive discretionary spending allocations from the budget resolution, which are divided among subcommittees responsible for appropriations bills. While the resolution and allocations do not determine specific funding amounts, they set parameters for funding decisions. The House and Senate have not yet adopted a budget resolution for FY2017. The House and Senate have not adopted a budget resolution for FY2017. The Senate Budget Committee chair filed budgetary levels in the Congressional Record, enforceable in the Senate. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported initial suballocations, including $56.474 billion for the THUD subcommittee, $1 billion less than FY2016. The House Appropriations Committee adopted interim suballocations, not procedurally enforceable, with $58.190 billion for the THUD subcommittee in H.Rept. 114-606. The discretionary funding provided for THUD in FY2016, the Obama Administration request for FY2017, and the amounts allocated by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees are detailed in tables. The Obama Administration requested $134.5 billion for THUD programs in FY2017, $20.5 billion more than in FY2016, with increases mainly for highway, transit, and rail funding. The Trump Administration requested a reduction in funding for DOT and HUD programs in FY2017, including zeroing out certain programs and cutting funding for others. The Senate-reported S. 2844 recommended a slight increase in funding for THUD over FY2016 levels. FY2017 funding is currently being provided through a Continuing Appropriations Resolution at a similar level to FY2016. In FY2016, the THUD subcommittees were able to provide $8.7 billion in discretionary appropriations to THUD agencies above the net discretionary budget authority level due to budgetary savings from rescissions and offsets. The amount of these \"budget savings\" can vary from year to year, affecting the cost in terms of 302(b) allocation. In FY2016, the THUD subcommittees provided $8.7 billion in discretionary appropriations to THUD agencies above the net discretionary budget authority level. In FY2017, the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $1.9 billion more discretionary funding for THUD compared to FY2016, despite a $1.1 billion decrease in discretionary allocation. The Trump Administration requested a $1 billion reduction in DOT funding from FY2016 levels, including cuts to the Essential Air Services and TIGER grant programs. The Senate bill for the Department of Transportation (DOT) included $76.9 billion in new budgetary resources, with increases in funding for federal-aid highway program and federal public transportation program. It also allocated $85 million for new intercity rail grant programs and $1.42 billion for Amtrak. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended a similar amount of new budgetary resources as the Senate bill. The Senate bill for the Department of Transportation includes increases in funding for federal-aid highway and public transportation programs, as well as $50 million for new intercity rail grant programs and $1.42 billion for Amtrak. The Obama Administration's budget proposal for DOT requests $96.9 billion in budgetary resources, including $1.25 billion for National Infrastructure Investment (TIGER grants) and $51.5 billion for federal-aid highways. The FY2017 budget includes $19.8 billion for public transportation, a 68% increase from FY2016, and $1.9 billion for Amtrak, a 37% increase from FY2016. The Trump Administration has recommended a $1.5 billion reduction in funding for the Community Development Block Grant program. The House Appropriations Committee's bill for HUD proposes $47.95 billion in gross appropriations. The FY2017 budget includes $38.7 billion in net budget authority for HUD, with funding increases for Section 8 tenant-based and project-based rental assistance accounts. The Senate bill would provide $48.4 billion in gross appropriations for HUD. The FY2017 budget for HUD includes $39.2 billion in net budget authority, with funding increases for Section 8 tenant-based and project-based rental assistance accounts. This is approximately $1.5 billion more in appropriations than FY2016 but about $500 million less than the Obama Administration's request. Funding for Community Development Block Grants remains level compared to FY2016, with additional funding for new incremental vouchers for youth aging out of foster care and homeless veterans. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request for HUD included $48.9 billion in gross appropriations, $39.7 billion in net budget authority, and increases in funding for most HUD programs. There was a 7% funding cut for CDBG, with a proposal to revisit funding distribution. Table 8 shows appropriations levels for related agencies funded within the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies bill. The Surface Transportation Board was transferred to the Related Agencies title starting with FY2017. The House Appropriations Committee-passed bill would reduce funding for the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) by $1.5 million in FY2017, with a sunset date of October 1, 2017. The committee report notes that funding could be better used to serve individuals experiencing homelessness directly. The Obama Administration requested to extend the sunset date to October 1, 2020, while the Senate Appropriations Committee-passed bill proposed an extension to October 1, 2018. Neither the House nor Senate bills would provide funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling administered by NeighborWorks America. The Senate-passed bill would provide funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling through NeighborWorks America, despite declining foreclosure rates. The Obama Administration did not request funding for this counseling in FY2017. Both the House and Senate bills would continue funding for broader community reinvestment activities and housing counseling through HUD."
