    "content": "This chapter outlines nuclear detection science, focusing on weapons and the fissile materials used in them. Nuclear weapons require uranium enriched to 20% U-235 or plutonium Pu-239. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 designates these materials as \"special nuclear material\" (SNM). In this report, highly enriched uranium (HEU) refers to weapons-grade enrichment levels of 90% U-235. Weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) is at least 93% Pu-239. It would take 26 kg of HEU or 5 kg of WGPu to fuel a bomb. Nuclear detection uses photons, measured in electron volts (eV), with energy levels in keV and MeV. The electromagnetic spectrum ranges from radio waves to gamma rays, with x-rays and gamma rays having similar energies but originating from different processes. Gamma rays come from an atom's nucleus, while x-rays come from interactions with an atom's electrons. Detection systems use gamma-ray spectra to identify radioactive isotopes, while x-ray beams can have higher energies than gamma rays. X-ray beams, generated through the bremsstrahlung process, are more penetrating than gamma rays. They are produced when charged particles accelerate and collide with a heavy metal target, releasing energy as x-rays with a range of energy levels. X-rays do not have spectral peaks like gamma rays. Signatures are properties used to detect substances, such as SNM. Atomic number (Z) is the number of protons in an atom's nucleus, while density is a bulk property. The densest materials have high atomic numbers (Z) and can be used to detect uranium and plutonium. Detection methods like effective Z and radiography use Z and density combined. The opacity of an object to a photon beam depends on its Z, density, and the energy of the photons. Dense, high-Z material absorbs or scatters gamma rays and x-rays, making them useful for detecting objects like bombs in containers. To detect objects like bombs in containers, x-rays or gamma rays are beamed in to create a radiograph. Radioactive atoms emit gamma rays and neutrons, with gamma-ray spectra being well characterized for each isotope. Elevated gamma radiation levels may or may not indicate the presence of special nuclear material (SNM), but careful analysis of the total gamma-ray spectrum can reveal its presence. Uranium from a nuclear reactor may contain uranium-232, which decays over time. The decay of uranium-232 to thallium-208 produces a high-energy gamma ray, making it easily detectable. Neutrons are released during fission of heavy elements like U-238 and plutonium, with plutonium emitting a significant amount of neutrons. Neutrons do not have a characteristic energy spectrum for identification, requiring detector elements for data collection. Detection of isotopes involves using detector elements to collect data, converting it into usable information through algorithms, and acting on that information through CONOPS. Detectors, algorithms, and CONOPS are essential for effective nuclear detection. Detectors convert energy from photons and neutrons into electrical pulses, which are then processed by algorithms to provide understandable data for operators. The CONOPS for nuclear detection involves specifying how detection units operate to obtain data and how the data are used, including resolving alarms on-site or referring them to off-site experts and managing the flow of data effectively. The flow of data in nuclear detection involves managing intelligence information, data from detection systems, and analysis by federal, state, and local officials. Detector sensitivity relies on detection efficiency and spectral resolution to extract true signals from noise. The efficiency of radiation detectors can be increased by using larger or closer detectors to the source, which improves the fraction of radiation reaching the detector. Spectral resolution, referring to the sharpness of peaks in a gamma-ray spectrum, is crucial for accurate data collection. Polyvinyl toluene (PVT) is a cost-effective material for detectors but has poor resolution, leading to blurred peaks from gamma rays of different energies. The efficiency of radiation detectors can be increased by using larger or closer detectors to the source, which improves the fraction of radiation reaching the detector. Spectral resolution is crucial for accurate data collection. Polyvinyl toluene (PVT) has poor resolution, blurring peaks from gamma rays of different energies. High-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors provide sharp peaks for clear identification of specific isotopes, but are expensive and require cooling. Cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) crystals have improved sensitivity, shown in Figure 5 with cesium-137 spectrum. Increasing the spatial resolution of a detector improves sensitivity by controlling the field-of-view and reducing background radiation levels, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. Longer scan times improve accuracy but hinder commerce flow, striking a balance between data collection and operational efficiency. Nuclear detection utilizes neutrons and photons to detect radioactive material passively or actively. Neutrons and photons can penetrate most materials, making them ideal for detection purposes. Gamma rays and x-rays are used actively to probe containers for dense material. Fission induced by beamed neutrons or high-energy photons emits detectable neutrons and gamma rays. Scintillator materials like PVT can convert gamma rays into electrical energy for measurement. One way to convert gamma rays into electrical energy is by using a scintillator material like PVT. The gamma ray interacts with the material, emitting lower-energy photons of visible light. A photomultiplier tube then converts these photons into electrons, generating a measurable pulse of electricity. The pulse is sorted by energy using a multi-channel analyzer and displayed as a gamma-ray spectrum. Alternatively, a semiconductor material like HPGe can directly convert gamma rays into an electrical signal proportional to the energy deposited. When a gamma ray interacts with a semiconductor material, it generates an electric current proportional to the gamma-ray energy deposited. The current is sorted by voltage and used to compute a spectrum. A common neutron detector uses helium-3 gas, where low-energy neutrons are absorbed, producing charged particles that generate a current. Charged particles from helium-3 atoms generate a tiny electric current when they lose energy. Neutron count is crucial for identifying special nuclear materials (SNM) and U-238 due to their neutron emission. Neutron spectra are not useful for identifying isotopes as they lack distinct energy lines. Helium-3 scarcity has led to the search for alternatives like boron-10 for neutron detection in homeland security. High-energy photons can penetrate solid objects but are scattered or absorbed by dense materials. Gamma rays and x-rays are used for radiography and cargo scanning to create opacity maps of container contents. Dense objects can mask special nuclear materials, and shielding can be used to defeat detection systems. Different materials attenuate gamma rays in varying amounts depending on their quantity and energy level. High-Z materials absorb and deflect gamma rays, while low-Z materials absorb and scatter neutrons. WGPu emits energetic gamma rays that are difficult to attenuate. Iran is enriching uranium using centrifuges from chemical forms derived from uranium ore, which have not been through a reactor. This makes it difficult to shield gamma rays from the uranium. Other sources of radiation, such as background radiation from naturally occurring radioactive material and commercial goods containing radioactive material, complicate detection efforts. Radioactive isotopes are widely used in medicine and industry. Enemy attempts to defeat detection systems may complicate plots or make them more detectable. Congress mandated scanning U.S.-bound containers with imaging and radiation detection equipment at foreign ports. Salvage fuzing could detonate a weapon if attempts to detect it are sensed. Smuggling HEU into the United States to avoid detection is a concern. Attempts to smuggle highly enriched uranium (HEU) into the United States to avoid detection of a complete bomb would require fabricating the weapon inside the country, risking accidents that could provide clues to law enforcement. The United States deploys technologies, like pager-sized devices, to detect nuclear weapons or special nuclear material (SNM), but they have limitations in identifying the material causing an alarm. Radiation portal monitors (RPMs) are used to detect radiation from vehicles. Radiation portal monitors (RPMs) use scintillator material like PVT to detect radiation from vehicles. While RPMs were deployed post-9/11 due to cost, PVT cannot pinpoint radiation sources, leading to false alarms from everyday items with radioactive material. Newer hand-held devices with isotope identification capabilities use high-purity germanium crystals but are heavy and delicate, limiting field use. Radiation portal monitors (RPMs) are limited in detecting low radioactivity sources like shielded HEU in cargo containers. These devices create radiographic images of contents to search for nuclear weapons and contraband. However, dense or jumbled items may hide these threats. Various U.S. technologies are being developed for nuclear detection. The section discusses nine U.S. technologies selected to include different agencies, organizations, types of technology, physical principles, distances between detector and object, and levels of maturity. The curr_chunk discusses various categories related to the technologies selected for deployment in the future, including the problem addressed, technology background, description, potential benefits, status, risks, funding, and potential synergisms. It emphasizes the importance of considering risks and potential gains by increased funding for each technology. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of engineering scientifically sound technologies into workable systems, addressing affordability, development time, and field use problems. Project managers expressed a need for increased funding to solve problems and exploit opportunities. The analysis focuses on how managers of nine technologies would use additional funds to improve their projects, such as pursuing multiple routes, buying more equipment, or hiring more staff. This analysis is not meant to solely focus on these technologies for authorization or appropriation consideration. The curr_chunk discusses nine technologies and their potential synergisms, highlighting common elements and applications beyond current plans. DTRA and DNDO terminated the nanocomposite scintillator project in January 2010, but two parts continue as separate projects for detecting low energy neutrons and identifying gamma-ray spectra. The curr_chunk discusses efforts to combine desirable qualities of scintillator materials for better performance at lower cost in detecting thermal neutrons and identifying gamma-ray spectra simultaneously. Scintillators capture energy from photons, ideally depositing their full energy to build accurate photon energy spectra. Inorganic scintillators like sodium iodide with thallium have a high probability of full energy interaction, making them efficient in converting energy into visible light for accurate gamma-ray spectrum identification. Inorganic scintillators like sodium iodide with thallium have a high probability of full energy interaction for accurate gamma-ray spectrum identification. However, they have drawbacks such as small sensitive area, fragility, sensitivity to environmental conditions, and cost issues. Organic scintillators like plastic PVT are cheaper, easier to make, and less fragile. The Nanocomposite Scintillator Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory aims to combine the advantages of inorganic and organic scintillator materials to improve gamma-ray spectrum identification. Nanocrystals of certain inorganic materials are used to capture most of the energy from photons, addressing the inefficiency of plastic scintillators like PVT in absorbing gamma rays. The nanocomposite scintillator project at Los Alamos National Laboratory combines inorganic scintillator materials with plastic to improve gamma-ray spectrum identification. Lanthanum bromide or cerium bromide crystals mixed with modified polystyrene plastic increase energy conversion to a detectable signal. When a gamma-ray photon strikes this material, its energy is absorbed by nanocrystals and the plastic, generating optical photons that are converted to an electronic signal for counting. The nanocomposite scintillator project at Los Alamos National Laboratory aims to improve gamma-ray spectrum identification by combining inorganic scintillator materials with plastic. The project, led by Edward McKigney, believes that nanocomposite scintillator material can discriminate between neutrons and gamma rays based on simulations and experiments. Neutrons generate protons when they strike the plastic, while gamma rays generate electrons, leading to different responses in the material. The nanocomposite scintillator project at Los Alamos National Laboratory aims to improve gamma-ray spectrum identification by combining inorganic scintillator materials with plastic. The material can detect neutrons and differentiate between them and gamma rays. The cost-effective material offers high performance at a low cost, is rugged and flexible, and can be fabricated at an industrial scale. It operates at ambient temperatures, increasing detector sensitivity. The nanocomposite scintillator project at Los Alamos National Laboratory aims to develop a new material for gamma-ray spectrum identification. The project includes components such as process scale-up, electronics development, detector design, and basic research. The budget for the project started in 2004 with funding from Los Alamos, DNDO, and DTRA. The goal is to deliver a small cylinder of the material by December 2008 and have a pilot-scale demonstration by the end of FY2009. Anticipated costs for FY2009 are $4 million for the nanocomposite scintillator component. The project aims to demonstrate a scintillator material optimized for gamma-ray detection. The schedule for the demonstration has been delayed by 6 to 12 months. Researchers are working on finding chemicals to coat nanocrystals for proper dispersion in plastic, aiming for a packing level of 50%. Care must be taken to minimize changes in plastic properties due to densely packed crystals. High packing levels are needed to measure gamma-ray peak sharpness. The project aims to optimize a scintillator material for gamma-ray detection, with experiments planned by December 2008 to measure peak sharpness. Attention must be paid to ensure the material can be manufactured with industrial processes, as heat generated during production could impair performance. Chemical engineering solutions exist for industrial-scale production. The project aims to optimize a scintillator material for gamma-ray detection, with experiments planned to measure peak sharpness by December 2008. Chemical engineering solutions exist for industrial-scale production, but concerns remain about devising a solution for pilot-scale production. The cost estimate for industrial production is based on raw material procurement and assumes low energy processing costs. The product cost is sensitive to the cost of cerium, a rare earth element, and excludes fixed infrastructure costs. Transferring the technology to industrial production remains a key consideration. The project aims to optimize a scintillator material for gamma-ray detection, with a total budget of about $5.5 million per year. Transferring the technology to a commercial partner by the end of FY2009 depends on resolving potential scientific and engineering problems in a timely manner and finding the right partner. The project is focused on designing robustness into the material to minimize the risk of failure in everyday use. McKigney suggests increasing the project budget to $12M/year to expedite the development of a scintillator material with high resolution and low cost. The project is pursuing a basic research project alongside its main goals, utilizing equipment at Los Alamos but could benefit from having its own equipment. Fabricating a large panel of detector material is challenging, and segmenting it into smaller panels is more feasible. McKigney suggests increasing the project budget to expedite the development of scintillator material for detectors. A panel segmented into tiny panels offers a cost-effective solution and data on radioactive source position. Custom-designed electronics channels are needed for each panel element, which could take years. Additional funding could accelerate the development of chips and scintillator material. Hiring more experts would also speed up the projects. This material is most beneficial for detectors using large panels of scintillator material. Nanocomposite scintillator material offers greater sensitivity and resolution for algorithms to process data, potentially simplifying algorithm development. It may be used for measuring neutron and gamma ray energies, serving as an alternative to helium-3 gas tubes for neutron detection. In a controlled environment, radioisotopes can be identified by matching gamma ray spectra to a library, but at ports or borders, the spectra would be complicated by various radiation sources. At ports or borders, gamma ray spectra are complicated by radiation sources and material attenuation. Nuclear detection algorithms are crucial for extracting signals from spectra, ensuring fast and accurate data processing to prevent false positives and negatives. The software is essential for processing data from detection hardware, making it usable for operators. The algorithm for gamma-ray identification models radiation transport through materials, recording gamma rays from various sources including background radiation, radioisotopes, and nuclear weapons. Uncertainties arise from energy loss, material interactions, and statistical fluctuations in gamma-ray counts. The composition and thickness of materials between the radiation source and detector are unknown, affecting the accuracy of the equations. Dean Mitchell of Sandia National Laboratories developed the \"Gamma Detector Response and Analysis Software\" (GADRAS) in 1985 for analyzing airborne radionuclides. GADRAS was later enhanced for automated isotope identification at border crossings post-9/11 to quickly process spectroscopic data for screening commerce. GADRAS was modified for quick data processing and accurate radioactive source identification using gamma-ray spectra analysis. The application includes six radiation analysis algorithms and supports radiation transport calculations. GADRAS analyzes the full spectrum to avoid ambiguity caused by overlapping peaks and to capture data outside the peaks. Less than 3% of counts in a U-238 spectrum occur in the most prominent peak. Using the entire spectrum in gamma-ray analysis helps characterize materials and improve accuracy in identifying radioactive sources. Absence of counts in certain regions can provide clues to the identity of materials. GADRAS also utilizes neutron flux data to differentiate between high-Z and low-Z materials. GADRAS, a software used since 1986, is continually upgraded to support new radiation sensors and capabilities. It now includes the analysis of data from neutron multiplicity counters, making it more automated and faster. The goal is to require less skill to operate and improve efficiency. The current effort for GADRAS focuses on improving sensitivity to SNM and reducing false alarms. Sacrifices to fidelity were made in the past for speed, but with faster computers, analysis can be improved while increasing speed. Researchers are examining 2005 radiation sensor data to address false alarms. The main application of GADRAS is to support \"Triage/Reachback\" analysis for radiation detection operators in the field. Customs and Border Protection officers use GADRAS for detailed analysis of suspicious radiation signatures in vehicles or cargo containers. If needed, data can be sent to nuclear weapons laboratories for further analysis. GADRAS analyzes gamma ray spectra to accurately detect special nuclear material, reducing false positives and negatives. Neutron count data enhances its capabilities. GADRAS has been used for cargo inspection since 1998 with regular software upgrades. Sandia estimates spending $600,000 in FY2010 for GADRAS development. DTRA and NNSA are proposing next-generation GADRAS development with emphasis on algorithm revisions and software updates for field use. Scientific challenges include improving equations for detector material response to radiation. The main risk to GADRAS development is the programming language used for the graphical user interface. The current version of GADRAS has a GUI written in Visual Basic Version 6 (VB6), which may not be compatible with new compilers or future versions of Windows. User feedback indicates issues with components in Vista. Upgrading GADRAS is a low-budget activity with little cost risk, but it would take one to two years to revise the GUI due to lack of funding. The current version of GADRAS has significant schedule risks, and it may take one to two years to revise the GUI. Upgrading in advance of a change in operating systems would prevent interruptions for users. GADRAS has been in use for many years mainly by scientists and technicians, reducing the risk of failure in everyday use. Careful testing reduces the risk of problems with upgrades. There are concerns about compatibility with future Windows versions and the need for timely conversions. GADRAS is considered complicated to use and is mainly used for Reachback rather than in the field. Mitchell suggests a budget of $600,000 a year for two years to hire additional staff. Mitchell proposes allocating $600,000 a year for two years to hire programmers to update GADRAS and document the Application Programs Interface. This would allow for easier access to capabilities in the Dynamic Link Library, potentially improving system performance and increasing worker safety by reducing radiation exposure. Increased computation power could enhance GADRAS capabilities, allowing for faster iterations and field use with radiation detection equipment. Modifications to improve performance of radioisotope identification devices are also being funded by DTRA. Improved scintillator materials can provide better data inputs, reducing false negatives and positives. Developing equipment to detect terrorist nuclear weapons and SNM requires evaluating cost and performance tradeoffs. Computer modeling can help in running simulated trials to optimize detector performance, maximizing true positives while minimizing false positives. The tradeoff in detecting threats involves balancing true positives and false positives, as shown by ROC curves. Improving one aspect comes at the expense of the other, highlighting the challenge in nuclear detection equipment performance. In nuclear threat detection, the challenge lies in balancing true positives and false alarms. False alarms are costly in terms of resources and can lead to operators ignoring alarms or reducing detector sensitivity, risking missing real threats. This tradeoff is illustrated in ROC curves, where improving detection performance may increase false alarms. The performance of a hypothetical detector can be visualized by moving from curve A to curve B to curve C, showing improvements over time. These curves could represent different detector materials, algorithm modifications, or varying operating conditions. Actual ROC curves are more complex and may cross over each other, indicating different detector performance. The performance of a detector can vary based on operational variables such as scan time, target type, distance, and environmental conditions. Choices in detector elements, algorithms, and subroutines impact performance, with many possible combinations. Multiple trials are needed to gather sufficient data for a statistically valid ROC curve. Computer modeling can help in gathering data for comparing, improving, or choosing between detection systems and their components by creating mathematical representations of the real world and varying inputs to calculate outputs. Modeling considers controllable variables (operational scenario, detector, and algorithm) and uncontrolled variables (signals from radioactive material) to assess detector performance. The performance of a modeled detector can be illustrated using ROC curves by simulating encounters for different variables. This helps in comparing detector performance and evaluating system requirements. Model developers strive to improve the representation of reality in computer-generated data for nuclear detection encounters. The spectral resolution required of a detector material to distinguish gamma-ray spectra of threat sources from non-threat sources is achieved through a program called Detection Modeling and Operational Analysis (DMOA). This program generates simulated populations of spectra to capture a range of gamma-ray sources and shielding configurations found in commerce, saving time and costs compared to experimental data generation. The models created by national laboratories and private sector contractors characterize operational scenarios, radiation signals, detectors, and signal-processing algorithms, with complex mathematical representations. Alternative algorithms are simulated to improve detector performance. The Detection Modeling and Operational Analysis (DMOA) program focuses on simulating gamma-ray spectra to improve detector performance. A study found differences in cargo spectra between seasons, attributed to varying product mixes. The program processes operational scenario data, radiation signals, and detector information to create gamma-ray spectra for algorithm analysis. The algorithm treats real-world and simulated spectra the same, emphasizing the importance of accurately generating gamma-ray spectra for simulation. The key to simulation is generating a gamma-ray spectrum that mimics real-world inputs for accurate system performance evaluation. Detection probability and false alarm rate can be summarized in a ROC curve. Improving model fidelity requires detailed knowledge of components being modeled and assessing detector performance sensitivity to operational changes. Evaluation benchmarks are essential for comparing systems, requiring a reference set of threat objects and shielding. In 2006, DMOA expanded the reference set of threat objects and shielding to include new threats and shieldings. They also developed a model for detecting objects using radiography. DMOA emphasized the importance of background and nuisance source modeling in setting detection thresholds. Real-world data was used to create a model of naturally occurring radioactive material distribution, which was validated against another dataset. Operational analysis compared algorithm performance using real-world data to highlight system sensitivity. The study analyzed the performance of various algorithms and emphasized the sensitivity of system performance to the detection algorithm used. A resolution study found benefits in better resolution for distinguishing threats from other radiation sources. Modeling was preferred over real-world data for constructing statistically significant ROC curves due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of field trials. Modeling is preferred over real-world data for constructing statistically significant ROC curves due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of field trials. A model allows for running thousands of simulated encounters in a short time to explore detector performance. It also enables exploration of encounters that may not be feasible in the real world due to cost, safety, or difficulty constraints. Additionally, a model and test program work together, with the test program generating data for the model to improve its predictive power. Modeling is preferred over real-world data for constructing statistically significant ROC curves due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of field trials. A model allows for running thousands of simulated encounters in a short time to explore detector performance and analyze alternatives before committing to a specific design. DMOA is an ongoing program funded at approximately $2 million per year within the DNDO System Architecture program. The DNDO System Architecture program funds the DMOA program at around $2 million annually for detection modeling. Other offices within DNDO, DOE, and DOD also conduct detection modeling for various purposes. The total federal budget spending on modeling is challenging to estimate due to its cross-cutting nature. The key risk lies in the model's output potentially differing significantly from actual field trial data, especially concerning uncertainties in modeling underlying science like radiation spectra. The modeling design team faces challenges in accurately predicting radiation transport in cargo containers due to uncertainties in the type of shielding an attacker might use. Different cargo types interfere with radiation transport differently, affecting gamma ray spectra. Models make simplifications and approximations, increasing the risk of not representing reality accurately. Systematic errors may arise, such as differences between seasonal cargo. Additional shielding and radiation sources add complexity to the modeling process. The modeling team faces challenges in predicting radiation transport in cargo containers due to uncertainties in shielding types. Different cargo types affect gamma ray spectra, and models may not accurately represent reality. Additional shielding and radiation sources increase complexity in the modeling process. LLNL has developed a statistical model for generating nuisance source populations based on measured data, but validating the model remains a difficulty. The modeling team encounters challenges in predicting radiation transport in cargo containers due to uncertainties in shielding types and the complexity of different cargo types affecting gamma ray spectra. Validating the model is difficult, as various isotopes contribute to background radiation, and there is no standard procedure to compare multivariate populations. Injecting spectra from radiation sources like HEU or WGPu into computed cargo spectra to test threat material detection may not accurately represent reality, as terrorists may arrange cargo to evade detection. Modeling deliberate cargo arrangements to reflect adversary behavior is outside the expertise of simulation developers. Terrorism experts may need to modify injections to better simulate adversary behavior. The funds for DMOA are mainly allocated for staff salaries, reducing the likelihood of unexpected cost increases. To stay ahead of potential terrorist threats involving nuclear weapons or SNM, efforts are needed to upgrade evasion methods in models with inputs from intelligence services and advancements in radiation characterization and algorithms. The program's progress depends on available resources. The program for nuclear detection relies on available resources and faces challenges with false alarms driving detector settings. There is a risk of systematic errors impacting the model's effectiveness, especially in cases where adjustments in the field are not possible. The current efforts for detection modeling in national laboratories and private sector contractors are currently decentralized, with most staff working part-time on modeling. Richard Wheeler suggests that additional funding could allow for full-time staff, standardized tools, dedicated computing resources, peer review, coordination of efforts, and new databases for model validation. While detector performance analysis is sensitive, advancements in modeling tools are possible. Current radiography systems have limitations in detecting special nuclear material (SNM) in cargo containers due to dense material being inconspicuous when surrounded by other dense or random objects. SNM could also be hidden inside dense objects for camouflage, making detection challenging. The Cargo Advanced Automated Radiography System (CAARS) program aims to improve the detection of special nuclear material (SNM) in cargo containers. DNDO is conducting research and development on advanced radiography systems to overcome limitations in detecting SNM. Three technical approaches to radiography are being explored under CAARS, with different contractors involved. No deployable CAARS systems currently exist, so the diagrams and performance specifications presented are viewed as goals. The Cargo Advanced Automated Radiography System (CAARS) program aims to improve the detection of special nuclear material (SNM) in cargo containers. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) raises concerns about CAARS, as it is not yet demonstrated in commercially available equipment. Two types of equipment for scanning cargo containers have been widely used since 2002: radiation portal monitors and radiography equipment like the Rapiscan Classic Eagle and SAIC VACIS. Radiography equipment creates x-ray-type images of a container, which is more relevant to CAARS. Radiography equipment used in CAARS emits gamma rays or x-rays to create images of cargo containers. A computer processes the images pixel by pixel to detect opaque areas. However, these systems cannot differentiate between materials or distinguish threats from clutter, making it challenging to detect smaller threat objects. The detection probability decreases as the threat object becomes smaller, making it difficult for current radiography systems to detect small pieces of HEU. The L-3 and SAIC CAARS systems utilize a physical principle to search for materials with high atomic number (Z) by generating 6-MeV electrons and x-rays. These x-rays interact differently with matter based on their energy levels, with 6-MeV x-rays being more opaque to high-Z materials due to increased scattering when they strike electrons. High-Z material is more opaque to 6-MeV x-rays than low-Z material, creating bright or dark spots on radiographs. 9-MeV x-rays interact more strongly with an atom's nucleus, releasing energy in the form of an electron-positron pair. High-Z material is much more opaque to 9-MeV x-rays than to 6-MeV x-rays, allowing for the creation of dual-energy radiographs that highlight high-Z material. High-Z material, such as tungsten, gold, lead, uranium, and plutonium, can be identified in radiographs using a threshold of Z>72. However, this data alone is not enough to trigger an alarm in cargo containers due to overlapping objects. Additional algorithms are needed to separate and analyze individual objects based on their size and Z values. High-energy x-rays can also detect fissionable materials like U-235 and Pu-239. The CAARS system developed by L-3 Communications Corporation uses high-energy x-rays to detect high-Z material and SNM. It includes a concrete enclosure to minimize radiation exposure, with one linear accelerator generating 6-MeV electrons and x-rays. The system can process two trucks at a time in 3 minutes to meet the throughput requirement of 40 containers per hour. The CAARS system, developed by L-3 Communications Corporation, uses high-energy x-rays to detect high-Z material and SNM. It includes a concrete enclosure and two linear accelerators generating x-rays with energies from 0 to 6 MeV and 0 to 9 MeV. The system can automatically detect high-Z materials while providing standard radiographs, potentially integrating the SNM detection mission with CBP's historical mission of detecting illegal materials. The CAARS technology, developed by L-3 Communications Corporation, uses high-energy x-rays to detect high-Z materials and SNM. It can scan at least 40 40-foot containers an hour with a 90% probability of detecting 100 cc of high-Z material and a false alarm probability less than 3 percent. DNDO does not consider detection of high-Z material as a false alarm due to its potential use in shielding SNM. The CAARS program is also advancing scientific and technical capabilities, even if the systems are not deployed. The CAARS program, developed by L-3 Communications Corporation, uses high-energy x-rays to detect high-Z materials and SNM. It can scan containers quickly with high detection probability. DNDO conducted reviews to assess the technology's maturity and found it more challenging to implement than expected. The technology should be demonstrated for full performance capability before acquisition. DNDO modified the CAARS contracts in 2008 to focus on demonstration and test and evaluation components, removing the acquisition component. The L-3 CAARS project completed its Critical Design Review milestone in July 2008, allowing fabrication of the prototype to begin. The L-3 CAARS project completed its Critical Design Review milestone in July 2008, allowing fabrication of the prototype to begin in Las Vegas. The prototype produced its first image in May 2009. DNDO conducted Technology Demonstration and Characterization in February and March 2010 to develop algorithms for discriminating between materials. The Joint Integrated Non-Intrusive Inspection (JINII) Program was established as a collaboration between DNDO, CBP, and DHS for detecting contraband and high-Z material. The Joint Integrated Non-Intrusive Inspection (JINII) program, a collaboration between DNDO, CBP, and DHS, focuses on non-intrusive inspection methods to detect contraband and high-Z material in containers without physically opening them. JINII includes the CAARS system for automatic detection of suspicious areas and a test campaign to assess the ability of radiography systems to detect high-Z material visually. Additionally, commercial off-the-shelf systems like the Rapiscan Eagle Portal have been developed with limited capability to automatically detect high-Z objects in cargo. Deploying these systems could enhance inspection capabilities. The Rapiscan Eagle, a commercial off-the-shelf system, uses an accelerator to generate radiographic images of cargo containers. It has an added algorithm, \"Auto-Z,\" to detect high-Z material automatically. This system is cost-effective, utilizes existing infrastructure, and requires minimal operator training. It can detect a 400-cc cube of high-Z material nearly as well as CAARS candidates but struggles with a 100-cc cube. Deploying such systems could enhance inspection capabilities in the field. DNDO completed Technology Demonstration and Characterization testing for L-3, Rapiscan, and SAIC systems in March 2010. The data collected will help in cost-benefit analysis for high-Z and traditional contraband detection systems. Future development, testing, or acquisition of these systems may be recommended based on cost-effectiveness. The status of the test equipment as of May 2010 was significant according to Rynes. The AS&E CAARS material has been distributed to other DNDO projects. The SAIC CAARS system is being dismantled and material distributed. The L-3 CAARS system is stored for potential installation later. The Rapiscan Eagle remains at Moffett Field with funding through FY11. The budget for the CAARS program: FY2006, $16.3 million; FY2007, $26.4 million; FY2008, $31.8 million; FY2009, $26.1 million. The program ended in FY2009, replaced by a follow-on DNDO-CBP program with $15.2 million funding in FY2010. The L-3 system is intended to be the least complex and lowest-risk CAARS system. The CAARS system by L-3 is designed to be low-risk with commercially available hardware. The software risk is higher due to undeveloped algorithms for sorting materials on radiographs. Scaling up the system for container scanning remains a challenge, especially in handling large data quantities efficiently. Accelerators at high energy levels may require significant shielding, and x-rays can scatter from cargo interactions. The x-rays from the accelerator can scatter from cargo interactions, requiring shielding to prevent a large footprint that could hinder deployment of detection systems at ports. Adjusting the CAARS schedule for more R&D time could reduce schedule and cost risks, but spreading resources across three projects may delay each system and increase program costs. Focusing on the L-3 system, which is further in development, could be a more efficient use of funds. The efficient use of funds may involve focusing on the L-3 system, which is further along in development. However, a multi-pronged approach could offer advantages such as quick deployment of simpler technology and hedging against potential failures. The debate lies in whether these advantages justify the higher cost, as other companies are also developing systems to detect high-Z material outside of the CAARS program. The CAARS program's effectiveness is being questioned, with concerns about the money spent and the potential for a high false alarm rate. Operators may be able to clear false alarms without intrusive inspections, but confidence in their judgment is a key issue. The system does not differentiate between special nuclear material (SNM) and other high-Z material. The CAARS program is facing scrutiny due to concerns about false alarms and the inability to differentiate between SNM and other high-Z materials. Questions arise about the effectiveness of automated detection goals and the practicality of penetrating steel thickness commonly found in cargo containers. The CAARS program is under scrutiny for false alarms and difficulty in distinguishing SNM from other materials. Concerns about radiation interference with portal monitors and operational issues with CBP systems have arisen. The CBP expresses concerns about the size and radiation containment of the L-3 and AS&E CAARS systems, stating that only a few ports of entry on the U.S.-Mexican border could accommodate them. They are worried about radiation emitted by the equipment and the potential delays in container traffic due to scanning times. CBP notes concerns about the size and radiation containment of CAARS systems, emphasizing the need to minimize delays in scanning processes. Thomas Winkowski highlights the potential 5-minute sequence for scanning a container and warns against the lengthy rebooting and software reinstallations that could cause significant delays. CBP expressed concerns about the size and radiation containment of CAARS systems, emphasizing the need to minimize delays in scanning processes. They highlighted the challenges of the system's large footprint and throughput issues. Rynes mentioned that CBP's concerns led to a course correction for CAARS and the establishment of the JINII program. Additional funds could improve CAARS by reducing system size for easier deployment at ports. Additional funds could enhance CAARS capabilities by improving detector efficiency, automating radiograph processing, developing algorithms for contraband detection, and integrating with radiation portal monitors. Neutron or high-energy photon technology could be used to discriminate SNM from other materials, with DNDO issuing a call for development in 2008. The CAARS program was developed in March 2008 without technology for counting neutrons or gamma rays. SAIC developed a system under CAARS, completed in March 2010, with an uncertain future. SAIC is competing to apply the technology to another DHS program. The system uses an electron accelerator developed by Accuray Corporation. The accelerator system developed by Accuray Corporation uses interleaved electron beams to generate photons with a range of energies. These photons pass through a cargo container in a fan-like beam, creating opacity images that are combined into a dual-energy radiograph. The system automatically identifies areas of high-Z material and dense material for further inspection. The proprietary detector in the Accuray Corporation's accelerator system operates at a low photon flux, allowing for a more compact design. Unlike high photon flux accelerators, this system uses copper instead of tungsten for heat resistance, reducing the production of photoneutrons. Accuray Corporation's accelerator system uses copper instead of tungsten for heat resistance, reducing photoneutron production. The system has low beam flux, eliminating the need for large concrete structures for neutron shielding. The dual-energy interleaved accelerator has stable X-ray beam and low variance in photon dose repeatability. The CAARS system can differentiate approximately 15 bands of Z from carbon to uranium with better-than-expected dose repeatability. Each Z band is represented by a different color in radiographs, allowing for clearer display of different materials. The variance reduction increases the number of Z-bands that can be differentiated. Dual-energy radiography measures the thickness of materials by analyzing the number of photons transmitted through an object. An algorithm calculates thickness ratios and displays them as an image. Variance in x-ray output is corrected to avoid errors in measurements. The correction for variance in x-ray output in dual-energy radiography helps avoid errors in measurements, allowing for more Z bands to be displayed. Concerns with equipment detecting nuclear weapons add to the workload of CBP operators, but contraband remains a constant threat. Contraband smuggling is a constant threat, with criminals successfully hiding it in cargo containers. The ability to separate pixels into Z-bands would help detect typical contraband and high-Z material. Dividing pixels into Z-bands facilitates anomaly detection, such as guns hidden in shipments. Algorithms can be developed to highlight suspicious shapes. Reducing neutron flux offers advantages like lower worker exposure and cost savings. SAIC's CAARS system offers advantages such as reduced shielding requirements, compact size, and the capability to detect neutrons and gamma rays resulting from photofission. The system is designed to automatically flag high-Z material, reducing operator burden and risk. SAIC's CAARS system is designed to automatically flag high-Z material, reducing operator burden and risk. The system occupies less space than other systems, making it suitable for locations with limited space like seaports. SAIC has made significant progress in developing the system, including building and testing units, refining algorithms, and completing Technology Demonstration and Characterization by December 2009. The key to the system's compact size is the Accuray interleaved x-ray source. SAIC has resolved initial start-up issues with the Accuray compact X-ray source, which is now performing beyond expectations. The company is at the near-production prototype stage and can produce pilot test units for deployment at ports and border crossings in a few months. SAIC is now imaging full cargo loads at a design speed of 33 inches per second. The estimated unit price of the system is $4 million to $7 million, depending on procurement terms. DNDO did not elect to fund SAIC's proposal for an advanced system in September 2008. SAIC's proposal for an advanced technology demonstration of the add-on capability to its CAARS system was not funded by DNDO in September 2008. By April 2010, SAIC had disassembled its CAARS test unit due to lack of funds and was adapting its technology to a truck-mounted design in response to a DHS Broad Agency Announcement. SAIC anticipates potential contract awards for a next-generation mobile cargo imaging system under the CanScan program. SAIC anticipates developing a prototype integrating CAARS dual-energy technology with neutron active interrogation for CBP. The system involves an interleaved accelerator with scientific risks, requiring stable electron beams of two energy levels. As of May 2009, the accelerator was operating beyond expectations. The accelerator, operating beyond expectations, enabled completion of Technology Demonstration and Characterization in December 2009. SAIC's cargo imaging system has a resolution of 7 mm to 9 mm, which may affect detection of contraband. CBP prefers finer resolution for spotting contraband. SAIC can achieve 5-mm resolution with more detectors at a higher cost. CBP insists on minimal interference with commerce during cargo scanning, requiring a scanning speed of 2.7 ft per second to scan a 40.5-ft container in 15 seconds. This poses a challenge for the system's performance improvement at a given scan speed. Improving system performance at current scan speed and photon output would require costly redesign. Uncertainties about availability, cost, and deployment of system raise concerns. Deployment in large numbers may be hindered by high unit price. Potential need for more powerful accelerator could impact operations in ports with limited space. SAIC proposes adding more detectors to improve resolution without increasing radiation exposure. Additional funding would allow for integration of photofission detection with CAARS radiography, hiring more software engineers, and applying the technology to detect contraband. The dual-energy radiography technology can differentiate between organic materials and metals, making it useful for detecting contraband and explosives. Improved scintillator material is being developed by multiple teams of scientists for potential use in the SAIC system. Algorithms for gamma-ray detectors and radiography units may share similarities with those being developed by SAIC. DNDO terminated a contract with AS&E for a similar system, citing the need for additional basic research. AS&E is working on a CAARS system using a different technology called \"EZ-3D TM\" developed by Passport Systems, Inc. The \"EZ-3D TM\" technology, developed by Passport Systems, Inc., utilizes x-rays to detect materials based on their atomic number (Z) in three dimensions. High-Z materials scatter x-ray photons backwards, which are detected by photon detectors arranged to capture these scattered x-rays. The number and energy distribution of backscattered x-rays indicate the atomic number (Z) of materials. In real-world scenarios, the effect of Z on x-rays is slightly less due to mixed cargo types. The key to EZ-3D technology lies in the relationship between Z and backscattered x-rays, as shown in Figure 13 for different elements. The graphs show the distribution of backscattered x-rays for five elements: uranium, lead, tin, iron, and aluminum. The x-ray counts are normalized at 511 keV for comparison. Differences in the x-ray distribution between elements are observed, influenced by the energy of the electron beam used. The x-ray distribution for different elements is shown in graphs, influenced by the energy of the electron beam. Beyond 1300-1800 keV, background counts exceed backscattered counts, providing no useful data. The proposed design involves a truck pulling a cargo container through an inspection unit at slow speed, passing through a radiography unit and an EZ-3D unit with a 9-MeV electron beam. The Rhodotron generates a 9-MeV electron beam that is steered downward towards the cargo container. The beam moves back and forth across the container to scan it. If dense cargo is detected, the beam focuses on that area for more data. The electron beam hits a water-cooled metal target, producing x-rays through the bremsstrahlung process. The x-rays pass through a metal sheet to filter out low-energy x-rays and then through a collimator to form a beam traveling in one direction. Collimation removes x-rays traveling in unwanted directions, allowing the beam to pass through the cargo. Backscattered x-rays are detected by sodium iodide detectors, which are collimated to intersect with the x-ray beam. The intersection of the beam and detector's field of view forms a voxel, locating the position of the cargo in three dimensions. Each detector records the number of individual x-rays detected. The system designed by AS&E locates voxels in cargo containers in the third dimension using x-ray detectors. It scans for high-Z material in 15 seconds, accounting for backscattered photons passing through other cargo. The algorithm integrates radiography and backscatter data to reconstruct container contents, adjusting hypotheses iteratively for the best fit with the data and automatically alarming when detecting suspicious voxels. The AS&E system is designed to locate high-Z material in cargo containers using x-ray detectors. The algorithm alarms when detecting suspicious voxels, and it is expected to generate more data by breaking the volume into smaller units for easier detection. The EZ-3D effect in the AS&E system is specific to high-Z materials, improving performance by directing the x-ray beam to scan dense areas longer. It aims to locate suspicious objects in three dimensions, aiding CBP personnel in secondary inspections and reducing container inspection delays. AS&E has been developing the CAARS system since 2006 under a DNDO contract. In 2008, the goal of the program shifted to an advanced technology demonstration. Passport Systems conducted experiments at the University of California, Santa Barbara, using x-rays to scan cargo simulations. DNDO also conducted a Critical Design Review of the AS&E system. AS&E conducted a Critical Design Review (CDR) of the CAARS system in October 2008, approving the design and allowing hardware ordering for an ATD prototype system. The system's design was finalized in early October, with plans to assemble a full-scale ATD system by November 2008. AS&E would also build a shielded-room facility for system development. Data from the ATD system is expected in April 2009, followed by testing and evaluation by DNDO using their own containers and cargo. AS&E completed a Critical Design Review of the CAARS system in October 2008, approving the design for an ATD prototype system. The system's performance will be tested using its own containers, cargo, and targets. If successful, DNDO will decide on operational testing at a port of entry. AS&E projects the cost of the CAARS system at $8-10 million per unit. DNDO currently has no plans to purchase and deploy the system, but will use prototypes for data collection and cost-benefit analysis for potential future procurements by DHS. The AS&E CAARS system development was put on hold in February 2009 due to technical issues. The system could potentially differentiate between high-Z materials like uranium and lead, but practical challenges make it difficult. The L-3 and SAIC prototypes are easier to deploy in a port environment compared to the AS&E system. The development of a system to differentiate high-Z materials in containers faces practical challenges, potentially requiring secondary inspections and causing delays. Passport Systems uses a lower-powered accelerator for experiments, raising questions about risks associated with shifting to a higher-powered accelerator. Integration of a linear accelerator and Rhodotron for EZ-3D has not been demonstrated. Passport Systems has simulated the performance of EZ-3D by merging radiography data into the cargo reconstruction algorithm. There are concerns about the AS&E system meeting the intended scan speed and the ability of the manufacturer, Ion Beam Applications, to build Rhodotrons faster and cheaper. AS&E plans to build a facility in the US for Rhodotron assembly if a large order is received. Concerns exist about the cost and production ramp-up of Rhodotrons. AS&E has experience in system design but has not consulted with CBP on the CAARS system design. Illig explains that the footprint of the unit is 60 ft by 160 ft due to concrete walls for radiation shielding, a concern for port operators due to limited space. The length could potentially be reduced to 40-50 ft by 120 ft by using alternative means to move containers. The system generates radiation using a 6-MeV linear accelerator for x-rays and a Rhodotron for 9-MeV electrons, with measures in place to reduce shielding needs. The Rhodotron generates 9-MeV electrons aimed downward to absorb x-rays by the Earth. Concerns arise about radiation escaping and AS&E's ability to provide assurances. Additional funding could allow for building a test cell with a Rhodotron and linear accelerator for data collection. This would improve system performance characterization and reduce risk. AS&E plans to build a system as part of the ATD for CAARS. AS&E plans to build a facility integrating backscatter and radiography technologies for the ATD for CAARS program. The facility could serve as a testbed for nuclear resonance fluorescence technology and research into resolving alarms from shielded nuclear material. The AS&E x-ray source at MIT's Bates Linear Accelerator Center provides a unique capability in the United States. After the CAARS program, options include keeping the source at Bates Center for researchers to use or returning it to AS&E. The AS&E x-ray source at MIT's Bates Linear Accelerator Center provides a unique capability in the United States for nuclear resonance fluorescence measurements at 9 MeV or experiments with prompt photofission. The decision to keep the source for a possible follow-on system depends on the performance of the AS&E CAARS system in upcoming tests. Detection of nuclear weapons or SNM in cargo containers or vehicles can be challenging, with radiography potentially missing small pieces of HEU. Beams of neutrons or high-energy x-rays hold potential for detecting SNM by inducing fission. Muon tomography (MT) is a potential method for detecting nuclear weapons or special nuclear materials (SNM) without the need for radiation sources, addressing concerns about radiation exposure. However, its feasibility in real-world scenarios and cost-effectiveness in detecting high-Z materials in vehicles and cargo at ports remain to be determined. Muon tomography is a method using heavy subatomic particles called muons, generated by cosmic rays, to detect high-Z materials like tungsten or lead in vehicles and cargo without disrupting commerce. Muons are highly energetic and penetrating, with the ability to pass through materials like lead or water. The degree of deflection of muons by matter is determined statistically by the density and Z of the material, allowing for differentiation between low-Z, low-density materials and high-Z, high-density materials. Tomography divides objects into parts, determines characteristics like density, and creates images. Muon tomography measures muon trajectories to detect high, medium, or low density materials. An algorithm integrates data to form a 3D image based on density and Z. Decision Sciences International Corporation (DSIC) is developing a Muon Tomography (MT) system to detect Special Nuclear Material (SNM) in vehicles and containers. The system uses drift tubes filled with gases to track muons, which have high penetrating power. The prototype works by analyzing the deflection of muons based on the density and Z of the materials inside the container. The Muon Tomography system developed by DSIC uses drift tubes filled with gases arranged in arrays to track muons. A positive charge applied to the wires draws free electrons created by muons at a known speed. The tubes measure the distance between the wire and a muon's closest approach, establishing points on the muon's trajectory. The system uses 3 points to define the trajectory. Originally planned in a \"tunnel\" configuration, the drift tubes are used to determine the object being examined. The Muon Tomography system developed by DSIC uses drift tubes arranged in arrays to track muons. Instead of the original plan for a \"top/bottom\" configuration, which would be less costly but require more scan time, multiple units can be used side by side to scan multiple lanes of traffic. This configuration allows for recording more muon tracks entering and exiting the object being examined, increasing total throughput. Units are only as wide as a lane of traffic, making it suitable for ports with limited space. The Muon Tomography system developed by DSIC uses drift tubes arranged in arrays to track muons efficiently. The system's electronics can uniquely identify a single muon 99.7% of the time, as muons travel at the speed of light and the electronics can process signals quickly. This technology is crucial for ports with limited space, as it allows for scanning multiple lanes of traffic without rearranging traffic lanes. The Muon Tomography system uses drift tubes to track muons, allowing for the identification of individual muons with high accuracy. By analyzing the deflection of muon tracks, the system can create a 3-D image of scanned objects based on scattering density and material thickness. The Muon Tomography system uses drift tubes to track muons, creating a 3-D image of scanned objects. The system can differentiate between high-Z and medium-Z material, detecting hidden HEU in cargo. Tests in early 2010 showed the system could clear most containers in less than 1 minute with 95% confidence. The DSIC scanner can detect gamma rays by differentiating their signal from muons when they strike drift tubes. Gamma rays ionize atoms in the gas inside the tubes, producing electrons that drift to the central wire for recording. The system claims to distinguish between electrons generated by gamma rays and muons using a muon-tracking algorithm. The DSIC scanner can compute a track for muon-generated electrons but not for gamma-generated electrons, as the latter do not pass through a drift tube. Gamma-ray count above background levels would be suspicious, but the scanner lacks spectroscopic capability to identify the source of gammas by their spectra. HEU that has been through a nuclear reactor picks up uranium-232, making it hard to shield. When scanning for HEU, the gamma signal from uranium-238 content can be shielded with lead to fall below detection threshold. Muon tomography can clear shielded packages 2.25 times faster than bare HEU due to increased object size. The gamma signal from uranium-238 content can be shielded with lead to fall below detection threshold. Muon tomography can clear shielded packages 2.25 times faster than bare HEU due to increased object size. This allows for quicker clearance of containers for large threat packages, reducing average scan times significantly. Throughput rates are improved, with only a minimal impact from longer scan times for cluttered scenes. Adjustments to scan procedures will be made based on scanning containers in actual commerce flow. DSIC's system can locate gamma-ray emitters in containers using drift tubes as detector elements. The DNDO argues that gamma-ray detection capability may not significantly reduce scan times in cargo containers, as shielded uranium-238 can easily go undetected by the muon tomography system. This challenges the claim that gamma-ray detection enhances the efficacy of muon tomography in identifying potential threats. DSIC anticipated in April 2010 that muon tomography (MT) could distinguish between different materials in under a minute, with improved electronics and computer modeling. An extended scan of a container with MT would be faster and less intrusive than unloading and reloading it, which could take hours. Muon tomography (MT) scanning can provide detailed images of threat objects, estimate yield, distinguish materials, and study radiation signatures to avoid triggering weapons. An algorithm can speed up detection by subtracting known parts of an image, focusing on suspicious objects. A library of MT images of vehicles can be used for scanning, reading license plates upon entry. The algorithm in the Muon tomography (MT) system reads license plates of trucks entering the system and subtracts the known image of the truck from the generated image, leaving only the cargo and any anomalies. DSIC has demonstrated the efficacy of this approach on several vehicles, but concerns remain about its ability to handle modifications to vehicles. DSIC is expanding its library of vehicle models for scanning, which is more valuable for passenger cars. Additionally, DSIC is working on improving its ability to detect Special Nuclear Material (SNM) with a prototype scanner. DSIC designed a prototype scanner to detect muons and gamma rays for SNM detection. Neutron detection capability was postponed but kept as an option using boron-10 coated drift tube walls. Muon tomography does not require radiation shielding and cannot harm people or contents. Neutrons in commerce are rare, so their presence would be suspicious. Muons can be used to detect high-Z material without generating radiation, making it safe for use at land border crossings. The detection algorithm automatically alarms for high-Z material, reducing the need for human interpretation. LANL built and tested a small MT prototype in 1995-1996 to detect high-Z materials. DSIC provided $7 million to LANL to develop a larger scanner, which was operated from October 2008 to mid-June 2009. The scanner was tested on vehicles with various materials and clutters before being moved to DSIC's headquarters in Poway, CA. DSIC modified the scanner to a top-bottom configuration large enough to scan SUVs, automobiles, and shipping containers. A Test Readiness Review was canceled in April 2009 due to algorithm issues, with plans to conduct it in late September or early October 2009. DNDO conducted a TRR in January 2010 to determine readiness for a Proof-of-Concept demonstration. After a Test Readiness Review in January 2010, DNDO's test team concluded that the DSIC MT system was not ready for a Proof-of-Concept demonstration. DSIC planned hardware and decision algorithm upgrades to address issues limiting functionality and performance. DNDO will conduct a second TRR after DSIC completes the upgrades and revisions to the TRR report. DNDO rejected DSIC's first draft TRR report in February 2010. The DSIC MT system's first test report was criticized for not addressing anomalies and instabilities in the image reconstruction and decision algorithm, lacking empirical data, and being inconsistent with observations by the test team. Concerns were raised about terrorists potentially countering the system. Terrorists could potentially counter the DSIC MT system by smuggling uranium in pieces below the detection threshold or by forming it into pellets mixed with a low-Z substance. However, fabricating HEU into a weapon-usable shape within the United States would introduce considerable difficulty. If terrorists were to obtain a state-made hollow-pit nuclear weapon, MT might not detect it if the SNM shell were thin enough. The Royal Society report highlighted the time constraints of muon radiography, with up to several hours needed to image a cubic foot of iron. DSIC has made advancements in signal extraction from muon scattering data, including using 3-D tomography for better imaging. Advancements in muon radiography include using 3-D images for better imaging and increasing scan time to 5-10 minutes to differentiate between materials. Feinstein noted the challenge of distinguishing high-Z nuclei from other materials in cargo containers. The minimal time to discriminate special nuclear material (SNM) from other materials in cargo containers using muon tomography has not been determined. It cannot detect highly diluted high-Z material or discriminate SNM from depleted uranium. Concerns were raised about its limited material identification abilities in 2008. Muon tomography (MT) has limited abilities and requires large detection equipment, making it impractical for many nonproliferation and national security applications. It also has long scan times and is considered impractical as a screening technique. Other more practical threat material identification tools are being developed by federal agencies. DSIC claimed in May 2010 that actual test data does not support concerns about MT's effectiveness. The MT system as of April 2010 will include gamma-ray detection and muon detection, with the option to add neutron detection. Questions arise regarding the value of gamma-ray detection in reducing scan time, as well as the prevalence of gamma rays in cargo containers. DSIC plans to conduct scans on containers in commerce to address these questions. DSIC plans to conduct scans on containers in commerce to address questions about reducing scan time with gamma-ray detection. They suggest a 26-second scan time, but cluttered scenes may pose challenges for containers with dense metal objects. DSIC worked with Los Alamos to use boron-10 compounds for neutron detection, offering a lower-cost alternative to helium-3. The effectiveness of boron-10 for neutron detection is questioned, prompting consideration of other gas combinations. DSIC planned rapid development for neutron detection, aiming for production after field-testing a third-generation prototype. Detection algorithms were being modified for operational use, with a third-party test validation and life expectancy analyses planned. The schedule was delayed due to various reasons, including relocating the detector. DSIC aimed to complete proof-of-concept demonstration for DNDO in November 2009 and begin construction of a commercial scanner in January 2010. DSIC aimed to begin construction of a commercial scanner in January 2010, with field testing planned for 2011 and commercial availability in 2012. The schedule remained on track as of April 2010, with design and component testing underway to improve system deployability and manufacturability. Concerns were raised about developing a commercialization schedule before completing successful demonstrations and operational issues related to clearing alarms. MT is expected to differentiate between high-Z material faster than various types of high-Z material like tungsten vs. uranium. However, SNAR technologies are more reliable in discriminating uranium from tungsten. If MT can differentiate between SNM and other high-Z material as developers anticipate, an extended-time secondary scan would be faster and less costly than unpacking a container. The experiments on MT using medium-scale laboratory equipment suggest that if MT cannot differentiate between SNM and other high-Z material as expected, more intrusive measures may be necessary. However, the false positive rate for alarms would be minimal, as there are few lead or tungsten ingots in commerce. Detecting SNM hidden in cargo remains the primary concern, rather than clearing ingots of tungsten or lead shipped in containers. The false alarm rate for detecting small amounts of SNM hidden in cargo depends on the threshold set by DSIC. Smaller voxels and lower thresholds may be needed to reduce false negatives, but this could increase the false positive rate. DSIC aims to use MT with a low-energy x-ray source for radiography in primary inspection and to clear questionable containers in secondary inspection. However, CBP agents may require more than 26 seconds to visually examine radiographs for contraband in primary inspection. DSIC is considering a low-energy x-ray system for radiography in primary inspection and to clear questionable containers in secondary inspection. They have designed a top/bottom scanner the width of existing truck lanes at ports to address concerns about port accommodation. Additional funds would enable DSIC to improve detectors, detection algorithms, and incorporate sensors for more detailed imaging and threat detection. DSIC is working on integrating gamma ray, neutron, and muon signals, developing a CONOPS for system use, and enhancing engineering and manufacturing for the production version. They are also developing a library of MT images for different vehicle types and collaborating with a research group on advanced imaging techniques. MT may serve as a secondary inspection system for x-ray inspection, particularly for containers at seaports. MT may serve as a secondary inspection system for x-ray inspection of containers at seaports, reducing scan time requirements while still maintaining effectiveness. The Coast Guard is exploring the use of muon detection systems for small boats entering ports, particularly in Miami, to detect potential nuclear threats. Muon tomography (MT) can be used for detecting radiological materials like cobalt-60 and cesium-137, which are not high Z materials. However, dense shielding like lead would be needed to block gamma rays due to their intense radioactivity. This application of MT could be useful for detecting radiological dispersal devices. Engineering a water-based muon detection system would be more challenging than a land-based system. Nuclear resonance fluorescence (NRF) is being considered as a method to detect special nuclear materials (SNM) in containers, which could be useful for identifying nuclear weapons. Detailed information about a weapon's design, such as the presence of a thermonuclear stage, can be obtained through techniques like radiography, neutron interrogation, and high-energy gamma ray interrogation. NRF may provide additional data that could be valuable in identifying SNM and gathering forensic evidence. NRF may provide valuable data for identifying special nuclear materials in weapons, aiding in dismantlement or tracing the source. By illuminating atoms with photons above a unique energy threshold, electrons move to an excited state and emit slightly less energetic photons when returning to normal state. This emission of light can help determine the materials present in a weapon. Fluorescence occurs when atoms emit visible light after being struck by photons. Nuclear resonance fluorescence (NRF) is a process where atoms absorb photons at specific energy levels and emit slightly less energetic photons, producing a unique gamma-ray spectrum for each isotope. This spectrum can be used to identify the element present. Nuclear resonance fluorescence (NRF) is a process where atoms absorb photons at specific energy levels and emit slightly less energetic photons, producing a unique gamma-ray spectrum for each isotope. This spectrum can be used to identify the element and isotope, including fissile U-235 and non-fissile U-238. NRF can identify a wide range of materials, not just radioactive isotopes, and can even provide information on the origin of shielded materials like lead. This technology allows for the identification of weapon materials without opening the weapon, making it valuable for customs and border protection. Nuclear resonance fluorescence (NRF) is a process where atoms absorb photons at specific energy levels and emit slightly less energetic photons, creating a unique gamma-ray spectrum for each isotope. This spectrum can identify the element and isotope, including U-235. NRF technology can detect a wide range of materials, not just radioactive isotopes, and can provide information on shielded materials like lead. NRF is valuable for customs and border protection to identify weapon materials without opening them. X-rays are used to generate NRF, with a photon detector recording the radiation spectrum to match NRF peaks against a library. Nuclear resonance fluorescence (NRF) technology uses photons to identify isotopes by matching NRF peaks against a library. Photons from NRF are distinguished by their narrow peaks, emitted in all directions, while the photon beam travels forward. A photon detector placed to the side detects NRF photons traveling backward. DNDO is exploring a method using monoenergetic photons, but it is currently challenging and costly for deployment. According to DNDO, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center has demonstrated accelerator technology that could lead to a compact mono-energy photon source. Passport Systems, Inc. is developing the Passport MAX NRF imaging system to detect SNM in cargo containers using a commercial electron accelerator. The system produces a photon beam with energies ranging from several hundred keV to the maximum energy of the electron beam by exciting nuclei in its path that emit photons. A germanium gamma-ray detector constructs a spectrum by viewing emitted photons scattered backwards from one region at a time. The detector's view creates a voxel, showing the type and quantity of each isotope. An algorithm constructs a 3D image of the container's contents. Passport MAX includes other detector subsystems like EZ-3D, a radiography imager, and an NRF detector for detecting notches in the photon spectrum. This approach can be used to scan smaller items like aircraft cargo containers or terrorist nuclear weapons. The NRF imaging component examines one region at a time, with other components locating volumes of interest for interrogation. The NRF system can quickly scan cargo containers for special nuclear material (SNM) and high-Z shielding. It can identify isotopes without operator input, eliminating false alarms from radiation portal monitors. The system is designed to detect terrorist nuclear weapons or SNM efficiently. The NRF-based system can scan cargo containers quickly for SNM and high-Z shielding material. The system adjusts scanning speed based on beam attenuation and regions of interest, potentially impacting throughput rate. Passport Systems predicts that Passport MAX can meet DNDO's scanning requirements with a 90% probability of detecting 100 cc of high-Z material and a false alarm probability less than 3%. The NRF-based system can identify the composition of a nuclear weapon and isotopic composition of uranium or plutonium for nuclear forensics. Radiation detection may be hindered by shielding in containers, but this system can overcome this issue when used against identified terrorist nuclear weapons. A bremsstrahlung source can generate a wide range of photons, allowing for the identification of multiple materials. The NRF PoC system, funded by DHS, demonstrated the ability to automatically select high-Z regions of interest and identify isotopic content using a wide range of emitted photons. The system successfully integrated critical components to operate as specified in an operational scanner. Passport Systems' NRF system successfully demonstrated the ability to detect high-Z material and contraband in various cargo types. The system's major hardware components are commercially available, and it is estimated to be commercially available by mid-2010 at a cost of $5 million to $10 million. However, it may not have completed DHS phased milestones by that time. DNDO is working on enabling technologies to reduce the size and cost of the NRF system while improving its performance. Passport Systems' NRF system, awarded a contract by DNDO in September 2008, aims to improve performance and speed by more than a factor of two. The system is part of DNDO's Shielded Nuclear Alarm Resolution program and is intended for use on cargo containers. Collaboration between organizations like LLNL, PNNL, and Passport Systems has been ongoing since 2004 to address national and homeland security issues. Collaboration between LLNL, PNNL, and Passport Systems aims to characterize NRF response of U-235 and Pu-239. Various institutions are conducting basic research on NRF, with experiments to identify energy levels of materials being a key scientific task. Passport Systems built a prototype at UC Santa Barbara for NRF measurements on U-238 and Pb-208 using the High Intensity Gamma Source at Duke. The scientific task involves conducting experiments to identify energy levels for materials undergoing NRF. This includes measuring NRF spectra of isotopes of uranium and plutonium, developing algorithms for quick material identification based on NRF energies, and utilizing the Passport MAX geometry to improve signal-to-noise ratio. The focus is on photons scattered backwards as a result of NRF to avoid interference from forward-traveling beam photons with a much higher energy range. The limitations of detecting microgram quantities of isotopes using NRF have not been quantified, potentially restricting its use in nuclear forensics. Further development of detection algorithms is necessary. The Rhodotron accelerator, essential for this system, is custom-built and may take up to a year to manufacture, posing procurement challenges. Passport Systems is building a prototype of a high duty cycle accelerator that could be produced more rapidly, making the Passport MAX unit smaller and more attractive for mobile operations. Integration of hardware and software into an operational system for Passport MAX may be complicated due to the many separate detector units it uses. A demonstration of the full-scale ATD scanner under the Shielded Nuclear Alarm Resolution program is scheduled for 2010-2011. The ATD scanner under the Shielded Nuclear Alarm Resolution program is scheduled for 2010-2011 with a projected unit cost of $5 million to $10 million. Progress has been made from early-stage development to Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) as of March 2010, reducing the risk to schedule. DNDO continues to fund enabling technologies for the project. Passport Systems aims to develop a low-cost, high-resolution detector and accelerator system to enhance NRF performance speed. The MAX ATD scanner demonstration in 2010 could lead to a commercial system by 2011, capable of scanning large objects like tractor-trailer trucks. The system, enclosed for radiation safety, would be 90 to 100 ft long, 20 to 30 ft wide, and several stories high to accommodate scanning a 40 ft long container. Passport Systems is developing a large system for scanning containers, aiming to reduce radiation dose outside the system. The company lacks key equipment and uses an accelerator at the University of California for its prototype. Additional funds would allow Passport to purchase necessary equipment, advance technologies, and hire more staff. The prototype MAX scanner uses expensive off-the-shelf hardware, but with more funds, Passport could design more cost-effective components. Passport Systems aims to design less costly components for its container scanning system with added funds. The Nuclear Resonance Fluorescence (NRF) technology could help identify illicit cargo, verify cargo container manifests, and be used in nuclear forensics and nonproliferation applications. Improved detector materials could enhance sensitivity and resolution, reducing energy and shielding requirements, and overall costs. The system's capability to detect special nuclear materials (SNM) at a range of several meters could potentially be extended to a kilometer or more, even in restricted territories. Passport Systems aims to design less costly components for its container scanning system with added funds. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is pursuing capabilities to increase the distance at which special nuclear materials (SNM) can be detected, including in restricted territories. The system's capability to detect SNM at a range of several meters could potentially be extended to a kilometer or more, aiding in the fight against nuclear terrorism and protecting military forces. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), a unit of the Department of Defense (DOD), is working on increasing the detection range of special nuclear materials (SNM) to 1 km or more. This is motivated by the need to search for nuclear material in hostile environments over large areas, where pinpointing the exact location is challenging. DTRA is also focused on ensuring that the equipment deployed is robust enough to survive harsh environments. Radiation attenuation due to shielding is a significant factor, with even moderate amounts of shielding affecting radiation emissions from gamma ray and neutron sources. DTRA is researching ways to increase the detection range of special nuclear materials (SNM) by stimulating radiation emitted by SNM to levels above background using high energy photons. They are investigating the use of protons for active detection and sponsoring remote-detection systems like the Photonuclear Inspection and Threat Assessment System (PITAS). In 2008, the Photonuclear Inspection and Threat Assessment System (PITAS) was DTRA's remote-detection system closest to deployment. In April 2010, DTRA initiated the Integrated Standoff Inspection System (ISIS) project to detect special nuclear material from a distance. Raytheon was awarded a $20.5 million contract for R&D on ISIS. Minimum requirements for ISIS include distance thresholds and detection time limits. The Integrated Standoff Inspection System (ISIS) project aims to detect special nuclear material from a distance, with specific requirements such as a detection range of over 50 m and a detection time of less than 10 min. The system is designed to be transportable by commercial aircraft and capable of being transported by one helicopter. The timeline for ISIS demonstration was set for FY2012, with limited information available due to the recent award of the R&D contract in April 2010. The system builds on the work of the Photonuclear Inspection and Threat Assessment System (PITAS), utilizing a powerful linear accelerator to generate x-rays for target detection. The x-ray beam from an accelerator can be used to detect special nuclear material by placing detectors near the target to pick up SNM signatures like delayed neutrons and gamma rays. To improve detection effectiveness, detectors should be separated from the accelerator and placed closer to the target, as radiation intensity diminishes with distance and the atmosphere absorbs many neutrons and gamma rays. This method, similar to the ISIS project, could enable the United States to detect SNM. A follow-on system like ISIS could enable the United States to detect special nuclear material (SNM) at standoff range for the first time, aiding in counterproliferation, counterterrorism, and force protection efforts. PITAS will remain available as an experimental tool to address issues with accelerator-based technologies, with plans to improve diagnostic equipment in 2010. Funding levels for PITAS experiments are not publicly disclosed. Detection of SNM at a distance, such as in a moving cargo container, presents challenges even with a collimated x-ray beam. The effectiveness of shielding against inbound x-rays, protons, neutrons, and gamma rays from fission is a concern. The spread of gamma rays and neutrons from fission of special nuclear material (SNM) presents challenges in detection at a distance. Limited research has been done on remote detection capabilities. Limited research has been done on remote detection capabilities, posing challenges for developers of PITAS. Field tests are needed to determine signals generated by the beam in SNM and develop algorithms for data processing. DTRA continues to investigate technologies for threat detection, including radiation sources and detectors. One potential neutron detector for PITAS is helium-3 drift tubes, but questions remain about their ruggedness for mobile deployment in harsh conditions. The system must be compact yet sensitive for effective operation. DTRA is considering alternative materials like boron-10 and lithium-6 for neutron detection due to the high demand for helium-3. The accelerator proposed for PITAS could pose radiation risks to operators, with the level of exposure depending on factors like radiation output, frequency of use, and shielding. The urgency of the mission would also play a role in determining the acceptability of the risk. DTRA is interested in reducing the size of particle accelerator technology for ease of deployment and is exploring the use of ionizing radiation for standoff detection of SNM. They are considering a remote-detection system using a proton beam with high energies to defeat shielding at 1 km. Additional funds could shorten the schedule for this project by several years. DTRA is investigating the use of high energy proton beams for active interrogation to defeat shielding at 1 km. Funding could accelerate the project to explore multiple paths simultaneously. This technology could support the Proliferation Support Initiative to prevent the shipment of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Improved scintillator materials are being considered for detection purposes. Improved scintillator materials are being developed to detect radiation in systems like SNM, requiring rugged, cost-effective materials with good resolution. Previous equipment had limitations in detecting isotopes and shielding SNM. Resolving alarms was time-consuming, but advancements are being made to improve detection capabilities. Improved scintillator materials are being developed to detect radiation in systems like SNM, requiring rugged, cost-effective materials with good resolution. Existing systems can be enhanced by using different detector material, computers, algorithms, or CONOPS. New systems aim to reduce false positives and false negatives by utilizing fission, dual-energy radiography, and EZ-3D technologies. These approaches have drawbacks like low signal strength, complexity, high cost, or large size, which need to be minimized in a fielded system. Other technologies, such as improved detector material, are also being explored. In March 2008, the Royal Society reported on nuclear detection technologies, highlighting the potential for advancements in muon detection systems in the medium term and nanotechnology in the long term. The commercial availability of a muon tomography system was initially projected for 2011 but faced delays, with a target date of 2012. Progress on nanocomposite scintillator technology was also being monitored for potential future use. In 2008, nanocomposite scintillator technology was expected to be ready for industry transfer by September 2009, but the project was canceled in January 2010. Evaluating R&D project prospects is challenging, as success requires overcoming scientific and engineering hurdles. The prototype must be rugged enough to withstand various environmental conditions and must have a workable concept of operations to be effective. The system must also be affordable and meet performance criteria to be useful. Examples include nanocomposite scintillators for gamma-ray detection. The AS&E CAARS project and SAIC's CAARS project aimed to develop sensitive detection material, but faced technical challenges. SAIC's subcontractor, Accuray, successfully developed an \"interleaved\" accelerator, enhancing the system's ability to differentiate among up to 15 bands of Z. This advancement could aid CBP agents in searching for contraband and SNM more effectively. DTRA suggests increasing funding for proton beam technology in early R&D to expedite deployment. Accelerating production may incur high costs and risks, while R&D allows for more tolerable failures with lower investments. Investing in R&D can prevent future issues, like using GADRAS algorithm on standard Windows OS for detecting SNM. According to Dean Mitchell, updating the GADRAS algorithm to run on current-generation OSs would cost around $1 million a year for two years. This update is necessary as Microsoft may introduce a new OS that no longer supports applications written with the Visual Basic 6.0 compiler. This could make GADRAS unavailable to its users until it is updated, impacting detection capability for many detector systems. Improving detector systems involves enhancing accelerator, gamma-ray detector material, computers, and algorithms to boost performance. Upgrading systems by substituting higher-performance detector material may face challenges like redesigning detector modules and addressing poor optical design in existing portal monitors. Upgrading detector systems may require replacing monitors with poor optical design, readout electronics, data analysis algorithms, data transmission systems, and power systems to match new detector modules. The next generation of detector systems should be more modular to allow for upgrades while retaining value. Improved detector material and algorithms could reduce radiation needed for scanning containers. Work is underway on systems using fission to detect SNM, potentially competing with existing technologies like CAARS. DNDO is exploring adding technology to CAARS for detecting SNM, potentially leading to competition with other systems. Competition in R&D is seen as beneficial to drive towards the most effective solutions. Multiple organizations pursuing the same R&D goals allow for different approaches to compete for objectives, as seen in examples like decoding the human genome and commercial space flight. Competition in basic research is encouraged to drive towards effective solutions. Examples like the human genome decoding and commercial space flight show the benefits of competition. Various systems in R&D, such as SAIC CAARS and Rapiscan Eagle, have overcome technical hurdles or faced termination. Decision Sciences Corporation addressed issues with its muon tomography scanner by using boron-10 instead of helium-3 in drift tubes. The importance of \"Concept of operations\" (CONOPS) in the effectiveness of detection systems is highlighted. Current equipment for detecting special nuclear material (SNM) relies on opacity and gamma-ray emissions signatures, but SNM has additional signatures. Innovations like using boron-10 instead of helium-3 in drift tubes and designing scanners for ports are crucial for improving detection capabilities. Future detection systems are being developed to utilize additional signatures beyond opacity and gamma-ray emissions, complicating terrorist attempts to smuggle nuclear weapons or SNM into the United States. These systems may be more costly and complex but offer added benefits. While detection systems have limitations, they can work effectively at \"points\" where people or cargo legally enter the country. Future detection systems are being developed to utilize additional signatures beyond opacity and gamma-ray emissions, complicating terrorist attempts to smuggle nuclear weapons or SNM into the United States. These systems may be more costly and complex but offer added benefits. Congress has supported a broad portfolio of detection R&D projects that has created a pipeline with technologies expected to become available for operational systems from near-term to long-term. Standoff radiation detection systems mounted along borders at natural choke points or smuggling routes might be of value for this mission. Future detection systems are being developed to utilize additional signatures beyond opacity and gamma-ray emissions, offering Congress improved detection capability and a broader menu of choices. Technical factors such as project advancement rates, benefits from related technologies, and cost variations from projections may influence technology choices. Congress may need to reevaluate deployment decisions if significantly more capable systems become available. However, choosing among competing technologies is challenging, as each has its own considerations. Congress faces challenges in choosing among competing technologies for future detection systems. Evaluating factors like cost, scan time, reliability, and radiation exposure is difficult due to limited data availability. Developers advocate for their technology, making it hard to obtain unbiased information. Weighting data elements to support a technology choice is complex, with the need to assign weights and make decisions despite data weaknesses. Congress focuses on preventing terrorists from smuggling nuclear weapons into the United States. The focus is on preventing terrorists from smuggling nuclear weapons into the United States, with an emphasis on scanning cargo containers at seaports using nonintrusive imaging and radiation detection equipment. This technology can also be adapted for monitoring air cargo containers and passenger cars. Developing and deploying detection equipment at seaports ensures ruggedness and ease of use. The focus is on preventing terrorists from smuggling nuclear weapons into the United States by deploying detection equipment at seaports. Congress has allocated billions of dollars for this purpose, supporting R&D on advanced technologies. Rapid deployment of passive radiation detectors in maritime cargo containers has provided some capability quickly, deterring terrorists and complicating smuggling plans. The initial deployments of detection equipment at seaports provide valuable data for refining system requirements and operational concepts. This R&D pipeline aims to enhance technologies and systems, improving overall effectiveness in detecting and deterring smuggling of nuclear weapons. Future technologies may fill gaps in the current architecture, such as remote detection for monitoring potential choke points. Congress may need to address gaps and synergisms in the technology portfolio, like the use of helium-3 in several systems. The technology portfolio aims to address gaps and synergisms, such as limited helium-3 supply for neutron detection systems. Other gaps include long-range SNM detection sensors, autonomous sensors for remote areas, and affordable detectors. Synergisms involve developing sensitive materials for gamma rays and neutrons that can be used in various systems. Improved sensitivity in detector materials can lead to cost reduction, simpler algorithms, and faster scan times. Collaboration in developing alternative neutron detectors can expedite deployment and lower costs for companies. Progress in sensitive detector material development can benefit companies in improving their systems faster and at a lower cost. Progress in developing more sensitive detector material can benefit companies by allowing them to improve their systems faster and at a lower cost. Collaboration and sharing of development efforts could help avoid duplication of work, especially for government-funded projects. Congress could direct executive agencies to conduct specified tests overseen by independent experts to ensure proper testing procedures for competing systems like the Advanced Spectroscopic Portal. Congress has access to technical expertise through various groups like the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Academy of Sciences. They could consult with these experts to ensure proper testing procedures for systems like the Advanced Spectroscopic Portal. Congress could also consider alternatives such as establishing an independent test and evaluation unit within DHS or requiring detailed reporting from DNDO. This would enhance confidence in test results and decisions based on them. Increasing the risk of detection for terrorists would have a greater deterrent effect compared to drug smugglers, as terrorists value nuclear weapons greatly. Advanced detection technologies make it harder for terrorists to evade new systems, creating uncertainties that deter them. Upgrading fielded equipment and improving detection capabilities add layers of deterrence. Detection may impact terrorists differently due to the high value of nuclear weapons to them. The multiplication of technical obstacles in deterring terrorist attacks is compared to the Cold War nuclear arms race. Some U.S. detection systems are more capable than current detectors, but terrorists could still evade them using various techniques. This could complicate their plot and increase the risk of detection by non-technical means. The threat of nuclear weapons being brought into the United States may increase in various ways. The United States faces an increasing threat of nuclear weapons being brought into the country, leading to the need for ongoing research and development in nuclear detection technology. Congress has funded R&D efforts with short- and longer-term goals, recognizing the dynamic nature of the competition between detection and evasion. The U.S. has a technical advantage in detection capabilities, but detectors must be able to detect small, complete weapons. During the Cold War, the U.S. developed nuclear artillery shells and atomic demolition munitions. The United States developed smaller atomic demolition munitions and there have been reports of Soviet-era \"suitcase bombs.\" Terrorists would likely create less sophisticated and larger weapons without state assistance. Detecting uranium used in nuclear weapons is harder than plutonium due to lower radiation emissions. Small quantities of uranium or plutonium are enough to fuel a bomb, with 26 kg of uranium or 5 kg of plutonium needed. Detection technology is crucial to interdict stolen or smuggled materials. The ability to detect small masses is crucial for thwarting nuclear smuggling. Nuclear detection relies on photons, which are energy packets with no mass or charge. Energy levels used in detection range from thousands to millions of electron volts. The electromagnetic spectrum includes radio waves, visible light, x-rays, and gamma rays. An x-ray photon and a. Gamma rays originate in an atom's nucleus, emitted by radioactive isotopes in unique spectra. These spectra, like those of uranium-235 and plutonium-239, are the only way to identify an isotope outside a well-equipped laboratory. Detection systems that use x-ray beams, generated through the bremsstrahlung process, are more penetrating than gamma rays. X-rays do not exhibit spectral peaks like gamma rays, making this difference important for detection of radioactive isotopes. Atoms decay by emitting radiation such as alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. Alpha particles are easily stopped, beta particles are lighter but still charged, and gamma rays can penetrate more material. When an atom emits an alpha or beta particle, it transforms into a different element. Gamma-ray emission typically follows alpha or beta decay. Each radioactive isotope emits gamma rays in a unique energy spectrum. Some heavy elements fission, with U-238 being the only naturally occurring isotope that does so spontaneously. Fission produces neutrons and gamma rays, with U-235 and Pu-239 being examples of isotopes that fission when struck by neutrons or high-energy photons. Fissile materials like U-235 and Pu-239 can undergo fission with neutrons of any energy, supporting a nuclear chain reaction. These materials are crucial for nuclear weapons and are designated as \"special nuclear material.\" Plutonium, produced from uranium fuel rods in reactors, is separated using chemical processes. Weapons-grade plutonium is at least 93% Pu-239, while natural uranium consists mainly of U-238 and a small amount of U-235. Enriching uranium in U-235 is necessary for nuclear reactor fuel or weapons. Enriching uranium in the isotope 235 for nuclear reactor fuel or weapons involves using centrifuges to separate U-235 from U-238 based on weight differences. Highly enriched uranium (HEU) is uranium enriched to 20% or more in U-235, with weapons-grade uranium typically enriched to 90%. HEU can also be produced from material in a nuclear reactor, containing trace amounts of U-232, which is easier to detect than U-235. Nuclear detection involves using neutrons and high-energy photons to detect radioactive material passively or actively. Neutrons and photons can penetrate materials and be used to probe containers for dense material. Fission induced by neutrons or photons above 6 MeV in Special Nuclear Material (SNM) emits detectable neutrons and gamma rays. Gamma rays can also identify radioactive sources, while neutrons do not have a characteristic energy spectrum for isotope identification. The rate of decay, indicated by the half-life of radioactive isotopes like cobalt-60, plutonium-239, and uranium-235, is crucial for detection. Different materials attenuate neutrons and gamma rays in various ways, with heavy materials like lead, tungsten, uranium, and plutonium being effective at this. The type, energy level, and quantity of radiation emitted are key factors for detection. High-Z materials like lead, tungsten, uranium, and plutonium efficiently attenuate gamma rays, while light atoms like hydrogen are most effective at stopping neutrons. Hydrogen-containing materials such as water, wood, plastic, or food are particularly efficient at stopping neutrons. Low-Z materials are less effective at stopping neutrons but still more effective than high-Z materials. Gamma rays are less attenuated by low-Z materials, and neutrons are less attenuated by high-Z materials. Different amounts of material are needed to attenuate gamma rays depending on their energy level. Gamma rays from WGPu are difficult to shield compared to HEU due to their energy level. An inch of lead can render gamma rays from U-235 undetectable, but self-shielding affects the detection of low-energy gamma rays from HEU. Demonstrations at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2006 showed how shielding and self-shielding impact gamma ray detection. The detector at Los Alamos National Laboratory demonstrated how gamma-ray detection is affected by shielding and self-shielding. Different materials, such as HEU foil and marble, showed varying levels of self-shielding. Background radiation from natural sources can complicate the detection of special nuclear materials. Radioactive material like thorium, uranium, and radon is found everywhere in trace amounts. Some commercial goods contain radioactive material, such as ceramics, kitty litter, and gas mantles. Radioactive isotopes are used in medicine and industry. Terrorist groups could potentially hide radioactive material in shipments to mask gamma-ray signatures. Signatures are properties used to detect substances like special nuclear materials (SNM). Various signatures can detect nuclear weapons or fissile material. The density and atomic number of materials like uranium and plutonium can be used to detect nuclear weapons or fissile material. Uranium is the densest and highest-Z element found in nature, while plutonium has a slightly higher Z. These properties are key in identifying such materials. Plutonium, with a Z of 94, has density variations compared to uranium. Detection methods utilize Z and density, with opacity to photon beams dependent on these factors. X-rays and gamma rays can penetrate matter differently based on Z and density, aiding in object detection. Elevated gamma radiation levels may not always indicate the presence of special nuclear material. Neutrons above cosmic ray background from a cargo container would be suspicious, as most materials do not emit neutrons spontaneously. Plutonium emits 60,000 neutrons per second, while HEU emits 3 neutrons per second. Each isotope has a unique gamma ray spectrum, which is the only way to identify a particular isotope outside a well-equipped laboratory. Detector names with \"spectrum\" or \"identify\" can help in this identification process. HEU, identified by gamma-ray spectra, contains U-238 emitting gamma rays at 1.001 MeV. It also contains uranium-232, decaying to thallium-208 with a gamma ray of 2.614 MeV. These gamma rays are hard to detect due to low emission rates and interference from naturally occurring uranium. Thallium-208 has a gamma ray of 2.614 MeV, one of the highest-energy gamma rays from radioactive decay, requiring 2.041 cm of lead for attenuation. It is a decay product of thorium-232 and decays rapidly, producing many gamma rays. WGPu, a mix of plutonium isotopes, has unique gamma ray signatures. SNM can fission when struck by neutrons or high-energy gamma rays, with one fission causing a chain reaction in a large mass. Neutrons released by fission cause chain reactions in SNM, which also fissions spontaneously. Fission products indicate SNM presence, with prompt neutrons and gamma rays emitted. U-235 and Pu-239 release prompt neutrons and gamma rays when fissioning. When struck by low-energy neutrons, only special nuclear materials (SNM) will fission, emitting a burst of neutrons and gamma rays. High-energy gamma rays can also cause SNM to fission, but may also induce fission in other materials like natural uranium. Fission of U-235 or Pu-239 atoms results in various fission fragments that decay into isotopes of different elements. Fission is a statistical process with multiple possible outcomes for each isotope. Fission of special nuclear materials (SNM) results in a complex mixture of isotopes of different elements with varying half-lives. These isotopes emit gamma rays, which penetrate low-Z cargo more easily than neutrons. Higher-Z cargo attenuates gamma rays more than neutrons. Some gamma rays have energies exceeding thallium-208, making them distinct characteristics of fission. The high-energy gamma radiation produced by fission is a strong indicator of special nuclear materials (SNM). Neutron and gamma-ray flux intensity, along with prompt response to a probe, are distinctive signatures of SNM presence. Additionally, a neutron beam can make certain elements radioactive, such as transforming stable oxygen-16 into radioactive nitrogen-16. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory conducted experiments bombarding natural uranium with high-energy neutrons. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory conducted experiments bombarding natural uranium with a neutron beam inside a cargo container. They observed that the gamma ray spectrum showed signals from nitrogen-16 decay initially, followed by radioactive fission products with an average half-life of 55 seconds. This time difference serves as an indicator of special nuclear materials (SNM). Interrogating SNM with neutrons or high-energy photons can induce fission, producing a unique signature that distinguishes SNM from other materials. Even a subcritical mass of SNM can sustain a chain reaction briefly, unlike non-SNM materials. A subcritical mass of special nuclear materials (SNM) can briefly sustain a chain reaction after the neutron beam is turned off, producing a delayed neutron time signature specific to U-235 and Pu-239. The intensity and duration of the neutron flux depend on the amount of SNM and cargo loading. However, hydrogenous materials in cargo can attenuate the prompt fission signal, leading to some scans taking up to two minutes or being infeasible. Chain reactions in special nuclear materials (SNM) are triggered by a neutron from spontaneous fission or background neutron, lasting several to dozens of generations. This produces a unique burst of neutrons and gamma rays over a short period, distinguishing it from random background radiation. Detection of this signature is a strong indicator of SNM presence. Unlike other detection methods, this signature can be detected passively. Detection of special nuclear materials (SNM) involves detecting unique bursts of neutrons and gamma rays, which can be done passively. This requires advanced detector technology and algorithms to convert data into usable information for effective nuclear detection. Algorithms are essential for nuclear detection, processing data quickly for operators. They convert detector hardware data into understandable formats like gamma ray spectra or material identification. Improvements in algorithms are as crucial as hardware upgrades for detector capability. Algorithms can be enhanced through better physics understanding or improved computer processing power. CONOPS involves specifying how detection units operate to gather data effectively. The curr_chunk discusses the operational aspects of a detection unit, including scanning rates, proximity to containers, screening procedures, alarm resolution, and data management. It emphasizes the importance of CONOPS in nuclear detection, detailing how data is used and shared among CBP agents and officials for analysis and action. The curr_chunk explains the importance of detectors in nuclear detection, highlighting the different levels of gamma ray detectors and their capabilities in identifying isotopes and special nuclear materials. Detector systems can also produce images showing the origin of gamma rays, requiring a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for detection. Gamma-ray detectors require a signal-to-noise ratio to extract the true signal from noise, such as background radioactive material. Two key concepts are detection efficiency and spectral resolution. Detection efficiency involves the amount of signal recorded and can be improved by moving the detector closer to the source or increasing its size. The efficiency of a detector can be increased by reducing the cost of the active material and improving the fraction of radiation absorbed. Spectral resolution is important for presenting energy peaks in a radiation spectrum accurately. A more efficient detector can collect information faster and reduce screening time for cargo containers. In practice, detectors like polyvinyl toluene have poor resolution with wide bell curves for gamma-ray energy levels, making it difficult to identify isotopes. High-purity germanium detectors, on the other hand, produce sharp peaks allowing for clear identification of specific isotopes. High-purity germanium detectors have sharp peaks for clear identification of isotopes, but are expensive and require cooling. Field-use HPGe detectors are being developed. Cadmium-zinc-telluride detectors can improve sensitivity, as shown in gamma-ray spectra for cesium-137. The sensitivity of CZT crystals has improved over time due to better crystal quality and larger crystal sizes. This allows for more efficient photon capture and more accurate determination of photon-induced electrical charge. University of Michigan researchers have developed three-dimensional arrays of CZT crystals to accurately determine the 3-D coordinates of gamma ray photons, improving the identification and location of gamma-ray sources. Advances in detector electronics, such as noise reduction in circuits, have significantly enhanced the measurement of gamma-ray energy. For example, a circuit developed in 2007 by Brookhaven National Laboratory has greatly improved energy resolution. Advances in detector electronics have improved signal reconstruction from gamma rays, allowing for more accurate measurement of gamma ray energy. Integration time, or the time available for a detector to scan an object, plays a crucial role in detecting special nuclear materials (SNM). Longer integration time results in better data collection, enabling detectors to detect more photons, muons, and neutrons, which helps in distinguishing SNM from background materials. Increasing integration time improves data quality, aiding in better signal separation and detection of shielded threat material. However, longer integration time can hinder commerce flow, necessitating a balance between accuracy and operational efficiency in detection systems. Increasing spatial resolution of detectors can improve SNM detection by controlling the field-of-view and reducing background radiation levels. Gamma rays can be converted into electrical energy using scintillator materials like PVT or sodium iodide. When a photon, like a gamma ray, interacts with a scintillator, it emits lower-energy photons. These optical photons are converted to electrons by a photomultiplier tube, which then generates an electrical pulse proportional to the energy deposited by the gamma ray. A multi-channel analyzer categorizes the pulse by energy, creating a gamma ray spectrum. In contrast, semiconductor materials like HPGe directly convert gamma rays into an electrical signal. When a gamma ray strikes semiconductor material, it generates an electrical signal proportional to the energy deposited. The voltage applied across the material sweeps electrons to create a current, with each pulse sorted by energy level to compute a spectrum. Detecting gamma-ray signatures requires precise time recording, especially for prompt gamma rays emitted quickly. The ability to record precise time of arrival is less important for delayed gamma rays. Detecting fission chain time signature requires a high-efficiency detector. High efficiency is crucial for detecting prompt emissions from fission. High-resolution detectors are needed for nuclear resonance fluorescence analysis. Neutrons interact with atomic nuclei, detected using helium-3 gas tubes connected to a power supply. When a neutron is absorbed, it produces energetic particles that knock electrons off other atoms, creating charged ions that move to plates, generating electric current. Neutrons generate a tiny electric current when absorbed by atomic nuclei, producing charged particles that are measured and counted. Neutron energy spectra do not have discrete energies like gamma rays, making them less useful for identifying isotopes. Total neutron count is crucial for identifying special nuclear material (SNM), as only SNM emits neutrons in significant numbers. Other methods rely on the time pattern of neutron arrival for SNM detection. DOE faces a shortage of He-3 for neutron detection systems due to declining warhead numbers and tritium production. Plans to supply 10,000 liters/year at $72 per liter fall short of demand. CBP would need 2500 detector units for border monitoring. Alternative neutron detection systems are possible, including tubes coated with boron-10 or lithium-6, tubes filled with boron-10 trifluoride, nanocomposite scintillators, and \"neutron straws.\" Substituting these technologies for He-3 would require re-engineering the system's neutron detectors, conducting tests, and potentially affecting system performance. Photons of high energy can penetrate solid objects, with denser material absorbing lower energy photons. Cargo scanning uses a fan-shaped beam to create an opacity map of container contents. Increasing photon energy improves penetration for radiography to detect dense objects like nuclear weapons. Radiography can detect large dense objects like nuclear weapons but has limitations. It does not detect radiation or specifically SNM, and small pieces of SNM may be harder to detect. Understanding detection system weaknesses is important, as enemies could use various means to evade technologies. Detailed discussions on evasion methods are often classified to keep reports unclassified. Various means are used to defeat detection technologies, such as high-Z material absorbing gamma rays, low-Z material deflecting neutrons, and radiography potentially missing small pieces of SNM. Enemy attempts to evade detection can complicate plans, as multiple detection systems are harder to defeat. Placing a lead shield around a bomb to attenuate gamma rays could make it obvious on a radiograph. Enemy attempts to smuggle HEU into the United States could involve fabricating the weapon inside the country, which may require smuggling other weapon components and purchasing specialized equipment. To prevent this, containers loaded on vessels in foreign ports must be scanned by imaging and radiation detection equipment before entering the US by July 1, 2012. Salvage fuzing is a potential threat, but it has shortcomings such as accidental detonation and the possibility of detonating in a US port, causing less damage than in a city center. Developing technology for smuggling weapon components and purchasing specialized equipment poses risks of accidents and detection by law enforcement. It is crucial to consider technology advancements in the context of offense-defense competition."
