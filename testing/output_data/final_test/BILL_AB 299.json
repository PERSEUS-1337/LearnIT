    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Brandon Patrick Water Safety Act, also known as Article 7, requires the department to create a submersion incident report form for statewide drownings. The form includes basic incident information like date, time, address, and type of dwelling. The Brandon Patrick Water Safety Act mandates the creation of a submersion incident report form for statewide drownings. The form includes victim information such as age, gender, race, last seen location, time submersed, clothing worn, flotation device usage, and circumstances leading to the incident, including factors like drugs, alcohol, trauma, or preexisting conditions. The submersion incident report form includes sections for Water Source Information and Adult Supervision. The Water Source Information section collects details about the incident site, water clarity, depth, type, presence of toys, and pool/spa construction date. The Adult Supervision section records the supervisor's identity and if a child protective services referral was made. The submersion incident report form includes questions about whether submersion was witnessed, if a trained lifeguard was on duty, and details about barriers such as working barriers, secondary barriers, and other barriers present. The form created for submersion incident reports includes questions about rescue equipment, CPR performance, swim classes, and victim status. It must be completed by first responders within 72 hours. First responders must complete a form within 72 hours for individuals treated or hospitalized for respiratory distress from submersion incidents. The form is then submitted to the department and local county health department. Data is aggregated quarterly and statistical information on drownings is posted annually on department and county health department websites. This form is not required for individuals rescued and released without respiratory distress symptoms. The department provides a form on its website for cities and counties to use as their official form for reporting drowning incidents. Cities and counties can also add their logo and contact information to the form. Definitions for terms like \"drowning\" and \"first responder\" are provided in the section. The curr_chunk defines \"nonfatal drowning\" as survival after drowning and specifies the individuals authorized to provide prehospital emergency medical care or rescue services. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act incurs state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be made accordingly."
