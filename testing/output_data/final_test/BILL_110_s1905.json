    "content": "The Act is titled as the \"Regional Presidential Primary and Caucus Act of 2007\" and includes definitions for various terms. The \"Regional Presidential Primary and Caucus Act of 2007\" defines key terms such as caucus, election year, national committee, and political party. A caucus is a meeting for selecting delegates, an election year is when a Presidential election is held, a national committee oversees party operations, and a political party nominates candidates for federal office. The term \"primary\" refers to a primary election for selecting delegates to a national Presidential nominating convention of a political party, excluding caucuses or conventions. It also defines a federal office candidate as one nominated by a political party that won electoral votes in the previous Presidential election. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. SCHEDULE.\" is extracted from the context that defines the term \"primary\" and a federal office candidate. The Election Assistance Commission will conduct a lottery by March 1, 2010, to determine the order of primaries in 4 regions. Region I will hold the first primary, followed by Region II, Region III, and Region IV. Region IV will hold the fourth primary. If Region II holds the first primary, Region III will hold the second primary, and Region I will hold the third primary. If Region III holds the first primary, Region IV will hold the second primary, and Region I will hold the third primary. In 2012, each State that elects to hold a primary shall do so according to a schedule outlined in the Act. The schedule dictates which region will hold the primary based on a specific order if Region IV is selected to hold the first primary. Each State in the selected region must hold primaries according to a schedule outlined in the Act. The first primary will be held from the first Tuesday in March to the sixth day following, the second primary from the first Tuesday in April to the sixth day following, and the third primary as required. Each State in the selected region must hold primaries according to a schedule outlined in the Act. The first primary will be held from the first Tuesday in March to the sixth day following, the second primary from the first Tuesday in April to the sixth day following, and the third primary as required. In subsequent election cycles, each State in each region that elects to hold a primary shall hold a primary in May and June following similar guidelines. States in a region that elect to hold primaries must do so from the first Tuesday of the month following the previous election year's primary to the sixth day after that Tuesday. The primary election period for states in certain regions begins on the first Tuesday in March of the succeeding election year and ends on the sixth day after that Tuesday. Exceptions apply to specific states, allowing them to hold primaries earlier if they choose. Region I is defined for the purposes of these regulations. Region I includes Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia. Region II comprises Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and South Carolina. Region III includes Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Region IV comprises Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, and Montana. The national committees determine the regions of territories in the United States, including Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. SEC. 4. STATE CAUCUS TO SELECT DELEGATES. SEC. 4. STATE CAUCUS TO SELECT DELEGATES. In General, a State holding a caucus for selecting delegates to a national Presidential nominating convention must align with the region's primary schedule.
