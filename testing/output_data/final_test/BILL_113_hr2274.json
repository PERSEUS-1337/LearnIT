The term 'control' in this paragraph refers to the power to direct the management or policies of a company, whether through ownership of securities or other means.

The term 'control' refers to the power to direct the management or policies of a company, whether through ownership of securities or other means. An individual is presumed to have control if they hold certain positions within a company or have the right to vote 20 percent or more of a class of voting securities. An eligible privately held company is one that does not have any registered securities and meets specific ownership criteria. In the fiscal year before engaging the M&A broker, the company must meet certain conditions related to securities registration and filing requirements with the Commission. The conditions for a company to be considered an M&A broker include earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization less than $25,000,000 and gross revenues less than $250,000,000. Securities transactions involving the transfer of ownership of an eligible privately held company, whether the broker represents the seller or buyer, through various means like purchase, sale, or business combination, as long as the broker believes the buyer will control the company post-transaction. The broker must ensure that the buyer will control the eligible privately held company post-transaction and have access to financial information before finalizing the deal. The broker must provide year-end financial statements, including balance sheet, income statement, and statement of changes in financial position, along with information on management, business operations, and any material losses. If audited, the financial statements must be accompanied by the independent auditor's report and a balance sheet dated within 120 days of the offer. The issuer must provide year-end financial statements, including balance sheet, income statement, and material loss contingencies. Every 5 years, dollar amounts will be adjusted based on the Employment Cost Index For Wages and Salaries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics adjusts dollar amounts annually based on the Employment Cost Index For Wages and Salaries, rounding to the nearest multiple of $100,000. The Act and any amendments will take effect 90 days after enactment."
