The amendment to the Endangered Species Act requires petitions to include clear evidence of species ranges, population estimates, reasons for action, population decline, and additional relevant information. The Endangered Species Act now requires petitions to include scientific literature, data on species range and population, and methodology used for data collection. The Secretary must publish a notice in the Federal Register within 30 days of receiving a petition to add or remove a species from the list. The Endangered Species Act now requires petitions to include scientific information on the status of the species. Upon receipt of a petition, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service must promptly publish it online, provide notice to landowners, and notify affected Governors. Independent review of petitions and findings is also required. The Endangered Species Act now mandates that petitions must contain scientific data on the species' status. Following a finding by the Secretary, an independent review board is appointed to assess the petition's scientific information and methodology within 60 days. The Endangered Species Act requires petitions to meet academic and scientific standards. If a finding is made by the Secretary, an independent review board is appointed to evaluate the petition's data within 90 days. The Endangered Species Act mandates that petitions must meet academic and scientific criteria. If the Secretary makes a finding, an independent review board assesses the data within 90 days, evaluating scientific information, methodology, evidence, and concurrence with the Secretary's finding. The Secretary is required to publish these findings in the Federal Register and on their website. The Endangered Species Act requires petitions to meet scientific criteria. An independent review board evaluates the Secretary's findings within 90 days, with the option to revoke or explain discrepancies in the Federal Register.

Board members receive compensation at a rate equivalent to a GS-12 grade. The schedule for each day of a qualified individual engaged in duties as a board member includes travel time. A qualified individual in the biological sciences must have expertise to review scientific methodology, be impartial, and not have ties to the Secretary or the state involved in the species under review. The Secretary must publish a summary of the independent scientific review board's report for any final regulation implementing an action requiring such a review. The report must be included in the official record of the regulation. The Secretary must appoint an independent review board to conduct a scientific review within 30 days of issuing a statement on a proposed action that may jeopardize a species.
