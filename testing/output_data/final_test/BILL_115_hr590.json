    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act of 2017\". Congress acknowledges the significant role of nuclear energy in the United States, generating 20% of total electricity and 60% of carbon-free electricity. Nuclear power plants operate efficiently, providing reliable and affordable electricity while contributing billions to the economy and creating high-paying jobs. The commercial nuclear industry is crucial for national security and must maintain its leadership in the global market. The development of advanced nuclear reactor designs is crucial for maintaining the nation's nuclear fleet and expanding the use of new technologies. Nuclear fusion technology shows promise in generating electricity with increased safety and no radioactive waste. A performance-based regulatory framework is needed to support the progress of advanced reactor designs through Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval. The text chunk discusses definitions related to the topic. The curr_chunk defines terms related to advanced nuclear reactors, the Department of Energy, and licensing activities by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. The curr_chunk defines terms related to advanced nuclear reactors, the Department of Energy, and licensing activities by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. It includes definitions for National Laboratory, NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission), and Secretary (Secretary of Energy). The curr_chunk focuses on agency coordination. The NRC and the Department will establish a memorandum of understanding on technical expertise, modeling and simulation, and facilities for advanced reactor technology. The Department will maintain facilities for civilian nuclear industry research and development of safe reactor technology, ensuring NRC access as needed. The Department will maintain facilities for civilian nuclear industry research and development of safe reactor technology, ensuring NRC access as needed. SEC. 5. ADVANCED REACTOR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. The NRC must submit a plan to Congress within 1 year of this Act's enactment for developing an efficient, risk-informed framework for advanced reactor licensing. The plan will evaluate unique aspects, legal issues, regulatory options, and ways to expedite licensing. Options to expedite and streamline the licensing of advanced reactors, including minimizing delays, incorporating consensus-based codes, making the framework more predictable, and allowing phased review processes. The NRC evaluates processes for issuing approvals without re-reviewing previous information, including partial applications and design criteria. It assesses the need for policy changes, the role of licensing advanced reactors in long-term planning, and cost-sharing options for applicants. Coordination and stakeholder input are required in developing these processes. The NRC must seek input from the Department, nuclear industry, and stakeholders to develop a plan with cost estimates and milestones for implementing the advanced reactor regulatory framework by September 30, 2019. The NRC also needs to provide the status of performance metrics and milestone schedules for design certification applications, along with a plan to address any delays. SEC. 6. USER FEES AND ANNUAL CHARGES. Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 regarding amounts appropriated to the Commission for activities related to the development of regulatory infrastructure for advanced nuclear reactor technologies before October 1, 2020."
