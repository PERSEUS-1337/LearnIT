    "content": "The \"Families Beyond Bars Act of 2010\" is the short title of this Act. Congress finds that a significant number of children in the United States have at least one parent who has been incarcerated, leading to documented trauma and negative effects on the children's mental health and academic performance. Children of incarcerated parents face various challenges such as truancy, attention deficit disorders, substance abuse, teen pregnancy, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that these children are almost 6 times more likely to be incarcerated themselves. Increased visitation between incarcerated parents and their children can help reduce anxiety and sense of loss, potentially leading to a decrease in future crime and incarceration rates among these children. Participation in visitation programs allows these children to build relationships with caring adults and experience meaningful involvement, which can help mitigate the negative effects of having an incarcerated parent. The incarceration of mothers can disrupt family structure, income, living arrangements, and emotional support for their children. Mothers often serve as primary caregivers before arrest. Parenting skills can be enhanced during incarceration, leading to resistance to peer pressure and high expectations for children's school work. The Beyond Bars Grant Program is established. The Attorney General can award grants to organizations for child-parent visitation programs that strengthen familial bonds. Grants can be used for group meetings, counseling for children and incarcerated parents, and hiring program facilitators. The program facilitators selected will organize group meetings, provide counseling to eligible children and their incarcerated parents, receive a monthly stipend, arrange transportation for children to attend meetings, provide security during meetings, and offer enrichment activities for incarcerated parents. (7) Enrichment activities for incarcerated parents, including parenting classes and transition programs;\n(8) Connections to community and social services for eligible children, incarcerated parents, and guardians;\n(9) Obtain necessary program materials and supplies;\n(10) Conduct evaluations of grant activities, including volunteer recruitment and parental support. The program aims to provide enrichment activities for children, coordinate child-parent visitation programs in correctional facilities, and supervise adult volunteers assisting with the program. The child-parent visitation program includes group meetings supervised by a qualified facilitator. Meetings may focus on improving parenting skills for incarcerated parents and ensuring strong family foundations. Monthly child-parent meetings are also included in the program. The child-parent visitation program includes monthly meetings for eligible children to visit their incarcerated parents in a supportive environment with activities like arts and crafts, games, and mentoring sessions. Additionally, there are meetings held in locations outside of prison facilities for child-parent interaction. The prison facility offers eligible children opportunities to develop interpersonal skills, self-confidence, and self-esteem through evidence-based programs, community service projects, and recreational activities. A stipend for qualified program facilitators is limited to 45% of grant funds. Qualified program facilitators can receive a stipend by entering into an agreement with a qualified organization to facilitate group meetings for at least one year. The agreement may be renewable for additional one-year periods. Qualified organizations interested in receiving a grant must submit an application to the Attorney General, including assurance of providing the non-Federal share of activity costs. The Attorney General may prioritize grants based on organizations with existing child-parent visitation programs, proven leadership development programs, and strong plans for measuring program success. Qualified organizations receiving grants must provide a percentage of costs from non-Federal sources, which can be cash, in-kind, from State or local public sources, or private donations. The percentage varies based on the organization's establishment date, starting at 2.5% for the first year and increasing to 10% by the third year. Qualified organizations receiving grants must provide a percentage of costs from non-Federal sources, which can be cash, in-kind, from State or local public sources, or private donations. The percentage varies based on the organization's establishment date, starting at 2.5% for the first year and increasing to 15% by the fifth year. The Attorney General is authorized to issue necessary regulations for this section. Each qualified organization receiving a grant under this section must submit an annual report to the Attorney General, including evaluations, best practices, and demographic information about eligible children served and those who applied but were not accepted.
