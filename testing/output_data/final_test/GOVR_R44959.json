    "content": "The iconography of the Confederate states in the U.S. Civil War is a contentious part of American historical memory, with Confederate symbols being seen as both historical symbols and symbols of oppression. Recent incidents, such as the Charleston church shooting in 2015 and violence in Charlottesville in 2017, have sparked renewed debate on the presence of Confederate symbols in public spaces, leading to some governments removing them. Congress is also considering the role of Confederate symbols on federal lands. Congress is considering the presence of Confederate symbols on federal lands and in federal programs, with various agencies like the National Park Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of the Army administering assets that display Confederate memorials. Military installations and Navy ships also honor Confederate figures, and the U.S. Capitol complex contains works commemorating Confederate soldiers and officials. The presence of Confederate symbols on federal lands and at sites receiving federal funding raises questions for Congress on how to address differing views on their meaning, which symbols should be removed or preserved, and whether every tribute to a Confederate figure should be considered a Confederate symbol. Federal agencies may need to focus on education and dialogue about the conflicted history of these symbols. This report focuses on Confederate symbols administered by federal entities like NPS, VA, and DOD, discussing recent legislative proposals and current policies regarding these symbols. Bills in recent Congresses have addressed Confederate symbols on federal lands and programs. The 115th Congress is considering bills on Confederate symbols under federal jurisdiction, with questions arising on implementation. H.R. 3660, the No Federal Funding for Confederate Symbols Act, would prohibit funding for such symbols. H.R. 3660, the No Federal Funding for Confederate Symbols Act, aims to prohibit the use of federal funds for Confederate symbols on federal property, including flags, monuments, and statues. It also directs the renaming of military installations currently named after Confederate leaders. H.R. 3779, H.R. 3701, S. 1772, and H.Res. 12 propose the removal of Confederate monuments and symbols from federal property to promote a more perfect union and avoid promoting racism and oppression. The House considered amendments regarding Confederate symbols during the appropriations bill for FY2018, but none were approved. In previous Congresses, there were attempts to address the display and sale of Confederate flags at NPS units, including national cemeteries. The House appropriations bill for FY2016 included amendments regarding Confederate flags at NPS sites, but none were ultimately included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2016. Amendments aimed to prohibit the display and sale of Confederate flags at national cemeteries and NPS gift shops. In the 114th Congress, amendments addressing VA policies on the display of the Confederate flag at national cemeteries were proposed but not included in final appropriations legislation. Bills such as H.R. 3007 and H.R. 4909 aimed to prohibit the display of the Confederate battle flag in VA national cemeteries but were not enacted. In the 114th Congress, various bills aimed to prohibit the display of Confederate symbols at national cemeteries and educational institutions, but these provisions were not enacted into law. H.Res. 344 urged states to remove Confederate symbols from public locations and state flags, discontinue their use in government speech contexts, and businesses to stop selling Confederate merchandise. NPS manages National Park units related to Civil War history, some with Confederate commemorations, and administers national cemeteries that may display the Confederate flag at certain times. The National Park Service (NPS) provides education and interpretation on Civil War history and Confederate states. NPS is connected with preserving nonfederal Confederate memorials and has faced scrutiny for its lack of inventory on Confederate commemorative works at park sites. Many Confederate works are found at NPS battlefields and Civil War-related park units. Some Confederate commemorative works in parks are not eligible for historic property designations due to being constructed recently. NPS policies govern the establishment and removal of commemorative works in national park units, requiring authorization by Congress or approval by the NPS Director. The NPS policies govern the establishment and removal of commemorative works in national park units, requiring authorization by Congress or approval by the NPS Director. Confederate commemorative works in Civil War parks may not be approved unless specifically authorized by Congress or commemorate groups not recognized during the commemorative period. Existing commemorative works in parks will not be altered or removed, even if deemed inaccurate or incompatible with prevailing views. The NPS policies govern the establishment and removal of commemorative works in national park units, requiring authorization by Congress or approval by the NPS Director. NPS could face constraints in removing Confederate commemorative works, such as those established by acts of Congress or protected under historic property laws. The agency's mission is to conserve scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife in park units. The National Park Service's mission is to conserve scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife in park units. NPS may need congressional legislation to authorize the removal of certain works from park units, such as Confederate memorials and flags. The agency is committed to safeguarding memorials while educating visitors about their historical context. After the Charleston, SC shooting in 2015, NPS implemented a policy prohibiting the display of Confederate flags in national park units, except for specific historical contexts like reenactments or educational programs. This policy applies to all NPS sites, including the 14 national cemeteries administered by the agency. NPS policies allow the display of Confederate flags at national cemeteries on specific days, such as Confederate Memorial Day and Memorial Day, for decorating the graves of Confederate veterans. A sponsoring group must provide and remove the flags after the events. Following the June 2015 shootings in Charleston, House Members addressed the display of Confederate flags at NPS cemeteries in proposed amendments to Interior appropriations bills for both FY2016 and FY2017. Some NPS units have shops operated by concessioners, cooperating associations, or other partners, which sell items related to the themes and features of the park. NPS and Congress addressed the sale of Confederate-themed items in NPS shops, particularly items displaying the Confederate flag. NPS asked its concessioners and other partners to voluntarily end sales of items that depict a Confederate flag as a stand-alone feature. NPS requested the voluntary end of sales of Confederate flag items in its shops, except for educational and historical context items. House Members introduced amendments regarding Confederate-themed items in NPS facilities during FY2016 and FY2017 appropriations discussions. NPS also supports heritage and historic preservation efforts, providing assistance to national heritage areas primarily managed by nonfederal entities. The National Park Service (NPS) coordinates preservation efforts with state, local, and private entities, including designations for historic landmarks and the National Register of Historic Places. These designations offer protections and eligibility for grants to nonfederal sites. Some sites commemorating the Confederacy are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated as national historic landmarks, leading to debates about their preservation. For example, the Monument Avenue Historic District in Richmond, VA, features Confederate monuments. The Monument Avenue Historic District in Richmond, VA, with Confederate monuments, is a national historic landmark district subject to debate. Legislation varies on the role of Confederate symbols in the National Park System, with some seeking removal or maintenance of certain symbols. NHPA protections only apply if federal funding or licensing is involved. The debate over Confederate symbols in the National Park System includes proposals for their removal or maintenance, with some restrictions on NPS's ability to take administrative actions without congressional authorization. Both the Obama and Trump Administrations have expressed the need to preserve some Confederate symbols in park units under NPS statutes, while also promoting educational activities to interpret them appropriately. The Obama and Trump Administrations have taken steps to discourage the use of Confederate symbols, particularly the Confederate flag. Funding for the removal of Confederate commemorative works in the National Park System is a consideration due to NPS's lack of funds for disposal. The Department of Veterans Affairs administers national cemeteries as national shrines to honor the deceased, with the first national cemeteries established during the Civil War. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) was created in 1973 to oversee national cemeteries previously administered by the Army. It excludes Confederate soldiers from interment in national cemeteries, but provides grants for state veterans' cemeteries. The National Cemetery Administration oversees national cemeteries and provides grants for state veterans' cemeteries. State veterans' cemeteries that receive federal grants must adhere to federal law regarding eligibility for interment, excluding Confederate veterans. Federal law permits the VA to accept monuments and memorials donated by private entities for national cemeteries. Some Confederate monuments and memorials in national cemeteries were established before federal control, while others were more recently erected by private organizations like the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Veterans buried in national, state, or private cemeteries are eligible for government-provided headstones or grave markers, including Confederate veterans. Government-provided headstones or grave markers may be provided at no cost by the VA for Confederate veterans, if the grave is unmarked. The headstone can include identifying information and an emblem of belief or the Southern Cross of Honor. Small Confederate flags can be placed at gravesites on Memorial Day. The VA allows for the display of Confederate flags at national cemeteries where Confederate soldiers are buried. The flags must be provided by a sponsoring organization and can be displayed during interment, funeral, or memorial services. In 2016, the House of Representatives passed a bill to prohibit the VA from flying the Confederate flag at national cemeteries with Confederate veterans buried. The VA later amended its policy to ban the display of the Confederate flag at any national cemetery. The controversy over Confederate symbols on public lands supported with federal funds continues to affect the VA. The controversy over Confederate symbols on public lands supported with federal funds affects the VA, national cemeteries, and current laws and policies regarding headstones for Confederate gravesites. Legislation like H.R. 3660 raises questions about the treatment of existing headstones, monuments, and memorials in national cemeteries, as well as the inclusion of the Southern Cross of Honor on future VA-issued headstones for unmarked Confederate graves. The Department of Defense emphasizes preserving a servicemember's right of expression to the maximum extent. The Defense Department allows servicemembers to express themselves in accordance with constitutional and statutory provisions. While the display of the Confederate flag is not explicitly prohibited, commanders can ban it if deemed detrimental to unit discipline. The Navy has a policy on the Confederate flag, ensuring trust in commitment to inclusivity. NSTC is committed to providing an environment of equal opportunity and maintaining an ethnically-diverse workforce. Command leaders must avoid associating the Navy with symbols like the Confederate battle flag to prevent linking the Navy with negative connotations. Command leaders should avoid connecting the Navy to the Confederate battle flag to maintain inclusiveness. Displays of the flag in a museum alongside Civil War artifacts are unlikely to be seen as partisan. While the Navy can choose its messages, individual expression rights must be preserved. Command leaders must be mindful of conduct that could undermine the Navy's positive message. Some military recruits with Confederate flag tattoos have been barred from joining the military based on policies prohibiting certain types of tattoos. The Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps all have policies that prohibit tattoos injurious to good order and discipline. The Navy has a general policy regarding the display of the Confederate flag. Army Regulation (AR) 670-1 prohibits soldiers from having extremist, indecent, sexist, or racist tattoos. The Army does not have specific prohibitions concerning the Confederate flag in tattoos. The Navy prohibits tattoos that are prejudicial to good order, discipline, and morale, including those that are obscene, sexually explicit, advocate discrimination, symbolize affiliation with gangs or extremist groups, or advocate illegal drug use. Marine Corps also prohibits tattoos that are prejudicial to good order and discipline. The Navy and Marine Corps prohibit tattoos that are prejudicial to good order and discipline, including those that are drug-related, gang-related, extremist, obscene, sexist, or racist. The Air Force also prohibits tattoos that are obscene, associated with gangs or extremist organizations, or advocate discrimination. There is no explicit prohibition against the Confederate flag in these policies. Arlington National Cemetery, under U.S. Army jurisdiction, allows small Confederate flags on Confederate graves on Memorial Day or Confederate Memorial Day. Flags must be removed at private expense the following workday. Congress authorized funds for a section of the cemetery in 1900. In 1900, Congress authorized $2,500 for a section of Arlington National Cemetery to be set aside for Confederate dead. Section 16 was reserved for Confederate graves, with 482 persons buried there including officers, enlisted men, wives, civilians, and unknowns. A monument was approved in 1906 and unveiled in 1914 to honor the Confederate dead. Currently, there are 10 major Army installations in southern states named after Confederate military leaders. The Department of the Army lacks a formal process for renaming military installations, with bases named after Confederate military leaders. Legislation in the 115th Congress aims to rename these bases and prohibit the use of federal funds for Confederate symbols. Legislation in the 115th Congress aims to rename military installations named after Confederate leaders and prohibit federal funds for maintenance of Confederate symbols. Proponents argue for honoring other national military leaders, while opponents cite challenges in creating a new review process and selecting names. Congress faces various proposals regarding Confederate symbols on federal lands and in federally funded programs. Some proposals regarding Confederate symbols on federal lands raise questions about implementation and financial implications."
