    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Clarification and Implementation Act of 2008\". Congressional findings and purpose are outlined in the Act. Prior to the passage of the UIGEA in 2006, Federal law was vague and outdated on Internet gambling. Federal prosecutions have only involved sports betting, creating a lack of court decisions on other forms of online gambling. Sports betting, illegal in 49 states, is seen as particularly harmful due to its impact on the integrity of sports. The UIGEA clarified Internet gambling as illegal, leading European companies to close their sites to US customers. Companies that tried to comply with the law faced legal jeopardy, punishing intended behavior. The UIGEA clarified that Internet gambling is illegal, causing European companies to stop offering services to US customers. Congress clarified that criminal statutes on gambling do not apply to those who did not offer sports betting before October 13, 2006, and ceased services to US customers after the UIGEA passed. The focus of prosecutorial efforts should be on those offering Internet sports betting in the US.
