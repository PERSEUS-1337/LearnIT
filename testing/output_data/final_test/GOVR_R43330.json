    "content": "The Indian Health Service (IHS) is the federal agency responsible for improving the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives. Congress has a moral obligation to provide healthcare to these populations, as reaffirmed in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides health services to approximately 2.2 million American Indians or Alaska Natives who are members of federally recognized tribes. IHS works directly with tribes or Tribal Organizations (TOs) under the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) and grants to Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) under IHCIA Title V. Over half of federally recognized tribes operate health programs, with nearly 40% of IHS's budget administered by tribes. IHS's FY2016 appropriation is $4.8 billion, with additional funding for special diabetes programs. The Indian Health Service (IHS) receives a total estimated program level funding of $6.1 billion in FY2016, including appropriations, diabetes funding, and collections. Services provided by IHS facilities vary but focus on primary and preventive care for eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives. These services are available through facilities operated by IHS, Tribal Organizations (TOs), Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs), collectively known as \"I/T/U.\" The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides services to eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives through IHS-funded facilities. These facilities are collectively known as I/T/U and serve those residing on reservations, in non-reservation areas, and some urban areas with a significant Native population. While not all eligible individuals receive care from IHS, more than half do. Reasons for not seeking care include geographic inaccessibility and unavailable services. This report outlines the IHS's service population, organization, facility types, and programs aimed at improving health outcomes. The report outlines IHS programs focusing on reducing health conditions among beneficiaries, supporting new facilities, workforce increase, and contracts with ITs and TOs. It also discusses IHS's authorizing legislation, congressional oversight, and includes appendices on estimating the Native population and a timeline of federal health services provision. The IHS user population differs from self-identified Native population as not all are eligible for or use IHS services. Not all self-identified American Indians and Alaska Natives are eligible for IHS services; eligibility requires tribal membership or meeting specific requirements. Tribal membership is determined by the tribe, and not all self-identified individuals meet the criteria for IHS services. Tribal membership for IHS services is determined by the tribe, with requirements such as recognized descent from a tribal roll, minimum genealogical percentages, or proof of descent. Congress has set membership criteria for some tribes. Other individuals eligible for IHS services include those residing in IHS health service delivery areas, on tax-exempt land, recognized as Indian by their community, active in tribal affairs, or meeting other relevant factors. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides care to tribal members based on tribal membership criteria, including descent from a tribal roll or active participation in tribal affairs. Non-Indians may also receive care in specific circumstances, such as emergencies or infectious diseases. Services are primarily for federally recognized tribes, but may also extend to terminated or state-recognized tribes by Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs). Terminated or state-recognized tribe members are not eligible for IHS services. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides care to tribal members based on tribal membership criteria. The IHS user population is estimated to be 1.6 million, smaller than the projected service population of 2.2 million. The service population includes individuals who could use IHS facilities but have not done so in the prior three years. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau is used to estimate the service population. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides care to tribal members based on tribal membership criteria. The IHS user population is estimated to be 1.6 million, smaller than the projected service population of 2.2 million. The service population includes individuals who could use IHS facilities but have not done so in the prior three years. The IHS health care delivery system serves federal reservations, Indian communities in Oklahoma and California, and Indian, Eskimo (Inuit and Yupik), and Aleut communities in Alaska through 12 area offices and 168 local service units. The Indian Health Service (IHS) operates through 12 area offices covering multiple states, with the Alaska office serving exclusively in Alaska. IHS-funded health care is provided in facilities managed by the IHS directly or by tribes through self-determination contracts. Tribes administer approximately 40% of IHS's total appropriation, with more than half of federally recognized tribes operating health programs or facilities. Approximately 40% of IHS's total appropriation is administered by tribes, with certain geographic patterns in the location of tribally-operated programs. Some areas have all or almost all facilities and programs operated by tribes, while others have more facilities operated by the IHS. The size of the IHS user population also varies by area, with more than one-third of all users living in the Oklahoma City and Navajo areas. The Indian Health Service (IHS) system in New Mexico, southeastern Utah, and northeastern Arizona primarily consists of five types of facilities: hospitals, health centers, health stations, Alaska village clinics, and youth regional treatment centers. These facilities focus on primary care, with only hospitals and youth regional treatment centers providing in-patient care. Urban Indian Health Programs (UIOs) offer services that differ from those provided by IHS, ITs, and TOs. The Indian Health Service system includes hospitals and youth regional treatment centers that provide in-patient care. Hospitals offer various services such as surgical and specialty care, with most having emergency departments and some designated as trauma centers. Youth regional treatment centers focus on substance abuse and mental health treatment for American Indian and Alaska Native youth. The Indian Health Service system includes hospitals and youth regional treatment centers that provide in-patient care, with hospitals offering surgical and specialty care services. There are 10 facilities in total, with 5 operated by the IHS and the remaining 5 by ITs or TOs. Additionally, there are 344 health centers that generally provide outpatient services, primary and preventive care, health education, and some laboratory, pharmacy, and radiology services. Some health centers operated by ITs and TOs receive federal health center grants and may also operate school health centers. Alaska village clinics (150 total) provide services using paraprofessionals assisted by health professionals via telehealth technologies, including a dental health assistant program overseen by remote dentists. These clinics offer routine preventive dental care and less complicated dental procedures. The Indian Health Service (IHS) funds various types of facilities, including youth regional treatment facilities and urban Indian organizations (UIOs). UIOs, supported by grants and contracts from IHS, offer a variety of services at 57 locations. Outpatient facilities are more likely to be administered by Indian tribes (ITs) or tribal organizations (TOs) than by IHS. UIOs, funded by IHS, offer various services at 57 locations. 21 of the 35 UIO grantees provide direct medical care for 40+ hours per week, while 7 provide care for less than 40 hours. 5 grantees offer behavioral health counseling and education services, with partnerships for healthcare. One grantee is a residential treatment facility, and another provides national education and research services. UIOs serve approximately 54,000 American Indians and Alaska Natives. UIOs provide care to around 54,000 American Indians and Alaska Natives without access to IHS facilities. They receive funding from various sources, including IHS funds, state grants, and patient fees. IHS health services are provided directly by IHS-funded facilities or indirectly through contracts with outside providers. Reimbursements from federal programs are used to enhance available health services. The IHS provides a variety of medical services, including inpatient, ambulatory, emergency, dental, public health nursing, and preventive health care. Services focus on primary and preventive care, with limited specialty services available at IHS-funded facilities. The IHS system has 46 small hospitals with varying services, and some areas may have limited access to hospitals. The IHS utilizes technology to expand services in remote areas with limited access to hospitals. This includes providing behavioral health services via telehealth and consulting with specialists through telehealth technologies. The agency also disseminates best practices through training and technical assistance. IHS disseminates best practices through training and technical assistance, utilizing community members as paraprofessionals to provide care in rural and remote areas. This includes a community health representative program and dental health aides in Alaska. IHS facilities supplement funding for services through reimbursements from various sources. The Indian Health Service (IHS) is unique in its ability to collect reimbursements from various sources, such as private insurance, to supplement its funding for clinical services. These collections are retained by the service unit that collected them, incentivizing them to increase collections to expand services. IHS-funded facilities provide services directly when possible, but may refer beneficiaries to private providers through the purchased/referred care program or catastrophic health emergency fund when needed. The Indian Health Service (IHS) can collect reimbursements from private insurance to supplement its funding. IHS-funded facilities may refer beneficiaries to private providers through the purchased/referred care (PRC) program. PRC eligibility criteria include living in specific geographic areas called \"contract health service delivery areas\" (CHSDAs). The Indian Health Service's Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) program has specific eligibility criteria, including living in designated CHSDAs. IHS beneficiaries must exhaust all other healthcare resources before receiving PRC authorization for priority one services to prevent immediate death or serious impairment. Proof of denials from alternate resources is required for PRC approval. The Indian Health Service's Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) program requires preapproval for services, with providers accepting IHS payment as full payment. In emergencies, applicants must notify the program within 72 hours. Hospitals can only charge PRC program what Medicare would for inpatient services. Outpatient rates are negotiated with private providers. Proposed rule in 2014 aimed to extend Medicare Like Rates to outpatient providers. The Indian Health Service's Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) program requires preapproval for services, with providers accepting IHS payment as full payment. In emergencies, applicants must notify the program within 72 hours. The catastrophic health emergency fund (CHEF) provides funding to reimburse costs for high-cost cases like burn victims, motor vehicle incidents, and cardiology. Unlike the PRC program, the CHEF is centrally managed at IHS Headquarters. Local PRC programs can apply to the CHEF for high-cost cases that meet the criteria. IHS reported more cases meeting the CHEF criteria than available funds. IHS provides services directly or through ITs and TOs targeting common health conditions among beneficiaries. Grant programs for ITs and TOs also target common conditions. The Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) is part of IHS's National Diabetes Program, focusing on reducing diabetes rates among American Indian and Alaska Native populations. The program aims to provide support through diabetes surveillance, health promotion, and research translation using grant monies. The Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) is funded separately from IHS's discretionary appropriation through FY2017. Each area office has a diabetes consultant and there are 336 community-directed diabetes program grants. Performance measures show improved health outcomes for IHS beneficiaries with diabetes. IHS addresses high rates of substance abuse and mental health disorders among beneficiaries, especially younger individuals, through special facilities and behavioral health programs. The Division of Behavioral Health under Title VII of IHCIA aims to create collaborative behavioral health programs integrating alcohol and substance abuse, social services, and mental health care. IHS-funded facilities focus on suicide prevention, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, and methamphetamine use among American Indian and Alaska Natives. Inpatient services are not available, with PRC funds used for after-hours and inpatient care. The Indian Health Service (IHS) supports public health activities to encourage healthy behaviors and reduce infectious diseases among American Indian and Alaska Natives. This includes initiatives like the methamphetamine and suicide prevention program, community-based interventions, and efforts to increase immunization rates and access to safe water supplies. IHS aims to prevent illness to reduce the need for certain health services and expand care for beneficiaries. The Indian Health Service (IHS) focuses on prevention activities to improve health outcomes for American Indian and Alaska Natives. This includes funding for public health nurses who provide prevention-focused care interventions, manage chronic conditions, and prevent hospital readmissions. These efforts aim to reduce the need for more intensive health care services and maximize available resources. IHS utilizes community health representatives (CHRs) as part of their prevention activities to provide health education, support patient self-management, and improve community health. CHRs offer various services such as taking vital signs, foot care for diabetics, case management, and transportation services. They work alongside public health nurses to prevent hospital readmissions and reduce emergency department visits. Additionally, IHS focuses on immunization efforts to lower rates of preventable diseases. The Indian Health Service (IHS) focuses on immunization efforts to reduce rates of infectious diseases like influenza, pneumonia, and HPV. They also work with Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium to increase hepatitis B vaccination rates among Alaska Natives. IHS funds construction of water supply and sewage facilities for American Indian/Alaska Native homes to improve access to safe drinking water and waste disposal. The Indian Health Service (IHS) invests in sanitation facilities with positive health benefits and cost effectiveness. There is a backlog of 3,675 sanitation facility construction projects requiring $3.4 billion. IHS also funds health workforce recruitment, facility construction, and maintenance. The Indian Health Service (IHS) funds the maintenance and construction of health care facilities operated by ITs and TOs to ensure they meet building codes and accreditation standards. This includes funding for new facility construction based on a priority system developed with ITs and TOs. Accreditation is necessary to receive reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, the VA, and private insurance plans. The Indian Health Service (IHS) faces challenges in filling health care provider vacancies in rural areas, with a 20% vacancy rate for physicians and nurses in 2014. To address this, IHS offers programs like scholarships and loan repayments to recruit and retain providers, targeting American Indians and Alaska Natives. These programs require a commitment to provide care at an IHS-funded facility after training. Additionally, recruitment bonuses are provided to attract health professionals to IHS facilities. IHS offers recruitment bonuses and bonus pay to make salaries competitive with the private sector, targeting health professions with high vacancy rates or in remote locations. They partner with HRSA to obtain providers from NHSC, a scholarship and loan repayment program for areas with provider shortages. As of December 2014, 650 IHS health facilities were designated as having provider shortages. IHS facilities designated as having provider shortages are eligible to receive NHSC providers. IHS provides contract support costs to ITs and TOs for administering programs under self-determination contracts. Shortfalls in CSC funding have led to reduced services for tribes with contracts. The Supreme Court decision in Salazar v. Ramah Navajo required IHS to have sufficient CSCs available to support contracts. The Supreme Court decision in Salazar v. Ramah Navajo held that a lack of appropriations does not release the federal government from its obligations to fully reimburse CSC costs. IHS is balancing priorities of ITs and TOs to administer their own programs with available CSC funds. P.L. 114-113 specifies that CSC funds are available indefinitely and prohibits using them for other purposes. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act is the major authorizing legislation for IHS. In 1921, the Snyder Act provided broad authorization for federal Indian programs, including health-related programs, and allowed the BIA to employ physicians to serve Indian tribes. This law addressed the lack of explicit authorization for Indian programs, ensuring funding for activities previously undertaken by the agency. In 1954, the Transfer Act shifted Indian health care responsibility from BIA to PHS in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The Indian Sanitation Facility Act of 1959 allowed PHS to build sanitation facilities for Indian communities, reducing mortality rates. ISDEAA in 1975 enabled tribal administration of federal Indian programs. In 1975, Congress enacted ISDEAA, allowing tribes to manage federal Indian programs like BIA and IHS through self-determination contracts. IHS also established a tribal consultation policy under ISDEAA authority. In 1976, IHCIA authorized specific IHS activities and set health goals for the service population, including collections from Medicare and Medicaid. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) authorized collections from Medicare, Medicaid, and other insurers, established programs for urban Indians, substance abuse treatment, and health professions recruitment. It was reauthorized in 1992 and extended through FY2001. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) reauthorized IHCIA permanently in 2010. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) was reauthorized in 1992, allowing tribal governments to consolidate IHS self-determination contracts into self-governance compacts. These compacts give tribes control to redesign programs and services. In 2000, the Tribal Self-Governance Amendments made the IHS self-governance program permanent by creating Title V. Congress also enacted the Alaska Native and American Indian Direct Reimbursement Act in 2000. In 2000, Congress enacted the Alaska Native and American Indian Direct Reimbursement Act, making permanent the IHCIA demonstration program allowing ITs and TOs to directly bill Medicare, Medicaid, and other payors. The program increased collections, reduced billing time, eased tracking, and lowered administrative costs. In 2010, the ACA reauthorized the IHCIA, expanding IHS services to include long-term care and behavioral health, and allowing ITs and TOs to receive reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid. Changes affecting IHS include expansions of private insurance coverage, increased reimbursements for Medicare services at IHS-funded facilities, and changes in tax treatment of private insurance plans. Congressional committees oversee legislation impacting IHS, with authorization for participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. Committees overseeing these programs are involved in IHCIA reauthorization and legislation affecting IHS beneficiary participation. IHS provides health care to American Indians and Alaska Natives living on or near reservations or in Native villages. Despite some challenges like geographic inconvenience and limited services, IHS expands care through partnerships, technology, and preventive measures to reduce costly treatments. The American Indian and Alaska Native population is defined differently by federal agencies, with the Indian Health Service using self-identification based on race. The number of individuals identifying as American Indian or Alaska Native increased between the 1990 and 2000 Censuses due to changes in self-identification options. The American Indian/Alaska Native population increased by 21% between Census 2000 and Census 2010, with 5.2 million people identifying as such. Tribal membership criteria vary, leading to some individuals being counted as American Indian/Alaska Native and another race. Not all individuals identifying as multiple races in the Census may be tribal members, as not all tribes are federally recognized. The Indian Health Service (IHS) uses Census data to estimate its eligible and user populations, with 1.6 million registered American Indian/Alaska Native patients in 2014. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) collects data on its service population using a different definition than IHS and the Census Bureau. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) collects data on its service population from agencies and tribes, but the estimates are not census-based and only cover those on or near reservations. BIA data is dated, last published in 2013, and does not confirm enrollment figures. Urban Indian Organizations serve a wider range of eligible persons, including members of terminated or state-recognized tribes. Urban Indian Health Programs are not authorized to serve individuals solely based on self-identification as American Indian or Alaska Native. Data from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Census Bureau, and Indian Health Service provide some information on urban Indian populations, but do not definitively determine the eligible population for Indian Health Service services. The Census data suggests that most American Indians/Alaska Natives live outside reservations and urban areas, with a majority residing in urban areas. Urban Indian Health Programs cannot solely serve individuals based on self-identification. Federal involvement in Indian health began with infectious disease control and evolved into the modern day Indian Health Service. Federal involvement in Indian health is rooted in treaties between Indian Tribes and the federal government, evolving into the modern day Indian Health Service (IHS). The timeline below highlights key events in Indian health history, with sources for further reference. The Indian Health Service (IHS) has its roots in treaties between Indian Tribes and the federal government. Key sources for further reference include works by Prucha, Schmeckebier, Stuart, the U.S. American Indian Policy Review Commission, and the U.S. Congress.
