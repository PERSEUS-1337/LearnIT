    "content": "The 112th Congress is discussing funding for federal government programs for FY2011. Several short-term continuing resolutions have been approved to prevent a government shutdown. H.R. 1473 provides budget authority for the remainder of FY2011 with spending reductions. The federal government's spending is subject to appropriations legislation, with outlays occurring when funds are disbursed by the U.S. Treasury Department. Congress has approved short-term continuing resolutions to fund government activities for FY2011, with the latest bill, H.R. 1473, expected to be considered. Discussions on the federal budget have sparked debate among lawmakers. The FY2011 budget measures have sparked debate on federal spending, with a focus on reshaping government size and responsibilities. Critics argue that proposed reductions could harm programs and services, impacting the fragile economy still recovering from the 2009 recession. Comparisons are made between proposed funding levels, the President's budget request, and H.R. 1 approved by the House in February 2011. The House approved a budget level in February 2011 to return spending for most agencies to FY2008 levels, separating funding for security and non-security agencies. The definition of security agencies includes DOD, VA, State Department/USAID, and DHS, while non-security agencies are all others. Recent House committees have defined security to include DOD, VA, and DHS but exclude State Department/USAID. War funding is sometimes excluded from security spending data presentations. The House approved a budget level in February 2011 to return spending for most agencies to FY2008 levels, separating funding for security and non-security agencies. Recent House committees have defined security to include DOD, VA, and DHS but exclude State Department/USAID. War funding is sometimes excluded from security spending data presentations. Spending data also exclude war funding (Overseas Contingency Operations) from security totals. Table 2 shows funding levels for H.R. 1473 and other proposals by House subcommittee allocations, with subtotals for \"security\" and \"non-security\" to compare funding for different purposes in various proposals. The continuing resolution enacted at the end of the 111th Congress set funding levels close to FY2010 levels until final levels could be agreed upon. H.R. 1 proposed a total of $1.026 trillion, below the FY2010 enacted level and substantially below the President's FY2011 budget request. H.R. 1473 proposes a budget level of $1.050 trillion, which is $66.5 billion below the FY2010 enacted levels. The decrease in funding is mainly seen in Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS), Labor, HHS, Education, and Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development. The decrease in CJS funding is due to the winding down of costs from the 2010 census. The FY2010 budget reflects the winding down of costs from the 2010 census. Significant cuts were made to transportation funding, including zeroing out funding for the high-speed rail grant program for FY2011. The largest spending decreases in percentage terms relative to FY2010 enacted levels would affect various program funding controlled by different subcommittees. The President's FY2011 budget request sets a benchmark for funding proposals, with H.R. 1473 proposing a $78.5 billion decrease compared to the request. H.R. 1, the FY2011 funding measure passed by the House, serves as another benchmark, with H.R. 1473 funding $28.8 billion higher. Reductions in funding are primarily in non-security areas, with increases in Agriculture, Labor/HHS, Energy & Water, Financial Services, and Interior-Environment. Defense funding remains below the President's FY2011 request in all proposals. Both H.R. 1473 and H.R. 1 propose funding above FY2010 enacted levels, with H.R. 1473 at almost $5 billion and H.R. 1 at about $7 billion. Overall funding for the Department of Defense in H.R. 1473 would be $2 billion below FY2010 enacted levels when military construction funding is taken into account. Discretionary spending controls federal government functions like running executive branch agencies and international operations. Discretionary spending funds federal programs like Medicare and Social Security, while mandatory spending has grown faster. Budget authority allows agencies to use federal funds, similar to a checking account. Outlays happen when funds are disbursed. Congress controls budget authority, which differs from outlays. Deficits are the difference between revenues and outlays. Both discretionary and mandatory spending increased in FY2009. President Obama proposed a five-year freeze in discretionary spending in his FY2012 budget submission, leading to a projected decline in discretionary spending as a proportion of the economy after FY2011. Net interest payments are expected to rise post FY2011 due to increasing interest rates during economic recovery. CBO baseline projections are used as a budgeting tool to assess how legislative changes would impact the federal deficit, not as a prediction of likely budget outcomes. CBO baseline projections are based on current law, not current policy, and assume provisions slated to expire will do so. Discretionary spending is presumed to remain constant in real terms. This leads to higher revenue growth and slower spending growth. The CBO's baseline projections show higher revenue growth and slower discretionary spending growth compared to likely scenarios. Alternative projections with more plausible assumptions are also included. Appropriation legislation may involve changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs), with cost savings or increases summarized by CBO. H.R. 1473 includes $17.5 billion in mandatory program reductions, which are estimated to have minimal impact on outlays. CHIMPs are scored differently from discretionary spending changes. The proposal aims to keep discretionary spending below a cap by offsetting increases with reductions in mandatory spending. Changes in mandatory spending act as one-time offsets to discretionary spending increases. Data on estimated outlays are crucial for calculating total budget deficits and determining the federal government's fiscal policy stance.
