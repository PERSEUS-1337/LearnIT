    "content": "The \"Rural Health Care Protection and Improvement Act of 1997\" extends the Rural Health Transition Grant Program and adjusts grant amounts for hospitals if they are used inappropriately. It also improves fairness in payments to Health Maintenance Organizations and Competitive Medical Plans. The Secretary will determine annual per capita rates of payment for individuals enrolled in eligible organizations with risk-sharing contracts under Medicare. The factors for adjusting the capitation rate will also be announced. The term 'risk-sharing contract' and 'reasonable cost reimbursement contract' are defined in this section. The annual per capita rate of payment for each payment area is determined by the Secretary, adjusted for various risk factors to ensure actuarial equivalence. The Secretary may adjust factors for actuarial equivalence in payment rates to eligible organizations. Monthly payments are made in advance based on determined rates, including separate rates for individuals with end-stage renal disease. The Secretary may retroactively adjust payment amounts based on actual enrollment numbers in the health benefit plan operated by eligible organizations. Adjustments can be made for individuals transitioning from employer-sponsored plans to the plan under this section. The Secretary may retroactively adjust payment amounts for eligible organizations based on actual enrollment numbers. Adjustments can be made for individuals transitioning to the plan under this section. Eligible organizations will be notified of proposed changes in methodology by March 1 and given an opportunity to comment. Payments to organizations with reasonable cost reimbursement contracts will be made in accordance with subsection (h)(2). Payments to eligible organizations under specific contracts will replace amounts that would otherwise be payable for services provided to enrolled individuals. The annual capitation rate for a payment area is determined based on certain criteria. The annual capitation rate for payments to eligible organizations is determined based on specific criteria, including a national percentage and budget neutrality factor adjustment. The amount is calculated based on the input-price-adjusted national capitation rate for the year. The annual capitation rate for payments to eligible organizations is determined based on specific criteria, including a national percentage and budget neutrality factor adjustment. The rate increases by the national average per capita growth percentage specified for each succeeding year. For 1998, the rate is 100 percent of the previous year's rate, and for subsequent years, it is 102 percent of the previous year's rate. The 'area-specific percentage' for 1998 is 85 percent, with the remaining 15 percent being the 'national percentage'. The capitation rate for payments is determined based on specific criteria, including area-specific and national percentages. The area-specific percentage varies each year, while the national percentage remains constant. For 1998, the area-specific percentage is 85 percent, and for subsequent years, it decreases gradually to 50 percent. The national percentage increases accordingly. The capitation rate for payments is determined based on specific criteria, including area-specific and national percentages. The national standardized capitation rate for a year is calculated by multiplying the national standardized capitation rate for the year by the proportion attributable to that type of service. The national standardized capitation rate is calculated by multiplying the area-specific capitation rate for the year by the average number of individuals entitled to benefits in that area. The Secretary applies indices used for national payment rates to determine relative input prices of services compared to national prices. The national standardized capitation rate is calculated by dividing the total average number of individuals entitled to benefits under this title who reside in all payment areas for the year. For 1998, services are divided into part A and part B, with specific proportions for each type of service. The national standardized capitation rate for services under part A and part B is adjusted by specific percentages using different indexes for hospital wage levels and geographic area factors. The Secretary determines index values based on the population entitled to benefits under section 1811(1) without end-stage renal disease. Budget neutrality adjustment factor is calculated yearly to ensure payments equal what would have been made with different percentages. The national average per capita growth percentage is determined annually by the Secretary. The Secretary estimates the projected growth in expenditures for individuals entitled to benefits under this title. Payment areas are defined as counties or states for individuals with end-stage renal disease. Eligible organizations receive payments for individuals enrolled in parts A and B. Payments to eligible organizations for individuals entitled to benefits under part A and enrolled under part B are made from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The allocation of payments is determined based on the relative weight of benefits from each fund contributing to the adjusted average per capita cost. For organizations with risk-sharing contracts, the allocation is determined annually by the Secretary. For organizations with reasonable cost reimbursement contracts, the initial allocation is based on the plan's budget and adjusted after cost settlement to reflect actual expenditures. The amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply to contracts entered into under section 1876 (42 U.S.C. 1395mm) on or after October 1, 1997. SEC. 4. IMPROVING FAIRNESS OF MEDICARE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PAYMENTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will adjust payments to healthcare providers under the Medicare fee-for-service program to reflect changes in payments to eligible organizations, ensuring fairness. The adjustments must be budget neutral. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will adjust Medicare payments to healthcare providers in a budget-neutral manner. A report outlining the methodology for these adjustments must be submitted to Congress by October 1, 1997. This change will be effective for payments made under title XVIII of the Social Security Act on and after October 1, 1997. SEC. 5. ASSURING INCREASED PAYMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AND IMPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must ensure that increased payments to eligible organizations under the Social Security Act are used to enhance healthcare services for Medicare beneficiaries or improve healthcare infrastructure. Additionally, the Secretary is required to submit a detailed report to Congress annually on the actions taken and outcomes achieved."
