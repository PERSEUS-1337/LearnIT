    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ocean and Coastal Observation System Act of 2005\". Congress finds that ocean and coastal observations are crucial for protecting lives and property, predicting weather, and ensuring the health of oceans and coasts. Strengthened observation systems are needed to detect and warn of tsunamis, hurricanes, and other hazards to coastal regions. The US coastline, including the Great Lakes, is essential for the nation's prosperity. The US coastline, including the Great Lakes, is vital to the nation's prosperity, contributing over $117 billion to the economy in 2000 and supporting jobs for more than 200 million Americans. Improved monitoring of waters and coastline is necessary for managing coastal hazards and fisheries. Advances in sensing technologies allow for continuous observation of ocean and coastal conditions. The Commission on Ocean Policy recommends a national commitment to a sustained and integrated ocean and coastal observing system to improve weather forecasts, manage resources, and mitigate marine hazards. The US led nations in affirming the importance of global observations for decision-making in 2003. The Commission on Ocean Policy recommends a national commitment to a sustained and integrated ocean and coastal observing system for improved decision-making. The Act aims to develop and maintain an integrated ocean and coastal observing system to support healthy marine ecosystems, advance scientific understanding, and enhance science education. The Act aims to implement research, education, and outreach programs to improve understanding of the oceans and Great Lakes, establish a data management system for an integrated ocean observing system, and create regional observing systems to address local ocean information needs. The Act establishes definitions for key terms such as \"Council,\" \"observing system,\" and \"interagency program office\" in Section 3. Section 4 focuses on the establishment of an integrated ocean and coastal observing system. The President, through the Council, will establish an integrated system for ocean and coastal observations to detect and predict changes impacting the nation's social, economic, and ecological systems. This system aims to improve coastal and ocean health, protect lives from hazards like tsunamis and hurricanes, and understand the effects of human activities. The integrated system for ocean and coastal observations aims to understand the effects of human activities and natural variability on coastal and ocean health, support sustainable use and protection of resources, provide information for ecosystem-based management, assist marine-related businesses, and enhance research and development for continuous improvement of observation measurements. The observing system includes a national program, regional associations, data management system, research program, and outreach program. The Council oversees the design and implementation of the observing system, adopts plans and standards developed by the interagency program office, and coordinates with other earth programs. The Council coordinates with other earth observing activities, administers research programs, establishes pilot projects for technology development, supports international delegations, and coordinates Federal activities with other nations. The Council establishes an interagency program office called \"OceanUS\" to plan and coordinate the observing system, prepare annual and long-term plans for system design, promote collaboration among Federal agencies and regional associations, and coordinate agency priorities and budgets for system implementation. The Council establishes an interagency program office called \"OceanUS\" to plan and coordinate the observing system, prepare annual and long-term plans for system design, promote collaboration among Federal agencies and regional associations, and coordinate agency priorities and budgets for system implementation. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will be the lead Federal agency for implementing and operating the observing system, including establishing standards, certification processes for regional associations, external technical committee reviews, and opportunities for partnerships with private sector companies. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will coordinate the implementation, operation, and improvement of the observing system, establish administrative procedures for fund allocation, implement and maintain system elements, facilitate the transition of scientific advancements to operational deployment, integrate existing programs into the observation system, and certify regional associations meeting requirements. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration may certify regional associations to develop and operate ocean and coastal observing systems, integrating various data centers for data assimilation and management. Regional associations must meet national standards and user group information needs. The Administrator certifies regional associations to operate ocean and coastal observing systems. Regional associations must have an organizational structure, strategic plan, provide information products, collaborate with governmental entities, and meet certification standards. The Act authorizes regional associations to operate ocean and coastal observing systems, but prohibits them from engaging in lobbying activities. Any regional system certified under this Act is considered part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for liability purposes. SEC. 5. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND EDUCATION. The Council will establish programs for research, development, education, and outreach for the ocean and coastal observing system. This includes basic and focused research projects, large-scale computing resources, and public education efforts to improve understanding of ocean and coastal processes and their relationship to human activities. The Council integrates ongoing activities such as the National Sea Grant College Program, Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence, and the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. The Council allows departments and agencies to share and transfer funds for projects related to the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. The Act does not override the Secretary of the Interior's authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Authorization of appropriations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration totaling $150,000,000 annually from 2006 to 2010 for ocean and coastal observing systems and research programs. At least 50% of funds for observing systems to be allocated to regional associations. Reporting requirement is also mandated. The President must submit a report to Congress by March 31, 2010, detailing the programs established under sections 4 and 5. The report should include activities, effectiveness evaluation, and recommendations for reauthorization and funding levels for future fiscal years."
