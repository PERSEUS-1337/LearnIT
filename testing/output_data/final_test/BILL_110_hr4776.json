    "content": "The Act titled \"Consumer Protection Home Inspection Counseling Act of 2007\" establishes a program to train counselors to provide voluntary home inspection counseling to consumers. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will establish a program to train staff, contractors, and entities providing housing counseling to also offer voluntary home inspection counseling to consumers. The training materials will be in plain language and easily understood by consumers. The program established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will provide training and counseling on voluntary home inspections. Key points include the voluntary nature of home inspections, the recommendation to obtain one, the lack of requirement for FHA loans, the need for the homebuyer to request an inspection, and the distinction between appraisals and inspections. The program established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development provides training and counseling on voluntary home inspections. Homebuyers are advised to consider obtaining a home inspection early on, as it is beneficial. It is emphasized that an appraisal is different from a home inspection, and homebuyers may request a voluntary inspection. Individuals providing housing counseling must present HUD Form 92564-CN, \"For Your Protection: Get a Home Inspection,\" to homebuyers during counseling sessions. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will develop additional guidance materials in consultation with professional home inspector associations to educate housing counselors on how to advise consumers in selecting a professional home inspector. These materials will be required for counselors providing housing counseling under specific programs. The Secretary will develop a new protocol to certify housing counselors under the Housing and Urban Development Act. Standards for counseling materials will be established, and requirements for home inspection counseling will be implemented. The Housing and Urban Development Act will require housing counselors to undergo training in home inspection counseling and distribute counseling aids. Only certified organizations or counselors can provide homeownership counseling for HUD programs. The Secretary has the authority to revoke certifications for non-compliance. Public outreach efforts will also be implemented. The Secretary will promote the training module and counseling aids developed under the Housing and Urban Development Act to various organizations and the general public through public outreach activities, including plain-language statements, multimedia public service announcements, and advisory statements. The materials will be made available electronically and through other means. The Secretary will promote the training module and counseling aids developed under the Housing and Urban Development Act through public outreach activities, including advisory statements to mortgage lenders and a toll-free telephone number for information on home inspection counseling. Public outreach targets real estate professionals, housing counseling authorities, nonprofit organizations, employers, community-based organizations, and high school guidance counselors, with an emphasis on reaching vulnerable populations. The Secretary will focus on reaching vulnerable populations, including first-time and low-income homebuyers, through public outreach activities. SEC. 6. REPORT. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 12 months of this Act's enactment, detailing compliance actions, unaddressed requirements, achieved results, areas for improvement, and recommendations for better implementation."
