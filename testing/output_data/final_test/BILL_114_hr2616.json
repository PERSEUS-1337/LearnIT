    "content": "The Urban Flooding Awareness Act of 2015 may be cited as the \"Urban Flooding Awareness Act\". Urban flooding is defined in the Act. The Urban Flooding Awareness Act of 2015 defines urban flooding as the inundation of property in densely populated areas due to rain overwhelming drainage systems. It includes stormwater entering buildings, water backup through sewer pipes, seepage through walls, accumulation of water on property, and overflow from water bodies. Urban flooding excludes flooding in undeveloped or agricultural areas. The primary focus of the study under the Urban Flooding Awareness Act of 2015 is on urban areas outside of special flood hazard areas, excluding flooding in undeveloped or agricultural areas. The Urban Flooding Study focuses on urban areas outside of special flood hazard areas, excluding undeveloped or agricultural areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on urban flooding. The study will review research, laws, regulations, and costs associated with urban flooding events in major metropolitan areas across the United States. The study on urban flooding will focus on the frequency and severity of flooding in major metropolitan areas over the past 2 decades, the adequacy of federally provided flood risk information, cost-effective methods to identify property damage risk, causes of urban flooding, and potential training for local experts in flood risk characterization. The study on urban flooding will examine the increase in flooding over the past 20 years due to global climate change, urbanization, and deteriorating stormwater infrastructure. It will focus on cost-effective strategies like nonstructural and natural infrastructure to reduce flooding impacts. Assessment of opportunities for implementing innovative strategies and practices on government-controlled land, including roads, parking lots, buildings, and recreational areas. The role of Federal and State governments in spurring market innovations through public-private partnerships, such as smart home technologies for flood warning systems. Sustainable methods for funding flood risk and damage reduction. Sustainable funding strategies for flood risk reduction include establishing State revolving fund programs, stormwater fee programs, grant programs, and public-private partnerships. Information and education strategies are also emphasized. Information and education strategies, including nontraditional approaches like community colleges and social media, are important for educating community leaders, government staff, and property owners on flood risks, reduction strategies, and flood insurance policies. The relevance of the National Flood Insurance Program and Community Rating System to urban flooding areas outside traditional flood plains, along with strategies for improving compliance and increasing participation, are also crucial. Strategies for protecting downstream communities from flooding impacts of development in upstream areas, including watershed-wide flood protection planning and legal options. Cost-effective methods to reduce infiltration/inflow into sewer systems and enhance coordination in stormwater management programs at the federal level. The curr_chunk discusses stormwater management and flood risk mitigation programming under various laws, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act. The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency is required to consult with multiple agencies in carrying out these programs. The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must consult with various agencies, including the Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Small Business Administration, for stormwater management and flood risk mitigation programs. Federal agencies are required to cooperate with the Administrator, and a report to Congress is due by December 31, 2016. The Senate committees will report findings from the National Academy of Sciences on urban flooding, with recommendations for strategies and technologies to Congress and the executive branch."
