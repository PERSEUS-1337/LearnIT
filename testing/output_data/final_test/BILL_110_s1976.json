    "content": "Chapter 4 of subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended by adding a new section on organic conversion. The National Organic Program, established under the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990, defines terms like 'national organic program' and 'organic system plan'. The Secretary is required to establish a program providing cost-share and incentive payments to producers for conservation practices during the conversion to organic production within 180 days of enactment. The Secretary will provide organic conversion cost-share and incentive payments to producers transitioning to organic production systems, including land and livestock not previously certified organic. Producers can use the funds for conservation practices during the conversion process. The Secretary will provide organic conversion cost-share and incentive payments to producers transitioning to organic production systems. This includes conservation practices required by an approved organic system plan to protect natural resources and animal welfare measures. Producers must agree to develop and carry out these activities to be eligible for payments. Producers transitioning to organic production systems can receive technical assistance for conservation practices and activities that protect natural resources. They must also submit annual verification by a certifying entity. Producers seeking organic certification must submit annual verification by an accredited certifying entity. Contracts under this section have a maximum term of 4 years, with limitations on payments not exceeding $20,000 per year or $80,000 in total. The Secretary can terminate contracts if producers are not pursuing organic certification. New contracts won't be entered into if there is insufficient market demand for a specific agricultural commodity. Certified organic producers can petition to suspend assistance for that commodity. The Secretary may suspend assistance for a commodity if there is insufficient market demand for increased organic production and producers would be adversely affected. At least 50 percent of funds for technical and educational assistance should be allocated under this section. The Secretary may allocate funds for technical and educational assistance to support organic producers in conservation practices, marketing, and product planning. Assistance may be suspended if market demand for increased organic production is lacking."
