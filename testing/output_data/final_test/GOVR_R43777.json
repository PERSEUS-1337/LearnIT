    "content": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provides scientific information to understand the Earth, manage resources, and enhance quality of life. It is part of the Department of the Interior (DOI) and collaborates with other agencies to manage land and wildlife resources. The USGS conducts domestic and international scientific activities to improve government effectiveness, address foreign policy, and enhance U.S. competitiveness in the global economy. The USGS conducts scientific activities in various mission areas to enhance U.S. competitiveness in the global economy. Researchers from different fields collaborate with federal, state, and local agencies to conduct research and data collection. The USGS conducts scientific studies that impact areas of congressional interest, such as oil, gas, and mineral resource assessments for federal land use policy evaluation. They also collect data on large-scale ecosystems and water resources to assist decision makers at all levels of government. The agency does not have regulatory authority but collaborates with various agencies for research and data collection. The USGS conducts scientific studies on water quality and quantity to assist decision makers at all levels of government. Congress has oversight of the USGS and questions its expanded role in areas like ecosystem science and coastal stewardship. Some believe the agency should focus more on its original mission of classifying public lands and examining geologic structures and mineral resources. The USGS is praised for its broad scientific research areas, including energy, water resources, and climate change. Congress has expanded the agency's authority over the years, leading to a diversified mission. Recent interest in the USGS's scope and evolution since its inception is driving discussions on its current structure and funding. The USGS was officially created in 1879, with roots dating back to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Mapping and surveying land became a priority for the federal government due to territorial acquisitions. State and federal geological surveys also played a role in the USGS's creation, driven by interests in mining and natural resource development. The USGS was established in 1879 following recommendations for surveying the country's geological and topographical aspects. The USGS Organic Act authorized its creation to study the geological structure and economic resources of the United States, focusing on classifying public lands and examining mineral resources. The USGS Organic Act established the authority of the Director of the USGS to oversee the surveying of geological structure, mineral resources, and products of the national domain. The Act prohibits personal interests in surveyed lands and mineral wealth, and does not specifically address water resources, ecosystem resources, natural hazards, and climate change. The first Director of the USGS, Clarence King, broadened the agency's mission to include classifying public domain lands and expanding beyond a western focus. He also established a mining geology program to collect mineral statistics in the western states. Subsequent actions shaped the interpretation and application of the USGS Organic Act. The USGS's scope and authorities were shaped by subsequent actions of its directors and Congress, expanding through administrative decisions and laws. Under Director John Wesley Powell, the agency broadened its work to include topographical mapping, paleontological and stratigraphic studies. Budget cuts in the early 1890s led to a temporary shift away from topography. The USGS expanded its role under Director Charles Walcott in the late 1800s to aid various industries in the application of geology. This included involvement in water resources through the deployment of streamgages. Congress also passed laws amending the Organic Act to allow the USGS to work with other entities and authorized specific projects that later became program areas within the USGS. The USGS began studying water resources in 1888 with congressional authorization to assess irrigation needs in arid regions, identify areas for water storage, measure streamflow, and designate sites for reservoirs and canals. Ecosystem studies were incorporated into the USGS mission in 1996, with biological research functions consolidated into the National Biological Survey in 1994. The National Biological Survey (NBS) was established as an independent science agency to conduct research insulated from political pressures within DOI agencies. Scientists from DOI agencies, mainly from the Fish and Wildlife Service, were transferred to NBS to reduce overlap of research. In 1996, NBS was moved into the USGS and named the Biological Resources Division (BRD) to promote independent scientific research. The BRD focused on wildlife resources, fisheries, and fish propagation. The Biological Resources Division (BRD) of the Department focuses on fisheries, fish propagation, aquatic resources, and disease impacts on wildlife populations. It was reorganized in 2011 as part of the Ecosystem program area, maintaining independent scientific research. USGS activities have expanded in response to global events, including searching for strategic minerals during world wars and assessing geological structures of oil and gas fields in the 1920s. The USGS expanded its scientific work beyond U.S. borders, with international activities authorized by the Secretary of the Interior. This included establishing the USGS Center for Earthquake Research in Menlo Park, CA, after a 9.2 magnitude earthquake in Alaska in 1964. The agency's scope of work also involved addressing global issues like climate variation and providing expertise on petroleum and mineral resources. The USGS has expanded its scientific work internationally, focusing on climate variation, petroleum, and mineral resources. Despite its increased scope, the agency has shed some responsibilities, leading to the formation of separate federal agencies like the U.S. Bureau of Mines and the U.S. Forest Service. The USGS underwent organizational changes in the 20th and 21st centuries, leading to the formation of separate agencies like the Minerals Management Service and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. In 2011, the USGS reorganized its science programs into interdisciplinary areas aligned with its strategic plan, focusing on Ecosystems, Climate Variability, Energy and Minerals, Environmental Health, Natural Hazards, Water Resources, and Data Integration. The USGS underwent organizational changes in the 20th and 21st centuries, leading to the formation of separate agencies like the Minerals Management Service and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. In 2011, the USGS reorganized its science programs into interdisciplinary areas aligned with its strategic plan, focusing on Ecosystems, Climate Variability, Energy and Minerals, Environmental Health, Natural Hazards, Water Resources, and Data Integration. The realignment of program areas aimed to reduce barriers in budget and management structures hindering interdisciplinary problem-solving, promote collaboration within the USGS, and increase collaboration across geographic boundaries. Under the USGS's mission areas, scientists investigate ecological and geological processes affecting ecosystems like the Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes. Water Resources involve collecting and analyzing hydrological data. The USGS's Water Resources program focuses on collecting, assessing, and disseminating hydrological data for water conservation. It includes the National Streamflow Information and Cooperative Water sub-programs that fund streamgages nationwide. The Climate and Land Use Change mission area provides science on the impact of climate and land use changes on natural resources in the United States, covering sectors like climate research, carbon sequestration, and land remote sensing. The Land Use Change subprogram allows users to access Earth observation imagery from satellites to study the effects of land use, climate, energy, and mineral resources on the environment. The Energy and Minerals mission area focuses on research and assessments of the nation's mineral and energy resources, including how they impact landscape, water, climate, ecosystems, and human health. The Environmental Health mission area examines the relationship between environmental and human health, with sub-programs on contaminant biology and toxic substances hydrology. The Core Science Systems program provides data in a geospatial framework for managing resources and planning for natural hazards. Science Support includes funding for administrative activities. The mission area studies interactions between ecological and geological processes, contaminants, and pathogens. Examples include studying the effects of toxic chemicals on fish reproduction and insecticides on honeybee die-offs. Natural Hazards mission area provides scientific information to address and mitigate effects of natural hazards like volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, storm surges, and landslides. Coastal and Marine Geology sub-program addresses coastal effects of natural hazards and rising sea levels on ecosystems and communities. The FY2015 budget request for the USGS was $1.073 billion, which was $41.3 million more than the FY2014 enacted level of $1.032 billion. The House Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Committee reported an Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for FY2015, with the USGS receiving $1.036 billion under this reported bill. This amount was approximately $3.7 million over the FY2014 enacted amount and $37.6 million less than the Administration's request. The Administration requested increases for all USGS programs in FY2015, except for Science Support and Natural Hazards. Ecosystems program saw a $10.8 million increase, with $4.0 million for Invasive Species. Climate Variability had an $18.4 million increase, including $11.6 million for Climate Science Centers. USGS implements the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center and DOI Climate Science Centers for regional research on global change data. The Climate Science Centers (CSCs) aim to evaluate global climate change models at appropriate scales for research managers and facilitate data integration and outreach to collaborators and stakeholders. The Administration proposed using the centers for adaptation planning on issues like sea level rise and drought, working with tribal communities, and creating a system for adaptation coordination among agencies. The House reported bill proposed small increases or flat funding for USGS programs, except for Core Science Systems and Science Support which would see decreases. The largest difference between the House reported bill and the Administration's request was for the Climate Variability sub-program, with a $18.4 million increase requested by the Administration. The request for the Climate Variability sub-program is $18.4 million above the FY2014 level. USGS appropriations have historically risen significantly after WWII and in the 1990s, but have not reached peak funding levels. Some in Congress believe the USGS has expanded its mission beyond geology and resources, potentially diverting funding from traditional endeavors like assessing energy supplies. The USGS has expanded its scope and mission over time, including the creation of the Ecosystems Program Area in 2011. Critics argue that ecosystem research should not be a focus of USGS, suggesting that other agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service should handle it. The USGS, as the primary scientific agency within DOI, has evolved to focus on ecosystem-level studies related to restoration, habitat assessment, and species survival. Some argue that these responsibilities should remain with USGS, as it conducts science in support of natural resource management rather than managing natural resources like other DOI agencies. However, there are concerns that the expanding scientific expertise and programs within other DOI agencies may be eroding USGS's role as the scientific agency of DOI. The Administration is proposing to increase funding for the Science Support program under FWS in FY2015. This could potentially challenge USGS's role as the primary scientific agency within DOI. USGS addresses the issue of balance among its program areas through a Science Strategy created approximately every 10 years, with the latest one from 2007. The USGS creates a Science Strategy every 10 years to guide its scientific efforts, with the latest one from 2007. This strategy led to the reorganization of USGS into interdisciplinary program areas in 2011. The agency's broad authority allows for a wide range of scientific activities addressing national issues, even in nontraditional subject areas. Congressional authorizations for USGS activities can determine if the agency is overreaching its authorities. The USGS conducts activities authorized by law and also initiatives initiated by the Director or Secretary of the Interior. For example, they participate in the DOI Powering Our Future Initiative by supporting alternative energy permitting and assessing wind energy impacts. The USGS maintains over 8,000 streamgages nationwide to monitor water flow and quality, aiding in managing water supplies, assessing flooding or drought events, and informing water quality decisions. The USGS maintains over 8,000 streamgages nationwide funded through various programs to monitor water flow and quality, aid in managing water supplies, assessing flooding or drought events, and providing data for treaty requirements. The National Streamflow Information Program (NSIP) and Cooperative Water Program (CWP) fund streamgages through partnerships with federal, state, local, and tribal agencies. The USGS faces challenges in funding streamgages, with some being proposed for discontinuation each year. Stakeholders often petition for continued funding. There is a debate on resource allocation between the NSIP and Cooperative Water Program streamgage networks. The Administration has requested an increase for NSIP but a decrease for the Cooperative Water Program in FY2015, indicating a potential shift in funding priorities. The USGS is facing challenges in funding streamgages, with some being proposed for discontinuation each year due to lack of funds from stakeholders. There is a debate on resource allocation between the NSIP and Cooperative Water Program streamgage networks. Landsat satellites provide valuable data for various fields such as agriculture, geology, forestry, and emergency response. Landsat is a joint initiative between USGS and NASA, with Landsat 8 being the latest satellite launched in 2013. NASA develops and launches the satellite, while USGS manages data distribution. Landsat data has been collected since 1972 and is available for download at no cost. The Landsat program consists of two satellites, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8, orbiting the Earth at 438 miles altitude. They provide imagery data to track changes in the Earth's land surface, with Landsat 7 capturing various radiation bands and Landsat 8 carrying improved instruments for observation. These satellites offer continuous monitoring of the Earth's surface. The Landsat program offers continuous monitoring of the Earth's land surface through two satellites, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8, equipped with various instruments including a thermal infrared sensor. Users can identify land-cover changes over 40 years, from slow and subtle changes like river courses to rapid events like volcanic eruptions. The long-term comparability of observations is a key value of the program, along with the no-cost data policy. However, there are ongoing discussions about privatizing or commercializing Earth observing satellite data, raising questions about the future of Landsat that may be of interest to Congress. The value of Landsat imagery to its user community is a key consideration for Congress, weighing the cost and effort of satellite design, launch, and operation. Questions arise about the availability of similar remote sensing data from other countries' satellites and the advantages and disadvantages of acquiring data from them versus a U.S.-built satellite. The discussion also includes evaluating the unique 40+ years of continuous observations from Landsat and the consequences of terminating this long-term record. Several natural disasters in the United States have sparked congressional interest in understanding and mitigating their effects. The Stafford Act and other statutes authorize federal agencies like the USGS to issue warnings on geologic hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides. The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) allows the USGS to improve earthquake understanding and assess national risks through seismic hazard maps for building codes and other applications. The USGS, under its Natural Hazards Program, addresses various natural hazards such as volcano, landslide, flood, drought, and wildfire hazards. These activities are authorized by the Organic Act, which directs the Survey to examine geological structure. While some hazards have a clear link to geological causes, others like floods, droughts, and wildfires may be less apparent. Ultimately, the motion of tectonic plates shapes the modern arrangement of continents and oceans, influencing weather patterns. The USGS is responsible for studying natural hazards like volcanoes, earthquakes, and floods. They manage the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and monitor earthquake and volcano hazards globally through the Global Seismic Network. The USGS works with the International Monitoring System to ensure compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. They funded the Worldwide Standardized Seismographic Network in the 1960s for research and treaty monitoring. Advances in global seismology emerged from monitoring underground nuclear explosions during the Cold War. The USGS also deals with induced seismicity linked to deep-well injection of wastewaters from oil and gas operations. The number of disposal wells has increased due to unconventional wells like shale gas. The USGS has faced challenges in evaluating earthquake hazards posed by induced seismicity from unconventional wells like shale gas and oil. Some Members of Congress and stakeholders have suggested expanding USGS's role in natural hazards. Improved technology and understanding of geological processes have helped mitigate negative impacts of natural hazards. The Administration is urged to provide funds for an Early Earthquake Warning System on the West Coast. This system could offer advance warning by detecting seismic waves and transmitting intensity and arrival time information. Implementation may be costly but could mitigate severe damage and save lives. The USGS is working on hazard mitigation initiatives to understand coastal processes and assess vulnerability to extreme coastal storms. Improved methods may predict beach changes post-storm and aid in managing coastal infrastructure. Studies like the one on Fire Island National Seashore after Superstorm Sandy show potential impacts on sandy beach communities, providing valuable information for community planners and emergency response authorities.
