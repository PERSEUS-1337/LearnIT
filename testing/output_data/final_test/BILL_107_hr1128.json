    "content": "The Act titled \"Health Care Paperwork Reduction and Fraud Prevention Act of 2001\" aims to simplify billing codes and forms through the establishment of a National Bipartisan Commission. The Commission on Billing Codes and Forms Simplification, established by the Health Care Paperwork Reduction and Fraud Prevention Act of 2001, is tasked with recommending standardized forms, reducing billing codes, and reforming regulatory and appeals processes in healthcare billing. The Commission on Billing Codes and Forms Simplification, established by the Health Care Paperwork Reduction and Fraud Prevention Act of 2001, consists of 17 members appointed by the President, Senate Majority Leader, Senate Minority Leader, Speaker of the House, and House Minority Leader. Their goal is to assist ambulance providers in submitting claims correctly under the Medicare program and prevent targeting of inadvertent billing errors. The Commission on Billing Codes and Forms Simplification, established by the Health Care Paperwork Reduction and Fraud Prevention Act of 2001, consists of 17 members appointed by various political leaders. The Commission must appoint members within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Provisions from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 apply to the Commission, and they must submit a report by December 31, 2001. The Commission on Billing Codes and Forms Simplification, established by the Health Care Paperwork Reduction and Fraud Prevention Act of 2001, must submit a report to the President and Congress by December 31, 2001. The report will only include recommendations, findings, and conclusions approved by at least 11 members of the Commission. The Commission will terminate 30 days after submitting the report. SEC. 3. EDUCATION OF PHYSICIANS AND PROVIDERS ON MEDICARE PAYMENTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a process for physicians to request assistance with questionable codes and procedures under the Medicare program. The carrier must respond within 30 business days with the correct billing or procedural answer. Written statements can be used as proof in future audits, except for cases of fraudulent billing. The Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration will restore a toll-free hotline for physicians to inquire about the Medicare program. Definitions for \"physician\" and \"carrier\" are provided in the section. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned. Policy development for E&M guidelines under the Medicare program is addressed in Section 4. HCFA must follow specific steps before implementing new evaluation and management guidelines for the Medicare program, including physician assessment, establishing improvement goals, conducting pilot projects, and ensuring objectives are met. Pilot projects must be of sufficient length and involve consultation. The pilot projects under this subsection must be conducted in consultation with medical societies and focus on peer review methods by physicians evaluating medical record information for statistical outlier services relative to CPT guidelines. The pilot projects will examine the impact of E&M guidelines on different physician practices and the costs of compliance, patient, and physician satisfaction. HCFA will report to relevant committees on the extent to which the pilot projects met their objectives. The objectives for E&M guidelines include enhancing documentation accuracy, reducing administrative burdens, decreasing non-clinical documentation, increasing reviewer accuracy, educating physicians and staff, promoting appropriate E&M code use, and adhering to CPT coding rules. Definitions for this section and related sections include:\n- Physician: as defined in section 1861(r) of the Social Security Act\n- Carrier: a carrier with a contract under title XVIII of the Social Security Act to administer benefits under part B\n- Secretary: the Secretary of Health and Human Services\n- HCFA: the Health Care Financing Administration\n- Medicare program: the program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act SEC. 5. Overpayments under the Medicare program. If a carrier conducts a post-payment audit of a physician under Medicare, they must provide the physician with personalized notice of billing issues within 3 months. The notice should offer suggestions for resolving the problems. Physicians are allowed to repay Medicare overpayments within 3 months without penalties or interest. If a physician identifies an overpayment before being notified by the carrier, they can reimburse Medicare without penalty and cannot be audited or targeted based on this. If a physician's Medicare billing error is a first-time error and they have not been previously audited, the carrier cannot assess fines through extrapolation unless a fraudulent claim is submitted. The carrier must inform the physician of potential claim problems within one year before using extrapolation for reimbursement or penalties. Physicians can dispute charges by submitting additional information and documentation. After a post-payment audit, a carrier conducting a pre-payment screen on a physician service under Medicare cannot delay reimbursements for more than one month. Once the physician submits a corrected claim, the carrier must remove the pre-payment screen. Enforcement provisions under the Medicare program state that inspectors cannot enter a physician's office with a gun or deadly weapon for arrest without a valid warrant, unless the physician is fleeing or deemed dangerous."
