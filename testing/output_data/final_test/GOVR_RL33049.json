This represents a 4% increase from FY2005 and includes $21.3 billion for Border and Transportation Security agencies, a 5% increase from FY2005. The House passed H.R. 2360 with a net appropriation of $31.9 billion for DHS, including $30.8 billion in discretionary budget authority. This represents a 4% increase from FY2005 and includes $21 billion for Border and Transportation Security agencies, a 3.4% increase from FY2005. President's FY2006 budget request proposed $30.6 billion for DHS, a 7.7% increase from FY2004 funding. Increasing border and transportation security are crucial for homeland security. Border security involves regulating the flow of goods and people across borders to detect and prevent entry of dangerous individuals or items. Transportation security involves screening and protecting people and goods within the country. The requested $19.6 billion for BTS agencies in FY2006 represents a 3.4% decrease from the enacted FY2005 amount of $20.3 billion. Border management in the United States involves sophisticated systems to determine entry permissions for goods and people while balancing security needs with facilitating commerce and travel. Transportation security has expanded federal screening roles in airports and plans to increase federal presence in other modes of transportation. These systems aim to function efficiently without disrupting legitimate activities. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel of 22 agencies to the Department of Homeland Security, organized into four major directorates. The BTS Directorate, along with the U.S. Coast Guard, is responsible for defense against terrorism, securing borders, and managing immigration operations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for coordinating entry into the United States, enforcing immigration laws, and securing borders and transportation systems. This includes TSA's expanded role in protecting transportation systems and Customs functions previously under the Department of the Treasury. DHS, along with the U.S. Coast Guard, ensures the security of commercial traffic entering ports and inspects plants and animals to prevent the introduction of pests and diseases. The activities fall under three bureaus: Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and others. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversees three bureaus: Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Transportation Security Agency (TSA). Functions from legacy agencies were merged into CBP and ICE, while other agencies like Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) and US-VISIT program have been transferred between departments. The Coast Guard remains under direct DHS oversight. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) underwent a Second Stage Review (2SR) in 2005, resulting in proposed changes to increase overall preparedness, enhance transportation security, strengthen border security, improve information sharing, and realign the organization for better mission performance. The DHS announced new policy initiatives on July 13, including the proposed elimination of the BTS Directorate and the creation of a new Directorate of Policy. The operational agencies within BTS would report directly to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of DHS to streamline policy creation and ensure consistency. Immediate policy changes include transitioning the US-VISIT program to a 10-print fingerprinting standard and moving the Federal Air Marshals program out of ICE. The DHS announced new policy initiatives on July 13, including transitioning the US-VISIT program to a 10-print standard and moving the Federal Air Marshals program out of ICE. The Secretary mentioned restructuring the immigration process and introducing more personnel and technology for border control. A new initiative called \"Secure Freight\" was also introduced to enhance cargo and supply chain security. The DHS announced new policy initiatives on July 13, including transitioning the US-VISIT program to a 10-print standard and moving the Federal Air Marshals program out of ICE. Secretary Chertoff called for increasing inspections at foreign ports, speeding up cargo inspections, and deploying radiation portal monitors. A revised budget request for DHS reflected organizational changes, including the elimination of the Office of the Under Secretary for BTS. On March 1, 2003, responsibilities and funds were shifted to the new Department of Homeland Security. Challenges arose in determining the exact amount of appropriated funds transferred due to the transition from predecessor agencies. The funding lines between FY2003 and FY2004 were not identical to lines of functional responsibility before and after the transfer to the Department of Homeland Security. With the completion of appropriations for FY2004, a baseline has been established for future appropriations decisions. The just announced reorganization of the department may impact next year's appropriations cycle. The report analyzes functional classification for \"border and transportation security,\" including activities of the Coast Guard and excludes certain functions related to security improvement in other DHS accounts. Grant programs for localities are also excluded. The report excludes grant programs for localities and focuses on the costs for border and transportation security functions within DHS. The Administration's FY2006 request groups various agencies under Title II Security for border and transportation security. The report focuses on appropriations for border and transportation security functions within DHS, excluding grant programs for localities. The Administration's FY2006 request includes agencies like US-VISIT, CBP, ICE, TSA, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Secret Service under Title II Security. The requested amount for DHS in FY2005 is $30.6 billion, with $19.6 billion allocated for BTS functions. The FY2006 budget request for border and transportation security agencies is broken down as follows: USCG accounts for 40.6%, CBP for 28.5%, ICE for 18.6%, TSA for 8.4%, SCO for 2.7%, and FLETC for 1.1%. TSA's net budget authority would be $3,321 million, or 16% of DHS total requested budget authority for FY2006 without the fee increase proposal. The FY2006 budget request for border and transportation security agencies shows the allocation of funds for various agencies. USCG accounts for 40.6%, CBP for 28.5%, ICE for 18.6%, TSA for 8.4%, SCO for 2.7%, and FLETC for 1.1%. TSA's net budget authority would be $3,321 million, or 16% of DHS total requested budget authority for FY2006. The FY2006 budget allocation for border and transportation security agencies includes funds for various programs. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2360 differ in their funding for US-VISIT, FAST, and NEXUS/SENTRI programs. The Senate does not create a new Automation Modernization Office and leaves programs in their current locations. The need for additional funding in border and transportation security is highlighted, with Congress facing the challenge of determining the appropriate funding level amidst competing resource claims. The report details operational components, including appropriations data, issues of interest, and challenges faced. Securing borders and transportation systems involves regulating imports/exports, enforcing immigration laws, inspecting agriculture/livestock, overseeing port security, and inspecting airline passengers/baggage. Achieving operational control is a key objective. The discussion focuses on securing borders and transportation systems, including regulating imports/exports, enforcing immigration laws, overseeing port security, and inspecting airline passengers and baggage. The exclusion of USCIS from the discussion is justified to avoid distorting the true costs of border and transportation security. The report focuses on the enforcement of immigration laws and provides account level details for various border and transportation agencies. DHS is proposing to create a new office combining several programs, but the House Appropriation Committee denies its creation. The House Appropriation Committee denies the creation of the SCO, but H.R. 2360 moves FAST and NEXUS/SENTRI from CBP to the BTS management level. USVISIT is combined with these programs in a new Automation Modernization office. TSA programs proposed for transfer to SCO would remain in TSA under H.R. 2360. The Senate-reported version also denies the creation of the SCO and leaves funding for FAST and NEXUS/SENTRI in CBP. Fees for programs like TWIC and HAZMAT remain in TSA. Funding includes $124 million from P.L.109-13 and a $63 million rescission in P.L.108-11. The Supplemental Appropriations Act includes rescissions and supplemental funding for various programs within CBP and TSA. DHS is proposing to transfer the Research and Development account from TSA to the Directorate of S&T. Aviation Security Capital Fund is used for installing Explosive Detection Systems. In FY2006, DHS proposes a $3 increase in the passenger security fee for flights, generating $1.56 billion in new revenue. There is a discrepancy between the Administration's budget documents and the committee tables regarding aviation security fee offset amounts. The House Appropriations Committee did not approve the proposed fee increase and recommends an offset of $1.99 billion, with a net appropriation of $3.26 billion for TSA. In FY2006, DHS proposes a $3 increase in the passenger security fee for flights, generating $1.56 billion in new revenue. The House Appropriations Committee recommends a net appropriation of $3.26 billion for TSA, including supplemental funding and proposed transfers within DHS. The Administration's FY2006 request for the Security Coordination Office (SCO) includes $846 million in gross budget authority. This funding covers various programs such as US-VISIT, Secure Flight, TWIC, Registered Traveler, HAZMAT checks, and Alien Flight School background checks. Additionally, SCO will oversee fee-funded activities including TWIC, Registered Traveler, HAZMAT checks, and Alien Flight School. The House and Senate both deny the creation of the Security Coordination Office (SCO) and instead propose funding for various transportation vetting and credentialing programs within TSA and CBP. The requested appropriation for SCO is $525 million, but the committees require a broader justification for its establishment. The Senate version of the bill would leave funding for FAST and NEXUS/SENTRI programs within CBP. The Senate-reported version would keep funding for the FAST and NEXUS/SENTRI programs within CBP instead of creating a new BTS Automation Modernization office. The House and Senate versions of the bill would leave funding for TSA programs within TSA. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2360 did not approve the proposed SCO, unlike the House. The Senate does not create a new Automation Modernization Office and leaves programs like FAST and NEXUS/SENTRI in CBP. The proposal for the SCO stems from Homeland Security Presidential Directive 11 (HSPD-11) in response to 9/11 recommendations. The goal of the SCO is to enhance screening policies by leveraging unique aspects of screening programs. Both House and Senate appropriators have discussed these issues. The proposed SCO, directed by the new credentialing office within the SCO, faces challenges in operational aspects and coordination with other agencies. Uncertainty remains about which functions should remain at the agency level and which could be transferred to the SCO. Coordination with other agencies in the BTS Directorate is identified as a key challenge. The proposed SCO, directed by the new credentialing office within the SCO, faces challenges in operational aspects and coordination with other agencies. Challenges include defining interrelationships and commonalities among programs proposed for transfer, delineating roles and responsibilities, and addressing existing issues with programs like Secure Flight and TWIC. CBP's primary mission post-9/11 is to prevent entry of terrorists and terrorism instruments, inspect people and goods, interdict terrorists and contraband, intercept illegal narcotics, firearms, and enforce security at U.S. ports-of-entry. CBP's primary mission post-9/11 is to prevent entry of terrorists and terrorism instruments, inspect people and goods, interdict terrorists and contraband, intercept illegal narcotics, firearms, and enforce security at U.S. ports-of-entry. The Administration has requested an appropriation of $6,717 million in gross budget authority for CBP in FY2006, representing a 4% increase over the enacted FY2005 level. This includes program increases for weapons of mass destruction detection technology, Border Patrol staff, and other enforcement measures. The House-passed H.R. 2360 provides additional funding for various security initiatives including WMD detection technology, Border Patrol staff, long range radar for Air and Marine Operations, Border Patrol aircraft replacement, and other security programs totaling $210 million. The House-passed H.R. 2360 provides a net appropriation of $5,785 billion for CBP, an 8% increase over FY2005 and a 4% increase over the President's FY2006 request. It fully funds requested increases and adds $150 million for Border Patrol staffing. The Senate-passed H.R. 2360 provides $5,998 million for CBP, a $213 million increase over the House version, and increases compared to FY2006 and FY2005 levels. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2360 provides $125 million for radiation portal monitors (RPMs) under the S&T Directorate and an additional $241 million for Border Patrol staffing. It also includes $21 million for FAST and NEXUS/SENTRI funding for CBP. CBP's appropriation is divided into four accounts: Salaries and Expenses, Air and Marine Operations, Automation Modernization, and Construction. The majority of the funding goes to the Salaries and Expenses account. Table 5 and Table 6 provide budget authority details for CBP accounts in FY2005-FY2006. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2360 show similarities in funding amounts for CBP, with differences highlighted in Table 6. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2360 show differences in funding amounts for CBP, including allocations for C-TPAT, FAST, Inspection technology, Border Control Between Ports of Entry, and Air and Marine Operations S&E. The Senate version provides $75 million for C-TPAT and FAST, while the House version funds FAST under a different account. Additionally, the Senate funds research and development for new inspection technology within the S&T Directorate, while the House funds it within CBP. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2360 differ in funding for CBP, including Border Patrol Agents. The Senate added more funding for support positions and technology costs. Potential CBP issues for Congress include cargo security programs like CSI and C-TPAT. The FY2006 request includes an additional $5.4 million for CSI to support the expansion of activities in seven new ports in seven countries. House-passed H.R. 2360 fully funds the requested increase, recommending a total of nearly $139 million for CSI in FY2006. The House Committee directs CBP to submit a report detailing spending and planning projections for CSI for FY2005-FY2009. The Senate Committee fully funds the request for CSI but notes its concern about host-country cooperation. The committee requested a report from the Department by February 18, 2006, outlining steps to address foreign countries' cooperation issues. C-TPAT, a partnership for supply chain security, received an $8.2 million increase in FY2006 for travel and equipment. Both the House and Senate fully funded C-TPAT. The Senate directed CBP to submit a report by February 18, 2006, with performance measures and plans to address GAO recommendations. The Senate Committee expressed concerns about standards for CSI and C-TPAT. The Senate Committee expressed concerns over standards for the CSI and C-TPAT programs, directing CBP to submit a report detailing performance measures, human capital plan, and implementation strategies. The FY2006 Administration requested an increase of $125 million for technology to detect WMD, including funds for additional RPMs and next-generation RPMs. House-passed H.R. 2360 fully funded the $188 million request for cargo inspection technology. The Senate Committee expressed concerns over standards for the CSI and C-TPAT programs, directing CBP to submit a report detailing performance measures, human capital plan, and implementation strategies. The FY2006 Administration requested an increase of $125 million for technology to detect WMD, including funds for additional RPMs and next-generation RPMs. House-passed H.R. 2360 fully funded the $188 million request for cargo inspection technology. H.Rept. 109-79 directs CBP to submit two reports by January 16, 2006: (1) the current status and investment plan for RPMs through FY2010; and (2) the projected spending, maintenance, and replacement of large-scale non-intrusive inspection equipment for FY2006-FY2010. Senate-passed H.R. 2360 fully funds the requested increase of $125 million for RPMs under the S&T Directorate. The FY2006 request includes an increase of $31.7 million for long-range radar coverage for AMO. The request for an increase in funding is to cover 50% of the cost for a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) LRR feed, with the other 50% to be covered by the Department of Defense. The House-passed H.R. 2360 fully funds the request for AMO and provides an additional $60 million for various purposes. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2360 also fully funds the requested increase for AMO and provides an additional $33 million for specific purposes related to AMO. CBP is proposing to add 210 agents to the U.S. Border Patrol workforce in FY2006 to backfill positions vacated along the Southwest border. This increase is below the authorized 2,000 additional agents, raising questions about the appropriate staffing level for Border Patrol to achieve its mission. House appropriators have added $150 million to the President's request to hire, train, and deploy 1,500 Border Patrol agents by the end of FY2006. The Senate Appropriations Committee concurs with this and increases the funding by $241 million, including additional support positions, relocation costs, and technology expenses. They also allocate $20 million for upgrading the Border Patrol's aircraft fleet. The integration of the Border Patrol's IDENT and FBI's IAFIS systems is progressing well, with IDENT/IAFIS workstations deployed to all USBP stations. The integration has led to an 8.5% increase in identifying criminal aliens. However, there are concerns about USBP agents lacking access to the Terrorist Watchlist at their stations. The lack of access to the Terrorist Watchlist at Border Patrol stations is a concern, especially with reports of Al-Qaeda considering infiltrating the Southwest border. Congress has expressed frustration with CBP for not delivering a requested report on the IDENT/IAFIS integration project. The Senate Appropriations Committee has funded the President's request and directed DHS to submit the outstanding report by July 1, 2005. Additionally, the Senate included $3 million for CBP to reimburse the US-VISIT program for its use of the IDENT/IAFIS system. The Arizona Border Control Initiative (ABCI) was launched on March 16, 2004, to coordinate federal, state, and local authorities to control the Arizona border and stop cross-border smuggling operations. It involved assigning 200 additional permanent border patrol agents and 60 special operations agents to the Tucson sector, leading to a 56% increase in apprehensions of unauthorized aliens in the first six months. CBP proposes an increase of $1 million for a multi-disciplinary program in FY2006 to apprehend unauthorized aliens. House appropriators support the multi-agency approach to border protection. The Senate Appropriations Committee fully funds the President's request. CBP also proposes an increase of $19.8 million for the America Shield Initiative, integrating surveillance systems and detection technology. The FY2006 funding request will be used to deploy surveillance assets to high-priority areas on the southwest and northern borders. The House appropriators fully fund the President's request but express concerns about contracting problems in the ISIS program. They request a report on these issues and expect DHS to consult with the Appropriations Committee on integrating new technologies into the existing ASI system. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees fully fund the President's request for the ASI program and construction of tactical infrastructure for border security. They request reports on performance metrics and encourage exploring off-the-shelf solutions for program development. The Senate Appropriations Committee increases the President's request by $218 million, to $311 million. This includes funding for facilities to accommodate additional USBP agents, completing the fence in the San Diego Sector, and expanding tactical infrastructure in the Tucson Sector. ICE focuses on enforcement of immigration and customs laws, investigations into fraud and smuggling, and oversees building security activities. ICE, a bureau under the Department of Homeland Security, combines investigations and intelligence functions from U.S. Customs Service and former Immigration and Naturalization Service. It conducts investigations to reduce illegal entry into the United States, locates and removes illegal aliens, inspects places of employment for undocumented workers, and identifies visa overstays. ICE, a bureau under the Department of Homeland Security, conducts investigations to reduce illegal entry into the United States, locates and removes illegal aliens, inspects places of employment for undocumented workers, and identifies visa overstays. The Bureau also develops intelligence to combat terrorist financing, money laundering, and enforce export laws. The Administration has requested an appropriation of $4,364 million in gross budget authority for ICE in FY2006, representing a 4% increase over the enacted FY2005 level. This includes program increases for various activities such as investigations, custody management, organized crime, drug enforcement, and detention and removal. House-Passed H.R. 2360 provides $3,830 million for ICE, an increase of $182 million or 5% over the President's FY2006 request. This includes funding for various enforcement programs such as detention and removal, worksite enforcement, Federal Air Marshals, and legal resources. Additionally, $5 million is allocated for implementing \u00a7287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allowing agreements with states and local governments for immigration enforcement. House-Passed H.R. 2360 allocates funds for ICE, including $11.2 million for immigration enforcement and repatriation of smuggled aliens. It also withholds $20 million until an immigration enforcement strategy is submitted. Additionally, $50 million is withheld until a national detention management plan is provided. H.Rept. 109-79 recommends fully funding the President's requests and additional funding for detention beds, fugitive operations team positions, and Institutional Removal. The Senate-passed H.R. 2360 provides $3,808 million for ICE, including funding for various positions such as fugitive operations team, Institutional Removal Program agents, Alternatives to Detention positions, criminal investigators, Immigration Enforcement Agents, and the Cyber Crimes Center. Amendments added funds for improving the National Crime Information Center database and facilitating agreements between ICE and local law enforcement agencies. The Senate-passed H.R. 2360 provides $11.2 million for funding or reimbursing federal agencies for the care and repatriation of smuggled aliens. Additionally, there are recommendations for increased funding for various positions within ICE, including Custody Management, Visa Security Program, fugitive operations team, Institutional Removal Program agents, Alternatives to Detention positions, immigration investigators, Immigration Enforcement Agents, and the ABCI. Additional funding is also allocated for attorney personnel. ICE appropriation issues for Congress include severe financial management problems leading to hiring freezes, lack of detention bedspace resulting in unauthorized aliens being released, and concerns about having enough investigators for agency operations. ICE inherited financial organization and systems from the former INS. An audit found inadequate maintenance of accounting records in FY2004, especially concerning agreements, transactions, costs, and budgetary transactions. ICE also provided accounting services for other DHS agencies while facing turnover in financial management staff. ICE experienced significant turnover in financial management staff, leading to delays in basic accounting functions and budget shortfalls from late reimbursements. This resulted in a hiring freeze and cutbacks on non-essential expenses, including training. Auditors highlighted the need for DHS to address the lack of oversight in ICE's financial management. ICE requested a $500 million reprogramming for FY2005 to cover funding shortfalls. The House appropriators expressed concern over ICE's financial troubles and directed DHS to provide monthly reports on ICE's financial condition. The Office of Investigations in ICE focuses on criminal and civil violations affecting national security, including illegal arms exports, financial crimes, human trafficking, and immigration fraud. ICE special agents also protect critical infrastructure industries vulnerable to sabotage. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 abolished the INS and U.S. Customs Service, transferring investigative functions to ICE. Concerns have been raised about ICE focusing disproportionately on terrorism rather than civil violations of immigration law. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 authorized the addition of 800 new investigators to address immigration law violations. The President's budget requests $1,496 million for immigration enforcement, including funding increases for the Visa Security Unit and Temporary Worker Worksite Enforcement. This includes adding 148 new positions for these units. Additional funding is requested for temporary worker worksite enforcement to add 143 positions for investigating and prosecuting violations under existing immigration law. The budget also includes an increase of $5 million to add five new officers to the Visa Security Unit and expand training programs. H.Rept. 109-79 recommends $19 million to expand the Visa Security Program, and S.Rept. 109-83 recommends an additional $4.8 million for nine positions for the Visa Security Unit. The funding recommendations include an additional $18 million for 200 new Immigration Enforcement Agents, $19 million for 150 criminal investigators, and $37 million for 300 new immigration investigations positions. Detention and Removal Operations in ICE are responsible for managing aliens in removal proceedings or ordered removed from the US, but face challenges with limited detention space. The DOJ's Inspector General found that almost 94% of detained individuals with final removal orders were deported, compared to only 11% of those not detained. Concerns have been raised about the decision-making process for releasing aliens based on detention space availability, leading to disparities in different geographic areas. Legislation authorized an increase in DRO bed space, with the President's budget requesting funds for new beds. The House-passed H.R.2360 would withhold $50 million of funds for ICE salaries until a national detention management plan is submitted. S.Rept. 109-83 recommends $77.4 million for Custody Management positions and 2,240 new beds. ICE started the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) in 2004 as an alternative to detention for low-risk offenders, using electronic monitoring and home visits. ICE proposes funding increases for various programs, including home visits, work visits, and telephone reporting for monitoring aliens awaiting hearings. The Interior Repatriation program aims to reduce re-entry attempts by flying aliens to the interior of Mexico. The Administration is requesting $39.3 million to continue the program in FY2006. The Administration is requesting $39.3 million to continue the Interior Repatriation Program in FY2006, with $25 million for Custody Management and $14.3 million for Transportation and Removal. H.Rept. 109-79 directs the Commissioner of CBP to report on the program's performance by January 16, 2006, including cost, required agents, repatriated aliens, and recidivism data. INA\u00a7287(g) grants authority for state and local immigration enforcement activities. The debate over the role of state and local law enforcement officials in enforcing federal immigration laws has raised concerns about training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. Some localities provide sanctuary for illegal aliens, refusing to turn them over to federal authorities. Critics argue that the federal government lacks resources for immigration enforcement, suggesting that state and local entities should assist. The debate over utilizing state and local law enforcement for immigration enforcement has raised concerns about resources. Both Senate-passed H.R. 2360 and House-passed H.R. 2360 would allocate $5 million for INA \u00a7287(g). The Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in ICE manages the web-based monitoring system SEVIS, funded by fees from foreign students and institutions. Schools have faced challenges with SEVIS operations and lack of guidance from ICE. The President is seeking an additional $19.7 million for SEVP in FY2006 to maintain staffing levels. The Office of Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA) is responsible for litigating alien custody and removal cases before DOJ's Executive Office of Immigration Review. The President's budget requests an increase of $3.5 million for OPLA to hire more staff, aiming to reduce backlogged cases in immigration courts. This increase was not included in H.R. 2360 as passed by the House or Senate. The TSA, created by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, is responsible for protecting U.S. transportation systems from terrorist threats. It was transferred to DHS in 2002 and deploys various security technologies to ensure safety in air, land, and rail transportation. The TSA is responsible for improving transportation security through regulations and enforcement. The President has requested a budget increase for TSA in FY2006, with a portion of research and development functions being transferred to the S&T Directorate. The President has requested a budget increase for TSA in FY2006, with functions totaling $142 million being transferred to the proposed Office of Screening Coordination and Operations. This includes key aviation security initiatives such as developing and testing emerging checkpoint explosives technologies. The President has proposed an increase in passenger security fees to approach full cost recovery for aviation security screening. The fee would raise from $2.50 to $5.50 per flight segment, with a maximum of $8.00 per one-way trip. This is coupled with other initiatives such as realigning the screener workforce, deploying high-speed Internet connections at screening checkpoints, providing training for flight crews, and conducting security inspections at repair stations. The proposed fee increase for aviation security is expected to raise fee collections from $2.652 billion in FY2005 to $4.1 billion in FY2006, offsetting 82% of the $4.985 billion budget. Additionally, $32 million is requested for surface transportation security, including $8 million for hiring and deploying 100 rail and transit inspectors across the United States. The President's Budget and DHS Budget in Brief, along with House and Senate reports on H.R. 2360, proposed transferring activities to the SCO under the FY2006 request. This includes TWIC, HAZMAT, Registered Traveler, and Alien Flight School Checks. Both House and Senate versions of H.R. 2360 would keep these programs and fees in TSA. Total fee collections for aviation security are expected to increase from $2.652 billion in FY2005 to $4.1 billion in FY2006, offsetting 82% of the $4.985 billion budget. Additionally, $32 million is requested for surface transportation security, including $8 million for hiring and deploying rail and transit inspectors."
