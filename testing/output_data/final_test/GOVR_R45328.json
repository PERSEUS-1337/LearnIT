    "content": "Congressional commissions are established by Congress to provide advice, make recommendations for changes in public policy, study specific problems or events, and perform duties such as holding hearings, conducting research, and delivering findings in written reports. For example, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States was created to investigate the facts and causes of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and provide recommendations to prevent future acts of terrorism. The commission submitted a final report to Congress and the President with findings, conclusions, and 48 policy recommendations. The report examines the statutory lifecycle of congressional commissions, including deadlines and activities. It also discusses common language in commission legislation, such as establishment, appointments, duties, powers, rules, staff, and funding. The focus is on congressional commissions created by statute, not those created by the President or nonstatutory bodies. For the purposes of this report, a congressional commission is defined as a temporary, independent entity established by Congress to serve in an advisory capacity. This report analyzes statutory language used to establish congressional commissions between the 101st Congress and the 115th Congress. A database search was conducted to identify commissions established during this time period. A Congress.gov database search was conducted to identify 110 congressional commissions established by statute between the 101st Congress and the 115th Congress. These commissions are given deadlines to complete their work, with varying amounts of time provided depending on how the deadlines are structured. Statutory deadlines are commonly provided for the appointment of commission members, first meeting, submission of interim and final reports, and commission termination. Figure 1 illustrates the time allotted for a commission to complete its tasks, using the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission as an example. Deadlines for appointments, first meeting, final report issuance, and termination are typical in commission statutes. For instance, the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission had 60 days from enactment for appointments to be made. Statutory deadlines are commonly provided for the appointment of commission members, first meeting, submission of interim and final reports, and commission termination. The amount of time provided for appointments to be made for commissions established since the 101st Congress has ranged from 30 days to 1 year. Approximately half of commission statutes direct that the commission's first meeting be held by a particular deadline, with 60 days being the median amount of time provided for appointments for the 110 commissions analyzed. The Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission was instructed to hold its initial meeting within 30 days of the appointment of a majority of its members. Deadlines for initial meetings are commonly tied to the appointment of commission members, with a median time of 30 days. Some commissions are directed to hold an initial meeting within 90 days of establishment. The median time provided for commissions to submit a final report is 90 days from establishment. Deadlines vary, with some commissions given less than six months and others three or more years. The Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission had 15 months to submit its final report. The median time for final report submission since the 101st Congress is approximately 1.4 years. The time period for congressional commissions to submit their final report varies, with deadlines tied to different events like the first meeting or appointment of members. The length of time granted is crucial for the quality of the work product and fulfilling statutory mandates. It may take six months or more to set up a new commission before work can begin. The timely production of expert advice on a current policy matter is a primary goal of a commission. Shorter deadlines may be appropriate to address pressing policy problems and reduce overall costs. Congressional commissions usually have termination dates linked to specific events or fixed periods after enactment. For example, the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission was instructed to terminate 60 days after its establishment. The Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission was instructed to terminate 60 days after the submission of its final report, with deadlines tied to specific events in the commission's lifecycle. Legislation may require a commission to produce a final report by a specific calendar date to ensure timely delivery of results. Tying a commission's final report deadline to a flexible date, such as the first meeting or appointment of members, can provide a more predictable timeline for completing the work, although it may result in a delay in the actual submission date. The commission's final report deadline may be tied to a flexible date, potentially delaying the submission. Policymakers have various choices when designing a commission, including establishing its mandate, membership structure, duties, powers, rules of procedure, staff hiring, and funding. Legislators can customize the composition and organization of a commission based on specific goals. The establishment and organization of a commission are based on congressional goals. Examples of statutory language, alternative approaches, and advantages/disadvantages in commission design are discussed. The commission's establishment is typically outlined in a brief introductory paragraph, specifying its name and location within the legislative branch. The legal status of a commission is determined by how its members are appointed, with appointments by the President making it an executive branch entity and appointments by Members of Congress making it a legislative branch entity. Congressional intent for creating a commission is often demonstrated through \"findings\" in the legislation. The legal status of a commission is determined by how its members are appointed, with appointments by the President making it an executive branch entity and appointments by Members of Congress making it a legislative branch entity. Legislation creating commissions may include a short \"purpose\" section describing the justification for the commission. Advisory commissions can have various membership structures and designers face decisions on the number of members, appointment process, qualifications, and deadlines. The size of congressional commissions varies, with the median being 12 members. Larger commissions can offer a wider range of viewpoints and potentially increase legislative success. Small commissions, on the other hand, may be more efficient in coordination and completing work products. Appointments to commissions can be made in various ways, including through selected officials like congressional leaders, committee leaders, the President, or Cabinet officials. Smaller commissions may have lower overall costs and fewer expenses, with members potentially receiving compensation. Appointments to commissions can be made through selected officials like congressional leaders, the President, Cabinet secretaries, and state officials. Approximately 82% of identified commissions allow for appointments in this manner. The Commission on Wartime Contracting is an example where members were appointed by selected officials in collaboration with others. Appointments to commissions are often made by selected officials in collaboration with others. For example, the Thomas Jefferson Commemoration Commission had 10 specific officials designated to serve on the commission. Approximately 17% of identified commissions have a similar appointment structure. Commission statutes may provide for appointments according to a single method or multiple methods, with qualifications or restrictions to ensure expertise, representation, and diverse viewpoints. Appointment authority may be given to a small or large number of individuals, with advantages of generating buy-in but potential delays in the process. Legislation creating commissions often specifies qualifications for appointees, such as expertise in relevant fields or representation of specific groups. For example, the National Commission on the Future of the Army required expertise in security policy, military forces, and reserve forces. Similarly, the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission mandated the appointment of decorated veterans. Legislation creating commissions often specifies qualifications for appointees to ensure a wide range of viewpoints and representation of various interests. For example, the Commission on Indian and Native Alaskan Health Care required the appointment of a certain number of Indians or Native Alaskans, while the Motor Fuel Tax Enforcement Advisory Commission mandated representation from highway construction, fuel distribution, state tax administration, and relevant federal agencies. Similarly, the Commission on Long-Term Care required specific appointments to cover various interests. The Commission on Long-Term Care membership includes individuals representing consumers, older adults, individuals with limitations, family caregivers, healthcare workforce, insurance providers, employers, state departments, and Medicaid agencies. Members must have experience in long-term care issues, health policy, and insurance, and represent diverse geographic and demographic groups. The Commission on Long-Term Care membership includes individuals representing diverse geographic and demographic groups. Qualifications or restrictions on appointments can enhance the commission's work product and credibility but may limit autonomy in appointments. The specificity of qualification language impacts its effectiveness. Most commissions are structured to be bipartisan, with appointment authority divided between majority and minority parties. Some commissions have an even split between parties, while others specify the partisan breakdown of members. The specificity of qualification language can impact the effectiveness of appointments. Approximately 74% of identified commissions require some level of bipartisanship in the appointment process. Bipartisan arrangements can lead to more politically balanced findings and recommendations, as well as increased credibility within Congress and among the public. A perceived partisan commission may struggle to generate interest and support. Partisan commissions may face challenges in garnering public support and congressional backing. Bipartisanship can be crucial for a commission's effectiveness, but in some cases, it may hinder progress on controversial issues. Appointment terms for advisory commissions vary, with some lasting for a set period and others having established term limits for appointees. Appointment terms for advisory commissions vary, with some lasting for a set period and others having established term limits for appointees. For example, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission members serve until the adjournment of Congress or until the confirmation of a successor, while the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom has two-year terms with eligibility for reappointment. Vacancies on commissions are typically filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission appoints term-limited commissioners to fill vacancies for the unexpired portion of the predecessor's term. Most congressional commissions do not compensate members but reimburse travel expenses. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom allows travel expenses for its members. Members of the Commission are allowed travel expenses and per diem while performing services. Approximately 33% of commissions compensate their members, typically at the daily equivalent of Level IV of the Executive Schedule. Government employees on the commission do not receive additional compensation for their service. The Antitrust Modernization Commission allows for member compensation at Level IV of the Executive Schedule, including reimbursement for travel expenses. Government employees on the commission do not receive additional compensation for their service. Members of the Commission, including government employees, do not receive additional pay for their service. They are entitled to travel expenses as per regulations. Compensation and reimbursement for expenses can impact the composition of the commission, attracting qualified members but also increasing overall costs, especially for long-term commissions. Commissions are typically directed by statute to carry out specific tasks, which can range from brief and general duties to detailed research, investigations, and reporting. For example, the Antitrust Modernization Commission had four major duties assigned to it. The Antitrust Modernization Commission was tasked with modernizing antitrust laws, soliciting views from all concerned parties, evaluating proposals, and submitting a report to Congress and the President. Unlike other commissions, it had specific instructions for its tasks. The National Commission on Crime Control and Prevention holds field hearings in various regions to gather testimony from criminal justice professionals, business leaders, elected officials, and medical doctors. Commissions are required to produce reports outlining their activities, findings, and legislative recommendations, with some needing interim reports before the final report is issued. Reports are submitted to Congress, the President, or an executive agency. Most congressional commissions must issue a final report. Commissions are mandated to issue final reports containing detailed conclusions and recommendations. Some commissions may be required to include legislative language to implement recommendations, such as the creation of a National Women's History Museum. The Commission is tasked with submitting legislative recommendations to Congress for the establishment and construction of the Museum. Some statutes allow for expedited legislative procedures for commission recommendations, similar to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commissions. The Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, like the BRAC, has fast-track authority for its recommendations. Legislation may require interim reports to update on study progress, share findings, ensure agency compliance, and inform Congress on expenses. The Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, similar to the BRAC, has the authority to issue interim reports to update on study progress, share findings, ensure agency compliance, and inform Congress on expenses. Legislation mandates interim reports on a regular schedule and as needed basis for commissions like the Creating Options for Veterans' Expedited Recovery Commission. The Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, like the BRAC, can issue interim reports to update on study progress, share findings, ensure agency compliance, and inform Congress on expenses. The Commission is required to submit reports to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as other appropriate entities. Approximately 57% of commissions are directed to submit their work product to both Congress and the President, while the rest are typically submitted to a combination of Congress, the President, and/or an executive branch official and executive agency. Some statutes creating commissions do not specify to whom the report must be submitted. Statutes may require commissions to submit reports to Congress, relevant committees, or individuals like chamber or committee leaders. Some statutes mandate that final reports be made publicly available. For example, the Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the United States Intelligence Community was directed to submit a report to the President and congressional intelligence committees, with recommendations for legislation. The Commission is recommended to enact legislation and submit reports to Congress and relevant committees. Commissions have the authority to perform various actions to carry out their mission, such as holding hearings and obtaining administrative support. Some commissions may require specific powers depending on their goals, like receiving gifts or commemorative items. Commissions have the authority to hold hearings and receive evidence to carry out their mission. This includes the ability to obtain data from federal agencies, hear testimony from experts, and government officials. The Commission on Care, for example, is statutorily authorized to hold hearings as needed. Commissions are authorized to hold hearings and receive evidence to fulfill their duties. This may include gathering data from federal agencies, hearing testimony from experts, and government officials. Congress may require that hearings be open to the public. The National Prison Rape Reduction Commission, for example, is mandated to hold public hearings and gather necessary information to carry out its responsibilities. Commissions are authorized to obtain information from government agencies to fulfill their goals, but often lack enforcement mechanisms like subpoena authority to ensure compliance. Congressional commissions often lack subpoena authority to enforce their requests for information from government agencies. However, in some cases, commissions have been granted the authority to issue subpoenas by Congress. This authority is rare, with only nine congressional commissions since the 101st Congress having been identified as having subpoena authority. The reluctance of policymakers to grant subpoena authority to congressional commissions may be due to concerns about misuse of the authority. Limited subpoena authority has been granted to some commissions to address these concerns and allow them to conduct their studies effectively. Legislators may be hesitant to grant subpoena authority to commissions due to concerns about potential misuse. However, supporters argue that requiring concurrence from minority-appointed members can prevent politicization. Subpoena authority can be valuable when dealing with uncooperative parties, but past commissions have been granted additional powers to aid in their operations. The Virgin Islands of the United States Centennial Commission was granted various authorities, including using the U.S. mail system, entering contracts, obtaining services from experts, requesting federal employee details, receiving administrative support, and accepting gifts. The Commission may receive assistance from personnel detailed by the Secretary of the Interior or the Archivist of the United States, procure services from experts and consultants, use the U.S. mail system, and accept gifts to aid its work. The Commission can receive assistance from various sources, including the Administrator of General Services for facilities and services at a normal rental rate. It also has the authority to enter into contracts with different entities to fulfill its duties. The Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance can receive administrative assistance from the Secretaries of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Labor as needed. Commission statutes generally outline a structure for selecting a chairperson and conducting business. The selection of a chairperson for commissions is typically done through election by the commission members or appointment by the President, congressional leaders, or an executive branch official. For example, the Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission elected a chairperson from its members, while the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States had the President appoint the chairperson. The Commission on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program had appointment authority shared by the Senate. The Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program appoints chairpersons through various authorities, including congressional leaders and executive branch officials. Singular chairpersons may enhance efficiency, while co-chair arrangements can provide balance and stakeholder involvement. Most commission statutes specify a quorum as a majority of members. In most cases, a quorum for commissions is set at a majority of members, with some statutes having thresholds of less than a majority or a supermajority. Hearings and testimony can sometimes proceed with less than a quorum. Statutes are often silent on the threshold for passage of a final report, but a simple majority is commonly assumed. Some statutes require a majority agreement for recommendations in the final report, while others specify a greater than majority vote for certain actions. Establishment of supermajority thresholds in commissions can ensure minority views are heard and incorporated, leading to a final report with broader support. This can improve the commission's credibility, bipartisan backing, and result in recommendations with wider congressional support. The requirement for bipartisan or nonpartisan work product from a commission does not guarantee unanimous agreement among members. Supermajority requirements may not ensure widespread agreement, especially on partisan or ideological issues. This could result in a report where commissioners cannot agree on recommendations. The commission may produce final work products with general statements to avoid dissent. Commission statutes often do not prescribe many rules of operation, allowing members to establish their own rules informally or as needed. The commission may operate based on informal norms or formal rules, depending on factors like size, meeting frequency, member preferences, collegiality, and statutory guidance. Congressional commissions can hire staff, including a lead staffer, without specific size mandates, subject to available funds. The authority to hire staff and set salaries for congressional commissions is typically provided, with statutes designating individuals responsible for these decisions. There are often maximum rates of pay established for commission staff. Most commissions establish a maximum rate of pay for staff, often at Level V of the Executive Schedule, with annual pay rates of $153,800 in 2018. Commissions are authorized to hire staff without regard to certain pay rate laws, like the National Commission for the Review of the Research and Development Programs of the United States Intelligence Community, which could hire staff director and personnel with specified pay limits. The Commission appoints a staff director and necessary personnel without following certain pay rate laws, with a maximum pay limit equivalent to Level V of the Executive Schedule. Commission staff may be considered federal employees for benefits. Decisions regarding staff size and compensation at the Commission in the United States can significantly impact costs. Reducing staff compensation or size may save money but could hinder hiring quality staff and affect efficiency. Staffing decisions are crucial for the commission's effectiveness and completion of its mission. The commission's authority includes hiring staff, obtaining services from detailees, consultants, and volunteers. They can request detailees from any federal agency, with retained employment rights. Some commissions have limits on which federal employees can be detailed. For example, the Virgin Islands Centennial Commission can only request detailees from specific departments. The Human Space Flight Independent Investigation Commission excludes NASA employees. The Flight Independent Investigation Commission exempted NASA employees from commission detail. Statutes specify reimbursement for detailees, which may increase the overall cost. Commissions can also procure services from experts and consultants with pay limitations. The Guam War Claims Review Commission statute capped compensation for experts and consultants. The Commission may procure temporary services under section 3109(b) of title 5, United States Code, with compensation capped at the daily equivalent of the maximum annual rate of basic pay for GS-15. Expert or consultant services can be procured without compensation if agreed upon in writing. Some commissions have the authority to accept volunteer services, more common among commemorative commissions. The John F. Kennedy Centennial Commission can accept voluntary and uncompensated services as needed. Costs of congressional commissions vary widely, with expenses depending on factors like staff size and duration. The 9/11 Commission, for example, received over $10 million in appropriations and had a full-time staff of 80. The funding of congressional commissions varies based on factors such as staff size, meeting frequency, and publication production. Commissions can receive appropriations from Congress and may also accept donations to offset costs. Statutes authorizing funding for commissions may specify a dollar amount or limit funding availability. For example, the Guam War Claims Review Commission was authorized $500,000 for its operations. The Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a National Museum of the American Latino received authorization for $2,100,000 for the first fiscal year and $1,100,000 for the second fiscal year. Some commissions are prohibited from receiving federal funds and must rely on donations and volunteer efforts instead. The John F. Kennedy Centennial Commission and the World War I Centennial Commission are funded through donations, gifts, and volunteer efforts, as federal funds are prohibited. Other commissions may receive specific appropriations or agency funding. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) sets requirements for federal advisory bodies funded through agency appropriations or other mechanisms. The statute creating advisory commissions may specify funding sources, such as the Department of Defense or the Highway Trust Fund. The application of FACA requirements depends on factors like the appointing authority and branch of government involved. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) sets requirements for federal advisory bodies, specifying funding sources and appointing authorities. Some commission statutes exempt FACA but still require similar public disclosure measures."
