    "content": "Two new meta reinforcement learning algorithms, E-MAML and ERL2, are proposed for exploration in meta reinforcement learning. Results show improved performance on tasks emphasizing exploration. In supervised learning, accuracy is evaluated on a separate test set, while in reinforcement learning, there is no distinction between training and testing environments, leading to a focus on mastery over generalization. Meta RL focuses on agents quickly mastering new environments at test time by learning how to learn. Recent advances have introduced algorithms that improve policies with minimal sample complexity. Exploration in meta RL is a key question that needs more consideration, as initial exploration and system identification are crucial for solving environments. Real-life agents improve their exploratory phase with practice. Real-life agents improve exploratory skills with practice. Existing algorithms in meta RL lack efficiency in exploration. New algorithms E-MAML and E-RL 2 address this issue by introducing improved exploration strategies. The algorithms E-MAML and E-RL 2 improve exploration strategies in meta RL. They outperform MAML and RL 2 in Krazy World and maze environments. The E-MAML derivation suggests new directions for exploration in meta-learning. Recent work in Deep Reinforcement Learning has laid the foundation for solving previously challenging RL problems. Recent work in Deep Reinforcement Learning has introduced algorithms like BID26, BID14, BID25, and BID12 that enable high-dimensional continuous control in complex environments from raw state information. However, these algorithms still struggle with exploration challenges. New approaches to exploration in deep RL, such as BID31 and BID28, have been proposed to address these shortcomings. The paper discusses new approaches to exploration in deep RL, focusing on artificial curiosity and meta-RL. Despite various efforts, exploration in RL remains challenging. The paper aims to address exploration in meta RL, which can also be tackled using other methods. In meta RL, problems can be addressed with hierarchical RL, focusing on learning reusable primitives for better exploration. Meta RL literature includes life-long learning, learning to learn, continual learning, and multi-task learning. Meta learning directly optimizes for behaviors, unlike hierarchical RL which focuses on defining specific architectures. In meta RL, problems can be addressed with hierarchical RL, focusing on learning reusable primitives for better exploration. The papers BID20 and BID19 propose self-modifying learning machines or genetic programs, leading to a meta-GP approach. These methods encompass most metalearning approaches. Exploration in these contexts often focuses on curiosity or free learning phases during training, which differs from defining an intrinsic motivation signal. This paper focuses on defining intrinsic motivation signals and aims to apply insights from prior literature to recently developed algorithms like E-MAML and E-RL 2. It builds upon existing meta learning algorithms like MAML and RL 2, incorporating information from free learning phases into gradient updates for better utilization of reward signals. The paper discusses using intrinsic motivation signals in algorithms like E-MAML and E-RL 2, building upon meta-learning algorithms like MAML and RL 2. It focuses on optimizing reward signals for faster reinforcement learning. In meta reinforcement learning, the goal is to find a policy and update method that quickly solves a distribution of tasks. The aim is to be significantly more sample efficient than traditional methods, collecting only 1-10 trajectories compared to 100,000 or more with policy gradients. In meta reinforcement learning, the objective is to efficiently solve a variety of tasks by updating the policy and method. The focus is on being more sample efficient, requiring only 1-10 trajectories compared to traditional methods that need 100,000 or more with policy gradients. The algorithm aims to learn how to quickly master new tasks, similar to MAML, where the objective can be optimized by taking a derivative and carrying out a standard REINFORCE style analysis. In meta reinforcement learning, the objective is to efficiently solve tasks by updating the policy and method with a focus on sample efficiency. The sampling distribution \u03c0 \u03b8 on future rewards is important for weighting initial samples by expected future returns. Including this dependency reinforces exploratory trajectories and encourages good exploratory behaviors. The modified expectation can be written to account for this, leading to a more exploratory version of the objective. The gradient of this objective can be found by applying the product rule. The gradient of the objective in meta reinforcement learning involves applying the product rule to derive a two-term expression that encourages both exploitation and exploration. The first term promotes update steps that lead to good final rewards, while the second term focuses on actions that maximize future rewards without exploiting the current trajectory. This modified algorithm, called E-MAML, enhances MAML by incorporating an exploratory component. E-MAML is an algorithm that augments MAML by adding an exploratory term. RL 2 optimizes by feeding rollouts from different MDPs into an RNN to act as the update function U. Training the RNN involves sampling MDPs from M and obtaining rollouts. To train the RNN, N MDPs are sampled from M and k rollouts are obtained for each MDP. A policy gradient update is computed to maximize returns over the trials. Inspired by E-MAML, exploratory rollouts are included in the algorithm. RL 2 works well with POMDPs due to the RNN's system-identification capabilities. During exploratory rollouts, all information is used in the forward pass, but rewards are set to zero in the backwards pass. During training, the RNN receives rewards for exploratory and exploitative episodes. The policy gradient is computed using a modified return formula that zeros out rewards from exploratory episodes. This encourages the RNN to explore initially, leading to better system identification and higher rewards in later episodes. A new environment called Krazy World is introduced to test meta RL algorithms' exploration abilities. Figure 1 shows three example worlds from the task distribution in the Krazy World environment. The agent must identify different tile types and their effects before exploiting them. Tasks change, requiring re-identification each time. In the Krazy World environment, the agent encounters various tile types with different effects such as ice squares, death squares, wall squares, lock squares, teleporter squares, and energy squares. The agent must adapt to changing tasks and can also face a randomly swapped color palette for the grid, requiring identification of new systems to achieve a high score. The Krazy World environment features various tile types with different effects like ice, death, wall, lock, teleporter, and energy squares. The game allows for altering dynamics, including permuting player inputs, moving multiple steps in arbitrary directions, and offering local or global observations in basis vectors or images. The Krazy World environment contains various tile types with different effects like ice, death, wall, lock, teleporter, and energy squares. Basis vectors are used to represent each element of the grid, which are then concatenated to form the observation. A successful meta learning agent needs to explore the environment to identify tile types, color palette, and dynamics. In maze environments, the agent must navigate twists and turns to reach the goal square without rendering the mazes, relying solely on state space. The agent navigates maze environments without rendered mazes, using state space only. Experimental results include learning curves on Krazy World, gap analysis after updating, and heuristic metrics for exploration algorithms. Meta learning algorithms like E-MAML and MAML show faster convergence compared to RL 2, which has poor performance. The meta-RL algorithms MAML and E-MAML show faster convergence compared to RL 2, which has poor performance and high variance. Training involves initializing multiple environments with different seeds, sampling hyper-parameters, collecting data, making meta-updates, and training on test environments. Training at test time involves performing one VPG update. Training at test time for MAML and E-MAML involves one VPG update, while for RL 2 and E-RL 2, it includes running three exploratory episodes and reporting the loss on the fourth and fifth episodes. Meta-updates are calculated using PPO, and the process is repeated 64 times to provide final learning curves. The Y axis in Figures 4 and 5 represents the reward obtained after training on 64 test environments, while the X axis shows the total number of environmental time-steps used for training. The learning curves for meta-learning algorithms in Krazy World show that E-MAML and E-RL 2 have the best final performance. E-MAML has steep initial gains, while E-RL 2 surpasses E-MAML around 14 million training steps. MAML delivers comparable final performance to E-MAML but takes longer to achieve it. RL 2 shows poor performance and high variance on this task. RL 2 has poor performance and high variance in maze tasks. The agent tends to find a single goal square and stops exploring further. RNNs like E-RL 2 perform better in mazes due to their ability to leverage memory. MAML struggles to avoid hitting walls, while E-RL 2 and RL 2 sporadically solve mazes. E-RL 2 eventually outperforms other algorithms in maze tasks. E-RL 2 and RL 2 learn to avoid hitting walls in maze tasks, with E-RL 2 showing faster learning and better final performance. MAML and E-MAML, using MLPs instead of RNNs, have lower returns. The optimal return for this task is around 1.1, while a random agent would achieve -2.2. Figure 5 displays meta learning curves on mazes, while Figure 6 isolates each algorithm's performance for easier comparison. When examining meta learning algorithms, an important metric is the gap between the initial policy and the updated policy after one learning episode. For MAML, the gap is measured after one policy gradient step, while for RL 2, it is measured after three exploratory episodes. These gaps are similar to the Jump Start metric in prior literature. Additionally, three heuristic metrics are considered for measuring the exploratory ability of the meta-learners in Figure 7. The fraction of tile types visited by the agent at test time, the number of times the agent visits a death tile, and the number of goals reached are key metrics for evaluating exploratory agents in meta-learning algorithms. RL 2 tends to visit fewer goals but shows improvement after one update, indicating the effectiveness of meta-learning. The gap between initial and updated policy performance is significant on Krazy World for all algorithms. Initial performance on gridworld is similar for all algorithms, converging around 0.1. E-MAML and RL 2 have higher variance. MAML and E-MAML show a small gap in maze tasks, possibly due to lack of memory. E-RL 2 shows the best improvement in exploiting goals. Exploratory algorithms perform better in meta reinforcement learning exploration. Two new algorithms were developed and analyzed for their properties. The study introduced new algorithms that learn and explore more efficiently than existing ones. Future research may focus on meta-learning a curiosity signal for robust exploration. E-MAML was found to be the most diligent in exploring different tile types during test time. Further details on potential future directions can be found in the appendix. The study introduced new algorithms that learn and explore efficiently. E-MAML was diligent in exploring different tile types during test time. RL 2 and MAML check a majority of tile types at test time, while E-RL 2 is sporadic. Algorithms start by dying in all test episodes and decrease to between one and two. RL 2 exploits one goal, while other algorithms explore to find more goals. Exploratory algorithms consistently deliver the best performance. Meta learners seem to learn system identification. MAML and E-MAML do not benefit from more than one gradient step at test time. The study introduced new algorithms for efficient learning and exploration. E-MAML explores different tile types during test time and only performs one gradient step. The path-integral formulation of the expected reward in E-MAML is simplified by re-writing the action probability. The surrogate loss is expressed in a notation that highlights the flexibility of the inner-update operator. In E-MAML, the update operator of choice is crucial for performance. In E-MAML, the update operator of choice is crucial for performance. The operator belongs to a general class of exploratory operators O, where MAML is a specific instance."
