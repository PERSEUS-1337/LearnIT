    "content": "Industry observers have raised concerns about gaps in food import safety, particularly regarding imported goods released into the US market after FDA detention under an import alert. Importers must provide evidence of compliance with federal laws, often through private laboratory testing. The FDA lacks authority to regulate these labs, prompting proposals for regulation in this area. The FDA lacks authority to regulate private laboratories that analyze imported goods, leading to proposals for regulation in the 110th Congress. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act delegates administrative responsibility for imported food regulation to the FDA. The FDA can automatically detain products under the FFDCA if they are deemed unsafe or in violation of regulations. Import alerts are issued to identify problem commodities or shippers, allowing importers to petition for release by providing compliant test results from private laboratories. Private laboratories play a crucial role in ensuring imported food complies with FDA standards. Test results from these labs are used by the FDA to determine if products meet entry requirements. While they help free up FDA resources, there is criticism about the autonomy given to importers and labs. Criticism has been raised regarding the autonomy given to importers and private laboratories in the testing of food samples for FDA compliance. Importers have been accused of selecting samples that are not representative or submitting multiple samples until a compliant one is found, allowing for potentially adulterated or misbranded foods to enter the market. This issue was highlighted in a 1998 Senate hearing and a 2008 House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing. The FDA-regulated goods testified at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing, addressing importers altering test results to hide FDA violations. Suggestions were made to improve FDA regulation of imported foods through laboratory use and audits. Recent proposals aim to monitor private laboratories to prevent abuses. The FDA Office of Regulatory Affairs provides Private Laboratory Guidance in its Laboratory Manual. The FDA provides guidance on ensuring private labs analyzing FDA-regulated imported commodities submit scientifically sound data. Recommendations include sampling techniques, analyst training, review considerations, and audit sample criteria. In 2004, a rule to regulate imported food product sampling services and private labs was proposed but later withdrawn. The FDA proposed a rule in 2004 for regulating food product sampling services and private laboratories, emphasizing proper sample identification, collection, and maintenance. The rule required independent sampling execution to prevent importer influence and mandated the use of validated analytical methods. It omitted a laboratory accreditation requirement and was withdrawn in August 2005. The FDA's Food Protection Plan and the Action Plan for Import Safety aim to enhance food import safety. The Food Protection Plan suggests legislation for FDA accreditation of private laboratories. The Action Plan emphasizes setting standards for sampling and testing imported products, including using accredited private labs. Legislation in the 110th Congress focused on private laboratory regulation and accreditation. One common theme among legislative proposals is the accreditation or certification of private laboratories. Representative Dingell circulated a draft bill in April 2008 to amend the FFDCA, requiring new sampling and testing protocols for food shipments. The draft included a new section dedicated to testing food shipments in facilities that would not have been certified, with accredited laboratories conducting sampling and testing and submitting results electronically to the HHS Secretary and facility owner. The EAT SAFE Act, introduced by Senator Casey in December 2007, proposed testing protocols for food shipments. It required accredited laboratories to conduct sampling and testing, submit results electronically to the HHS Secretary and facility owner, and be certified by the agency under a fee-funded process. The Safe FEAST Act, introduced in April 2008 by Representative Costa, proposed certifying imports through a fee-funded process developed by the FDA. Qualified laboratories would be allowed to test imported foods after meeting specific criteria set by the HHS Secretary. Additionally, alternative laboratories could also test samples but would have to meet additional requirements, such as submitting evidence of qualifications and all testing results to the FDA. The bill introduced by Representative Roskam in April 2008 aimed to impose regulations on private laboratories testing imported FDA-regulated goods. It would have required certification of laboratories by the HHS Secretary, audits, submission of test results to the FDA, and penalties for falsifying results."
