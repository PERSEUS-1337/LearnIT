    "content": "President Barack Obama submitted a request for military construction appropriations for FY2012 to Congress on February 14, 2011. The request overlapped with the appropriations process for FY2011. The House passed the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 2012 on June 14, 2011, after debates on provisions affecting military construction projects. One debate focused on Section 415, which was removed by a close vote of 204-203. The section aimed to prevent the use of military construction funds to enforce Executive Order 13502, allowing for project labor agreements on construction projects over $25 million. Another amendment, which would have prohibited Davis-Bacon prevailing wage standards on military construction projects, was defeated 178-232. The Senate received H.R. 2055 on June 15 and referred it to the Committee on Appropriations, which reported it with an amendment on June 30, 2011. The Senate reported H.R. 2055 with an amendment on June 30, 2011, placing it on the Senate Legislative Calendar. A motion to proceed to consideration of the bill was made on July 11, along with a cloture motion. The cloture motion was accepted with unanimous consent, and the motion to consider H.R. 2055 was withdrawn. Authorization of funding for the Department of Defense, including military construction, is required by Section 114 of Title 10, United States Code, through the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The NDAA for FY2012 (H.R. 1540) was introduced in the House on April 14, 2011. The House Committee on Armed Services reported its amendment of the bill on May 17, 2011. The House passed the bill by recorded vote on May 26, and the Senate received it on June 6, 2011. The Senate Committee on Armed Services reported its version of the NDAA on June 22, authorizing military construction appropriations and additional authorities related to military construction and family housing. The act routinely authorizes specific construction projects, land acquisitions, property improvements, and can also forbid various actions. The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act funds new military facilities for weapons systems, military force redeployment, improving living and working conditions, reducing operating costs, and enhancing military productivity. It also covers construction and movement of organizations in base closure actions and environmental remediation for defense property disposal. The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act funds new military facilities for various purposes, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Security Investment Program and military family housing improvements through public-private partnerships. The Homeowners Assistance Fund (HAF) was created in the mid-1960s to help DOD family homeowners affected by base closures. Eligibility was temporarily expanded to include military members who bought homes during the \"housing bubble\" and had to move during the \"housing crisis.\" The Secretary of Defense ended this temporary eligibility in late 2010. Another subaccount funds the construction of facilities at chemical munitions depots for demilitarization. Construction of plants at select depots to demilitarize and dispose of U.S. chemical munitions stockpiles is nearing completion. Title IV of the bill provides temporary appropriations for military construction supporting overseas contingency operations, such as deployments to U.S. Central Command. The Obama Administration has shifted military construction funding into regular appropriations, known as \"Title IV (OCO)\" construction. In FY2012, no funds were requested for OCO construction. The House passed a bill appropriating $14.2 billion for military construction and family housing, a reduction from the presidential request. This bill includes $237.1 million in recycled funding from previous appropriations, bringing the total appropriation to $14.4 billion. The Senate received H.R. 2055 on June 15 and referred it to the Committee on Appropriations, which reported the bill with an amendment in the form of a substitute on June 30. The Senate amendment would appropriate $13.7 billion in new budget authority for military construction and family housing, $1.0 billion below the President's request. Congress passed the first of eight continuing appropriations bills to fund FY2011 as FY2010 expired at the end of September. The initial continuing appropriation for FY2011 allowed spending on military construction at the same rate as FY2010 but prohibited new projects. The restriction was lifted with the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 112-10) in April 2011. This forced moratorium enabled Congress to reclaim some FY2011 funding for FY2012. The House debated the Military Construction Appropriations Act for FY2012 (H.R. 2055) on June 2. The House debated and passed the Military Construction Appropriations Act for FY2012 (H.R. 2055) on June 2 and June 14, 2011. Funding details for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012 are provided in Table 2, showing the new budget authority (NBA) required for each year. The U.S. Northern Command's geographic area includes the contiguous United States, Alaska, Canada, and Mexico, with military construction issues focusing on personnel relocation and troop redeployment. Additional details can be found in the Appendix. The 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC Commission) mandated a complex program of construction and troop relocation within the continental United States. Approximately $35 billion was appropriated for this effort, with completion scheduled by September 15, 2011. However, due to challenges in fully implementing some recommendations by the deadline, H.R. 1540 allows for the Secretary of Defense to extend completion of up to seven recommendations. Section 2707 of H.R. 1540 allows the Secretary of Defense to extend completion of up to seven recommendations for a year. It also restricts the use of over 1,000 parking spaces at the BRAC Commission Recommendation 133 site until certain actions are taken. BRAC 133 will relocate defense workers to the Mark Center in Arlington, VA, raising concerns about increased traffic. This is part of the domestic BRAC effort, funded through the BRAC appropriation, which includes construction for units relocated to the US under the Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy. The DOD announced plans to permanently move a Navy aircraft carrier from Norfolk, VA to Mayport, FL as part of the Global Defense Posture Realignment. Concerns about vulnerability led to the decision to build a second facility at Mayport, estimated to cost $580 million. Congress has not yet appropriated construction funds, but the budget request includes support for future facility construction. The FY2012 budget request includes funding for ancillary items to support future facility construction at Mayport, FL for a Navy aircraft carrier. However, there are restrictions in place, such as a prohibition on using funds for architectural and engineering services for the homeport project. Additionally, there is a provision to prevent the use of funds for construction in the US to house Guantanamo detainees. The text chunk discusses the prohibition on using funds to support the expansion of the Pi\u00f1on Canyon Maneuver Site in Colorado due to local resistance. It also mentions the geographical area of responsibility of the U.S. Pacific Command. The U.S. Pacific Command is undergoing major force movements and construction in the Pacific region. A recent analysis by GAO found that DOD lacks comprehensive cost data in its theater posture plan, hindering decision makers' understanding of posture requirements and affordability. Without proper reporting of posture costs, decision makers and congressional committees will not have a full fiscal context for developing posture plans and understanding funding requirements. Japan is constructing a new air facility in Okinawa as part of intergovernmental agreements. Japan is building a new air facility in Okinawa for U.S. Marine Corps aviation units, replacing the current facility at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. The construction has been delayed due to site selection and political considerations, but plans have been finalized for a new site and runway configuration. The completion date is now uncertain, but both the U.S. and Japan aim to finish the facility as soon as possible after 2014. The Senate Committee on Armed Services has expressed concern about the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Okinawa, stating that the current plan is untenable and must be resolved sooner and more economically. They estimate that the relocation would take at least 7 to 10 years and cost $5.0\u201310.0 billion. The committee is considering relocating Marine aviation assets to Kadena Air Base instead of the projected new facility. The Senate's version of the NDAA, S. 1253, proposes an independent panel to assess U.S. force posture in East Asia and the Pacific Region, focusing on force realignments on Okinawa and Guam. Japan has pledged $6 billion for relocating 8,000 Marines from Okinawa to Guam. Congress criticized the slow pace of DOD planning for the move, deferring construction funding pending a global posture review. The redeployment is tied to the FRF project, with DOD awaiting tangible progress. The House and Senate Committees express concerns about the funding and completion of construction for the Marine Corps redeployment from Okinawa to Guam, linked to the FRF project. The DOD is waiting for progress on the FRF before starting construction for the Marines' housing. The Senate Committee on Appropriations highlights the lack of cost estimates for the Guam buildup and the absence of a comprehensive master plan from the DOD. The Committee has deferred funding for fiscal year 2012 military construction projects associated with the relocation of United States Marines to Guam due to uncertainties regarding the Government of Japan's commitment and the lack of a comprehensive master plan from the DOD. The Senate version of the NDAA would also strike the requested funding for these construction projects, while the House version authorizes full funding. The Senate's version of the NDAA for 2012 would delay funding for Marine relocation to Guam until certain conditions are met, including providing a master construction plan and tangible progress on the relocation of MCAS Futenma. Bilateral consultations between the US and Japan have taken place regarding this issue. The Department of State confirmed the delay in completing the FRF and Marine relocation projects beyond 2014 to avoid the indefinite use of MCAS Futenma. U.S. ground forces have been concentrated in forward bases along the Korean Peninsula since 1954, with plans to consolidate USFK, U.S. Army, and Air Force units into two large military communities near Seoul. The GAO noted in a report that DOD cost estimates for initiatives in South Korea total $17.6 billion through 2020, with incomplete estimates. One initiative to extend tour lengths and move dependents could cost $5 billion by 2020 and $22 billion or more through 2050. However, this initiative lacks a business case analysis to determine cost-effectiveness. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concerns about the cost-effectiveness of tour normalization in South Korea, particularly in the context of a $13 billion construction program at Camp Humphreys. They questioned the need for significant investments in military construction for schools, family housing, and child development centers. The Senate Committee on Appropriations raised concerns about the cost and plan for Tour Normalization in Korea, specifically questioning the need for a $13 billion construction program at Camp Humphreys to accommodate the relocation of U.S. troops and the first phase of tour normalization. They highlighted the lack of a business case analysis and the potential need for changes to the current construction program. The Senate Committee on Appropriations raised concerns about the cost and plan for Tour Normalization in Korea, particularly the $13 billion construction program at Camp Humphreys. They emphasized the need for a detailed business case analysis before approving any future funding requests. The Senate Committee on Armed Services included Section 2113 in their version of the NDAA for FY2012 to restrict funds for tour normalization support. The NDAA for FY2012 includes provisions to restrict funds for tour normalization support until a detailed analysis is conducted. U.S. European Command (EUCOM) covers Europe, Russia, Israel, Greenland, and Iceland, with the EUCOM commander also serving as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR). During the Cold War, a large number of U.S. forces were stationed in the EUCOM area of responsibility. With the end of the Cold War, U.S. military presence in Western and Southern Europe, including West Germany, saw significant reductions. By 2010, there were approximately 79,000 U.S. servicemembers in Europe, with the majority located in Germany. Military personnel in Germany are being consolidated into two large communities at Kaiserslautern and Grafenw\u00f6hr-Vilseck. The military construction in eastern Bavaria near the Czech border has been focused on supporting the relocation of combat power. The President's FY2012 request includes $563 million for construction in Germany, including facilities for the European Army and Air Force Exchange, training facilities, barracks, and family housing. The DOD Education Agency is also requesting $207 million for school construction projects. The Tricare Management Agency plans to replace the military medical center at Rhine Ordnance Barracks at a total cost of $1.2 billion. The Air Force is asking for $35 million to build a new airman's dormitory at Ramstein Air Base, and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is asking for $2.4 million to upgrade its facility serving U.S. Army, Europe, headquarters near Stuttgart. The Senate Committee on Appropriations noted the impact of efficiency initiatives announced by the Secretary of Defense in 2010 regarding the United States Army transformation and realignment plans in Europe. The Army is reducing staff billets and Brigade Combat Teams in Europe as part of efficiency initiatives. They are facing challenges in articulating long-term plans for forces and installations in Europe. The Committee directs the Army and European Command to provide a report on installations in Germany to be returned to the host nation. Responsibility for military affairs in Africa shifted to AFRICOM in 2008. Responsibility for military affairs in Africa shifted to AFRICOM in 2008, but Egypt did not transfer to AFRICOM. Funds were requested in FY2011 for the construction of two headquarters buildings at Camp Lemonier, Djibouti. The Senate Committee on Appropriations noted that DOD had not submitted a requested report on plans for future operations of both Camp Lemonier and CJTF-HOA. The President's request for FY2012 includes funds for construction of housing and facility improvements at the camp. The House and Senate fully funded facility improvements at Camp Lemonier, Djibouti for AFRICOM's mission. Concerns remain about the long-term mission and security of the installation. The Navy installation primarily supports CJTF-HOA for anti-terrorism efforts in East Africa. The Committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a comprehensive master plan for Camp Lemonier. The House and Senate funded facility improvements at Camp Lemonier for AFRICOM's mission. A comprehensive master plan is required for Camp Lemonier to measure progress and funding requirements. Discussions have mentioned the potential movement of AFRICOM headquarters to the Norfolk, VA area. U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility includes Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia. The FY2012 request for military construction appropriations includes funding for projects in Afghanistan, Qatar, and Bahrain Island. Congress has annually renewed temporary authority for the Secretary of Defense to use O&M funding for military construction in support of overseas operations. The Section 2808 authority, originally granted in the FY2004 National Defense Authorization Act, allows for construction funding for overseas contingency operations. Funding amounts and locations have varied over the years, with limits set in subsequent legislation. Congressional language distinguishes between construction for short-term military operations and permanent troop garrisoning in Iraq or Afghanistan. The Section 2808 authority allows for construction funding for overseas contingency operations, with limits set in subsequent legislation. Congressional language distinguishes between construction for short-term military operations and permanent troop garrisoning in Iraq or Afghanistan. Funding for FY2011 was provided through a series of continuing appropriations. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 111-242) allowed government agencies to operate at the same rate as FY2010 appropriations until December 3, 2010. It adjusted funding levels for various accounts, including a significant reduction in military construction accounts. Additionally, it included a provision prohibiting the use of funds for new production items for the Department of Defense. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 111-242) allowed government agencies to operate at the same rate as FY2010 appropriations until December 3, 2010. It included a provision prohibiting the use of funds for new production items for the Department of Defense, restricting the initiation of any new FY2011 construction projects. The President's FY2012 military construction and family housing appropriation request to Congress was submitted on February 14, 2011. The House passed its version of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 2055) on June 14, 2011, with funding levels showing reductions compared to FY2011 enacted amounts. The reductions include a significant decrease in BRAC 2005 funding needed for the first post-implementation year of the program. The President's FY2012 request for military construction funding is significantly less than needed for BRAC 2005. The House passed H.R. 2055 with reduced funding levels, and the Senate may consider the measure soon. As Congress considers the President's FY2012 military construction funding request, questions arise about the impact of delays in FY2011 appropriations, management issues in U.S. basing in Asia, debt limits on project timing, and the impact of earmark prohibitions on Congress's power. The text chunk discusses the appropriateness of DOD assisting local jurisdictions with increased military community size demands and the need for legislation to create necessary authority and funding. It also questions if new authority is needed to extend recommendations from the 2005 BRAC Commission due to the complexity of the current BRAC round."
