    "content": "This report highlights nine campaign finance policy issues that may receive attention during the 111th Congress, including bundling, campaign travel, electronic filing, FEC, hybrid political advertising, joint fundraising committees, public financing of presidential campaigns, 527 organizations, and restricting campaign activity among state election officials. It provides an overview of each issue, recent legislation, and policy considerations. These issues are expected to remain topics of debate in the upcoming Congress. The report highlights nine campaign finance policy issues for the 111th Congress, including bundling, campaign travel, electronic filing, FEC, hybrid political advertising, joint fundraising committees, public financing of presidential campaigns, 527 organizations, and restricting campaign activity among state election officials. These issues are expected to remain topics of debate, with questions surrounding money amounts, transparency, and regulation shaping the discussion. Approximately 50 legislative measures on federal campaign finance policy were considered during the 110th Congress. During the 110th Congress, around 50 legislative measures on federal campaign finance policy were introduced, with two becoming law. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (HLOGA) restricted campaign travel on private aircraft and required additional reporting on bundled contributions by lobbyists. The FEC's Administrative Fine Program was extended until 2013. Other issues like campaign payments to candidate families and funding for enforcement of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act were discussed but did not pass into law. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (H.R. 3093) was discussed in a House Administration Subcommittee hearing, along with other topics such as public financing of congressional campaigns, coordinated party expenditures, electronic filing of Senate campaign finance reports, FEC nominations, and automated political telephone calls. The most significant policy concern for the 111th Congress was the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. The Citizens United case invalidated parts of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, allowing corporations and unions to use their funds for political ads. This decision also overturned a previous ruling on corporate-funded independent expenditures. The ban on corporate or union contributions to political candidates remains unaffected. Unions and corporations can now use their treasury funds for political ads supporting or opposing candidates, thanks to the Citizens United case. This has led to discussions in Congress about potential policy responses, such as public campaign financing, altering contribution limits, or amending the Constitution. Supporters of corporate speech rights may prefer to maintain the status quo with no legislative action. Most congressional attention post Citizens United ruling has focused on the DISCLOSE Act (H.R. 5175; S. 3295; S. 3628). The House passed H.R. 5175 on June 24, 2010, while the Senate failed to invoke cloture on S. 3628. H.R. 4790 was also ordered reported by the Committee on Financial Services for additional disclosure of political expenditures to corporate shareholders. Issues from the 110th Congress may resurface in the 111th Congress. The Federal Election Campaign Act assigns campaign treasurers with primary responsibility for filing FEC reports and ensuring compliance. Candidates may influence campaign spending informally, but are not legally responsible for disbursing funds. Concerns have been raised about how campaign funds would be spent if a candidate died. H.R. 749 was reported by the House Committee on Administration in 2009 to permit candidates to... H.R. 749 (Jones, NC) passed the House by voice vote, allowing candidates to designate someone to direct campaign spending after their death. The bill also permits candidates to specify how funds should be disbursed. H.R. 749 passed the House with bipartisan support, allowing candidates to designate someone to control campaign spending after their death. The bill aims to prevent asset disputes by ensuring designees follow candidate wishes, potentially creating different levels of candidate authority over spending in life versus death. H.R. 749 passed to allow candidates to designate someone to control campaign spending after their death, potentially creating different levels of candidate authority over spending in life versus death. Bundling is a fundraising practice involving intermediaries, often lobbyists, that has been prominent in recent years. Bundling in the 2008 presidential elections allowed individuals to give larger contributions through intermediaries, raising concerns about potential coercion or impermissible sources. Despite not being prohibited by FEC regulations, new rules implemented in 2008 required political committees to report bundled contributions. Political committees must report bundled contributions of at least $15,000 aggregated from at least two contributions during specified reporting periods. Only contributions bundled by registered lobbyists need to be disclosed. Committees can verify bundlers' lobbyist status by checking official websites. The new rules also consider other sources of knowledge about lobbyists' bundling activities. Controversy surrounds the credit given to lobbyists for raising bundled contributions. Under new rules, political committees must credit lobbyists for bundled contributions before reporting them. Mere knowledge of bundling is not sufficient for disclosure; committees must officially recognize the lobbyist's role in raising funds. Under new rules, political committees must credit lobbyists for bundled contributions before reporting them. Hosts of joint fundraising events must be listed in bundling disclosure reports if they are registered lobbyists and credited with raising contributions meeting the $16,000 threshold. Critics have raised concerns about these rules. The FEC rules require political committees to credit lobbyists for bundled contributions before reporting them. Critics argue that these rules could allow committees to avoid disclosing bundlers' roles through manipulation of crediting arrangements. If Congress revisits bundling policy, two perspectives could be relevant: reporting information about bundling and further regulating bundling practices. Key questions include whether campaigns should only disclose bundling by registered lobbyists. If Congress revisits bundling policy, key questions include whether campaigns should only disclose bundling by registered lobbyists. Congress may wish to increase transparency about bundling overall, potentially by extending disclosure requirements to cover bundling by anyone, regardless of profession. During the 110th Congress, a bill proposed such an approach but did not advance beyond committee referral. If Congress decides to discourage bundling, additional regulations may be necessary, such as limits on contributions by a single bundler or a complete ban on bundling. Some believe that more restrictions or disclosure requirements could increase transparency and limit bundling, while others argue that further regulation could burden the regulated community. Additionally, HLOGA restricts campaign travel on private, non-commercial aircraft. HLOGA restricts campaign travel on private, non-commercial aircraft by requiring reimbursement at the \"pro rata share of the fair market value\" for rental or charter of a comparable aircraft. This is a change from previous regulations that allowed reimbursement at first-class travel rates. HLOGA restricts campaign travel on private aircraft by requiring reimbursement at the \"pro rata share of the fair market value\" for rental or charter of a comparable aircraft. FEC adopted rules for HLOGA's air-travel provisions in December 2007, but they were never finalized until November 2009. House Members, candidates, and campaign staff are banned from flying on private aircraft, as reimbursements for such flights are not allowed under HLOGA. The FEC rules required reimbursement for campaign travel on private aircraft based on charter rates, applying to presidential, vice-presidential, Senate campaigns, PACs, and party committees. HLOGA banned reimbursement for House campaign travel on private aircraft. In November 2009, the commission debated interpretations of HLOGA's travel rules, resulting in a deadlock on approving the December 2007 rules. The FEC approved new rules for campaign travel reimbursement in a 4-2 vote along partisan lines. The rules distinguish between campaign travel and travel on behalf of PACs or parties, requiring charter-rate reimbursement in some cases. Chairman Walther (I) joined Republican Commissioners to constitute a majority, superseding the 2007 rules. Travel reimbursement for campaign-related travel has been a topic of controversy, with new rules approved by the FEC in a partisan vote. The rules differentiate between campaign travel and travel on behalf of PACs or parties, requiring charter-rate reimbursement in certain cases. Critics argue that the rules may allow for avoiding more expensive charter-rate reimbursement by classifying travel as on behalf of PACs or parties. Supporters, however, maintain that Congress mandated charter-rate reimbursement only for presidential travel. The FEC approved new rules for campaign-related travel reimbursement, requiring charter-rate reimbursement for presidential, vice-presidential, or Senate candidate travel. Congress could potentially object to the rules and employ oversight or legislation to address concerns, such as applying the charter rate to all campaign travel and clarifying restrictions on reimbursement by House and Senate leadership PACs. Congress may also consider banning Senate campaign travel on private aircraft or monitoring the implementation of the new rules. The FEC approved new rules for campaign-related travel reimbursement, requiring charter-rate reimbursement for presidential, vice-presidential, or Senate candidate travel. Unlike other federal political committees, Senate campaign committees, party committees, and PACs are not required to file campaign finance reports electronically. Senate reports are unique because they are filed with the Secretary of the Senate rather than directly with the FEC. In the 110th Congress, a bill was proposed to extend electronic filing to Senate reports but was not considered on the Senate floor. Despite this, electronic filing remains a popular policy proposal. In the 111th Congress, Senator Feingold introduced bills similar to the previous one, including one that would require electronic filing and reporting directly to the FEC. The primary policy questions surrounding electronic filing are whether Senate campaign finance reports should be filed electronically and where those reports should be filed. Electronic filing of campaign finance reports is supported for efficiency and cost reasons. Currently, paper reports are converted to electronic format at a reported cost of $250,000 annually. Various stakeholders support electronic filing to improve transparency and make data available faster. Both the FEC and the Secretary of the Senate are prepared to administer electronic filing, which could eliminate the conversion process and expedite public disclosure of data. Electronic filing of Senate reports would improve transparency, reduce costs, and apply uniform filing standards to all political committees. Some Members have called for addressing campaign finance disclosure issues alongside electronic filing, such as disclosure requirements for 527 organizations. During the 110th Congress, there was debate over filing Senate campaign finance reports with the FEC instead of the Secretary of the Senate. Some Senators viewed filing with the Secretary as a Senate prerogative. The FEC enforces campaign finance laws and facilitates disclosure of federal campaign finance data. The Federal Election Commission enforces campaign finance laws and administers the presidential public financing program. The agency is led by six presidentially appointed commissioners, and the Senate confirms their nominations. The 110th Congress passed a bill extending the FEC's Administrative Fine Program until 2013, which sets penalties for financial-reporting violations. The FEC is responsible for implementing changes to campaign finance law and regulations. The Federal Election Commission enforces campaign finance laws and administers the presidential public financing program. Internal commission issues, including \"deadlocked\" votes, are potentially noteworthy. Questions about the commission's structure and effectiveness have long been debated. Proposed bills in Congress aim to replace the FEC with a Federal Election Administration with enhanced enforcement powers. The Federal Election Commission faced challenges due to a loss of its policymaking quorum in 2008, resulting in inability to approve rules and enforcement actions. Congress may need to monitor the agency's recovery. Concerns were raised about deadlocked votes affecting enforcement issues. The FEC faced challenges in 2008 due to a loss of its policymaking quorum, leading to issues with rule approval and enforcement actions. In January 2009, the agency held hearings on operations issues, receiving both praise and criticism. The FEC is reconsidering its Internet presence and held hearings on the topic in July and August 2009. Nominations to the FEC have received legislative attention during the 111th Congress. Commissioner Ellen Weintraub's term expired in 2007, and she remains at the agency in holdover status. The terms of Commissioners Donald McGahn and Steven Walther expired on April 30, 2009; they may continue to serve in holdover status. President Obama announced his intention to nominate John J. Sullivan to replace Commissioner Weintraub. Various campaign finance interest groups took opposing positions on Sullivan's nomination. Groups such as the Campaign Legal Center and the Center for Competitive Politics disagreed about Sullivan's positions while representing the SEIU before the FEC. Sullivan clarified that his work reflected advocacy for his client, not his personal views on enforcing regulations. Three Senators expressed support for his nomination, but it received no further action in the Senate. President Obama withdrew the nomination in August 2010. Hybrid advertising involves a clearly identified candidate and generic references to other party candidates. It raises legislative concerns due to cost-sharing practices, where the party and candidate's campaign committee split costs. An FEC rulemaking on this issue has been ongoing since May 2007. Critics argue that cost-sharing in hybrid ads could be a loophole allowing parties to improperly subsidize campaign spending, potentially undermining FECA regulations. Cost-sharing in hybrid advertising is a concern as it allows parties to improperly subsidize campaign spending. Critics argue that shared costs primarily benefit the named candidate, while the campaign committee only pays for a portion of the advertising. Some suggest attributing 100% of the cost to the candidate to close this loophole. Congress could either wait for ongoing FEC rulemaking or legislate specific cost-sharing requirements to address this issue. Congress may need to consider closing the loophole surrounding hybrid ads by legislating in a technical area typically left to the FEC. Opponents argue that existing FEC regulations provide enough guidance on cost-sharing arrangements, including hybrid advertising. Additional restrictions could limit parties' flexibility in allocating costs and may be seen as interfering with long-standing campaign practices. Joint fundraising committees played a significant role in the 2008 presidential race, supporting House and Senate contests as well. These committees are a legislative concern as they enable large contributions that may exceed FECA limits. In 2007-2008, individuals could donate up to $4,600 to a candidate campaign and up to $28,500 annually to national party committees. Contributions to state or local party committees were capped at $10,000 annually. In the 2008 election cycle, joint fundraising committees linked to Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns collected contributions exceeding legal limits. These committees received large donations, distributed them within legal limits to various political entities, including presidential campaigns, national party committees, and state party committees. Concerns have been raised about whether these joint committees bypass campaign finance laws. Interest groups have called on Congress to address this issue. The 111th Congress is urged to ban joint fundraising committees due to concerns about exceeding contribution limits. Four options exist: prohibition of joint committees, restricting candidate participation, limiting fund transfers, or amending regulations on coordination. If restrictions are imposed, individuals would have to contribute directly to political committees within FECA limits. Coordination restrictions on joint committees could limit transfers among committees, making contributions to a single source more difficult. Congress could choose to maintain the status quo regarding joint fundraising committees, which some believe are a way to support individual candidates while others see them as beneficial for party-building activities. Joint committees allow for efficient funneling of large contributions to targeted states and political committees within permissible limits. Despite ongoing discussions about public financing legislation, House and Senate campaigns have always been privately financed. Public financing of House and Senate campaigns has been a topic of congressional activity since the 1980s and early 1990s. Legislation for public financing has only passed once in the 102nd Congress, but was vetoed by President George H.W. Bush. Momentum for public financing legislation subsided in the mid-1990s and early 2000s, but has received renewed attention in recent Congresses with the introduction of five bills. Five bills in the 111th Congress proposed publicly funding House or Senate campaigns, offering grants to cover all costs for participating candidates. None of the bills advanced out of committee, but the Senate Rules and Administration Committee held a hearing on the issue in June 2007. The bills included mandates for public financing during House general elections, a \"clean money, clean elections\" model, and a combination of grants and matching funds for limiting campaign spending. Three bills in the 111th Congress propose voluntary public financing for congressional campaigns, offering a base subsidy, matching funds, and broadcast vouches. Participants would not have spending limits if private fundraising is limited to $100 contributions from individuals. H.R. 6116 aims to supersede H.R. 1826 and was reported by the House Administration Committee in September 2010. The debate over public financing of campaigns has been ongoing for over 50 years, with supporters arguing it can reduce political corruption and enhance electoral competition. Opponents of public financing argue that private financing is sufficient, and government-funded campaign subsidies are seen as \"welfare for politicians.\" Constitutional concerns are raised over spending limits that come with public financing proposals. Designing a program that provides enough benefits for robust campaigns is a key question. The bills H.R. 6116, H.R. 1826, and S. 752 propose voluntary public financing for congressional campaigns. The bills H.R. 6116, H.R. 1826, and S. 752 propose public financing for congressional campaigns without limiting participants' expenditures, as long as they are funded by small dollar contributions or public financing funds. Concerns remain about the influence of private money in politics and the potential for financial influence from less accountable sources. The 2008 election cycle raised concerns about the presidential public financing system due to low taxpayer participation and funding shortfalls. Major candidates saw a decline in public participation and financial resources, leading to the need for reform. Senator McCain was one of eight candidates who received matching funds during the primaries. Senator Obama, the Democratic nominee, declined public funds during the general-election campaign, marking a shift away from the traditional public financing program. Some believe this decision, along with other challenges, may signal the end of the program, while others argue for reform to revive its effectiveness. Public financing was once a major funding source for presidential campaigns, but recent elections have seen a decline in its appeal to candidates. Joint fundraising committees have also posed a threat to the program's original goal of limiting private fundraising in exchange for public funds. The public financing program for presidential campaigns may need to be revamped to attract more competitive candidates. There is a consensus that maintaining the status quo could lead to only less viable candidates receiving funding. Efforts to make the program more appealing, such as increasing spending limits, are being considered despite potential costs. The role of public financing in presidential campaigns is a key policy question for Congress to address. Public financing for presidential campaigns may require changes to attract competitive candidates. Efforts to increase spending limits or find other revenue sources may be necessary. Strong political will and coalition-building will be crucial for enacting any program changes. The issue of small contributions has also been a prominent topic of debate, with proposals for additional matching funds. Two bills to revamp the presidential public financing system were introduced in late July 2010. Efforts to revamp the presidential public financing system were introduced in late July 2010 with bills like H.R. 6061 and S. 3681. Previous proposals in the 110th Congress suggested increasing the match rate for small contributions to 400% or 500% and lowering the maximum matching contribution to $200. This could provide more resources to publicly financed candidates, but it depends on the availability of funds in the PECF. Efforts to reform the public financing program include proposals to focus on small contributions and revise funding mechanisms. This could encourage candidates to prioritize small donations, but may not necessarily reduce campaign costs, especially for those who can raise and spend unlimited amounts. Eliminating spending limits could make public financing an unnecessary funding source for some candidates. Public financing for presidential campaigns could be repealed, eliminating taxpayer funds. Bills in Congress have been introduced to repeal parts or the entire program, but none have advanced. Recent focus has been on political committees, including candidate committees, party committees, and PACs, with \"527\" organizations also playing a role in elections. The 527 issue involves concerns about unregulated money affecting federal elections, with research showing decreased activity among 527s in the 2008 cycle compared to 2004. Financial summaries from CQ MoneyLine and the Center for Responsive Politics indicate lower receipts and expenditures for 527s in 2008. The 527 issue, involving concerns about unregulated money in federal elections, saw decreased financial activity in the 2008 cycle compared to 2004. Despite this, the regulation of 527s remains controversial, with the FEC making case-by-case determinations on whether they should be treated as political committees under FECA. Major fines were imposed on some 527s post-2004 elections for failing to register as political committees. Some critics argue that fines for 527s were insufficient as they were imposed well after the election and were a small part of their budgets. There is ongoing controversy over FEC enforcement of 527s. Proposed legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to treat 527s as political committees, subjecting them to contribution limits and other FECA requirements. Advocates for more regulation believe 527s influence federal elections and should be regulated under FECA. H.R. 512, passed by the House in 2010, aims to amend FECA by prohibiting chief State election officials from actively participating in federal election campaigns if they have supervisory authority. This bill would restrict their involvement in managing elections for federal candidates. The bill H.R. 512 aims to prevent chief election officials from participating in federal election campaigns to reduce conflicts of interest. Some concerns were raised about limiting officials' political activities, but supporters argue it is necessary to maintain objectivity in election administration. Representative Susan Davis supports H.R. 512 to prevent corruption and enhance integrity in elections. The bill focuses on conflicts of interest among state election officials, specifically prohibiting them from involvement in federal campaigns. The bill H.R. 512 aims to prevent corruption and enhance integrity in elections by prohibiting state election officials from active involvement in federal campaigns. There is ambiguity regarding the term \"member\" in the bill, which could be clarified by Congress or the FEC through rulemaking if the bill becomes law. Some believe that the campaign finance system needs significant reform due to the increase in money flowing through recent election cycles, while others argue that the focus should be on regulating the money in politics. The focus is on regulating the money in politics, with debates on campaign finance policy during the 111th Congress. Issues discussed are tied to recent elections, and consensus on regulating campaign facets can be challenging. The debate revolves around common themes in campaign finance policy, with disagreements on approaches. The question of whether there is \"too much\" money in American elections is a contentious topic. The debate over the amount of money in American elections is contentious, with some seeing potential corruption and distraction for candidates, while others view fundraising as a test of political viability. The issue remains unresolved, but there are calls for legislation or oversight on funding sources. The debate over 527s and public financing also highlight ongoing disagreements on campaign spending limits. Campaign finance policy debates often focus on steering candidates towards lower spending and limiting private fundraising through incentives or requirements. Questions arise about regulating funding sources like bundling, hybrid advertising, and joint fundraising. Transparency is key, usually achieved through disclosure of campaign activities and amounts. The debate over electronic filing of Senate campaign finance reports is linked to transparency concerns, with some advocating for more efficient electronic filing. Other recent issues in campaign finance may also be considered. The 111th Congress is reconsidering campaign finance issues, including new disclosure requirements related to bundling. Questions about which behaviors should be regulated by FECA or FEC are at the forefront of debate. These policy issues may involve placing new requirements on the regulated community. The report discusses potential new requirements for the regulated community, focusing on bundling, electronic filing, hybrid advertising, joint fundraising, presidential public financing, and 527s. Congress may reevaluate the FEC's structure and effectiveness. Key questions include whether to address campaign finance issues individually or collectively, with interconnected issues such as presidential campaign financing, public financing, bundling, hybrid advertising, and joint fundraising."
