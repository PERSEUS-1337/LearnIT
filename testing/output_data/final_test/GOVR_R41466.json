    "content": "During the mid-1970s, investigations revealed questionable payments by US corporations to foreign officials. Legal actions by the SEC and DOJ were taken against firms for concealing such payments. More stringent regulations were deemed necessary to address the issue of foreign bribery and improve corporate accountability. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977 was passed in response to revelations of corporate bribery of foreign officials by American corporations. The Act aimed to improve corporate accountability by requiring detailed record-keeping and internal accounting controls for SEC registered issuers. The 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act required SEC registered issuers to maintain internal accounting controls and prohibited American businesses from bribing foreign officials to obtain or retain business. The 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibited businesses from paying money to bribe foreign officials for business influence. It placed responsibility on corporations to control their officers and agents to prevent bribery. Certain payments to foreign government employees were not considered illegal bribes, such as those with ministerial or clerical duties, and \"grease payments\" for expediting shipments. The 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibited businesses from paying bribes to foreign officials for business influence. Some payments to foreign government employees were not considered illegal bribes, such as those for expediting shipments. Critics argued that the act had a chilling effect on US export trade and called for the removal of the \"reason to know\" standard. Critics of the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act called for the removal of the \"reason to know\" standard regarding liability for a firm's agent in a foreign country. They argued that American firms should not have to bear the responsibility of monitoring the independent actions of their agents abroad. Additionally, critics believed that the internal accounting controls mandated by the act were too costly and burdensome for domestic firms. Critics of the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act argued for a materiality standard in public recordkeeping and criticized the act for imposing cultural biases on other nations. They also opposed the \"reason to know\" standard for liability of a firm's agent in a foreign country. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Amendments of 1988 were signed into law to prevent unfair competition by foreign businesses. The amendments made significant changes to the 1977 Act, maintaining accounting standards, SEC issuer requirements, and anti-bribery provisions. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Amendments of 1988 made changes to the Exchange Act, stating that criminal liability for violating accounting standards requires knowing circumvention or failure to implement accurate accounting controls. The amendments aimed to impose penalties for deliberate falsification of books and records and evasion of accounting controls. Additionally, Section 5002 of the Trade Act added a provision to the Securities Exchange Act requiring issuers with less than 50% voting power to use their influence in good faith. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Amendments of 1988 aimed to impose penalties for deliberate falsification of books and records and evasion of accounting controls. Section 5003 of the Trade Act amended the provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act concerning anti-bribery prohibitions by issuers and domestic concerns. The amendment recognized that a minority owner cannot exert a disproportionate degree of influence over accounting practices. \"Reasonable assurances\" and \"reasonable detail\" mean a level of detail and assurance that would satisfy prudent officials. The prudent man qualification clarifies that the standard does not require unrealistic exactitude. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Amendments of 1988 aimed to impose penalties for deliberate falsification of books and records and evasion of accounting controls. Section 5003 of the Trade Act amended the provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act concerning anti-bribery prohibitions by issuers and domestic concerns. The amendment aligned the foreign bribery standard with the domestic bribery standard found in 18 U.S.C. Section 201 by prohibiting payments to foreign officials for influencing their official acts or inducing them to violate their lawful duties. The \"knowing\" requirement was retained, and the \"recklessly disregarding\" standard was abandoned. The 1988 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Amendments aimed to penalize deliberate falsification of records and evasion of accounting controls. Section 5003 of the Trade Act aligned the foreign bribery standard with domestic bribery laws, retaining the \"knowing\" requirement and abandoning the \"recklessly disregarding\" standard. The amendment aimed to cover situations of \"conscious disregard,\" \"willful blindness,\" or \"deliberate ignorance\" to prevent management officials from avoiding liability for FCPA violations. The 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, amended in 1988, clarified when bribery provisions apply to American businesses or individuals. The amendments allowed for certain affirmative defenses, such as lawful payments under foreign laws or reasonable expenditures like travel expenses. The 1988 Amendments to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act clarified that certain expenditures, such as travel and lodging expenses for foreign officials, must be directly related to promoting products or services or executing a contract with a foreign government. The defense does not apply if a payment is made corruptly in exchange for an official act. The terms \"knowing\" and \"routine governmental action\" are crucial in determining intent. The term \"knowing\" in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act refers to having a firm belief or high probability that a circumstance exists. \"Routine governmental action\" includes common tasks performed by foreign officials, but does not cover decisions made by them. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act imposes criminal penalties for violations, including increased fines and imprisonment for individuals and corporations. In 1998, the act was amended to implement the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Officials. The 1998 Amendments to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act expanded coverage to include certain foreign nationals and extended jurisdiction beyond the US borders. Criticisms of the Act have included concerns about competitive disadvantages and unethical payments. Bills to amend the Act have been more prevalent in earlier Congresses. For example, during the 111th Congress, there was interest in prohibiting convicted businesses from receiving government contracts. H.R. 5366 aimed to debar individuals violating the FCPA from government contracts. The House passed the bill to prevent bribery by federal government contractors. H.R. 5837 would have required certification of compliance with the FCPA for government contract eligibility. In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to address criticisms of the FCPA. H.R. 2152 aimed to allow a private right of action for violations, while H.R. 3531 sought to authorize a private right of action against foreign businesses that harm U.S. companies through bribery. H.R. 3588 proposed debarring FCPA violators from federal contracts. The FCPA prohibits persons guilty of violations from federal government contracts. Bills in the 113th and 114th Congress aimed to apply the FCPA to immigrant visa applications. The DOJ and SEC enforce the Act for criminal and civil violations respectively. The DOJ is increasing efforts to find violators, as seen in recent cases like United States v. Esquenazi. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that two employees of a U.S. company were guilty of bribery under the FCPA for making payments to a foreign government entity. This case is significant as it clarifies the definition of \"foreign official\" under the FCPA. Other DOJ actions involve individuals in the military and law enforcement industry indicted for bribing foreign officials. The government's FCPA cases have had mixed outcomes, with some resolved through plea deals or settlements, like Mercator Corporation's case involving illegal payments to a Kazakh official. The DOJ has taken action against companies for violating the FCPA, such as Marubeni Corporation paying a $54.6 million penalty for bribing the Nigerian government. Investigations into FCPA violations have been conducted on companies like Merck and Blackwater (Xe), with some cases going to trial and others being closed without charges. The SEC has also taken action against companies for FCPA violations, with settlements like VimpelCom's $795 million global settlement for violations in Uzbekistan and Bristol-Myers Squibb's $14 million settlement for improper payments in China. Hitachi also settled for $19 million for inaccurately recorded payments to South Africa's ruling party. The SEC fined Hitachi for inaccurately recording improper payments to South Africa's ruling party to secure contracts for power plants, and BNY Mellon for providing student internships to family members of foreign government officials linked to a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund."
