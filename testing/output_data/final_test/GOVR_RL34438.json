    "content": "In the past three decades, the U.S. government and international community have increasingly recognized violence against women (VAW) as a human rights problem with global health implications. This shift was driven by grassroots women's NGOs bringing attention to VAW as a violation of human rights. U.S. policymakers have mainly addressed VAW as part of broader international development efforts rather than as a standalone issue. The U.S. government and international community have recognized violence against women (VAW) as a human rights issue with global health implications. Congress has funded programs addressing various forms of VAW, such as trafficking and female genital cutting. However, there is a lack of government-wide coordination in addressing international VAW, leading to calls for enhanced efforts to combat violence against women. The report identifies types of VAW and consequences of violence against women. It highlights U.S. government programs working to reduce international VAW and suggests policy considerations for Congress. The U.N. General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women in 1993. The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women (DEVAW) defines VAW as any gender-based violence causing physical, sexual, or psychological harm to women. Despite international adoption of DEVAW, definitions of VAW vary among governments, organizations, and cultures, impacting policymakers. VAW is defined differently by various entities, affecting the measurement and addressing of violence. Some do not consider psychological abuse as VAW, while others argue for a broader definition. It is seen as a result of unequal power dynamics between genders, leading to cultural stereotypes that perpetuate violence. Research has identified community and individual risk factors that contribute to violence against women (VAW), including cultural norms, high crime levels, poor economic conditions, and a lack of legal protection. Women facing VAW may experience social and economic consequences, such as difficulty in participating fully in their communities and increased likelihood of living in poverty. Women who experience violence are less likely to hold jobs and live in poverty. Violence and fear may lead to avoidance of public places like schools and workplaces. Research shows a decrease in political participation and development projects due to physical threats. Harassment and sexual abuse contribute to low female enrollment and high dropout rates in secondary schools. Victims suffer severe physical and mental health consequences, with increased risks of poor physical and reproductive health. The impacts of VAW can be immediate (fractures, gunshot wounds, bruises, death) or functional (long-term health consequences like gastrointestinal disorders, chronic pain). WHO surveys estimate 10-69% of women have been physically harmed by a male partner. Developing countries may have higher rates of violence against women. Research indicates that women in developing countries may experience higher rates of violence, with approximately one in five women experiencing rape or attempted rape in their lifetime. Female mortality rates due to infanticide and neglect are high in some Asian and sub-Saharan African countries. Many incidents of violence go unreported due to shame and fear, with experts believing that reported cases represent only a minimum of actual VAW cases. Underreporting is common, especially in developing countries, where victims may view violence as normal behavior. Violence Against Women (VAW) is often underreported in many countries, with victims sometimes seeing it as normal behavior. Researchers face challenges in collecting data on VAW prevalence, especially in conflict situations. Lack of law enforcement infrastructure and reporting services in some communities may discourage women from reporting abuse. VAW can occur in various settings, including homes, workplaces, schools, and state institutions. Custodial VAW, such as violence in prisons and detention centers, is reported globally, but its prevalence is not well quantified. Violence Against Women (VAW) is prevalent globally, with schools being a common setting for abuse in developing countries. In Ecuador, 22% of women reported being sexually abused in school. Research shows that women are most likely to experience violence from people they know, including authority figures, parents, sons, husbands, and partners. Intimate partner violence is a common form of VAW. Studies show that intimate partner violence is a common form of Violence Against Women (VAW), including forced sex, physical violence, and psychological abuse like isolation. Other types of VAW include honor killings in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries, dowry-related violence in South Asia, and female genital cutting in some African and Middle Eastern countries. Female genital cutting, also known as female circumcision, is prevalent in some African and Middle Eastern countries. The World Health Organization estimates that millions of women and girls have undergone this procedure, with millions more at risk each year. Child and adolescent marriage, common in parts of the Middle East and Africa, is considered a form of violence against women, with girls as young as 10 or 12 being married to older men. These harmful traditional practices, including female genital cutting, intimate partner violence, and child marriage, are damaging to women despite being socially acceptable in some communities. \"Harmful traditional practices, such as FGC, intimate partner violence, and child marriage, perpetuate unbalanced sex stereotypes and a cycle of violence. Perspectives on what constitutes harmful traditional practices vary, with some cultures justifying violence as punishment for female disobedience. International advocates argue for addressing these practices through anti-VAW programs.\" Some experts argue that harmful traditional practices cannot be significantly altered without sustained, long-term efforts on the local level with national and international support. The challenge lies in finding the right balance between human rights and preserving culture. The U.S. government does not track the cost or number of current anti-VAW programs, making it unclear how much money is spent annually. The U.S. government implements anti-VAW programs through various agencies like USAID, DOS, DOD, HHS, DOJ, DOL, DHS, and the Peace Corps. Around 350 U.S. government programs with VAW components have been identified, making it challenging to capture the overall response to VAW. The U.S. government response to violence against women (VAW) is complex due to the numerous programs across different agencies. Funding levels for these programs varied from $10,000 to $15 million in FY2006 and FY2007, with only a small portion dedicated to anti-VAW efforts. Approximately 10% of reported programs operated globally, with others spread across different regions. The Obama Administration has prioritized women's issues, including VAW, in U.S. foreign policy. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has focused on addressing violence against women (VAW) in U.S. foreign policy, particularly sexual violence in conflict. She played a key role in the adoption of U.N. Security Council Resolutions on sexual violence in conflict and obstacles to women's involvement in peace processes. In 2010, she established the Secretary's International Fund for Women and Girls to combat VAW through grants for NGO activities. The Obama Administration also prioritized addressing VAW in specific countries, especially in Africa. In August 2009, Secretary of State Clinton announced $17 million in new funding to combat sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Obama Administration requested $117.2 million for global programs addressing gender-based violence, with specific allocations for different regions. The Bush Administration supported programs addressing international violence against women (VAW) as a foreign policy priority. While not focusing solely on VAW, it initiated government-wide programs with prevention, treatment, and protection components within broader missions. These components were often a small part of program budgets, including initiatives in HIV/AIDS relief, the Middle East Partnership Initiative, Women's Justice and Empowerment, and addressing violence against women in Darfur, Sudan. The Administration strongly supported U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1325 and 1820 on women, peace, and security, and U.S. agencies participate in working groups addressing international violence against women. The National Security Staff leads the International Violence Against Women Working Group, which includes State Department, USAID, DOJ, MCC, and others. USAID collaborates with NGOs through the Interagency Gender Working Group, prioritizing GBV. In 2011, USAID established a policy task team for gender equality and women's empowerment. The U.S. government has established various task teams and working groups to address gender equality, women's empowerment, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking. President Obama issued an executive order in 2009 to create the White House Council on Women and Girls, which serves as an advisory body to coordinate federal responses to issues impacting women. The White House Council on Women and Girls was established by President Obama in 2009 to coordinate federal responses to issues impacting women. The Council, comprised of Cabinet members and high-level officials, is tasked with developing a federal interagency plan to address violence against women and ensure consistency across agencies. The U.S. government's efforts to combat violence against women lack tracking of programs and funding, making it challenging to assess the impact of initiatives. The physical and psychological health impacts of violence against women (VAW) are wide-ranging, including miscarriage, STD transmission, and mental health issues. VAW can lead to negative outcomes such as abortion, suicide attempts, partner violence, and even death. Limited data exists on the frequency of women being killed by spouses or family members in some cultures. In some cultures, unmarried women facing unintended pregnancies may face social isolation. Forced marriage and pregnancy in young girls can lead to complications like death or health issues. Violence against women can result in psychological problems, substance abuse, suicide attempts, and post-traumatic stress syndrome. Victims of rape, intimate partner violence, and child sex abuse experience higher levels of post-traumatic stress. Rape victims are more likely to experience higher levels of post-traumatic stress and attempt suicide. USAID, HHS, and other agencies support health-related violence against women prevention programs globally. PEPFAR allocates resources to address the health consequences of violence against women, with $104 million supporting activities with a gender-based violence component in FY2006. The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) allocated $1 billion in FY2008 for activities with a gender focus, including 407 addressing violence and coercion. In 2010, PEPFAR intensified its focus on gender-based violence (GBV) with a $30 million commitment, particularly in the DRC, Mozambique, and Tanzania. PEPFAR is part of a public-private partnership, Together for Girls, working to combat GBV at the country level. The Bureau of Global Health (GH) supports VAW prevention and response activities, including those related to intimate partner violence, sexual violence, coercion, and female genital cutting (FGC). USAID programs educate on these issues, advocate against sexual abuse, provide services for rape survivors, and promote safe sex negotiation. GH also focuses on deterring FGC through prevention, awareness, and treatment efforts in various countries. USAID and HHS support international programs for data collection and analysis on violence's impact on reproductive health. CDC's MEASURE program works with USAID to conduct national reproductive health surveys, including data on violence against women. NCIPC collaborates with partners to assess violence patterns and prevention strategies. HHS and WHO collaborate on prevention strategies for violence against women and children, including in conflict and post-conflict settings. CDC's Global AIDS Program supports programs addressing the link between violence against women and HIV, such as post-exposure prophylaxis and strengthening health, community, and legal services for survivors. Levels of violence against women (VAW) increase during conflict and remain a significant risk in post-conflict and emergency situations. Displaced individuals, including refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, with women and girls making up close to 50% of displaced populations. Sexual violence, including rape and exploitation, is common during crises, highlighting the need for protection and support for survivors. In conflict and emergency situations, violence against women (VAW) increases, with displaced individuals being especially vulnerable. Survivors face emotional and physical health risks, unwanted pregnancies, and rejection by their communities. Perpetrators often go unpunished due to fear, lawlessness, and lack of judicial enforcement. Humanitarian workers can also be perpetrators of VAW. This issue is prevalent in conflict settings worldwide, including Darfur, DRC, Pakistan, and Colombia. In crisis settings, various international entities collaborate on prevention and response strategies to protect vulnerable populations, especially women and girls. Efforts focus on strengthening the protection of displaced women, promoting gender equality, and increasing the capacity of states and host communities. U.S. activities addressing gender-based violence (GBV) in humanitarian and refugee/IDP settings are integrated into other programs, making it challenging to quantify the total scope of these initiatives. Some projects now prioritize addressing GBV specifically in the humanitarian sector. In the humanitarian sector, the U.S. government's response to gender-based violence (GBV) is coordinated by the State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) and USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA). Implementing partners include U.N. agencies, international organizations, and NGOs. PRM has allocated over $60 million towards targeted GBV programming for refugee and IDP populations since FY2000. PRM funds projects to address GBV, support integrated activities, and develop policies with international partners. Recent projects include capacity building for Afghan refugees, vulnerability reduction for Rohingya community in Bangladesh, and GBV prevention in Colombia. Global programs focus on accountability of humanitarian workers, protection for vulnerable people, and support for GBV survivors. USAID/DCHA supports response and prevention projects in humanitarian operations through its implementing partners, including programs in Liberia, Uganda, Darfur, DRC, Sri Lanka, and Kenya. Projects aim to address sexual exploitation and violence, provide energy-efficient stoves to reduce women's exposure to abuse, and support health and livelihood recovery programs. In Darfur, a $15 million initiative focused on improving the physical safety of vulnerable populations, including women. In FY2010, DCHA funded approximately $7.5 million in stand-alone protection programs. In FY2010, DCHA funded $7.5 million in protection programs addressing GBV in humanitarian situations, including projects on natural disasters' impact on GBV and post-conflict support. Projects were funded through grants to local and international organizations. Awareness training for foreign military and peacekeeping troops was highlighted after events in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2004. Cases of sexual exploitation and abuse by U.N. peacekeepers were documented in various regions in the 1990s and early 2000s. In response to incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse by U.N. peacekeepers in regions like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Cambodia, East Timor, and West Africa, the U.N. Secretary General recommended intensive training for peacekeepers. The Department of Defense has integrated VAW training into programs for military forces involved in disaster and humanitarian relief operations, with funding typically included in overall program budgets. DOD educational institutions have incorporated VAW topics into their curricula, with the Center of Excellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance reporting an increasing number of training modules on VAW and SEA. A growing number of training modules on violence against women and sexual exploitation and abuse are offered worldwide to foreign government personnel, including civilians, military, and police, as well as NGOs. The Defense Institute of International Legal Studies (DIILS) provides various training programs related to gender-based violence, including in resident courses at its facility in Rhode Island and mobile courses abroad. DIILS also includes instruction on violence against women in its peacekeeping program curriculum and seminars on the Law of Armed Conflict. DIILS conducts programs to build military justice capacity in post-conflict countries, emphasizing human rights and the protection of non-combatant women. They address violence against women in special courses for foreign militaries. The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) also includes VAW content in its training exercises for foreign peacekeepers. The State Department report to Congress highlights the success of the African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) program in promoting exemplary conduct among African peacekeepers. Despite acknowledging that training cannot guarantee good conduct, no ACOTA-trained peacekeepers have been implicated in VAW/SEA misconduct since the program's inception in 1997. Congress has also worked to incorporate VAW awareness into foreign military training. The State Department report to Congress highlighted the success of the African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) program in promoting exemplary conduct among African peacekeepers. Training on gender-based violence is required in programs funded through bilateral assistance and military accounts. Congress has also requested reports on programs addressing sexual violence and gender-based violence in foreign police, judicial, and military training programs. Trafficking in women and girls is a high-profile form of violence against women. Human trafficking, defined by P.L. 106-386, includes sex trafficking induced by force, fraud, or coercion, and labor trafficking through the use of force or coercion. Examples affecting women and girls are forced labor, child soldiering, and sex trafficking. Various forms of coercion, including debt bondage, are used to exploit victims. Domestic violence is a risk factor for sex trafficking and exploitation. Domestic violence is a risk factor for sex trafficking and exploitation, with gender-based violence being a common experience for victims of human trafficking. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by human trafficking, with studies showing that 65%-75% of victims are women and 15%-25% are minors. Women and girls account for 56% of victims of forced economic exploitation and 98% of victims of forced commercial sexual exploitation. The vulnerability of women and girls to sexual exploitation is influenced by various factors in different countries. Most trafficked women are under 25 years old, with many in their teens. Trafficking victims also have higher rates of HIV/AIDS infection. Countries experiencing political upheaval, armed conflict, economic crisis, or natural disasters are more likely to become sources of human trafficking. Inadequate legal protection, discriminatory attitudes, and lack of education and job opportunities also contribute to trafficking. The vulnerability of women and girls to trafficking is influenced by factors such as discrimination, lack of opportunities, and poverty in source countries. Poor and minority women are especially at risk, with some families selling their daughters to avoid dowries. Female migrant workers are also vulnerable due to their economic and political status. The intersection of gender-based violence and trafficking presents a challenge for policymakers. The U.S. government supports various initiatives to address these issues. The U.S. government supports anti-trafficking initiatives overseas, focusing on prevention, protection, and prosecution. Programs aim to raise awareness, provide education and employment opportunities for at-risk individuals, particularly women and girls. Protection efforts include supporting shelters and training service providers to identify and assist trafficking victims. The U.S. government supports anti-trafficking initiatives overseas, focusing on prevention, protection, and prosecution. Programs aim to identify and protect trafficking victims, improve prosecution rates of traffickers, and help countries enforce anti-trafficking laws. The annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report ranks countries based on their commitment to combating human trafficking, with Tier 3 countries facing potential U.S. foreign assistance withholding. In FY2010, the U.S. government allocated $85.3 million in international anti-trafficking assistance to over 80 countries, an increase from the previous year. Various acts such as TVPRA and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act have authorized appropriations for anti-trafficking programs, including increased technical assistance to help foreign governments combat forced labor and protect migrant workers. The U.S. government provides funding for anti-trafficking programs abroad through agencies like the State Department, USAID, and the Department of Labor. These programs focus on victim assistance, prevention, public awareness campaigns, and law enforcement efforts. USAID supports prevention programs, protection programs, and training for law enforcement officials. The Department of Labor works to provide assistance to foreign migrant workers. The U.S. government funds anti-trafficking programs abroad through agencies like the State Department, USAID, and the Department of Labor. These programs focus on victim assistance, prevention, public awareness campaigns, and law enforcement efforts. Additionally, experts emphasize the need to strengthen political, legal, and law enforcement institutions to address violence against women globally, especially in developing countries where these institutions may hinder rather than help women seeking assistance. In developing countries, weaknesses in government institutions can be exacerbated by poverty and corruption. Advocates stress the importance of educating and training women to combat violence and gender discrimination. The U.S. government supports programs to enhance women's legal and political capabilities, including the Women's Justice and Empowerment Initiative. However, quantifying the number and cost of programs addressing violence against women is challenging. The Obama Administration has focused on women's empowerment in Africa and Zambia, with concerns raised about funding delays for the Women's Justice and Empowerment Initiative (WJEI). The Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) has also supported programs on violence against women (VAW), including training for judges on honor killings and intimate partner violence. USAID established a $14 million global grant program to increase women's involvement in peace processes, in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325. The State Department, USAID, and DOJ have backed programs to strengthen national governments' legal and political capacity. The State Department and USAID have funded initiatives in sub-Saharan Africa to support the rule of law, women's empowerment, and democracy. Programs aim to strengthen women's economic and legal rights in various countries, advocate for the enforcement of laws against harmful practices, and train specialists to influence foreign governments on addressing violence against women. Additionally, efforts include working with governments and NGOs to draft legislation on women's rights and promoting safe schools programs. The USAID Safe Schools program collaborates with partners at different levels to combat school-related gender-based violence. International organizations, including the United Nations and its agencies, support various programs addressing violence against women globally. The U.N. system has 36 entities working on anti-VAW activities, ranging from interagency efforts to smaller programs implemented by NGOs, national governments, or individual U.N. agencies. Agencies involved in combating VAW include UNDP, UNICEF, UN Women, WHO, ILO, UNAIDS, and UNODC. The United Nations and its agencies, including WHO, ILO, UNAIDS, UNODC, UNFPA, and UNHCR, are actively involved in addressing violence against women. The U.N. Secretariat's Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and U.N. funds and programs work to combat violence against women by peacekeepers and through interagency activities. U.N. Action coordinates efforts of 13 U.N. entities to improve the response to sexual violence before and after conflict, focusing on capacity building, training, strengthening services for survivors, addressing gender imbalances, and raising public awareness. The United Nations and its agencies, including WHO, ILO, UNAIDS, UNODC, UNFPA, and UNHCR, are actively involved in addressing violence against women. U.N. member states participate in international conventions and agreements to address VAW and women's rights, such as CEDAW, CRC, and the Trafficking Protocol. World Conferences on Women and U.N. Security Council resolutions also demonstrate concern for VAW. The Fourth Conference in Beijing in 1995 identified VAW as a human rights concern and obstacle to women's equality. The United Nations and its agencies address violence against women as a human rights concern and obstacle to women's equality. U.N. Security Council Resolutions highlight the need to protect women and girls from human rights abuses. International efforts involve NGOs, international financial institutions, and organizations like the World Bank and European Union in implementing anti-VAW initiatives globally. The Organization of American States (OAS) and the United Nations address violence against women as a human rights concern. The OAS Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women aims to prevent, punish, and eradicate violence. The United States has not signed or ratified the Convention, but Congress has shown interest in addressing international violence against women through legislation on specific types of violence. The US Congress has passed legislation addressing various types of violence against women (VAW), including human trafficking and female genital cutting (FGC), in different regions such as Africa and Asia. They have also incorporated VAW components into programs addressing international HIV/AIDS prevention and foreign military/law enforcement training. Congress has committed resources to the U.N. Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence Against Women. Additionally, there were unsuccessful attempts in the 110th and 111th Congresses to pass the International Violence Against Women Act, which aimed to coordinate and provide additional funding for US efforts to address VAW overseas. The 112th Congress may need to consider various issues related to addressing VAW both domestically and internationally. Some experts argue that current U.S. government programs do not adequately address international violence against women, citing insufficient funding levels and short program durations. They suggest that the emphasis on programs with VAW components may create a misleading perception of significant U.S. commitment to combating international VAW. The United States has been criticized for not doing enough to address gender-based violence. Some programs, like the Women's Justice Empowerment Initiative, were not fully funded or implemented. There are debates on whether anti-VAW efforts should be more integrated into U.S. foreign assistance programs. Some argue that additional funding is needed to coordinate government-wide efforts and fund U.S. programs addressing violence against women (VAW). There are concerns about the lack of coordination and data collection in anti-VAW efforts, leading to difficulty in assessing the adequacy of U.S. programs. Suggestions include actively tracking anti-VAW programs, establishing mechanisms to identify gaps, and creating a dedicated office or coordinating body for addressing VAW. Some experts argue for supporting international organizations addressing violence against women (VAW) to share costs and resources. Opponents suggest focusing on U.S. anti-VAW initiatives, as U.N. activities may not align with U.S. priorities. Congress could consider using U.N. mechanisms for combating VAW, with various programs available. The United Nations and its agencies support programs to eliminate violence against women, including the U.N. Trust Fund. Policymakers see the Trust Fund as a tool to combat international violence against women. Addressing VAW is a significant challenge for the U.S. government and the international community. Many developing countries lack the necessary infrastructure to address violence against women. A 2006 U.N. study revealed that over half of U.N. member states do not have laws addressing intimate partner violence. Despite some progress, obstacles such as poverty and political unrest hinder efforts to combat VAW in many countries. Some national governments support anti-VAW policies, but ineffective infrastructures hinder implementation and enforcement. Experts disagree on effective methods, funding levels, and program focus. Debate exists on balancing women's rights and freedom of choice, as well as resource allocation for treatment versus prevention of violence. Many anti-VAW programs lack evaluation for effectiveness due to short durations and small budgets, leading to difficulty in gauging impact and allocating resources efficiently. Analysts are recognizing the importance of program evaluation and are working to improve data collection and coordination among funding and implementing organizations. Some experts advocate for additional funding for program evaluations in anti-VAW projects to improve coordination and share best practices. Existing VAW research lacks comparative data due to varied methodologies and sampling techniques, hindering policymakers in addressing the issue. Efforts are being made to streamline survey processes and create international indicators for violence against women. In recent years, there has been an increase in research on violence against women (VAW) as awareness of the issue has grown. Governments, international organizations, and NGOs are recognizing the link between VAW, particularly sexual violence in conflict situations, and national and international security. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1820 in 2008 emphasized the importance of preventing and responding to sexual violence for international peace and security. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton highlighted the need to address VAW for overall security and success of nations. Supporters argue that sexual violence in armed conflict threatens public order, prolongs conflict, and hinders long-term peace. They highlight the impact on women's participation in society and the potential for destabilizing communities. Research on VAW now includes root causes, with a focus on the role of men and boys in prevention. NGOs and governments have developed initiatives like school curricula and public awareness campaigns. Some NGOs and governments have developed initiatives to educate boys and men on the negative consequences of violence against women, including rehabilitating perpetrators and challenging traditional masculinity. Research has shown a correlation between HIV/AIDS and violence against women, with women in developing countries disproportionately affected by HIV. Women who are victims of violence are more likely to contract HIV, indicating a possible correlation between rates of HIV in women and violence. Rates of HIV in women are linked to violence, as women who experience or fear violence are less likely to use condoms, increasing their risk of HIV. Rape makes women more susceptible to HIV due to tearing. Experts connect violence against women to discrimination, viewing it as a form of discrimination that also causes violence. To combat violence against women, equal attention should be given to the causes and impacts of female discrimination, which can lead to unequal power dynamics between men and women. Discriminated women may lack education, healthcare access, property rights, and inheritance rights. Some developed countries have studied the economic costs of violence against women, finding significant societal costs. For example, Canadian researchers estimated over $4 billion in damage from violence against women. Studies analyze short-term and long-term costs like healthcare, legal expenses, reduced employment, and productivity levels. Estimating the economic impact of pain and suffering inflicted on women by violence is challenging. Existing research underestimates the economic consequences of violence against women due to its complex and wide-ranging impact on society."
