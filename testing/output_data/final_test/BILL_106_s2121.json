    "content": "PART J of title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to create the Rural Education Initiative Act of 1999. The National Center for Educational Statistics reports that 46% of public schools serve rural areas. Federal education policy does not address the unique needs of rural schools, leading to challenges in accessing grant funds. Rural schools struggle to compete for federal funding due to lack of resources and personnel for grant applications. Rural schools face challenges in hiring and retaining qualified administrators and teachers, especially in reading, science, and mathematics. They also struggle with shrinking tax bases, high transportation costs, aging buildings, limited course offerings, and resources. The Small and Rural School Program authorizes a formula grant program to support rural schools facing challenges in hiring and retaining qualified staff, shrinking tax bases, high transportation costs, and limited resources. An eligible local educational agency can use funding from the State educational agency to support education reform efforts aimed at improving academic achievement and instruction quality for elementary and secondary school students. The agency must notify the State educational agency of its intention to use the funding by a specified date. Eligibility criteria apply to local educational agencies. Local educational agencies with fewer than 600 students in attendance and located in rural communities with specific codes are eligible for funding. Waivers can be granted by the Secretary for agencies meeting student criteria. The Secretary can waive criteria for rural educational agencies based on certification. Applicable funding includes funds from various titles disbursed to agencies for alternative uses. The agency disburses funding to local educational agencies for specific uses, ensuring that the funds supplement and do not replace other federal, state, or local education funds. References to funds for certain provisions in federal law can be considered as funds for this section. \"SEC. 10962. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\" The Secretary can award grants to eligible local educational agencies to support education reform efforts for improving academic achievement of students. Local agencies qualify if they have fewer than 600 students and are located in rural communities with specific codes. The Secretary of Agriculture determines if a local educational agency qualifies for a grant based on specific criteria. The agency can request a waiver if it meets certain conditions and is located in a rural area certified by a governmental agency. Grants are awarded to eligible local educational agencies for education reform efforts to improve student academic achievement. The Secretary awards grants to eligible local educational agencies based on student attendance and a set initial amount. The initial amount is calculated as $100 multiplied by the total number of students plus $20,000, not exceeding $60,000. If funds are insufficient, adjustments may be made to distribute the grants. The Secretary will reduce payments to local educational agencies if they do not pay in full the amounts eligible under paragraph (1). Additional funds will increase payments that were previously reduced. Each agency must conduct a census by December 1 to determine student attendance for grant eligibility. The local educational agency must submit the number of students in attendance to the Secretary by March 1 each year. Funds awarded must be disbursed by July 1. Eligible agencies cannot receive funds under another subpart for the same fiscal year. The funds provided should supplement, not replace, other education funds. \"SEC. 10963. ACCOUNTABILITY.\" Each local educational agency receiving funds under section 10961 or 10962 must administer an assessment consistent with section 1111 of title I. They are required to use the same assessment each year. State educational agencies must determine continued participation based on assessment results after the second year of a program under section 10961 or 10962. Based on assessment results, local educational agencies must determine if students performed according to section 1111 of title I to continue participation in the program. \"Subpart 2--Low-Income And Rural School Program authorized under SEC. 10971.\" The Secretary reserves funds for Bureau of Indian Affairs schools under this subpart. Grants are awarded to State educational agencies for subgrants to local educational agencies for authorized activities. The Secretary allocates funds to State educational agencies based on the number of students served by eligible local educational agencies. Specially qualified agencies in nonparticipating states can receive direct awards if they desire a grant under this subpart. Qualified agencies in a State seeking a grant under this subpart must apply directly to the Secretary. The Secretary may award funds to specially qualified agencies in the State on a competitive basis. Local educational agencies are eligible for funds if at least 20% of the children served are from families below the poverty line and all schools served by the agency meet the criteria. Grant funds awarded to local educational agencies or schools under this subpart can be used for educational technology, professional development, technical assistance, teacher recruitment and retention, parental involvement activities, and academic enrichment programs. The schools must be located in a community with a Rural-Urban Continuum Code of 6, 7, 8, or 9. State educational agencies must award grants to local educational agencies based on a competitive basis or a formula tied to student attendance. The agencies receiving grants cannot use more than 5% for administrative costs. Each State educational agency and specially qualified agency must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under specific guidelines, including measurable goals related to student academic achievement and dropout rates. Additionally, reports must be submitted as required. Each State educational agency and specially qualified agency receiving a grant under this subpart must provide an annual report to the Secretary. The report should detail how funds were awarded and used, as well as the progress made towards meeting the goals outlined in the application. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress detailing how funds were awarded and used by State educational agencies and specially qualified agencies, as well as the progress made towards meeting educational goals and objectives. ``SEC. 10975.
