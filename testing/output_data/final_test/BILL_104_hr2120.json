    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Naturalization Improvements Act of 1995\". The Congress finds that millions of adults and children will be eligible for citizenship, including those legalized under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The Immigration and Naturalization Service reports a significant increase in naturalization cases and citizenship applications, with varying percentages across different cities. According to the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the time from filing a citizenship application to being interviewed can range from 60 days to over 2 years. Barriers to completing the citizenship process include a backlog in applications, lack of outreach and information services, insufficient counseling on the application process, and lack of access to English language and citizenship preparation classes. The Immigration and Naturalization Service states that lack of English language skills is the primary reason for citizenship denials. President Clinton's budget proposal for fiscal year 1996 allocates $7 million for Immigration and Naturalization Service's citizenship expenses, much less than the $1 billion for border enforcement. Immigrants face barriers like lack of English skills in the citizenship process, leading to denials. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress in Section 3 emphasizes the importance of citizenship through naturalization, protecting rights and services for all residents, and making naturalization a national priority to ensure full participation in citizenship responsibilities. The Federal Government is responsible for providing necessary services for naturalization. The Immigration and Naturalization Service should privatize the administration of the oral English and written civics exam to reduce the backlog of citizenship applications. They should work with experienced educational testing agencies to develop national standards for the exams. The Immigration and Naturalization Service should collaborate with private agencies authorized to administer English and civics exams as an alternative to reduce citizenship application backlog and increase efficiency in the naturalization process. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is authorized to appropriate funds for restructuring procedures, promoting local agreements, expanding services to suburbs and target populations, and collaborating with various entities to deliver citizenship services efficiently. To upgrade equipment and technology for reporting on naturalization statistics and the application process."
