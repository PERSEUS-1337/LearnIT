    "content": "The Act titled \"ANCSA Unrecognized Community Landless Natives Authorization Act of 2017\" recognizes and compensates unrecognized Southeast Alaska Native communities. The \"ANCSA Unrecognized Community Landless Natives Authorization Act of 2017\" aims to address the exclusion of certain southeastern Alaska communities by allowing Native residents of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell to form Urban Corporations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and receive settlement land. The ANCSA Unrecognized Community Landless Natives Authorization Act of 2017 allows Native residents of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell to form Urban Corporations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and receive settlement land. Native individuals from these villages will be enrolled in the Urban Corporations. The ANCSA Unrecognized Community Landless Natives Authorization Act of 2017 enables Native residents of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell to establish Urban Corporations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and acquire settlement land. Natives enrolled in these Urban Corporations will receive 100 shares of Settlement Common Stock if they were shareholders of the Regional Corporation for Southeast Alaska before March 30, 1973. Additionally, Natives inheriting shares from deceased Natives from these villages will also receive shares in the respective Urban Corporation. The ANCSA Unrecognized Community Landless Natives Authorization Act of 2017 allows Natives from Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell to form Urban Corporations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Inherited shares from deceased Natives also entitle individuals to shares in the respective Urban Corporation. Amendments to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act include distribution rights regarding corporate funds and minimum allocations. The amendments to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act include provisions for Native members of specific villages to receive distributions as shareholders in Urban Corporations. The Unrecognized Community Landless Natives Authorization Act of 2017 and its amendments will not impact revenue distribution among Native Corporations or settlement agreements among Regional or Village Corporations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Compensation provisions have been added to the Act for Native members of specific villages to receive distributions as shareholders in Urban Corporations. The Unrecognized Community Landless Natives Authorization Act of 2017 and its amendments will not affect revenue distribution among Native Corporations or settlement agreements under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Compensation provisions have been included for Native members of certain villages to receive distributions as shareholders in Urban Corporations for Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell. Upon incorporation of Urban Corporations for Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell, the Secretary will offer 1 township of land (23,040 acres) to each corporation as compensation. Additionally, local areas of historical, cultural, traditional, and economic importance will be offered as compensation under this provision. The Secretary will select land for withdrawal and conveyance based on commercial purposes, including subsistence and cultural sites, aquaculture sites, hydroelectric sites, tideland, surplus Federal property, and eco-tourism sites. Land within a conservation system unit will not be included. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act specifies that land selected for withdrawal must be contiguous and compact if possible, and subject to valid existing rights. Offers must be accepted or rejected within one year. Each Urban Corporation for Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell must accept or reject the compensation offer from the Secretary within one year. To do so, they need to provide a corporate resolution confirming the majority shareholder's approval or rejection. If the offer is rejected, the Secretary will work with the Urban Corporation and the Regional Corporation for Southeast Alaska to revise the offer. The Urban Corporation shall have an additional 180 days to accept or reject a revised offer from the Secretary. Within 180 days of approval, the Secretary will withdraw the land, convey the surface estate to the Urban Corporation, and convey the subsurface estate to the Regional Corporation for Southeast Alaska. Additionally, the Secretary will convey roads, trails, facilities, leases, and appurtenances to the Urban Corporations of Haines, Ketchikan. The Urban Corporations of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell will receive all rights to roads, trails, facilities, and leases on the conveyed land. They may establish a settlement trust to promote health, education, welfare, and preserve Native heritage and culture. The trust established under paragraph (1) prioritizes support for elder and minor enrollees and their descendants before supporting all other enrollees."
