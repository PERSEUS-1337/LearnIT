Congress finds that chromium, specifically hexavalent chromium or Chrome 6, is widely used in various industries for different purposes, making it challenging to quantify human exposures due to the difficulty in identifying the specific form of chromium in exposure studies. Chrome 6 can be encountered through air, water, or contact with products containing the metal. In 2009, US facilities released nearly 8,000,000 pounds of chromium into the environment. By 2010, chromium was a major contaminant in over 500 heavily polluted sites on the National Priorities List. In the United States, more than 40 percent of heavily contaminated sites are contaminated with chromium. Chrome 6 has been declared to cause cancer when inhaled by the International Agency for the Research on Cancer in 1990 and the Environmental Protection Agency in 1998. The National Toxicology Program found clear evidence of cancer-causing activity in laboratory animals from Chrome 6 in drinking water in 2008. A 2010 draft toxicological review by the EPA stated that Chrome 6 in tap water is likely carcinogenic to humans. Tap water is considered carcinogenic to humans, with significant cancer concerns and health effects from animal studies. In 1991, the EPA set a tap water standard for total chromium at 100 parts per billion. California proposed a health goal of 0.06 parts per billion for Chrome 6 in 2009, much lower than the EPA standard. In 2010, California proposed a health goal of 0.02 parts per billion for Chrome 6 in drinking water. In 2011, California established a final public health goal of 0.02 parts per billion for Chrome 6 in drinking water. A nonprofit organization's report in December 2010 tested tap water in 35 US cities for chromium and found that the majority of chromium in drinking water was Chrome 6. Tap water in 31 cities contained Chrome 6, with the highest levels in Norman, Oklahoma. The highest levels of Chrome 6 in tap water were found in cities like Norman, Oklahoma; Honolulu, Hawaii; and Riverside, California. Tap water from 25 cities exceeded the 2009 proposed public health goal for Chrome 6. The purpose of this Act is to require the EPA to establish regulations within 90 days. The Act requires the EPA to establish a health advisory and a national primary drinking water regulation for hexavalent chromium within specific timeframes, ensuring protection for pregnant women, infants, and children by considering body weight, exposure patterns, and all routes of exposure to the contaminant. The EPA is mandated to establish a health advisory and national primary drinking water regulation for hexavalent chromium, ensuring protection for vulnerable populations. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include a health advisory for hexavalent chromium that is fully protective of vulnerable individuals within 90 days. The Administrator must propose and finalize a national primary drinking water regulation for hexavalent chromium within specific timeframes to ensure protection of vulnerable individuals. The national primary drinking water regulation for hexavalent chromium must protect vulnerable individuals, including pregnant women, infants, and children, with a maximum contaminant level as close to the goal for hexavalent chromium as feasible."
