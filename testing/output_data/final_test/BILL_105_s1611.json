    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prohibition on Cloning of Human Beings Act of 1998\". Congress finds that an adult sheep has been cloned using somatic cell nuclear transfer technology, which has various applications in biotechnology, livestock production, and medical advancements. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission has reviewed the ethical implications of cloning human beings and determined its potential for producing pharmaceutical proteins and regenerating human tissues or organs. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) concluded that attempting to create a child using somatic cell nuclear transfer-cloning is morally unacceptable due to significant scientific uncertainty, medical risks, and ethical concerns. They recommended further public deliberation before this technology can be used. The NBAC recommended a continuation of the moratorium on using Federal funds for somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a child. They also suggested enacting Federal legislation to prohibit such attempts and cooperating with other countries to enforce restrictions. The NBAC recommended a sunset provision for the prohibition on somatic cell nuclear transfer technology, with an oversight body to review and report on its status before the sunset date. They also emphasized the need for careful legislation to not interfere with other research areas like cloning human DNA sequences and cells. The NBAC found that cloning animals through somatic cell nuclear transfer raises different issues than creating children through this technique. Cell nuclear transfer does not raise the same issues as creating a child through the technique. It should be subject to existing regulations regarding the humane use of animals. Biomedical research facilities and reproductive services facilities engage in interstate commerce, with products and services moving across state lines. Scientists, doctors, and staff are involved in an interstate market. Scientists, doctors, and staff engage in an interstate market for research and purchasing medical supplies. The Act prohibits human cloning through somatic cell nuclear transfer, bans the use of Federal funds for such activities, and calls for further ethical and scientific review. It amends the Public Health Service Act to include a prohibition on cloning. In this section, definitions are provided for key terms related to cloning, including cloning, nucleus, oocyte, somatic cell, and somatic cell nuclear transfer. It is unlawful for any person or entity to engage in human cloning through somatic cell nuclear transfer. In this section, it is unlawful for any legal entity, public or private, to implant or ship the product of somatic cell nuclear transfer for implantation into a woman's uterus. The use of funds for prohibited activities is also restricted. However, protected research areas include cloning technologies for molecules, DNA, cells, and tissues. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission will report on the state of cloning science, ethical issues, and the prohibition's advisability. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission may produce additional reports to clarify topics, address changes in science or society, and modify recommendations. The Commission is authorized to continue for a 10-year period to prepare reports and fulfill other purposes as established in Executive Order 12975. This supersedes termination and chartering provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The penalties for intentionally violating subsection (b) include a fine of $1,000,000 or 3 times the gross pecuniary gain/loss. The Attorney General can initiate civil actions to enjoin violations, and property used in violations is subject to forfeiture to the United States. The Attorney General has exclusive enforcement authority under this section and can provide binding advisory opinions. Congress urges cooperation with foreign countries to enforce restrictions. No private right of action is granted, and state law is preempted. The provisions of this section preempt any State or local law that prohibits or restricts research on somatic cell nuclear transfer, mitochondrial therapy, or cloning. This section will be effective for 10 years from enactment, with prohibitions ending after that period."
