    "content": "President Bush sent his FY2009 budget to Congress, allocating $39 billion for HUD. The Senate and House passed the budget resolution, determining funding for appropriations subcommittees. The Transportation-HUD subcommittee approved a draft bill with funding for new housing vouchers for homeless veterans and the disabled. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved funding for various housing programs, including $30 million for new housing vouchers for homeless veterans and the disabled, $75 million for foreclosure counseling, $1.69 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants, $4 billion for Community Development Block Grants, $765 million for housing for the elderly, $250 million for disabled housing, and $4.5 billion for the public housing operating account. On July 10, 2008, the Senate Committee on Appropriations approved the FY2009 Transportation-HUD appropriations bill (S. 3261). President Bush signed a continuing resolution (CR) on September 30, 2008, funding most government agencies, including HUD, at their FY2008 levels (P.L. 110-329). The CR funded agencies until March 6, 2009, or enactment of a final FY2009 funding bill. It was part of a larger bill that included supplemental emergency funding and full-year appropriations acts for Defense, Homeland Security, and Military Construction/Veterans Administration. The CR also included provisions related to HUD. The FY2009 Transportation-HUD appropriations bill included provisions for HUD to spend funds faster for project-based Section 8 contracts, extend the HOPE VI program, raise loan commitment levels for FHA, and use salaries for FHA technology needs. FY2008 emergency supplemental disaster funding provided new Section 8 vouchers and CDBG funding for communities affected by disasters in 2005 and 2008. In 2009, Congress approved emergency funding for HUD programs in response to presidentially declared disasters in 2008. The bill provided over $13.68 billion in FY2009 funding for HUD. Additional funding was extended through a second CR until March 10, 2009, when the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 was signed into law to fund agencies, including HUD, for the remainder of the fiscal year. The CR provided funding for HUD programs for the remainder of the 2009 fiscal year, with most funding coming from discretionary appropriations. HUD's programs focus on addressing housing issues for low-income households, including rental assistance programs like Public Housing and Section 8 Vouchers. HOME and Community Development Block Grants help finance housing and community development activities. HUD provides block grants to help communities finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. Specialized grants assist homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. Efforts also focus on increasing homeownership rates for lower-income and minority households through programs offering downpayment assistance and housing counseling. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. FHA collects fees from borrowers to sustain the insurance fund. Surplus funds have been used to offset HUD's budget costs. Total enacted appropriations for HUD over the past five years are shown in Table 1. Table 1 displays HUD's total enacted appropriations over the past five years, which includes regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. HUD's funding mainly comes from regular annual appropriations, also known as discretionary appropriations, determining the amount spent on programs and activities. Emergency appropriations are sometimes provided by Congress in response to disasters, outside of regular appropriations acts. HUD's total budget authority is determined by a combination of new appropriations and offsets through rescissions, receipts, and collections. Budget authority represents the \"cost\" of the HUD budget, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. The total budget authority for HUD is determined by new appropriations and offsets, representing the \"cost\" of the budget as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. Congress can adjust appropriations based on changes in offsetting receipts to maintain level budget authority for HUD programs. The total non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased 28% between FY2002-FY2008, with regular annual appropriations growing by 20% while offsetting receipts and collections declined by over 65%. This resulted in an increase in total budget authority not solely due to program funding increases but also due to decreases in offsetting receipts. The increase in regular appropriations for HUD's programs from FY2002 to FY2008 is largely due to growth in appropriations for the Section 8 program, which increased by over 40%. This growth was offset by a decline in appropriations for other programs and activities during the same period. The Section 8 program's appropriations have increased from 45% to 55% of HUD's regular appropriations between FY2002 and FY2008. The decline in offsetting receipts is mainly due to decreases in excess receipts in the FHA's mortgage insurance programs. President Bush's FY2009 budget request for HUD is compared to the prior year's enacted budget authority in Table 2. President Bush's FY2009 budget requested a less than 4% increase in total regular budget authority for HUD, driven by declines in rescission and offsetting receipts. The FY2009 request for regular appropriations would provide new funding for HUD's programs. In FY2009, appropriations for HUD saw a slight decline from FY2008. The 110th Congress did not complete work on the FY2009 appropriations acts before adjourning. A continuing resolution funded most federal agencies at FY2008 levels until March 11, 2009. A FY2009 omnibus appropriations bill was signed into law on March 11, 2009, providing a more than 10% increase in regular appropriations for HUD over the FY2008 level. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations bill provided a significant increase in regular appropriations for HUD over the FY2008 level. A FY2009 supplemental appropriations bill (P.L. 111-6) allocated nearly $13.7 billion for HUD programs as an economic stimulus. The tenant-based rental assistance account funds the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, which provides portable rent subsidies for low-income families. HUD administers over 2 million Section 8 vouchers through local Public Housing Authorities. The Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account, the largest in HUD's budget, funds vouchers and program administration. Table 3 shows budget authority totals pre and post rescission. FY2008 saw a rescission from advance appropriations, reducing funding available. The budget authority for tenant-based rental assistance includes current year appropriations and advance appropriations. Advance appropriations are provided for the subsequent fiscal year. Funding for the Section 8 program has included an advance appropriation since FY2001, with the amount remaining consistent each year. This ensures that the program has the necessary budget authority for each fiscal year. In FY2008, Congress provided less advance appropriation for tenant-based rental assistance than in FY2007, leading to a decrease in budget authority available for the program. Additionally, a rescission of $723 million further complicated funding for FY2008. In FY2008, Congress provided less advance appropriation for tenant-based rental assistance than in FY2007, leading to a decrease in budget authority available for the program. Additionally, a rescission of $723 million further complicated funding for FY2008, lowering the CBO \"score\" for the bill. President Bush requested less advance appropriations for FY2009, with $4,000 million requested for use in FY2010. President Bush's FY2009 funding request would have provided $16,039 million in budget authority, an increase from FY2008. S. 3261 proposed $12,503 million in current year funding and $4,200 million in advance appropriations for FY2010, but included a $800 million rescission from FY2008. This would have resulted in $15,861 million available for FY2009, less than the President's request but more than FY2008. The omnibus appropriations law for FY2009 provided more budget authority ($16,225 million) than in FY2008 or requested by President Bush and S. 3261. It included $12,817 million in current year funding, $4,000 million in advance appropriations for FY2010, and a $750 million rescission. In FY2008, Congress provided $14,695 million for existing vouchers and rescinded $723 million from advance appropriations. In FY2008, Congress provided $13,972 million for renewals, supplemented by agencies' net restricted assets. Congress directed HUD to reduce agencies' funding by the excess of their net restricted assets over 7% of prior year renewal funding. This was estimated to free up roughly $723 million in net restricted asset funding, resulting in just under $14,695 million available for renewals in FY2008. In FY2008, funding available for renewals was just under $14,695 million, including $723 million in net restricted assets. President Bush requested $14,327 million for FY2009 renewals, with an additional $600 million anticipated from net restricted assets. This would have brought the total program level to $14,927 billion, an increase of about $232 million or 1.6% over FY2008. In FY2009, funding for renewals was proposed to be $14,827 million, with $800 million rescinded from the prior year's advance appropriation. The net funding level would be $14,027 million, less than the President's request. However, PHAs would have access to their net restricted assets, making $14,827 million available for renewals, exceeding the amount provided in FY2008. The omnibus budget proposal for FY2009 adopts the funding strategy proposed by President Bush and S. 3261, providing $15,200 million for renewals but rescinding $750 million from the prior year. This results in a net funding level of $14,450 million, which is higher than the amount proposed by S. 3261 and requested by President Bush. Additionally, $750 million in \"freed-up\" net restricted assets are assumed, resulting in a FY2009 program level that is 3.4% higher than FY2008. In FY2008, Congress directed HUD to fund PHAs based on their costs and utilization from the previous year, adjusted for inflation and other factors. PHAs' allocations were reduced if their net restricted assets exceeded 7% of their previous year's allocation, and budgets were prorated to fit within the amount appropriated. In FY2008, Congress directed HUD to fund PHAs based on their costs and utilization from the previous year, adjusted for inflation and other factors. Some PHAs were subject to different funding formulas, including Moving to Work PHAs, those that overspent in the previous year, and those affected by the 2005 hurricanes. The prohibition on overleasing was continued, and Congress provided $50 million for a rental subsidy reserve. President Bush requested funding for PHAs in FY2009 based on previous year's funding plus inflation, with adjustments for net assets and prorated to fit within the appropriation. A $50 million rental subsidy reserve was included for PHAs facing unforeseen circumstances. PHAs were also allowed to use excess budget authority for additional vouchers. This change would impact PHAs with cost/utilization changes from FY2008 to FY2009. The funding formula change in S. 3261 for FY2009 would have adjusted PHAs' funding based on previous year's costs and utilization, with inflation adjustments and deductions for net assets. Moving to Work agencies would continue to be funded based on their agreements. $100 million would have been allocated for agencies facing significant cost increases or increased leasing. The omnibus funding bill directs HUD to fund PHAs based on their costs and utilization from FY2008, adjusted for inflation and other factors, reduced by the amount of net restricted assets they had accumulated (up to $750 million in aggregate), and prorated to fit within the amount appropriated. It also includes a $100 million set aside for agencies with VASH vouchers. In FY2003, administrative fee funding was separated from voucher renewal funding. PHAs were paid fees based on a formula tied to HUD-established fair market rents. Congress directed HUD to allocate fees to PHAs based on the per voucher formula tied to FMRs used before FY2003. A fixed amount of funding was set aside for administrative fees in FY2008. The amount provided in FY2008 was estimated to be insufficient to fund 100% of PHAs administrative fees. President Bush requested an increase in administrative fee funding for FY2009, with a proposed amount of $1,400 million. S. 3261 would have provided $1,500 million for administrative fees, with $50 million set aside for PHAs needing extra funds and $50 million for Family Self Sufficiency coordinators. The omnibus bill included the same funding levels for administrative fees as S. 3261. The bill includes proposed funding levels for administrative fees in FY2009, with $125 million provided for new vouchers for homeless veterans, non-elderly disabled families, and families in the child welfare system. President Bush requested $39 million for elderly and disabled families displaced by the 2005 hurricanes and $75 million for new VASH vouchers. The omnibus appropriations bill provides funding for various voucher programs, including $20 million for FUP vouchers, $75 million for VASH vouchers, and $30 million for non-elderly disabled households. This funding is used to administer and renew project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private landlords, allowing low-income families to pay only 30% of their incomes towards rent. No new contracts have been entered into under this program since the early 1980s. In the early 1980s, Congress funded project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts for 20-40 years. Monthly payments for landlords came from old appropriations, but once contracts expire, new annual appropriations are needed. HUD stopped payments in July 2007 due to insufficient funding, citing legal counsel's advice against obligating partial funding in 12-month contracts. HUD stopped payments in July 2007 due to insufficient funding for project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts. The Department modified contracts with property owners to indicate that full funding might not be available for the entire contract term, leading to partial funding. This practice was discussed in a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee, where a HUD official testified that FY2008 funding would partially fund contracts through the end of the fiscal year. HUD can provide full or partial funding for project-based contracts that expire throughout the year. Full funding covers the entire 12-month term, while partial funding may only cover a shorter period, such as until the end of the federal fiscal year on September 30. If a contract expires in July, HUD would need to provide 3 months' worth of funding to cover until the end of the fiscal year, or 12 months of funding to cover a full year. This funding approach applies to roughly 18,000 project-based Section 8 contracts, although they may not expire evenly throughout the year. HUD may need 78 months of funding to cover all 18,000 contracts until the end of the fiscal year, or 144 months to fund them for a full 12 months. Congress provided $600 million more than requested for project-based rental assistance in FY2008, but it was not enough for full 12-month funding. In FY2009, President Bush requested $6,768 million for contract renewals and an additional $400 million in advance appropriations for FY2010. HUD requested funding to cover contracts through the end of FY2009 and an advance for FY2010. An additional $1,900 million was estimated to fully fund contracts for 12 months. S. 3261 proposed $8,218 million for project-based contract renewals, exceeding the President's request by $1,050 million. The Senate committee report noted that increased funding would provide stability to the program by allowing longer-term contracts with owners. The omnibus appropriations bill provides $7,100 million in current year funding and $400 million in advance appropriations for project-based rental assistance in FY2010. In total, $7,268 million is allocated for renewals, with $6,868 million available in FY2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included $2 billion for project-based contract renewals in FY2009, which combined with regular FY2009 funding should allow HUD to fund renewal contracts on a 12-month basis. The public housing program provides rental units for low-income families. Congress funds over 3,100 public housing authorities owning 1.2 million units. HUD supports PHAs through Operating and Capital Funds. HOPE VI grants aid in redeveloping distressed housing. In public housing developments, PHAs receive operating funding to maintain mixed-income communities. HUD estimates PHA budgets annually and compares it to Congress funding. If Congress funding is less, HUD applies across-the-board reductions, resulting in a proration level. In FY2008, Congress provided $4,200 million, funding 84% of PHA budget eligibility. In FY2009, President Bush requested just under $4,300 million. In FY2009, President Bush requested just under $4,300 million for HUD, with S. 3261 proposing $100 million more. The omnibus bill provides just under $4,455 for operating subsidies, estimated to result in a proration level of just under 89%. President Bush's budget requested a 16% decrease in funding for formula grants under the Capital Fund. The estimated capital needs for public housing are around $2 billion annually, with a backlog of $20 billion in unmet needs. HUD is conducting a Capital Needs Assessment to determine current needs, and PHAs can use capital funding to leverage outside resources. The omnibus appropriations bill included $2,356 billion for capital funding. The omnibus appropriations bill included $2,356 billion for capital funding, in addition to the $4 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. President Bush did not request new funding for the HOPE VI program since FY2003, but Congress continued to fund it. HUD criticized the program for slow grant fund expenditure and noted that PHAs can leverage capital fund grants similarly to HOPE VI grants. The omnibus appropriations bill provided $120 million for HOPE VI, with $2 million for technical assistance, extending the program through FY2009. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 reorganized federal housing assistance for Native Americans. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 reorganized federal housing assistance for Native Americans by replacing multiple programs with a single block grant program. NAHASDA provides block grants to Indian tribes or their housing entities for affordable housing activities, aiming to support Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance. The President's budget requested $627 million for Native American Block Grants in FY2009, including $2 million for credit subsidy. The Senate committee recommended an appropriation of $650 million in Native American Block Grants for FY2009, including $2 million in credit subsidy. The FY2009 omnibus legislation provides $645 million in Native American Block Grants, with $2 million in credit subsidy to support guaranteed loans. The FY2009 Native American Block Grants include $2 million in credit subsidy for guaranteed loans, $4 million for inspections, contract expertise, training, and technical assistance, and $3.5 million for a national organization providing training and assistance to Indian housing authorities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 added $510 million for Native American Block Grants, with $255 million distributed to tribes and TDHE based on FY2008 formula for construction, rehabilitation, and infrastructure, and the remaining $255 million distributed through competitive grants prioritizing construction and rehabilitation projects. The HOPWA program provides housing assistance for low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families through formula allocation and competitive grants. For FY2009, funding was set at $310 million, $10 million more than the President's request. The Bush Administration recommended changing the allocation formula. The HOPWA program allocates funds based on the number of AIDS cases in a jurisdiction. The President proposed using factors like the number of persons living with AIDS and housing costs. The omnibus appropriations bill does not address this proposal. The RHED program aims to address rural housing and economic development issues by providing funding for capacity building in rural areas. The Bush Administration's FY2009 budget requested no funding for RHED, arguing that rural communities' needs would be addressed through other programs. However, the Senate committee recommended an appropriation of $30 million for RHED, noting its importance in HUD's community development activities and the distinctiveness of its programs from those administered by the USDA. The committee expressed concern about high rates of unemployment and poverty in rural areas. The committee recommended allocating $12 million of the increased RHED funds for economic development and entrepreneurship activities for federally recognized Indian tribes. The omnibus for FY2009 provides $26 million for RHED, with $5 million designated for promoting economic development for these tribes. The Community Development Fund (CDF) supports activities like the Community Development Block Grant program and other community development-related programs. President Bush's FY2009 budget recommended $2,927 million for the formula portion of CDBG, $659 million less than the previous year. The Administration planned to reform the CDBG program by proposing the Community Development Block Grant Reform Act, which included changes to the distribution formula targeting assistance based on poverty levels. The Community Development Block Grant Reform Act proposed changes to the distribution formula based on poverty levels, including criteria for grant eligibility and a bonus grant program for improving living conditions in distressed neighborhoods. The Administration's FY2009 budget also suggested reducing funding for CDBG formula grants and eliminating other community development programs. The budget proposed reducing funding for Community Development Block Grants and eliminating other related programs, citing duplication of activities. S. 3261 recommended $3,889 million for Community Development Fund activities in FY2009, including formula-based allocations to entitlement communities and states. The Senate Appropriations Committee also recommended $201 million for Economic Development Initiatives. In FY2008, 820 projects received $180 million in EDI funds, averaging $220,000 each. In FY2009, $3,900 million was allocated for the Community Development Fund, with $3,642 million for CDBG formula grants. An additional $1 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act led to a 21% increase in formula allocations for entitlement communities, states, and Puerto Rico. $165 million was earmarked for Economic Development Initiative grants and $20 million for Neighborhood Initiative grants. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows leveraging of CDBG allocations for brownfield redevelopment, economic development, and housing. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows CDBG entitlement communities and states to borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocation for qualifying activities, pledging their CDBG allocations as security. The Bush Administration recommended terminating the program in FY2009 due to duplicative results. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $6 million in subsidies for $275 million in loan guarantee commitments, a slight increase from FY2008. The omnibus legislation for FY2009 appropriates $6 million in subsidies for $275 million in Section 108 loan guarantee commitments. It includes a provision allowing non-entitlement jurisdictions to access a state's loan guarantee program. The Brownfields Economic Development Initiative program provides funds for redevelopment of contaminated industrial and commercial facilities. The FY2009 omnibus legislation appropriates $10 million for brownfields redevelopment, with a provision prohibiting the use of brownfield funds for Section 108 loan guarantees. The HOME Investment Partnerships Program, created in 1990, provides block grant funding for affordable housing initiatives. Eligible activities include acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction, and rental assistance for eligible families. The American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) was created in 2003 to fund HOME grantees for downpayment, closing cost, and rehabilitation assistance for first-time home buyers. Housing counseling assistance is also provided under Section 106 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968. HUD offers competitive grants for various housing counseling services, including counseling for predatory lending, Homeownership Voucher Program, colonias, and Home Equity Conversion Mortgage counseling. President Bush's FY2009 budget requested funding for these programs. President Bush's FY2009 budget requested a $275 million increase in funding for HOME formula grants, citing the program as key to increasing homeownership opportunities, especially for minorities. The program received a strong rating from OMB's evaluation. S. 3261 would have provided $1,937 million for formula grants, just under 2% more than the President's requested level. The 2009 omnibus legislation allocated $1,809 million for formula grants, nearly 5% less than the President's request but over 11% more than the FY2008 level. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included $2.25 billion in emergency funding for the HOME account, to be distributed to states based on their FY2008 HOME formula funding. States must use this funding for gap financing for Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects. President Bush requested a 400% increase in funding for ADDI from $10 million in FY2008 to $40 million in FY2009. The program was originally authorized at $200 million per year but has never been funded at more than $86 million. The ADDI program was extended through FY2008 and a bill was proposed to provide $10 million for it in FY2009. However, the 2009 omnibus legislation did not include funding or authorization for ADDI. President Bush requested separate funding for housing counseling assistance, but it was continued to be funded within the HOME account. HUD's budget justification highlighted the program's ability to assist troubled individuals. The Congressional Budget Justifications request increased funding for the housing counseling program to help troubled homeowners facing mortgage defaults and foreclosures. S. 3261 proposed funding housing counseling separately at $65 million, which was adopted in the 2009 omnibus legislation. This funding account also supports the Self-Help Housing Opportunity Program (SHOP) for self-help homeownership opportunities. President Bush's FY2009 budget requested $40 million for SHOP, including funds for technical assistance. The President's budget did not include funding for Section 4 grants for capacity building. S. 3261 recommended $66 million for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunities account, including $35 million for capacity-building grants. This is $6 million more than FY2008 and $26 million more than requested by the Bush Administration. The omnibus legislation appropriates $64 million for self-help homeownership opportunities, including $26.5 million for SHOP, $34 million for capacity building activities by various organizations, and $4 million for the Housing Assistance Council. Homeless Assistance Grants encompass four programs authorized by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. The Homeless Assistance Grants, authorized by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, include four competitive grant programs administered by HUD: Supportive Housing Program (SHP), Shelter Plus Care program (S+C), Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Assistance for Single Room Occupancy Dwellings program (SRO), and Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG). Funding levels have increased steadily since FY2005, reaching $1,677 million in FY2009. The legislation provides $1,677 million for Homeless Assistance Grants, an increase of $91 million over the FY2008 appropriation. The omnibus bill does not set aside funding for a Samaritan initiative but allocates $10 million for a demonstration program to prevent homelessness among veterans. The omnibus bill allocates $3 million for research on homeless issues and $75 million for Section 8 vouchers for homeless veterans. At least three sites for housing veterans must have a high number of service members transitioning to civilian life, and four sites must be in rural areas with limited access to VA medical centers. Funding for the vouchers comes from the Section 8 tenant-based account, not the Homeless Assistance Grants. In FY2008, Congress appropriated $75 million for HUD-VASH, funding 10,070 new vouchers for homeless veterans. The Section 202 Housing for the Elderly and Section 811 Housing for Persons with Disabilities programs provide capital grants and rental assistance for subsidized housing. The Section 811 program also offers vouchers for tenants with disabilities to use in the private housing market. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations bill appropriates $765 million for housing and services for elderly households, exceeding the President's request by nearly $200 million. This amount is $30 million more than was provided in FY2008. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill in the 110th Congress had recommended the same funding level. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations bill allocates $90 million for the Service Coordinator program, an increase of $10 million from the President's request and $30 million more than FY2008. It also funds the Assisted Living Conversion program at $25 million, the same as FY2008. No funding is provided for a leveraged financing demonstration program proposed by the President for the second year in a row. $15 million allocated for HUD to collaborate with private sector professionals to increase the use of mixed financing arrangements for Section 202 housing. The omnibus bill encourages leveraging public and private capital financing, including Low Income Housing Tax Credits. Legislation includes refinancing provisions for Section 202 program. Owners of properties may refinance loans with interest rates at or below 6% to address a property's physical needs, without needing to refinance into a lower interest rate. Refinancing transactions must meet a cost benefit analysis and cannot increase costs for project-based Section 8 rental assistance, except under certain circumstances. With HUD approval, owners can raise tenant rents to cover increased debt service and operating costs if project-based Section 8 rental assistance is insufficient. Project-based Section 8 rental assistance can be used to cover costs, with HUD approval triggering eligibility for enhanced Section 8 vouchers. Units can become eligible for project-based assistance when tenants with enhanced vouchers leave. Owners must agree to maintain affordability for 20 years beyond the original loan maturity date. The FY2009 appropriations bill allocates $2 million for technical assistance to improve grant applications for housing development. The FY2009 omnibus appropriations legislation provides $250 million for the Section 811 program, $90 million more than proposed by the President's budget. The bill does not fund new Section 811 vouchers for persons with disabilities but provides $87 million to renew existing vouchers. The omnibus bill also does not fund the President's proposals for the Section 202 program. The omnibus bill does not fund the President's proposed leveraged financing demonstration program, which aimed to encourage mixed finance developments for persons with disabilities. The FHA administers mortgage insurance programs that insure lenders against loan defaults, enabling borrowers to obtain loans for various purposes. The programs are administered through two accounts: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance fund account (MMI/CMHI) and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance fund account (GI/SRI). The MMI/CMHI fund provides insurance for home mortgages, while the GI/SRI fund provides insurance for riskier home mortgages, multifamily rental housing, and special-purpose loans. In the past, the MMI fund had surplus receipts, but the FY2009 Budget projected a need for credit subsidy or higher insurance premiums to sustain operations. The Budget proposed allowing FHA to set risk-based premiums to avoid the need for subsidy appropriations. The Budget proposed increasing insurance premiums for FHA borrowers to avoid the need for subsidy appropriations. Legislative changes were suggested to make FHA more flexible and provide a lower-cost alternative to subprime mortgages. Additionally, the Budget proposed moving single-family programs to the MMI fund and restricting new loan insurance for households using seller-financed downpayments. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 included proposals to meet downpayment requirements for FHA borrowers. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended commitment limitations for the MMI and GI/SRI funds. The committee emphasized FHA's role in providing affordable loans for families during the housing crisis. The committee directed HUD to establish an Office of Predatory Lending in conjunction with the Department of Justice to protect the public from fraud in housing loans. The omnibus permits FHA to insure up to $315 billion in mortgages during FY2009, a 70% increase from FY2008. Despite a limit in present law, FHA may continue to insure Home Equity Conversion Mortgages through September 30, 2009. Ginnie Mae guarantees timely payment of principal and interest on securities. Ginnie Mae guarantees timely payment of principal and interest on securities backed by mortgages insured by FHA, VA, or Rural Housing Service. The budget proposed a change to bring all administrative contract expenses under discretionary authority, estimated to cost $43 million. The omnibus legislation allows Ginnie Mae to guarantee up to $300 billion in home loans in FY2009, a 50% increase from FY2008. FHA is authorized to insure up to $315 billion in home mortgages during FY2009. The increased authorization of Ginnie Mae guarantees is to facilitate the rise in FHA-insured loans. The Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) at HUD maintains information on housing needs, market conditions, and programs. The Research and Technology account funds core research activities including program evaluations and housing surveys. Section 107 University Partnerships are funded through the R&T account to build partnerships with higher education institutions. The Bush Administration requested $55 million for research and technology activities in FY2009 to support neighborhood development and revitalization through partnerships with higher education institutions. The proposed increase in core research funding by 45% to $41 million would be offset by a 41% decrease in funding for Section 107 university-based community development programs. Funding for these programs would decline from $23 million to $14 million for FY2009. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $60 million for research and technology activities in FY2009, which was $9 million more than the previous year and $5 million more than requested by the Administration. This funding included $23 million for university-based community development grants, $2 million for a study on housing voucher assistance program costs, and a proposal to limit HUD's demonstration authority. The FY2009 omnibus legislation includes $58 million for research and technology, with $23 million allocated for Section 107 University Partnerships. It also includes $32 million in unspecified appropriations and restricts HUD's authority to undertake new initiatives without congressional approval. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity enforces anti-discrimination laws in housing through programs like FHAP and FHIP. The Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) and Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) receive funding for enforcing fair housing laws. President Bush's FY2009 budget requested $51 million for these programs, with the Senate committee recommending an increase to $56 million. The Budget allocated $25 million for FHAP and $24 million for FHIP, with the Senate committee recommending over $28 million for FHIP, including funds for a Housing Discrimination Study. The Senate committee recommended over $28 million for FHIP, with $2 million designated for protecting the public from mortgage rescue scams. The Housing Discrimination Study proposed in the budget request was not funded. The FY2009 Omnibus Act allocated $54 million for fair housing programs, including $2 million for mortgage rescue scam prevention. The Office of Lead Hazard Control at HUD oversees the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Grant Program and the Healthy Homes Initiative. The FY2009 budget requested $116 million for these programs, a reduction from the previous year. The Senate committee recommended $145 million, citing the ongoing risk of lead poisoning in low-income housing. Lead risks persist in privately owned housing, especially in unsubsidized low-income units. The committee urged HUD to collaborate with grantees on lead-based paint abatement programs to disclose information on lead hazard abatements, risk assessment data, and blood lead levels to the public. The Omnibus funds the office at $140 million for FY2009, with $125.4 million allocated for the lead hazard program and $14.6 million for the Healthy Homes Initiative. OFHEO, the office overseeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's operations, had its appropriations offset by fees collected from the two entities. The Budget and Senate committee recommended funding for FY2009. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) was created in 2008 to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, replacing OFHEO. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided emergency funding for job preservation, economic recovery, and technological advancements. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 aimed to increase economic efficiency through technological advances, infrastructure investments, and stabilizing state and local government budgets. Over $300 billion in emergency funding was provided, with $13.68 billion allocated to HUD for various programs and new initiatives. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $4 billion for public housing capital needs, with $1 billion set aside for competitive grants. PHAs are directed to prioritize projects that can award contracts within 120 days, rehabilitation of vacant units, and ongoing capital projects. HUD will award the remaining $1 billion competitively for priority investments, including leveraging private sector funding for renovations and energy efficiency. The Native American Housing Block Grants ARRA provided $510 million for renovations and energy conservation retrofit investments. Half of this amount will be distributed to Indian tribes and housing entities based on the FY2008 funding formula. Recipients must use the funds for construction, rehabilitation, and infrastructure development, prioritizing projects that can be completed within 180 days. The remaining $255 million will be awarded competitively to tribes and housing entities by September 30, 2009. The Secretary has until September 30, 2009, to award funding for construction and rehabilitation projects that create employment for low-income individuals. Recipients must obligate and spend the funds within specific timeframes. An additional $1 billion in CDBG funds from the Community Development Fund ARRA will be allocated to Indian tribes, entitlement communities, and states based on specific distribution guidelines. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocates $1 billion in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to Indian tribes, entitlement communities, and states. This represents a 21% increase in FY2009 appropriations. Funds must be awarded within 30 days of enactment, with priority given to projects that can be under contract within 120 days. States are required to maintain funding levels for projects funded by the appropriations. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provides $1 billion in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds and an additional $2 billion for Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) activities. NSP funds allow states and selected local governments to acquire, rehabilitate, and sell abandoned and foreclosed housing to eligible low to middle income households. Recipients must spend at least half of the funds within two years and 100% within three years. These funds are in addition to previous NSP funds allocated under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) of FY2008. The NSP funds under ARRA (NSP 2) will be allocated competitively, allowing non-profits and consortiums to compete for funds against government entitlement communities. This raises policy and administrative issues regarding HUD's capacity to implement and monitor the grant programs. HUD may require non-profits in NSP 2 to obtain certification from the state or local government for consistency with the community development plan. For more information on NSP, see CRS Report RS22919, Community Development Block Grants: Neighborhood Stabilization Program. Congress appropriated $2.25 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, to provide gap financing for Low-Income Housing Tax Credit projects. State housing credit agencies will award funds to projects awarded tax credits between FY2007 and FY2009, prioritizing those expected to be completed by 2012. 75% of funds must be committed by February 2010, and 75% of committed funds must be used by February 2011. The Homelessness Prevention Fund, part of ARRA, allocated $1.5 billion to prevent homelessness and provide rapid re-housing. Funds are distributed to local communities and states not receiving Emergency Shelter Grants. HUD announced fund distribution on February 25, 2009, with all funds to be used for prevention activities. The Homelessness Prevention Fund, part of ARRA, allocated $1.5 billion to prevent homelessness and provide rapid re-housing. Funds are to be used for short- or medium-term rental assistance, housing searches, outreach to landlords, credit repair, security or utility deposits, utility payments, first month's rent, and moving expenses. Grantees must expend at least 60% of funds within two years and 100% within three years. The remaining $250 million from the Homelessness Prevention Fund is allocated for energy and green retrofit investments in assisted housing properties with rental assistance contracts. The funds can be provided through grants or loans, likely administered by HUD's Office of Affordable Housing Preservation as part of their \"Green Initiative.\" The Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes ARRA provided a $100 million appropriation for the Lead Hazard Reduction program as part of their \"Green Initiative.\" Grants from this fund are awarded to qualified applicants in FY2008 and FY2009, who must demonstrate a detailed plan for fund usage. Recipients must spend at least 50% of the funds within two years and 100% within three years. The ARRA included provisions for enhanced oversight of newly-appropriated funds, with funds needing to be expended within two years of availability. The Office of Inspector General received increased funding for oversight. FHA loan limits for one-family homes in 2008 were set at $729,750 or 125% of the median home price, applicable for loans insured in 2009. HUD was given discretionary authority.

The loan limit for HECMs in 2008 was $417,000. In 2008, the HECM loan limit was $417,000, but in 2009, ARRA increased it to $625,500. CBO estimated the cost of this increase to be $37 million in FY2009 and $13 million in FY2010."
