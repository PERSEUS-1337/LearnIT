The Secretary has the authority to insure mortgages for properties with dwellings for 1 to 4 families, with fixed or adjustable interest rates for specified periods. The effective rate of interest on insured mortgages can be adjusted periodically by the mortgagee based on factors like monthly payment amount, outstanding principal balance, or mortgage term. The adjustment is tied to a specified national interest rate index approved by the Secretary. Extensions of the mortgage term cannot exceed 40 years. The interest rate adjustments for insured mortgages are periodically made based on factors like monthly payment amount, outstanding balance, or mortgage term. The adjustments are tied to a specified national interest rate index approved by the Secretary and are limited to a maximum increase of 1 percent annually on the outstanding loan balance. The Secretary may insure mortgages with interest rate adjustments limited to a 1 percent increase annually on the outstanding balance and a maximum increase of 5 percentage points above the initial rate over the mortgage term. Regulations require mortgagees to provide written explanations of 2-step mortgage features to borrowers at the loan application stage. The total number of insured mortgages is also limited. The Secretary may insure mortgages with limited interest rate adjustments. The total number of insured mortgages is capped at 10 percent of the previous year's total. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will conduct a study on reducing upfront and annual premiums for mortgage insurance under the single-family home mortgage insurance program. The study will also assess the impact of these methods on the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's financial stability. A report with findings and recommendations must be submitted to Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment."
