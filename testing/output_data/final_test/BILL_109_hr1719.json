    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Diabetic Foot Complication and Lower Extremity Amputation Reduction Act of 2005\". The Congress finds that diabetes is a significant health issue in the United States, with 17 million patients and annual costs of $132 billion. There has been a 61% increase in diabetes cases since 1990, leading to a rise in lower extremity amputations. Medicare costs for diabetes patients with foot ulcers are three times higher than for diabetes patients in general. Cost effective ulcer prevention and treatment interventions can reduce Medicare costs as inpatient care makes up 74% of diabetic ulcer-related costs. Lower extremity amputations, costing an average of $60,000, are a burden on the health system. Research shows that a multidisciplinary approach can reduce amputation rates by over 50% at a lower cost. Title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include grants for education, screening, and treatment for diabetic foot complications under section 330M.

These entities must also educate patients and healthcare providers on preventive measures, conduct research on diabetic foot complications, and meet criteria developed by the Secretary in consultation with professional organizations. The criteria for the grant program include establishing a multi-center study on diabetic foot complications, creating evidence-based guidelines, and providing resources for effective patient treatment.
