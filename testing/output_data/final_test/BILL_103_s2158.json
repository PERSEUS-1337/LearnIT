Additionally, the ability to launder large sums of hard currency quickly and inexpensively is crucial in international drug trafficking. The Act aims to introduce new counterfeit-resistant $100 currencies to hinder terrorist and hostile groups from undermining US currency stability. It also seeks to deter money laundering by international drug traffickers, increasing their costs and reducing profits.
