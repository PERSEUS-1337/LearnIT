They are protected from criminal sanctions or civil penalties when acting in good faith under this provision. The exemption provided in subsection (a) protects independent pharmacies from criminal sanctions or civil penalties when negotiating with health plans. It does not grant new rights for collective cessation of service and does not affect the National Labor Relations Act. The exemption applies to conduct starting from the enactment of this Act. The exemption in subsection (a) protects independent pharmacies from penalties when negotiating with health plans. It does not exempt unlawful agreements that limit services provided by independent pharmacies. This section does not affect the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or negotiations related to federal programs. Plans related to benefits provided under various programs such as Medicaid, SCHIP, medical and dental care for uniformed services, Veterans' medical care, Federal employees' health benefits program, and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act are defined in this section. Definitions for terms like \"antitrust laws\" are also provided.
