U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick notified Congress on October 1, 2002, about the intention to start FTA talks with Morocco. Negotiations began on January 21, 2003, and after eight rounds, an agreement was reached on March 2, 2004. The FTA was signed on June 15, 2004, after approval from the Senate and House in July 2004. The free trade agreement between the US and Morocco was signed on June 15, 2004, after approval from both the Senate and House in July 2004. President Bush signed the legislation into law on August 3, 2004. The Moroccan Parliament ratified the agreement on January 18, 2005, and made changes to intellectual property laws to implement FTA obligations. Morocco was chosen as an FTA partner for reasons including promoting openness, tolerance, and economic growth in the Muslim world, strong ally in the war against terrorism, stronger support for US positions in WTO negotiations, and to help strengthen economic and political reforms in Morocco. The US-Morocco free trade agreement, signed in 2004, aims to provide increased market access for US exporters and investors. Morocco is the fourth Middle Eastern country to have an FTA with the US. The country is a moderate Arab state with close relations to Europe and the US, led by King Mohammed VI in a constitutional monarchy. King Mohammed VI, who assumed the throne in July 1999, holds extensive powers as the head of state in Morocco. He appoints the prime minister and key ministers, can dismiss the government, dissolve parliament, and rule by decree. The King also leads the armed forces and is the religious leader. Calls for constitutional reform to limit the King's powers have been made, but many believe he is working towards addressing social issues and gradually liberalizing the political system. Morocco's political system is fragmented with over 20 parties, making it difficult to address social and economic problems. High unemployment, income inequality, and poverty contribute to support for Islamist movements. The country faces challenges typical of poor developing nations, such as preparing for freer trade and reducing public sector wage rates. Morocco's economy is focused on mining, agriculture, fishing, tourism, and a growing manufacturing sector. It also heavily relies on phosphate exports and funds from Moroccans working abroad. Agriculture accounts for a significant portion of GDP and workforce, with the country being a net exporter of fruits and vegetables but a net importer of cereals, oilseeds, and sugar. Severe droughts often impact farm production, hindering economic growth. Morocco's economy heavily depends on funds from Moroccans working abroad and the illegal production and export of cannabis. The European Union is its primary trading partner, with France being the largest. The United States accounts for a small portion of Morocco's total trade. The Bush Administration's decision to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement with Morocco was met with surprise and criticism from some observers. The proposed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the U.S. and Morocco aims to benefit both countries economically and politically. Prior to the FTA, U.S. exports to Morocco faced a 20% tariff, while Moroccan exports to the U.S. faced a 4% tariff. The FTA is expected to increase two-way trade beyond the current $854 million level. Leading U.S. exports to Morocco include aircraft, corn, and machinery, with potential growth in wheat, soybeans, feed grains, beef, and poultry exports. The FTA also presents new commercial opportunities by offsetting tariff preferences in the EU-Morocco Association Agreement. The U.S.-Moroccan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) provides preferential tariff treatment for most EU industrial goods, excluding agriculture. U.S. agricultural interests see an opportunity to enhance their position compared to European producers. The U.S.-Moroccan Business coalition believes the FTA will increase American firms' access to Morocco's service sector, including telecommunications, tourism, banking, energy, audio-visual, finance, and insurance. The FTA aligns with the Bush Administration's trade strategy of \"competitive liberalization\" and could serve as a model for other developing countries. The U.S.-Moroccan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is seen as a key tool for promoting economic reform and trade liberalization, aligning with the Bush Administration's strategy of \"competitive liberalization.\" It aims to support Morocco's development and prosperity, enhance stability in the region, and strengthen the overall U.S.-Moroccan relationship. The U.S.-Moroccan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) aims to strengthen the overall U.S.-Moroccan relationship by rewarding Morocco for its support in the war on terrorism and signaling closer ties with the Arab world. The agreement eliminates tariffs on over 95% of bilateral trade immediately, benefiting sectors like information technology, construction equipment, and chemicals. Textile and apparel trade will be duty-free if they meet the Agreement's rules of origin, requiring U.S. or Moroccan yarn and fabric. The U.S.-Moroccan Free Trade Agreement eliminates tariffs on over 95% of bilateral trade immediately. Qualifying apparel must contain U.S. or Moroccan yarn and fabric with limited third country content. Morocco will provide duty-free access on products like pecans and frozen potatoes. U.S. service providers will have enhanced market access, and U.S. banks and insurance companies can establish subsidiaries in Morocco. The U.S.-Moroccan Free Trade Agreement includes protections for digital products, U.S. patents, trademarks, and copyrights. It ensures non-discriminatory access to the telecom network and allows U.S. phone companies to interconnect with Moroccan networks. The agreement also includes anti-corruption measures, access to Moroccan government contracts for U.S. companies, and enforcement of domestic labor and environmental laws. The U.S.-Moroccan Free Trade Agreement includes tariff reductions for agricultural producers in the United States, with immediate elimination of duties on soybeans for processing and phased reductions on other soy products over five years. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association anticipates increased market access for U.S. beef in Morocco's hotel and restaurant industry. Producers of poultry, wheat, corn, and sorghum will also benefit from the agreement. Producers of poultry, wheat, corn, and sorghum will gain from the U.S.-Moroccan Free Trade Agreement. Most U.S. trade advisory committees endorsed the agreement, with concerns raised by the Labor Advisory Committee regarding international labor standards in Morocco. The agreement is credited with influencing significant labor reforms in the country. The U.S.-Moroccan Free Trade Agreement led to significant labor reforms in Morocco, including raising the minimum employment age to 15, reducing the work week to 44 hours, reviewing the minimum wage periodically, and guaranteeing workers' rights of association and collective bargaining. The U.S. Department of Labor allocated $9.5 million to improve industrial relations and child labor standards in Morocco, while the Moroccan government ratified seven of the eight core International Labor Organization conventions."
