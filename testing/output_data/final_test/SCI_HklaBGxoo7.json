Adversarial attacks on ASR systems have focused on white-box attacks, but this paper explores a black-box approach using genetic algorithms and gradient estimation. The targeted attack achieved 89.25% similarity after 3000 generations while maintaining 94.6% audio file similarity. Genetic algorithms are used for a targeted attack on ASR systems, with a new momentum mutation update to limit excess noise. Gradient estimation is then employed for more precise noise placement, resulting in 89.25% attack similarity and 94.6% audio file similarity after 3000 generations. The neural network behind the voice control system is not publicly released, so adversaries only have access to an API providing interpreted text from a continuous waveform. A black box targeted attack is performed on model M by perturbing the input to achieve a specific target without needing access to gradients. Audio poses a greater challenge for models compared to images, requiring maximizing cross correlation to minimize audible noise. The text discusses the challenge of creating targeted adversarial audio for the DeepSpeech system using a genetic algorithm and gradient estimation approach. The complexity lies in applying black-box optimization to a deeply-layered, nonlinear decoder model capable of decoding phrases of any length. The combination of different approaches and momentum mutation update brings new success to the task. DeepSpeech uses a genetic algorithm and gradient estimation approach to create targeted adversarial audio. Alzantot et al. demonstrated success in a black-box adversarial attack on speech-to-text systems. The success of a black-box adversarial attack on speech-to-text systems using a genetic algorithm is demonstrated. The algorithm perturbs audio samples to create adversarial audio that is decoded differently from the original input. Modifications include a novel momentum mutation and the use of CTC-Loss to measure similarity between audio sequences and phrases. Elite populations are formed from the best scoring samples for future generations through parent selection and crossover. The genetic algorithm perturbs audio samples to create adversarial audio, selecting parents based on sample scores and adding mutations with probability. The population improves over time with the best traits and mutations remaining. Eventually, the algorithm reaches the max iterations or decodes the target, returning the best sample. The mutation step is crucial, adding noise to the audio sample based on mutation probability. The mutation step in the genetic algorithm is essential as it introduces noise to the audio sample, potentially leading to beneficial traits for the population. Without mutation, samples may become too similar across generations, hindering progress towards higher scores. To mitigate this noise, a filter is applied before adding it to the audio sample, which is sampled at a rate of 16kHz with a maximum frequency response of 8kHz. The highpass filter with a cutoff frequency of 7kHz limits noise to high frequencies, making it less audible to the human ear. Mutation in the algorithm is limited by mutation probability, similar to step size in SGD. A low mutation probability may not provide enough randomness to overcome local maxima, leading to mutations disappearing quickly. The Momentum Mutation proposal is inspired by the Momentum Update for Gradient Descent. It adjusts the mutation probability in each iteration based on a weighted moving average update, increasing the probability when the population fails to adapt. This acceleration helps mutations accumulate and overcome local maxima. The algorithm uses a moving average to smooth the mutation probability, allowing for faster convergence in Genetic algorithms. However, genetic algorithms become less effective when adversarial samples require only a few perturbations near the target. In such cases, gradient estimation techniques are more efficient. Estimation techniques are more effective when the edit distance between current and target decoding drops below a threshold. A technique proposed by Nitin for approximating the gradient of a black box system using input vectors achieved 89.25% similarity in decoded phrases and 94.6% correlation in adversarial samples. The average final Levenshtein distance after 3000 iterations is 2.3, with 35% achieving exact decoding in less than 3000 generations and 22% in less than 1000 generations. The algorithm achieved 35% success in matching the decoded phrase to the target exactly. Running the algorithm for more iterations could increase success rate, but at the cost of correlation similarity. There is a tradeoff between success rate and audio similarity, with the threshold being adjustable for the attacker's needs. The visualization in figure 4 shows that the audio remains largely unchanged, with most changes being low volume noise uniformly applied around the audio sample. The combination of genetic algorithms and gradient estimation successfully achieved black box adversarial examples for audio, producing better samples than individual algorithms. The algorithm had a 35% success rate in matching the decoded phrase to the target, demonstrating the effectiveness of black box adversarial attacks. This paper demonstrates the achievement of targeted adversarial attacks on black box models using straightforward methods, including momentum mutation and noise addition to high frequencies to improve effectiveness. The combination of these techniques resulted in achieving top results in achieving perfect or near-perfect target transcriptions on audio samples. In conclusion, a new domain for black box attacks on deep, nonlinear ASR systems is introduced, showcasing the feasibility of the approach and opening doors for future research."
