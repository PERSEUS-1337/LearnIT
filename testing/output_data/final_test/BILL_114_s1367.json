    "content": "PRIVATELY INSURED CREDIT UNIONS AUTHORIZED TO BECOME MEMBERS OF A FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK. The Federal Home Loan Bank Act is amended to allow privately insured credit unions to be treated as insured depository institutions for membership in a Federal home loan bank, subject to certification by the appropriate state supervisor. The appropriate state supervisor determines if a credit union meets eligibility requirements to apply for insurance of member accounts under the Federal Credit Union Act. If the state supervisor fails to make a determination within 12 months of the application, the credit union will be considered to have met the requirements for insurance of member accounts under the Federal Credit Union Act. The private deposit insurer must receive an annual independent actuarial opinion on sufficient reserves and a study on capital adequacy every 36 months. The credit union must submit financial information. The credit union must provide reports, records, and information related to examinations to the Federal Housing Finance Agency or Federal home loan bank while being a member. Security interests of the Federal home loan bank are not avoidable. The Federal home loan bank's security interests in credit union assets are protected, and advances made to State-chartered credit unions are safeguarded from State law provisions allowing contract repudiation. The Federal home loan bank ensures that its security interests in credit union assets are protected, and advances made to State-chartered credit unions are safeguarded from State law provisions. Additionally, audits of private insurers of certain depository institutions must be provided to supervisory agencies. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to include new requirements for depository institutions insured by private deposit insurers who are members of a Federal home loan bank. A GAO report is mandated to be submitted to Congress within 18 months. The GAO shall conduct a study and submit a report to Congress on the adequacy of insurance reserves held by a private deposit insurer insuring member accounts of entities described in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The report will also include information on compliance with Federal regulations regarding the disclosure of a lack of Federal deposit insurance."
