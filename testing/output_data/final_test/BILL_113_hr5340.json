    "content": "The \"Fighting Medicare Fraud Act of 2014\" allows for expanded exclusion from federal health programs for individuals with prior interest in sanctioned entities and entities affiliated with sanctioned entities. Paragraph (15) of section 1128(b) of the Social Security Act is amended to include individuals and entities affiliated with a sanctioned entity who have ownership or control interests and were aware of the conduct that led to the conviction or exclusion. The amended paragraph (15) of section 1128(b) of the Social Security Act includes individuals and entities affiliated with a sanctioned entity who have ownership or control interests and were aware of the conduct leading to conviction or exclusion. The term 'sanctioned entity' refers to an entity convicted of specific offenses or excluded from participation. The term 'affiliated entity' in the amended paragraph (15) of section 1128(b) of the Social Security Act refers to entities connected to a sanctioned entity through ownership or control interests, and who were aware of the conduct leading to conviction or exclusion. The term 'person with an ownership or control interest' in the context of sanctioned entities refers to individuals who have ownership or control interests in both the entity and the sanctioned entity. This definition is crucial for understanding the relationships between affiliated entities and sanctioned entities. SEC. 3. Criminal penalty for illegal distribution of Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP beneficiary identification or provider numbers. Whoever knowingly and with the intent to defraud purchases, sells, or distributes two or more Medicare, Medicaid, or Children's Health Insurance Program beneficiary identification numbers or provider numbers shall be imprisoned for not more than 15 years or fined, or both.

The Secretary, in consultation with the Inspector General and the Attorney General, will issue guidance to MA organizations and PDP sponsors on defining 'fraud' and 'abuse'. A conforming amendment to Part D is made, and the effective date for the amendments is specified. The effective date for the amendments specified in the Act shall apply to plan years beginning on or after the enactment date."
