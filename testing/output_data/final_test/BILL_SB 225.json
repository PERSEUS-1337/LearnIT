    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 117630 of the Health and Safety Code in California is amended. The Health and Safety Code in California is amended to define a \"biohazard bag\" as a disposable film bag used for medical waste. The film bags used for transportation must pass tear and impact resistance tests. The biohazard bag must have a resistance of 480 grams in both parallel and perpendicular planes. The biohazard bag used for medical waste collection must meet ASTM D1709 dart drop test standards and be placed in a USDOT-approved container for transport. The bag should be red, with exceptions for yellow bags for chemotherapy waste and white bags for pathology waste, marked with the biohazard symbol. Section 117904 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to allow for the approval of home-generated sharps consolidation points for the collection of sharps waste, which will be treated as medical waste. These consolidation points are exempt from certain requirements and fees, and must comply with specific regulations such as using sharps containers for waste disposal. Section 117943 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require all sharps waste to be placed in sharps containers. Sharps containers ready for disposal must not be held for more than seven days without approval. Operators of home-generated sharps consolidation points are not considered waste generators but must be listed on tracking documents. Medical waste treatment facilities must maintain tracking documents for sharps waste. Section 117943 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require medical waste generators to maintain treatment operating records, emergency action plans, and tracking documents for untreated medical waste shipped offsite for a minimum of three years. Documentation must be made available to the enforcement agency onsite. Section 117945 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require small quantity generators to maintain information on how they handle medical waste and records of waste shipped offsite for treatment. Documentation must be available onsite and electronically for at least three years. Section 117975 of the Health and Safety Code requires large quantity medical waste generators to maintain treatment records and tracking documents for all untreated medical waste shipped offsite. They must also report treatment operating records, have an emergency action plan, and provide tracking documents upon request to the enforcement agency. Documentation must be available onsite within two business days of the request. Section 118032 of the Health and Safety Code amends requirements for pharmaceutical waste generators or parent organizations with health care professionals. They are exempt from certain requirements if specific conditions are met, including having a medical waste management plan or information document on file. If the generator is a large quantity generator, they must have a medical waste management plan. The generator or health care professional can transport the pharmaceutical waste themselves or contract with a carrier. Prior notification and tracking document submission are required before shipping pharmaceutical waste. The facility receiving pharmaceutical waste must maintain a tracking document as specified. They notify the generator of any discrepancies, and the generator must report any diversion to the enforcement agency. If a health care professional returns pharmaceutical waste to the parent organization for consolidation before treatment and disposal, a single-page form or log can be used instead of a tracking document. The form or log must include the transporter's name, number of containers, and return date. The pharmaceutical waste return process requires a form or log with details like the return date, maintained by the generating health care professional and receiving facility. The form can verify multiple container returns if it meets specified requirements. Section 118040 of the Health and Safety Code requires hazardous waste transporters to maintain a tracking document for medical waste, tracking it from the generator facility to final treatment. The transporter must provide a copy of the tracking document to the generator and keep their own copy for three years, including specific information. The tracking document for medical waste transport must include transporter details, type and quantity of waste, generator information, permitted facility details, and dates of collection, transfer, and treatment. A hazardous waste transporter must have the tracking document while transporting medical waste and show it upon demand. The transporter must provide the receiving facility with the original tracking document. Both transporter and medical waste treatment facility must provide tracking data periodically as required by the department. Section 118275 of the Health and Safety Code requires medical waste to be containerized separately from other waste at the point of origin. Biohazardous waste must be placed in a biohazard bag and labeled accordingly. Sharps waste should be contained in a USFDA approved sharps container and handled as per regulations. Chemotherapy waste, including sharps contaminated with chemotherapeutic agents, must be segregated and labeled with \"Chemotherapy Waste\" or \"CHEMO\" for proper treatment according to regulations. Pharmaceutical waste, including controlled substances, must be segregated and containerized according to DEA requirements for proper disposal. Nonradioactive pharmaceutical wastes regulated as medical waste must be labeled for high heat or incineration only to ensure proper treatment. Sharps waste and pharmaceutical wastes can be consolidated into a common container if DEA requirements are met. Medical waste must be treated by incineration or approved alternative technologies to render it nonhazardous. Containers must meet specific requirements and be labeled with the biohazard symbol and \"HIGH HEAT\" or \"INCINERATION ONLY\" for proper treatment. Waste held for offsite shipment must also be labeled accordingly. When medical waste is containerized, labeling with the date of accumulation is not required. Any person providing false information related to health and safety regulations may face a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per violation. Any person who fails to register or obtain a medical waste permit, or violates any provision of the law, may face a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per violation. This act is urgent for the immediate preservation of public health and safety, to implement necessary changes in medical waste handling and disposal laws promptly."
