Federal policymakers have a longstanding interest in STEM education, with discussions spanning various policy areas. President George Washington highlighted the importance of promoting scientific knowledge in the first State of the Union address. President George Washington emphasized the importance of promoting scientific knowledge for public happiness and national prosperity in the United States. The focus on STEM education and its relationship to the country's advancement has been crucial since World War II, benefiting various sectors and contributing to social, economic, health, and military progress. Occupations in both STEM and non-STEM fields require workers with STEM skills. STEM literacy and expertise are seen as crucial competencies for the 21st century. The education system is a key source of STEM knowledge in the U.S., with federal legislators focusing on improving STEM outputs through policy and investments. Over 300 bills related to science education were introduced between 1997 and 2018. Between the 105th and 115th Congresses, the term \"science education\" was introduced. Federal agencies conduct STEM education programs with an estimated annual investment of around $3 billion. This report provides an overview of federal agencies, programs, funding, and issues in STEM education, aiming to inform policymakers. The report provides a history of legislative efforts in STEM education and lists major acts related to the federal STEM education effort. It outlines two components of the federal effort, including general educational programs like Title I-A and postsecondary federal student aid programs. The federal effort in STEM education includes programs for students in higher education, focusing on improving STEM education outcomes in the US. These programs aim to support students in STEM fields, enhance teacher preparation, and provide better access to STEM majors for underrepresented minorities. The federal effort in STEM education is mainly focused on programs that aim to influence the quality of STEM education in the United States. The Office of Science and Technology Policy advises the President on scientific aspects of policy, while the National Science and Technology Council coordinates STEM policy across the government. The Committee on STEM Education is responsible for coordinating STEM programs and initiatives at the federal level, established in 2011 in accordance with the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. The federal effort in STEM education, known as NSTC-11, has implemented the Federal STEM Education Five-Year Strategic Plan with a total budget of $3.4 billion. The primary objectives of federal STEM investments include increasing postsecondary STEM degrees, preparing individuals for STEM careers, and conducting STEM education research and development. Nearly three-quarters of federal STEM investments are focused on these objectives. The NSTC-11 inventory suggested approaches to improve federal STEM education investments, such as consolidating programs, creating joint solicitations, and developing evaluation tools. It also identified primary audiences served by these investments, with most programs benefiting multiple audience types. The largest number of investments and total funding in STEM education were targeted towards undergraduate and graduate learners, as well as K-12 students and STEM teachers. CoSTEM's five-year strategic plan, mandated by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act in 2013, aimed to improve STEM instruction by preparing new K-12 STEM teachers and supporting the existing workforce. The CoSTEM's strategic plan aims to increase the number of new K-12 STEM teachers, enhance youth engagement in STEM, graduate more students in STEM fields, support underrepresented groups in STEM, and design graduate education for future STEM workforce. The federal STEM education effort receives funding ranging from $2.8 billion to $3.4 billion annually between FY2010 and FY2016. STEM education programs are spread across multiple federal agencies, with NSF, HHS, and ED receiving the largest shares of funding. DOI, DHS, and EPA have the smallest budgets for STEM education. Funding for STEM education programs from federal agencies varied between FY2010 and FY2016. While funding increased at CNCS, DOD, HHS, and NSF, it remained constant at the Department of Agriculture. The largest increases were seen at HHS and CNCS, while the largest decrease was at ED due to the termination of the SMART Grants program. In recent years, there has been a push to streamline federal STEM education efforts due to concerns about overlap and duplication among various agencies. The total number of STEM education investments at federal agencies dropped by 51% between FY2010 and FY2016, with significant reductions at NASA, HHS, NSF, DOC, and DHS. The federal agencies CNCS, DOI, and DOT saw net increases in STEM education investments from FY2010 to FY2016. The largest federal STEM education programs in FY2016 were National Research Service Awards ($477 million), Graduate Research Fellowship program ($332 million), and Mathematics and Science Partnership program ($153 million). The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education program ($105 million) at NSF is highlighted as the next-largest program in the OSTP inventory. The Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards (NRSA) constituted a significant portion of HHS spending on STEM education in FY2016, with most funds supporting Institutional Research Training Grants. The Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) program at NSF is one of the oldest and largest STEM education programs, offering prestigious awards to STEM graduate students. The Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) is a prestigious national award for STEM graduate students, offering three-year portable stipends for research-based graduate study. In FY2016, NSF issued 8,000 fellowships worth up to $46,000 each, totaling $332 million in program funding. NSF's Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) program supports projects to enhance STEM education for undergraduate students through innovative curricular materials and instructional methods. The NSF's Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) program focuses on developing new curricular materials, instructional methods, and assessment tools to enhance student learning in STEM fields. It also aims to promote diversity among students and instructors. IUSE offers awards in two tracks: Engaged Student Learning and Institutional and Community Transformation, with expectations of making 140 new awards. Funding can range from $300,000 for projects in the exploration stage to $3 million for projects in the implementation stage. The condition of STEM education in the United States has generally held constant and improved in some areas over the last four decades. However, concerns remain about achievement gaps, student performance on international tests, STEM teacher quality, and the STEM labor supply. The percentage of U.S. bachelor's degree holders in science and engineering was 35.0% in 2016. The percentage of bachelor's degrees in science and engineering (S&E) fields has remained relatively constant at 30-35% for the past four decades. The total number of S&E bachelor's degrees awarded annually tripled from 1966 to 2015, reaching 650,057. At the graduate level, S&E degrees make up 56-70% of all doctoral degrees, with the total number of doctoral degrees in S&E fields growing from 11,570 in 1966 to 44,521 in 2015. The number of S&E degrees awarded has tripled from 1966 to 2015, reaching 650,057. Graduate enrollment in S&E fields has also more than tripled, growing from about 493,000 to almost 668,000 between 2000 and 2015. U.S. student performance in mathematics has held constant or improved over the past four decades, as measured by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). NAEP is a series of four assessment programs assessing students' mathematics and science knowledge. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has been in place since the late 1960s, with the national and state assessments starting in 1990. Results discussed focus on student achievement in the national NAEP program, assessing students in grades 4 and 8 biennially. Math scores for 4th and 8th graders increased between 1990 and 2017 but have remained stable in the past decade. Various student subgroups have shown improvement in scores over time, with noticeable gaps. The average scores of 12th grade students on the NAEP mathematics assessment increased by two points from 2005 to 2015. The average scores on the NAEP science assessments for 12th graders remained unchanged from 2009 to 2015. NAEP presents student scores in achievement levels - Basic, Proficient, and Advanced. Students at or above the Proficient level demonstrate solid academic performance. In 2017, 80% of fourth-grade students performed at or above Basic level in mathematics, with 40% at Proficient level and 8% at Advanced level. For eighth-grade students, 70% were at or above Basic level, 34% at Proficient level, and 10% at Advanced level in the NAEP mathematics assessment. Concerns about STEM education include achievement gaps, teacher preparation, and U.S. student performance on international assessments. The conversation about STEM education in the U.S. focuses on achievement gaps among different groups, underrepresentation of minorities and women in STEM fields, and the availability of quality S&E graduates to meet the demands of the STEM labor market. These issues are considered concerns due to the underrepresentation of certain demographic groups in STEM majors. Some view underrepresentation in STEM majors as limiting U.S. economic competitiveness by decreasing the talent pool for employers. Others see it as an equity issue, preventing minorities from accessing lucrative careers and perpetuating economic gaps. Achievement gaps at the K-12 level often lead to underrepresentation in STEM fields. Achievement gaps and underrepresentation in STEM fields are evident in disparities by race, ethnicity, and gender in test scores, degree attainment, and employment. In 2017, there was a significant gap in average scores between white students and their black and Hispanic counterparts in 4th and 8th grade NAEP mathematics assessments. Despite improvements in average scores for all ethnicities since 1990, disparities persist. The achievement gaps between white students and minority groups persist from elementary school through K-12. In STEM education, there is underrepresentation of women and certain ethnic groups in science and engineering degrees. For example, in 2014, 19.8% of engineering bachelor's degrees went to women, up from 0.4% in 1966. However, the percentage of math and computer science degrees awarded to women decreased from 33.2% in 1966 to 25.5% in 2012. The proportion of computer science degrees awarded to women decreased from 33.2% in 1966 to 25.5% in 2012. Women accounted for 76.7% of psychology degrees and 59.1% of biological and agricultural sciences degrees in 2014. Women's share of STEM doctoral degrees grew from 39% in 2000 to 45% in 2015. Grad enrollments in S&E fields increased by 35% from 2000 to 2010, with higher growth rates among Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, and black/African American students compared to whites. The percentage of STEM bachelor's degrees awarded to Hispanic/Latino students grew significantly from 7.7% in 2004 to 12.1% in 2014, outpacing the growth of the Hispanic/Latino population. However, the percentage of STEM bachelor's degrees awarded to black/African-American students remained constant at just below 9%. Women and certain minorities have historically been underrepresented in STEM fields. In 2011, women were underrepresented in STEM occupations, making up 26% of STEM workers in the U.S. Their representation in STEM professions has increased since the 1970s, with varying percentages in different STEM fields. Black and Hispanic individuals are also underrepresented in STEM occupations, holding 6% and 7% of STEM jobs respectively in 2011. In 2011, women were underrepresented in STEM occupations, making up 26% of STEM workers in the U.S. Black and Hispanic individuals, who made up 15% of the workforce, held 7% of STEM jobs. Racial and ethnic representation in STEM fields differs, with gaps between total workforce and STEM workforce for black and Hispanic workers persisting since the 1970s. Many U.S. mathematics and science teachers lack degrees in the subjects they teach, impacting student achievement. In the 2007-2008 school year, around 17% of high school teachers did not major in the subject they taught, with 28% of mathematics teachers not majoring in mathematics. U.S. students score above the all-country average but below the average of industrialized nations in mathematics and science tests. In mathematics and science, U.S. students rank around the OECD average. However, they perform better on the TIMSS assessment, with 8th graders ranking ninth in math and eighth in science out of 34 education systems. There is evidence of improvement over time, with scores in 2015 higher than previous years. Critics caution against comparing nations based on test results due to various influencing factors. Some observers attribute low U.S. student performance to poverty, but this reasoning applies to other countries as well. Analysis shows that wealthy U.S. areas outperform most nations on international assessments. Improved performance on these assessments could benefit long-term economic growth. Concerns arise over the increasing number of STEM degrees awarded to foreign students, with their share of STEM doctorates rising from 30% in 2000 to 34% in 2015. In 2015, foreign students earned half or more of doctoral degrees in engineering, computer sciences, and economics. They received lower proportions of degrees in other S&E fields. The percentage of doctoral degrees going to foreign students has been increasing since the mid-1970s, raising concerns about job displacement for U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Some analysts argue that federal policymakers should encourage foreign STEM students to study and stay in the United States to maintain competitiveness. Concerns are raised about the declining number of STEM degrees awarded in the U.S. compared to other nations like India and China. In 2007, China surpassed the United States in awarding doctoral degrees in natural sciences and engineering, with a higher growth rate in STEM degree production due to significant government investments in higher education. Some argue that the United States produces higher quality graduates in STEM fields, questioning the accuracy of country-level comparisons. Concerns exist about national S&E workforce shortages impacting economic competitiveness and national security. However, others believe these concerns are exaggerated, and that U.S. competitiveness is not at risk from S&E labor shortages. There is also a view that increasing non-STEM jobs requiring STEM skills contribute to perceived workforce shortages. The 2015 report by the National Science Board highlighted the importance of coordination between education providers and employers to align supply and demand for STEM workers. In 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau reported 7.2 million STEM workers, with 70% holding at least a bachelor's degree. However, many trained in science and engineering are not working in STEM occupations. Those who majored in engineering or computers/mathematics/statistics had the highest rates of employment in STEM occupations (49% each), followed by physical and related sciences majors at 27%. Education majors had the lowest STEM employment rate at 2%. Federal interest in STEM education dates back to the 1st Congress, with institutions like HHS, the Smithsonian Institution, the National Academy of Sciences, and ED playing key roles. STEM education policymaking intensified after World War II to maintain scientific achievements. The National Science Foundation (NSF) was created in 1950 to maintain scientific achievements after World War II. In 1952, NSF started issuing Graduate Research Fellowship awards to STEM graduate students. The launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union in 1957 led to the National Defense Education Act of 1958, marking the first federal involvement in STEM education policy. Legislative actions by the 114th and 115th Congresses, such as the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015, significantly impacted federal STEM education at elementary and secondary levels. The Land Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 were historical federal measures related to the incorporation of the Northwest Territories. The Land Ordinance directed surveyors to establish townships with a lot reserved for a public school, while the Northwest Ordinance established governments and civil liberties in the territories. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established civil liberties and emphasized the importance of education, stating that schools and education should be encouraged. The Marine Hospital Service (MHS) was established in 1798 to provide medical care for merchant seamen, leading to the creation of federal health agencies like the NIH. The Ransdell Act of 1930 re-designated the Hygienic Laboratory as the NIH and expanded education and training funding. In 1948, the National Cancer Institute began funding institutions to improve undergraduate education. The NRSA was established by Congress in 1974 at NIH to consolidate existing research and fellowship authorities. In 2002, it was renamed the \"Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award.\" The Morrill Act of 1862 authorized the establishment of land-grant colleges in areas like engineering, agriculture, and military tactics. The 1890 Morrill Act expanded the colleges' purposes to include various sciences. These provisions were later replaced with a focus on \"food and agricultural sciences.\" The National Science Foundation (NSF) was established in 1950 to develop a national policy for basic research and education in the sciences. It has supported STEM education through fellowships for students and teacher institutes since its inception. The National Defense Education Act (NDEA) was passed in 1958 to address educational imbalances highlighted by the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik. STEM education has remained a core function of NSF despite changes made by Congress and the President. The NDEA authorized federal student loan programs, funds for science, math, and foreign language instruction, and grants for gifted students. The ESEA, amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act, is the primary federal aid to K-12 education. STEM education provisions have been added to subsequent reauthorizations. The HEA authorized various programs for higher education. The Higher Education Act (HEA) authorizes federal aid programs for institutions of higher education and student aid programs to help with postsecondary education costs, including STEM fields. The HEA was last amended in 2008 by the Higher Education Opportunity Act. The only major STEM-focused program administered by the Department of Education was enacted by the Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005, providing $4,000 grants to STEM students until 2010-2011. The Department of Education administered a major STEM-focused program that provided $4,000 grants to STEM students until the end of the 2010-2011 academic year. Approximately $1.4 billion in grants were awarded between FY2006 and FY2010. The Department of Education Organization Act established ED as an independent federal agency and transferred science education programs from NSF to ED, excluding certain programs related to scientific career development and research. The Education for Economic Security Act of 1984 authorized STEM teacher training programs and presidential awards for teaching in mathematics and science. It was enacted in response to concerns about the U.S. education system's competitiveness following reports like A Nation at Risk. The America COMPETES Act and its 2010 reauthorization also support various STEM education programs. The America COMPETES Act and its 2010 reauthorization authorize STEM education programs at federal science agencies and ED, including NSF, Department of Energy, NASA, and NOAA. The 2010 reauthorization established a federal STEM education coordinating committee. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act reauthorized portions of the COMPETES Acts. The Every Student Succeeds Act made changes to STEM education provisions. The Every Student Succeeds Act made changes to STEM education provisions, including the elimination of the Math and Science Partnerships program. STEM education is now an allowable use of funds in the new Title IV block grant. Additionally, ESSA authorized the STEM Master Teacher Corps program to provide salary bonuses and professional development for outstanding STEM teachers. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act supports the development of career and technical skills among students in secondary and postsecondary education. Total appropriations for the Perkins Act have averaged approximately $1.1 billion over the last 10 years. In the 115th Congress, the House of Representatives passed the Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (H.R. 2353) to provide more flexibility for states in setting performance targets. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA; P.L. 114-329) was signed into law in January 2017, reauthorizing portions of the America COMPETES Act with provisions related to federal investments in STEM education. The AICA directed NSF to award grants to increase underrepresented populations in STEM fields, created an advisory panel on STEM education, expanded grant programs for computer science research, and promoted STEM apprenticeship opportunities. The INSPIRE Women Act (P.L. 115-7) encourages women and girls to pursue STEM careers through NASA programs. The curr_chunk discusses data sources and major publications related to STEM education in the United States and globally. It includes information on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. The curr_chunk provides information on assessments such as TIMSS and PISA for math and science achievements of students, as well as a GAO report on federal STEM education programs. The curr_chunk discusses federal STEM education programs and policy recommendations, including reports from the National Science and Technology Council and the U.S. Department of Education. It provides an inventory of federal STEM education investments and funding data from FY2005 to FY2013, along with policy recommendations and program evaluations. The 2005 GAO report provides an inventory of federal STEM education programs and assesses program goals. The National Science Board's publication offers comprehensive STEM indicators. The National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics compiles and analyzes STEM data, including separate publications on STEM education. The GAO report assesses the relationship between STEM education and the workforce. The 2014 GAO report assesses trends in STEM degrees awarded in the US and available jobs over a decade. Five inventories of federal STEM education programs have been published since 2005, showing funding levels and program numbers. The GAO reports from 2012 and 2018 highlighted discrepancies in the number of federally funded STEM education programs, with funding ranging from $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. The complexity in measuring and categorizing these programs is due to the lack of a common definition for STEM education activities, making it challenging to accurately capture all relevant programs. Some federal STEM education programs have discrepancies in funding estimates, with challenges in measuring due to the lack of a common definition for STEM education activities. Some estimates rely on agency self-reporting, which is less reliable."
