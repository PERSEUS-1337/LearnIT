    "content": "The \"First Flight Commemorative Coin Act of 1997\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Coin specifications are outlined in section 2. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to mint and issue $10 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and half dollar clad coins with specific weights, diameters, and compositions. The Secretary of the Treasury may reduce the maximum amounts of coins minted if there is insufficient public demand. The coins minted under this Act will be legal tender. The Secretary will obtain gold and silver for minting coins under this Act from various sources, including silver stockpiles established under other laws. The design of the coins will be determined by the Secretary. The design of the coins minted under this Act will commemorate the first flight of Orville and Wilbur Wright in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina in 1903. The coins will feature a value designation, the year \"2003\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be selected by the Secretary in consultation with the First Flight Foundation and the Commission of Fine Arts. The design of the coins minted under this Act will commemorate the first flight of Orville and Wilbur Wright in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina in 1903, reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. The Secretary may issue coins minted under this Act from August 1, 2003, to July 31, 2004, with a possible 5-year extension for coins with sufficient public demand. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount. Surcharges will be included in all sales. The Secretary will sell coins at prices ranging from $1 to $35 per coin, with marketing expenses covered to promote the coins minted under the Act. SEC. 7 of the Act waives procurement regulations for goods and services needed for Act implementation, except for equal employment opportunity laws. SEC. 8 addresses the distribution of surcharges. SEC. 8 of the Act directs all surcharges from coin sales to be paid to the First Flight Foundation for maintaining the Wright Brothers Monument and National Memorial Park in North Carolina. The Comptroller General can audit the Foundation's expenditures. SEC. 9 of the Act ensures that minting coins will not cost the US Government. SEC. 10 waives restrictions on coins minted under this Act."
