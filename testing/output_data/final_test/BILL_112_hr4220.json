    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Home-Based Health Services Training and Employment Act of 2012\". The Congress finds that the baby boom generation will require more health care providers, there is a shortage of training programs for home care, availability of home-based health services is limited for public housing residents, there are 44 million caregivers in the US, and 62% of working caregivers have made adjustments to their work schedules. Many low-income families in the US face a dilemma between work and caregiving responsibilities, especially in public housing where many aging residents need care. The Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that a significant percentage of households in assisted housing are elderly. New service programs are needed to provide home-based health services and job training for those in need. The Department of Housing and Urban Development should establish a home-based health services pilot program to train job seekers in providing care for elderly and disabled public housing residents. This program aims to offer job training and placement for those in need of employment. The program aims to assist disabled public housing residents, including elderly and disabled veterans, to remain in their homes and communities. The pilot grant program aims to train public housing residents to provide covered home-based health services, assisting disabled individuals to stay in their homes and communities. The United States Housing Act of 1937 is amended to establish a pilot grant program for training public housing residents as home health aides to provide covered home-based health services to elderly and disabled residents. The United States Housing Act of 1937 is amended to establish a pilot grant program for training public housing residents as home health aides to provide covered home-based health services to elderly and disabled residents. Eligible entities for the grant include public housing agencies, community health centers, home care provider organizations, faith-based organizations, and labor organizations. The entity must demonstrate qualification to the Secretary to receive the grant. The Secretary must ensure the establishment of an employment training program for public housing residents to provide home-based health services. Criteria may be set for training residents to assist elderly and disabled individuals in federally-assisted rental housing. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary to receive a grant under this program. The Secretary requires eligible entities to submit an application for competitive grant awards, with criteria including the percentage of residents age 62 and older in the service area where public housing residents trained under an employment training program will provide home-based health services. The Secretary considers various criteria for awarding grants, including the percentage of disabled and unemployed residents, the ability to provide quality care training, the record of care quality, and geographic diversity among eligible entities. The program will include employment training programs serving urban, rural, Indian, and specific populations in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth. An entity receiving funding under this subsection may use funds to establish and carry out an employment training program for public housing residents to provide home-based health care services to elderly and disabled residents. This includes covering transportation and child care expenses for residents in training. The Secretary shall submit a report to Congress on the use and impact of the grant program established by the Home-Based Health Services Training and Employment Act of 2012, including the effectiveness of providing jobs for public housing residents and meeting health needs. The Secretary will report to Congress on the grant program's use and impact, focusing on meeting health and long-term care needs of elderly and disabled residents in public and federally-assisted rental housing. The report will also include recommendations for the program. Definitions include home-based health services as care provided in a person's residence. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a residence used as an individual's home, including home health services, personal care services, and home-based services covered under specific waivers. It also defines a home health aide and the term \"covered.\" The curr_chunk defines \"covered\" as home-based health services eligible for medical or financial assistance under specific programs. It also defines \"federally-assisted rental housing\" as housing supported by various federal acts. The curr_chunk specifies types of federally-assisted housing programs, including Section 8, Native American Housing block grants, National Housing Act mortgages, and Section 811 of the National Affordable Housing Act. The curr_chunk discusses exemptions from certain subsections, rule of construction, and regulations related to home-based health services under the Housing Act. Financial assistance may be provided to entities in the pilot program under subsection (f) for training public housing residents as home health aides and providers of home-based health services for elderly or disabled residents. Financial assistance may be provided to public housing residents trained by entities in the pilot program under subsection (f) for home-based health services for elderly or disabled residents, in locations where medical assistance is not available under a State plan. Financial assistance under subsection (f) requires entities to meet eligibility criteria, submit an application, and comply with Secretary's terms. Income impact on public housing residents trained in home health services is considered. Residents providing covered home-based health services will have their income impact their eligibility for Federal housing programs. The income received will apply towards benefits as follows: no income for the first 12 months after training, 25% for 12-24 months, 50% for 24-36 months, and 100% after 36 months post-training."
