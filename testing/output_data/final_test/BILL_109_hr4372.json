The Secretary of Homeland Security is allocated $100,000,000 for this purpose. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and rail entities, will issue guidelines for a rail worker emergency training program within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The program must include elements such as infrastructure security, hazardous material handling, evacuation procedures, and rail yard security. Rail yard security measures include unauthorized access prevention, reporting suspicious activity, and notifying law enforcement in case of emergencies. Rail workers must be trained on security plans, threat level identification, and emergency communication protocols. In the event of an emergency, passenger communication, live situational training exercises for various scenarios, protective equipment use, locomotive cab securement, background checks for contractors, distress codes, self-defense responses, and other relevant subjects are covered. Railroad carriers must develop emergency training programs for rail workers following guidelines issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The programs must be approved within 60 days of submission, and training of all rail workers must be completed within 1 year of approval. The Secretary will update the guidelines as necessary. The Secretary of Homeland Security will update training guidelines for railroad carriers to reflect new security threats. Carriers must revise their programs accordingly and provide additional training to rail workers within 60 days of notification.
