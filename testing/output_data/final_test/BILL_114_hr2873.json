    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Limiting the Ability to Demand Detrimental Employment Restrictions Act\" or the \"LADDER Act\". The Act, known as the \"Limiting the Ability to Demand Detrimental Employment Restrictions Act\" or \"LADDER Act,\" defines key terms such as \"commerce\" and \"covenant not to compete,\" which restricts an employee from working for another employer in a specific time or geographical area, or in a similar role as their current employer. The Act, named the \"Limiting the Ability to Demand Detrimental Employment Restrictions Act\" or \"LADDER Act,\" defines terms like \"employee,\" \"employer,\" and \"livable hourly rate,\" which is set at $15 per hour or the state/local minimum wage. The LADDER Act sets the minimum hourly rate for low-wage employees at the greater of the adjusted amount described in section 3(c) or the state/local minimum wage. A low-wage employee is defined as someone who receives hourly compensation less than the livable hourly rate of $15. The Secretary of Labor is referred to as the Secretary, and the term \"State\" has its usual meaning. The term \"State\" in the LADDER Act refers to its definition in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. PROHIBITING COVENANTS NOT TO COMPETE FOR LOW-WAGE EMPLOYEES. No employer can have a non-compete agreement with low-wage employees engaged in commerce. Employers must post notice of this law. The Secretary will adjust the amount for inflation annually. The Secretary will adjust the amount for inflation annually by increasing it based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. Adjusted amounts will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $0.05. SEC. 4. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT FOR COVENANTS NOT TO COMPETE. Employers must disclose the requirement for employees to enter into a covenant not to compete before hiring them. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. The Secretary will handle complaints of violations of section 3 or 4 similar to complaints under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Civil fines of up to $5,000 per employee may be imposed for violations. When imposing fines, the Secretary considers the employer's size and the severity of the violation."
