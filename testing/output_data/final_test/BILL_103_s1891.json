The amount determined for the quarter starting October 1, 1995, includes one-quarter of base expenditures for the State, an increase based on the consumer price index, and the amount that would have been expended by the Federal Government and the State in terminated programs under section 4. The amount determined for succeeding quarters starting January 1, 1996, is based on the State's previous quarter expenditure under subsection (a) and the estimated increase in the consumer price index. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, calculates the amount for each State based on the total Federal and State expenditures for terminated programs. The amount equal to total Federal and State expenditures for administering and providing aid to families with dependent children, benefits under the food stamp program, and benefits under the special supplemental program for women, infants, and children for the State during a specific 12-month period starting on July 1, 1994.

SEC. 3. PAYMENTS TO STATES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will make quarterly payments to each State during fiscal years 1996-2000, equal to one-quarter of the amount determined under subsection (b) for the year. The payments are to be used for purposes described in subsection (c), based on federal welfare savings calculations for each State. The State will receive quarterly payments from the Secretary of Health and Human Services during fiscal years 1996-2000. The payments are determined based on federal welfare savings calculations and are to be used for specific purposes outlined in subsection (c). In succeeding fiscal years, the amount available for a State is determined based on the previous year's amount, adjusted for the consumer price index increase, and the Federal and State expenditures that would have occurred if programs had not been terminated. The government and the State would have spent money in the fiscal year on programs terminated under section 4, solely due to an increase in recipients estimated by the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, with the Secretary of Agriculture, will calculate the Federal Government's expenses for providing aid to families with dependent children under a State plan. The text discusses the expenditure of benefits under various programs in each state during a specific 12-month period starting in 1994. It also outlines the purposes for which these amounts may be expended, particularly focusing on the Medicaid program during fiscal years 1996 to 2000. During fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000, a State can modify eligibility requirements for Medicaid under the Social Security Act, while using funds received to support the State's financial contributions.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services may grant a waiver of requirements if a State shows adequate need. If a State receives excess funds, they must use them for medical assistance under the State plan. The Social Security Act allows states to use excess funds to provide assistance for low-income families. States may be denied payments if they fail to meet certain requirements. This section ensures budget authority for the federal government to make payments as described. SEC. 4. TERMINATION OF CERTAIN FEDERAL WELFARE PROGRAMS.
