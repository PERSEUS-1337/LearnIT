    "content": "The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, initially introduced as S. 1000 in the 112th Congress, had three energy efficiency titles for buildings, industry, and federal agencies. It was later revised as S. 761 in the 113th Congress and then as S. 1392 in 2013. The bill, also known as the Shaheen-Portman bill 2013, focused on building energy codes, industrial energy efficiency, federal agencies, and budget offsets with voluntary provisions. The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, also known as the Shaheen-Portman bill 2013, focused on building energy codes, industrial energy efficiency, federal agencies, and budget offsets. The bill contained voluntary provisions and was designed to be deficit-neutral. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported the bill on a 19-3 vote. Amendments were filed, and by September 19, 2013, 125 amendments had been proposed, with controversy surrounding amendments on fossil fuel use, carbon emissions regulation, regional haze regulation, Keystone XL Pipeline, and the Affordable Care Act. The Keystone XL Pipeline and ACA amendments were the main focus of debate on S. 1392. The Keystone XL Pipeline amendment called for a Sense of Congress resolution to encourage the President to issue a construction permit. Proponents argued it would create jobs, generate tax revenues, and reduce oil imports. Opponents raised concerns about job numbers, oil exports, and environmental risks. Another ACA amendment would affect how Members of Congress and others can obtain certain benefits. The sponsor of S.Amdt. 1866 requested a vote on the amendment and objected to further consideration of other amendments, leading to an impasse and suspension of action on September 19, 2013. The legislative history of S. 1392, Shaheen-Portman Bill, includes its introduction on February 27, 2014, and referral to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. S. 2074 incorporated core provisions of S. 1392 and additional text from 10 floor amendments. On March 5, 2014, the House passed H.R. 2126, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2014, with provisions aligning closely with sections of S. 2262. Introduced on April 28, 2014, S. 2262 is similar to S. 2074 but with an increased budget offset amount in section 501. The budget offset in section 501 of S. 2262 was increased to $720 million for FY2014 through FY2018. The bill has five titles with provisions for energy efficiency in buildings, industry, and federal agencies. Section 431, repealing section 433 of the Energy Independence and Security Act, has been a major focus of controversy. Section 431 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 would repeal a provision aiming to cut fossil energy use in federal buildings by 2030. It would also push back the federal energy reduction goal to 2017 and direct the Department of Energy to review the feasibility of further postponing energy savings targets. This has caused division within the environmental and energy efficiency communities. The environmental and energy efficiency communities are divided over Section 431 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Supporters argue that the existing prohibition is unworkable, while opponents believe it would undermine federal leadership on net-zero energy buildings and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) supports the bill and estimates potential energy savings through a bottom-up analysis. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts a net decrease in the deficit with S. 2262. The CBO estimates that S. 2262 would decrease the deficit by $12 million from FY2014 to FY2024. The bill has support from various businesses, associations, and trade groups. The Obama Administration has not issued a Statement of Administration Policy on S. 2262, but expressed support for S. 1392. Various environmental and energy organizations support S. 2262, while the Christian Coalition also backs the bill. Heritage Action opposes S. 2262, arguing that the bill's incentives would burden taxpayers and consumers without tangible benefits. They believe the government should not interfere in energy efficiency markets, as only the free market can decrease costs and increase efficiency. Heritage Action also criticized S. 1392 in 2013. Heritage Action strongly opposed S. 1392 in 2013 and S. 2262 in 2014. The motion to proceed to S. 2262 was approved on May 6, 2014, with floor debate continuing until May 7, 2014. Various energy-related amendments were proposed, including approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and preventing the establishment of a carbon tax. As of May 7, 2014, a total of 71 amendments to S. 2262 had been considered. During the debate on S. 2262, various energy-related amendments were proposed, including approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and preventing the establishment of a carbon tax. A total of 71 amendments had been introduced by May 7, 2014. Some Senators expressed interest in having multiple votes on energy-related issues, while one Senator planned to offer an amendment modifying the Affordable Care Act provision for Members of Congress and top-level officials. A request was made to sideline an effort to amend the Affordable Care Act in exchange for votes on energy proposals, including the Keystone XL pipeline. Senate leaders are negotiating to limit floor action to five amendments, with potential topics including the Keystone XL pipeline, LNG exports, carbon capture requirements for power plants, social cost of carbon, and carbon tax. S. 2280 was introduced on May 1, 2014, for legislative approval. S. 2280 was introduced on May 1, 2014, for legislative approval regarding the Keystone XL pipeline. During floor action, amendments were proposed, including one for LNG exports to all WTO member countries. The amendment would apply to pending and future applications to export LNG to all WTO member countries, including Ukraine. Another Senator plans to offer an amendment based on H.R. 6 to accelerate LNG exports. Amendments affecting natural gas exports were proposed during floor action. The Electricity Security and Affordability Act, S. 1905, aims to block the EPA's proposed rule for new coal-fired power plants. Efforts are underway to attach the bill as an amendment to S. 2262. During floor action, one amendment was offered that would affect power plant carbon capture. The social cost of carbon is a quantitative measure used in cost-benefit analyses of climate change policies and energy efficiency rules. Efforts are underway to craft amendments related to the social cost of carbon and the establishment of a carbon tax policy. During floor action on May 12, 2014, a bill involving a carbon tax faced a cloture vote that failed to reach the required threshold. The Majority Leader changed his vote to reserve the right for reconsideration, resulting in a final vote tally of 55-36. The bill aimed to strengthen national building codes for energy efficiency in new homes and commercial buildings. The legislation aims to strengthen national building codes for energy efficiency by requiring DOE support in setting energy savings targets and providing technical assistance. States must certify if they have updated their building codes to meet or exceed energy savings targets within two years of model code updates. DOE can offer technical assistance but adoption and enforcement of codes remain with the states. The legislation empowers DOE to support updating model building energy codes, utilizing specific codes as baselines, and providing funding to incentivize states to meet energy efficiency goals. It establishes programs for training engineers, architects, and workers in energy-efficient building design and operations. The legislation includes a career skills program for worker training in energy-efficient building technologies, with $10 million in funding and a 50 percent federal cost share. It also requires DOE to review energy efficiency programs for schools and provide technical assistance for energy efficiency projects. Subtitle D of the legislation focuses on energy efficiency in federal and other buildings. It requires the Administrator of General Services to develop model leasing provisions to encourage energy efficiency measures in federal leasing documents. Additionally, it mandates the development of policies and best practices for high-performance energy efficiency measures in separate spaces. Section 132 requires a study on improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings through high-performance measures in separate spaces. Section 133 establishes a voluntary Tenant Star program to recognize energy-efficient tenants in commercial buildings. Subtitle E: Energy Information for Commercial Buildings Section 141 requires federal agencies leasing space in non-ENERGY STAR labeled buildings to benchmark energy consumption and disclose it publicly. It also mandates agencies to provide energy consumption information to building owners for benchmarking purposes. Additionally, the DOE is tasked with studying the impact and best practices of state and local benchmarking policies for commercial buildings. Title II: Industrial Efficiency and Competitiveness Subtitle A: Manufacturing Energy Efficiency Section 201 authorizes funding for programs to improve industrial efficiency, streamline regulatory authority, deploy efficient technologies, and enhance public-private partnerships. Section 202 directs Industrial Assessment Centers to coordinate efforts with the Manufacturing Future of Industry Program. Subtitle B: Sustainable Manufacturing Initiative requires EERE to provide onsite technical assessments to manufacturers for efficiency opportunities. Supply Star, under Section 211, establishes a DOE pilot program to promote highly efficient supply chains with financing, technical support, and training. Electric Motor Rebate is also included in this section. Subtitle C: Electric Motor Rebate Program Section 221 creates a DOE rebate program to incentivize purchases of new, high efficiency motor systems. $10 million in programmatic funding for FY2014 through FY2023. Subtitle D: Transformer Rebate Program Section 231 directs DOE to launch an incentive rebate for energy efficient transformers. $5 million authorized for each of FY2014 and FY2015. Title III: Federal Agency Energy Efficiency Section 301 requires DOE to issue recommendations for energy efficiency in information technologies. Section 302 allows the General Services Administration to use funds for updating project designs of approved building construction to meet efficiency standards. Section 303 mandates federal agencies to work with the Office of Management and Budget to develop a strategy for implementing energy-efficient technologies in data centers, with annual evaluations for energy efficiency. DOE and the Office of E-Government are directed to maintain a program certifying practitioners to evaluate energy usage in data centers. The program certifies practitioners to evaluate energy usage at federal data centers and establishes an open data initiative for optimization. A demonstration program allows HUD to use performance-based contracts for energy and water upgrades in multifamily housing units, funded by private investors and reimbursed with utility bill savings. The program under Title IV targets residential units in multifamily buildings participating in rental assistance programs. Contracts issued may last up to 12 years, with payments contingent on validated utility savings by a third-party. Third-party certification requirements for Energy Star program partners are revised to exclude testing for those compliant with regulations. Subtitle B of the program focuses on Federal Green Buildings, requiring the DOE to review private sector green building certification systems to determine the most environmentally sound approach for certifying federal buildings. The cost of this amendment would be covered by the current EPA and DOE Energy Star budget. Subtitle C of the program addresses water heaters, specifically grid-enabled electric-resistance water heaters for electric thermal storage or demand response programs. It includes energy conservation standards and data reporting requirements for manufacturers and utilities. Subtitle D focuses on energy performance requirements for federal buildings. The Energy Performance Requirement for Federal Buildings extends existing targets, requiring DOE to review implementation results and analyze cost-effectiveness. Federal energy managers must conduct energy and water evaluations every four years to ensure optimal efficiency. Repeals the provision for reducing fossil fuel energy consumption in federal buildings to 0% by 2030. Section 432 expands energy standards for new federal buildings to include major renovations. Future rulemakings must adhere to the \"Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations\" for buildings over 5,000 sq. ft. Section 433 requires HUD to update underwriting guidelines for borrowers submitting a qualified home energy report for FHA-insured loans. The updated guidelines for underwriting criteria and valuation would consider energy cost savings as an offset to expenses. Lenders must inform loan applicants about the benefits of improving home energy efficiency. Section 441 mandates DOE to recognize voluntary certification programs for HVAC and water heating products. Title V of the legislation includes amendments to funding authorizations for FY2013-2018, budgetary effects compliance with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, and requirements for advance appropriations."
