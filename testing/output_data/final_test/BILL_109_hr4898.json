Congress finds that the Department of Defense's budget is larger than the total defense spending of all other countries combined. Despite this, the United States ranks 25th in infant mortality globally. $60 billion of the defense budget is spent on weapons for Cold War-era threats, while education funding has decreased to less than 10% of the proposed 2007 defense budget. While schools are cutting programs in music, foreign language, and physical education, 61,000,000 individuals in the US lack health insurance at some point each year. The Government Accountability Office estimates that a third of public schools need extensive repairs, serving 14,000,000 children. The US schools, with 73,000 facilities serving 40,000,000 children, require over $120 billion for repairs and replacements. Research shows that American middle school students rank 18th in science and 19th in math globally. The Department of Defense couldn't account for over $1 trillion in funds in 2003. The Department of Defense is responsible for over $1 trillion in funds. The US spends $20 billion annually on its nuclear arsenal, some of which are obsolete. The Department is also investing in space weapons despite White House policy emphasizing arms control. The United States faces challenges in arms control and nonproliferation, with allies opposing the development of space weapons to prevent an arms race. The country needs to reduce dependence on foreign oil and invest in sustainable energy for long-term security. Sustainable development and humanitarian aid are crucial in addressing national security threats and terrorism. To effectively combat terrorism, the United States must address global challenges such as poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, disease, and disaster by increasing funding for sustainable development and humanitarian assistance programs.
