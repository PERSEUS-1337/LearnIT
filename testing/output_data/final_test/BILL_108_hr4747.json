The Congress finds that over 158 million Americans use dietary supplements to improve their health, with consumer spending reaching $17.1 billion in 2000. The FDA predicts continued growth in supplement use due to factors like aging populations and advances in science.

However, the FDA has not effectively enforced DSHEA and needs more resources for implementation. Congress has allocated additional funds to enforce DSHEA, reaching $9,700,000 in fiscal year 2003.
