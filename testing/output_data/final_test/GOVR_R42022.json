    "content": "Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Mahmoud Abbas is considering alternative pathways for a Palestinian state due to lack of progress in peace talks with Israel. PLO and PA officials are seeking international recognition for Palestinian statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with over 100 countries already recognizing Palestine. The initiative has raised questions about the positions of North American and Western European governments that provide financial support to the PA. PLO officials are pursuing action in the United Nations to garner more international support. The Palestinian Authority is seeking international recognition for statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with support from the Palestinian public and various international institutions. Proponents of the initiative cite PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's plan for \"de facto statehood\" by August 2011 and President Obama's goal for a Palestinian state by 2011. A poll shows 83% of Palestinians support turning to the UN for support. The World Bank, IMF, and UN noted the Palestinian Authority's progress towards statehood but highlighted obstacles like an underdeveloped private sector, movement constraints imposed by Israel, fiscal issues due to lack of donor funding, and stalled negotiations. PLO Chairman Abbas initiated action for Palestinian state membership at the UN, based on the 1967 borders. The U.N. Secretary-General is expected to submit the Palestinian state membership matter to the Security Council for a recommendation. The Obama Administration may veto a positive recommendation, requiring a two-thirds majority vote in the General Assembly for admission. Security Council deliberations are ongoing, with the possibility of a General Assembly resolution for recognition based on the 1967 borders. The Assembly resolution may recommend recognizing a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, changing Palestine's status in the UN to a \"non-member state\" with a simple majority vote. This could help gain more support for U.N. action. UNESCO's General Conference is considering Palestinian membership, with a vote scheduled for October 25. The UNESCO General Conference is set to vote on Palestinian membership from October 25 to November 10, 2011. If Palestine is admitted, the US may be required to stop funding UNESCO due to a legal provision. This could impact UNESCO as the US currently contributes 22% of its budget. Many Members of Congress are interested in potential U.N. action on Palestinian statehood and may try to influence U.S. policy. The United States may face a choice between backing its opposition to U.N. action on Palestinian statehood with changes to aid or taking a more reserved approach. Both options have risks, with strong opposition potentially leading to loss of credibility and a restrained response seen as weakness. The outcome of U.N. action could present further challenges to U.S. policy. The aftermath of U.N. action on Palestinian statehood may pose challenges to U.S. efforts for a two-state solution. The U.N. framework and process for options include recognition of states, observer status, and criteria for U.N. membership. PLO Chairman Abbas applied for U.N. membership in 2011, leading to circulation of the application to member states, Security Council, and General Assembly. The Security Council referred the application for Palestinian statehood to its Committee on Admission of New Members for examination and report. The Committee has been meeting to review and examine the application, with reports expected by November 11. The United Nations does not recognize states; states recognize states. The United Nations does not recognize states; states recognize states. Some argue that admission to membership is an acknowledgment of statehood. Palestine is currently considered an \"entity\" by the UN, with observer status in the General Assembly. Non-member states can apply for Permanent Observer status. The United Nations does not recognize states; states recognize states. Palestine is currently considered an \"entity\" by the UN, with observer status in the General Assembly. There is a suggestion to change Palestine's observer status to that of a non-member state, which would require meeting the criteria for statehood outlined in the UN Charter. Bruno Simma outlines five criteria for admission to the UN, emphasizing that membership is only open to states recognized by others. Simma outlines the standard requirements for statehood, including recognition by other states and the ability to conduct diplomacy. To qualify as a state under international law, an applicant must have a defined territory, a permanent population, and an independent government. Additionally, being 'peace-loving' is a key criterion for UN membership, as stated in the UN Charter's Article 1, to maintain international peace and security. This criterion also reflects historical context and current behavior of the applicant state. The criterion \"peace-loving State\" is a key requirement for UN membership, reflecting historical context and current behavior. Applicant states must accept the obligations in the Charter and demonstrate the capacity and willingness to fulfill them. These criteria may still be considered during membership evaluations. The UN membership criteria include a minimum standard of resource endowment and willingness to fulfill obligations of the Charter. The admissions process is flexible, with indicators such as maintaining friendly relations and utilizing peaceful dispute settlement procedures. The Security Council and General Assembly are involved in considering applications for membership. The process for U.N. membership involves submitting applications to the Secretary-General, who forwards them to the General Assembly and Security Council. The Security Council reviews the application and refers it to the Council Committee on the Admission of New Members for consideration. The Security Council reviews membership applications and submits a report with recommended resolution language to the Council for consideration. Decisions are subject to veto by any of the five permanent members. If recommended, a resolution is forwarded to the General Assembly, along with a complete record of the discussion. If not recommended, a special report is submitted to the General Assembly. The General Assembly considers an applicant State's membership based on recommendations from the Security Council. Membership is decided by a two-thirds majority vote, and becomes effective upon adoption of the resolution. If the Security Council does not recommend or delays consideration, the Assembly may send the application back for further review. Appendix A details the process for recently admitted states. Appendix A provides information on the process for three recently admitted states, including document numbers for examination. The General Assembly sought an alternative approach in 1949 when the Security Council was unable to recommend admission for several states due to the USSR's veto. The Assembly requested an advisory opinion from the ICJ on whether a state can be admitted to the UN without a Security Council resolution. The World Court's advisory opinion in 1950 stated that admission to the UN cannot be done by the General Assembly if the Security Council fails to recommend a candidate. The Uniting for Peace Resolution was not considered a valid alternative in this case. Currently, there are 17 specialized agencies within the United Nations system, each with its own constitution, rules, and financial resources. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is not a specialized agency but operates similarly. IAEA reports to the General Assembly, Security Council, and ECOSOC. Membership requirements for these agencies vary. Membership in United Nations specialized agencies varies in terms of admission processes. Eleven agencies grant automatic membership to UN member states without requiring approval from the agency's membership. Three agencies also offer membership to member nations of any specialized agency without a vote. Two agencies, FAO and UNWTO, require a voting process for admission. UNWTO currently requires a two-thirds vote for membership, but a potential amendment could open membership to all UN member states. The United States is not a member of UNIDO or UNWTO. UNWTO, following UNESCO's Constitution, allows for membership of states not in the UN with a two-thirds vote. In October 2011, the UNESCO Executive Board recommended Palestine's membership, with 40 in favor, 4 against, and 14 abstentions. The UNESCO General Conference admitted Palestine as a member during its 36th session in October-November 2011. Various actors, including the US, PLO, Israel, EU, Arab states, and Turkey, could influence potential U.N. actions. The PLO must decide which U.N. venue to pursue. The United States, Israel, and other actors may seek to influence Palestinian decision-making on U.N. resolutions regarding Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and statehood aspirations. A compromise resolution could prevent a U.S. veto at the Security Council but risks negative reactions from Palestinians, potentially fueled by Hamas or other anti-peace parties. The United States, Israel, and other actors may seek to influence Palestinian decision-making on U.N. resolutions regarding Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and statehood aspirations. Possible implications could arise from U.N. action, with a focus on diplomatic efforts in Europe and potential resolutions. Possible implications of U.N. action on Palestinian statehood include consequences for interactions between Israelis and Palestinians, precedents for further international action, and ramifications for future negotiations and political developments. Emphasizing Palestinian claims to statehood may not resolve core issues, and some doubt that international or unilateral actions can lead to significant progress towards Palestinian independence. An upgrade in status for Palestinians may not provide key sovereignty characteristics like military capacity and control over borders. Israel would likely maintain control over East Jerusalem and the West Bank, while Hamas rules Gaza. The PLO could face challenges if Israel continues to control developments. U.N. action on statehood is seen as significant by PLO officials, but reduced support post-U.N. action could hinder future efforts. A resolution upgrading the permanent observer status of Palestine in the United Nations to a non-member state may lead to changes in how Israelis and Palestinians address their disputes, potentially altering expectations and dynamics in their relationship. This could impact Palestinian efforts to seek redress for political and legal claims and garner international support for follow-up measures. Israel views these developments as potentially delegitimizing and could lead to greater levels of Palestinian civil unrest. A General Assembly resolution recognizing Palestinian statehood could lead to increased Palestinian civil disobedience, international boycotts, and legal actions against Israel in international courts. This could potentially strengthen Palestinian access to international forums, but would not automatically confer privileges. Some PLO leaders argue that Israeli control over the West Bank and Gaza would then be seen as one state occupying another. Some international actors argue that Israeli control over the West Bank and Gaza would be viewed as one state occupying another, potentially increasing pressure on Israel. Abbas prefers a U.S.-led negotiation process but believes U.N. action for Palestinian statehood could level the playing field. However, pursuing U.N. action outside negotiations may signal a lack of faith in the U.S. as a peace process mediator. Some analysts argue that the PLO's pursuit of U.N. action on Palestinian statehood undermines prospects for resuming negotiations and violates previous Israeli-PLO agreements. Others warn that Palestinian sovereignty gained through unilateral means might relieve international urgency for a two-state solution. On September 23, the Quartet issued a statement acknowledging President Abbas's application for Palestinian state membership in the U.N. The Quartet supports President Abbas's application for Palestinian statehood at the UN, reaffirming its commitment to seeking a comprehensive resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict based on various UN resolutions and peace initiatives. It urges the parties to overcome obstacles and resume direct negotiations. The Quartet reiterates its urgent appeal for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations to resume without delay or preconditions. It proposes preparatory meetings within a month to agree on an agenda and timeline for reaching an agreement by the end of 2012. The Quartet expects comprehensive proposals on territory and security within three months and substantial progress within six months, leading to an international conference in Moscow. Efforts to restart negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian officials have led to plans for Quartet meetings in late October. However, a resumption of negotiations may be unlikely unless the PLO drops its insistence on a halt to Israeli settlement building, which has continued despite protests from Palestinian officials and international figures. The U.S. State Department and Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz express concerns about further construction in East Jerusalem, stating it hinders peace talks. Givat Hamatos development is seen as a barrier to a potential peace agreement. Hamas' refusal to recognize Israel and ongoing conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians complicate negotiations. Broad international support for Palestinian statehood could heighten Israeli security concerns due to political changes in the Arab world. Israeli threat perceptions may lead to some flexibility on core issues in a final-status Israel-PLO peace agreement, although the current political climate in Israel makes this unlikely. Time constraints for reaching a deal with the Palestinians are emphasized by commentators and former Israeli leaders. The current political climate in Israel may lead to less flexibility in negotiations with Palestinians, as Israeli leaders fear that concessions could embolden Palestinians and other Arabs. Many in the ruling coalition view the changes in the Arab world as a reason for caution, favoring military and strategic approaches over land-for-peace deals. Israel's best chance for long-term security lies in negotiating peace with the Palestinians. Possible Israeli responses to the Palestinian statehood issue include withholding transfer revenue, increasing settlement construction, and tightening security in the West Bank and Gaza. The outcome of U.N. action could impact internal Palestinian developments and their dealings with Israel and the international community. The Palestinian leadership's ability to drive the agenda towards peace with Israel, potential reunification efforts between Fatah and Hamas, and the risks of uprisings or challenges to their leadership are key questions amidst international recognition of Palestinian sovereignty. Many observers believe that Hamas agreed to exchange Israeli Sergeant Gilad Shalit for Palestinian prisoners in 2011 to regain domestic and regional prestige lost to Abbas and the PLO's U.N. initiatives. Progress in PA security capacities, West Bank economic development, and Israeli cooperation is seen as a result of U.S. aid, but the sustainability of this progress and its contribution to a broader political solution remain uncertain. The effectiveness of U.S. aid in influencing Palestinian political decisions depends on Palestinian recognition that it serves their long-term interests. Palestinian support for U.S.-sponsored efforts against Hamas and internal reforms may diminish without belief in U.S. support for their self-determination. Continued U.S. opposition to U.N. action on Palestinian statehood could further erode Palestinian confidence. The United States' effectiveness as a partner for Palestinians may be questioned, potentially undermining leverage from U.S. aid programs. Political pressure and frustration could lead to a shift in support for U.S. priorities. The lack of progress in the peace process may escalate tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, increasing the likelihood of conflict. The potential widening divisions between Palestinian territories due to neglect of Gaza Strip residents could lead to heightened resentment towards parties promoting the peace process. Some Members of Congress are questioning the continuation of U.S. assistance to Palestinians, especially if the PLO seeks recognition from international bodies. Some Members of Congress have placed holds on U.S. aid to Palestinians, including $192.2 million in Economic Support Fund project assistance and $147.6 million in International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement non-lethal assistance for PA security forces. Congresswoman Kay Granger and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen are involved in this decision. Some Members of Congress, including Senator Richard Lugar and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, have placed holds on U.S. aid to Palestinians due to uncertainty about providing aid while actions are being taken to boost support for Palestinian statehood outside of negotiations with Israel. It is unclear how long these holds may last. The final $50 million of the FY2011 authorized $200 million in direct budgetary assistance for the Palestinian Authority is not subject to a hold. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu urged Congress members not to object to the aid. Legislation for FY2012 appropriations would condition aid on the PA not seeking recognition at the United Nations without an agreement with Israel. The Senate Appropriations Committee's bill in September 2011 would prohibit direct budgetary assistance to the Palestinian Authority if Palestine seeks UN membership without an agreement with Israel. The Secretary of State could waive the prohibition for national security reasons and would need to provide recommendations on the PLO's status in the US if Palestine pursues UN membership. If the PLO gains international support for Palestinian statehood, it may shift away from the traditional Oslo peace process, leading Congress to face a dilemma regarding aid. Continuing aid may reduce PLO's incentive to modify its approach, while reducing aid could decrease U.S. influence over Palestinian policies. The potential shift in Palestinian statehood approach may lead to increased reliance on aid from European or Gulf Arab sources, potentially strengthening Iran's influence. This could diverge from U.S. interests in maintaining Israel's security and promoting democratic values. Cuts in U.S. aid may lead to erosion of Israel-PA security cooperation, escalating violence and hindering prospects for a two-state solution. Witnesses caution against an across-the-board cutoff of aid to the PA. The Council warns against a blanket cutoff of aid to the Palestinian Authority in response to potential U.N. actions, as some programs benefit U.S. and Israeli interests. The collapse of the PA could benefit terrorist groups like Hamas. It is advised to wait and see President Abbas's actions before making decisions. Some Members of Congress are considering reducing U.S. contributions to the United Nations or any U.N. agency that recognizes Palestinian statehood. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen has cited past threats to U.N. funding to discourage recognition of Palestinian statehood. In 2011, PLO diplomatic efforts for U.N. membership for a Palestinian state face a likely U.S. veto in the Security Council. However, there is potential for an upgrade to non-member state status in the General Assembly or membership in U.N.-affiliated agencies like UNESCO. The U.S., Israel, and European countries aim to influence Palestinian decisions on U.N. action and resolutions. The potential U.N. action on Palestinian statehood, including the question of borders along the 1967 lines, could lead to Israeli security measures in the West Bank and Gaza. PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas seeks a return to negotiations with Israel, but chances are low. Upgrading Palestinian statehood status at the U.N. may increase pressure on Israel to change its stance. The PLO aims to increase international legal pressure on Israel through access to institutions like the ICJ or ICC. This could lead to legal action against Israeli military practices and settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, potentially impacting Israeli military leaders with war crimes charges. Israel is concerned about the implications of Palestinian access to such institutions on its military morale and operational freedom. The U.N. action on Palestinian statehood may influence Israel's willingness to make concessions in negotiations, especially amidst changes in the Arab world and Israel's political landscape. The potential impact of U.N. action on Palestinian statehood on Israel's political and military relationships with Egypt and Turkey, as well as the internal challenges the PLO may face if the outcome does not meet Palestinian expectations. Congressional decision-making on aid to the PA could be tied to PLO efforts towards U.N. action and the diplomatic and on-the-ground outcomes that follow. Some observers believe that if the Security Council does not take action on an independent Palestine, the issue may be brought to the General Assembly for approval of a membership application, following the Uniting for Peace Resolution process. The General Assembly adopted Resolution 377 A (V) in 1950 as an option when the Security Council couldn't act on matters of international peace. After North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, the Council recommended member states provide assistance. The USSR initially boycotted Council meetings but later cast a negative vote on a U.S. draft resolution. The General Assembly resolved to act if the Security Council failed due to lack of unanimity among permanent members. If the Security Council is unable to act due to lack of agreement among permanent members, the General Assembly will promptly consider the situation and may recommend collective measures, including the use of armed force if necessary, to maintain international peace and security. An emergency special session can be convened within 24 hours if requested by the Security Council or a majority of UN members. The World Court advisory opinion refutes the use of the Uniting for Peace Resolution for admitting states to U.N. membership. Israeli analysts believe that PLO's pursuit of U.N. vote on Palestinian statehood violates previous agreements. The Palestinian Authority, presidency, and parliament agreed to resolve differences through negotiations. Claims of Israel breaching the Oslo agreements are possible, which aimed for a permanent settlement based on UN resolutions for Israel to withdraw from occupied territories for peace. The Interim Agreement prohibits any changes to the status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip until a permanent settlement is reached. The PLO's pursuit of a U.N. vote on Palestinian statehood for the West Bank and Gaza could be seen as contradicting the Oslo agreements. Israeli sources argue that this move may allow the PLO to gain sovereignty for \"Palestine\" without breaching the agreements. The ongoing requirement for the PLO to abide by the Oslo agreements, including negotiations, is debatable. The PLO could argue that the agreements no longer apply as they were meant to last for a transitional period of 5 years. The Oslo agreements between the PLO and Israel were meant to last for a transitional period of 5 years, governing specified areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The continuing applicability of the agreements beyond the initial 5-year period is unclear, leading to potential disputes between the parties. Israel could argue that by allowing the PA to continue its administrative duties, the PLO has accepted the agreements in their entirety, while Palestinians could claim that Israel breached obligations by actions such as building settlements in the West Bank. A potential U.N. General Assembly resolution on Palestinian statehood could be seen as undermining UNSCRs 242 and 338 by recognizing Palestinian sovereignty within the 1967 borders without addressing security considerations or requiring commitments for peace with Israel. General Assembly resolutions are generally non-binding. A General Assembly resolution on Palestinian statehood may not legally conflict with UNSCRs 242 and 338 as it is generally seen as non-binding. The PLO argues that pursuing statehood does not violate \"land-for-peace\" principles, and a sovereign Palestinian entity could potentially negotiate a compromise with Israel. Israeli analysts also see this move as shaping the diplomatic struggle between the two parties. The move to shape the political context of the diplomatic struggle between Israel and the Palestinians in favor of the Palestinians is seen as a struggle about political consciousness and international law. The idea of potential international recognition of Palestinian statehood is linked to the concept of an \"independent Palestinian state with provisional borders and attributes of sovereignty\" proposed in Phase II of the Roadmap. Congressional Action Regarding Palestinian Statehood was included in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY1990 and FY1991 after the PLO's declaration of statehood in 1988. In response to Yasser Arafat's threat to declare a state in May 1999, the House of Representatives and Senate passed resolutions opposing any attempt to establish Palestinian statehood outside of negotiations with Israel. This was in line with previous legislation that prohibited U.S. funding for the United Nations if the PLO was given the same standing as member states. The President should assert U.S. opposition to a unilateral Palestinian state declaration, citing violation of Oslo accords. In 2000, the House passed a bill to downgrade PLO office in the U.S. and prohibit aid to a declared Palestinian state. H.R. 5272 prohibits U.S. aid to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, authorizes the President to reduce contributions to international organizations recognizing a Palestinian state, and prohibits funds for recognizing a Palestinian state. It also opposes membership of a Palestinian state in international financial institutions. The Holy See and Palestine have observer status at the United Nations. The Holy See gained this status in 1964, while Palestine received it in 1974 and has since gained enhanced capacities. In 2004, a resolution was adopted giving the Holy See similar enhanced capacities to Palestine."
