    "content": "The Social Security program provides monthly cash benefits to retired or disabled workers and their dependents, as well as to the survivors of deceased workers. Workers need 40 earnings credits to qualify for benefits, with credits earned based on covered earnings. The program is financed by mandatory payroll taxes on wages and self-employment income. About 94% of the workforce in the United States is required to pay Social Security payroll taxes. In 2017, Social Security-covered workers and their employers each pay 6.2% of earnings up to $127,200. Self-employed individuals pay 12.4% on net self-employment income up to $127,200. Certain workers are exempt from Social Security payroll taxes, such as state and local government employees in alternative retirement systems, election workers earning less than $1,800, and ministers who opt out. Noncitizens working in the U.S. labor force, including those under specific visa categories, must pay Social Security payroll taxes. Exceptions apply for citizens of countries with totalization agreements and certain visa categories like H-2A agricultural workers and F and M students. The Social Security Administration (SSA) does not cover certain visa categories (e.g., H-2A agricultural workers, F and M students). Foreign nationals without work authorization are not necessarily illegally present. The SSA maintains an Earnings Suspense File for wages that cannot be matched to individual records due to mismatches in names and SSNs. As of October 2016, the file included 346 million wage items totaling $1.3 trillion, often due to clerical errors or the use of invalid SSNs by unauthorized aliens working in the U.S. In 2013, the SSA estimated that 3.1 million unauthorized aliens were working and paying Social Security taxes in 2010. Of those, 0.6 million had temporary work authorization but overstayed, 0.7 million obtained fraudulent birth certificates, and 1.8 million used SSNs that did not match their names. $13 billion in payroll taxes were from unauthorized immigrant workers and their employers in 2010. The Social Security Act specifies insured status and age requirements for entitlement to benefits. Once eligible, there are few restrictions on benefit payments, except for individuals in certain circumstances like residing in certain countries, being incarcerated, or being unlawfully present in the United States. The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 further restricts benefit payments in certain cases. The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 restricts the payment of benefits to certain noncitizens who file based on an SSN assigned after January 1, 2004. Noncitizens must have work authorization at the time of SSN assignment or later to gain insured status. Covered earnings only count towards insured status if the individual had work authorization at some point. If not, benefits would not be payable based on their work record. Noncitizens filing based on an SSN assigned before January 1, 2004, are not subject to the work authorization requirement. Noncitizens filing for benefits based on an SSN assigned before January 1, 2004, are not required to have work authorization. All Social Security-covered earnings count towards insured status and benefit computation, regardless of work authorization status. Congressional legislation on immigration reform has addressed the issue of unauthorized work earnings affecting Social Security benefits. In the 114th Congress, H.R. 1996 would prevent DACA recipients from receiving SSNs and Social Security benefits. The treatment of earnings from unauthorized work for Social Security purposes varies based on SSN assignment before or after 2004. Noncitizens authorized to work can be assigned an SSN, while those not authorized can only get one for nonwork reasons. Before the regulatory change, noncitizens could be assigned an SSN for nonwork purposes like obtaining a driver's license. Noncitizens in the US must be \"lawfully present\" to receive benefits, and if not, their benefits are suspended. Exceptions allow noncitizens to receive benefits while outside the US. Noncitizens in the United States can receive benefits outside the country if they meet exceptions to the alien nonpayment provision. Benefits are suspended if they are outside the US for more than six months, unless they are from a social insurance country or have a totalization agreement with the US. If they do not meet exceptions, benefits are suspended until they return lawfully. Noncitizens in the United States can receive benefits outside the country if they meet exceptions to the alien nonpayment provision. Benefits are suspended if they are outside the US for more than six months, unless they are from a social insurance country or have a totalization agreement with the US. To receive payments outside the United States, alien dependents and survivors must have lived in the United States for at least five years previously, with exceptions for treaty obligation countries or totalization agreement countries. When the Social Security program started in 1940, there were no restrictions on benefits for noncitizens. In 1956, Congress approved restrictions on benefits for alien workers living abroad, requiring them to reside in the US to receive benefits and suspending payments if they stayed outside the country for more than six months. In 1983, restrictions were also placed on benefit payments to alien dependents and survivors living abroad. In 1983, the Social Security Act (P.L. 98-21) imposed residency requirements on dependents and survivors, requiring them to have lived in the US for at least five years. Tighter restrictions were enacted due to fraudulent cases of adding dependents to benefit rolls after workers returned to their native countries. The U.S. General Accounting Office estimated that 56,000 out of 164,000 dependents living abroad in 1981 were added to the rolls under such circumstances. In 1981, 164,000 dependents living abroad were added to Social Security benefit rolls after the worker became entitled to benefits, with 91% being noncitizens. Some beneficiaries were found to be faking marriages and adoptions to cheat the system, especially in countries like Greece, Italy, Mexico, and the Philippines. Tighter restrictions on benefits for aliens residing in the US were approved by Congress in 1996. The PRWORA and Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 restricted Social Security benefits for aliens in the US who are not lawfully present, effective from September 1, 1996. Section 202(y) of the Social Security Act further prohibits monthly benefits for aliens not lawfully present, effective from December 1, 1996. Noncitizens authorized to work in the United States, including immigrants and temporary workers, are eligible for Social Security Numbers (SSNs). SSNs issued to permanent residents are the same as those for U.S. citizens, while SSNs for temporary residents are marked \"VALID FOR WORK ONLY WITH DHS AUTHORIZATION.\" SSNs are also issued to noncitizens not authorized to work. Noncitizens not authorized to work in the United States can receive SSNs for state or federal benefits, marked \"NOT VALID FOR EMPLOYMENT.\" SSNs do not change if a noncitizen adjusts status, but some U.S. citizens may have cards with \"VALID FOR WORK ONLY WITH DHS AUTHORIZATION.\" Evidentiary requirements are needed to obtain an SSN. The SSA requires applicants to provide evidence of age, citizenship, and identity, including a document with name, identifying information, and a photograph. Noncitizens living outside the U.S. have different rules for federal income tax on Social Security benefits. U.S. citizens and resident aliens pay taxes on a portion of their benefits based on income thresholds. Noncitizens living outside the U.S. pay federal income tax on their Social Security benefits without income thresholds. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that 49% of beneficiaries were affected by income taxation in 2014. Noncitizens outside the U.S. have a 30% tax withholding on their U.S. income. Noncitizens residing outside the United States pay 30% federal income tax on their Social Security benefits. Totalization agreements allow alien workers and dependents to receive payments while living abroad. Totalization agreements enable individuals working abroad to contribute to both countries' Social Security systems, allowing for dual coverage and taxation based on the same earnings. Workers can combine earnings credits from both systems to qualify for benefits if needed, with benefits prorated based on the years paid into each system. Totalization agreements allow individuals working abroad to contribute to both countries' Social Security systems based on the number of years paid into each system. Congressional review is required for these agreements, with a resolution of disapproval needed within 60 session days to reject an agreement. Since 1978, the United States has entered into totalization agreements with 26 countries, with pending agreements with Mexico and Brazil. Implementation procedures are formulated by officials from SSA and foreign Social Security agencies after agreements are signed. The United States enters into totalization agreements with other countries, which are reviewed by the State Department and the President before being sent to Congress for a 60-day review period. The agreements must be consistent with the Social Security Act and may include additional provisions deemed appropriate by the President. In December 2015, $51 million in Social Security benefits was paid to 221,000 beneficiaries under totalization agreements. Some believe there is a disconnect between how Social Security and immigration rules treat unauthorized aliens. Immigration policies discourage and penalize foreign nationals working without authorization in the US. Despite this, under certain circumstances, unauthorized aliens can collect Social Security benefits based on taxes paid while working illegally. There is debate over whether unauthorized aliens should receive Social Security benefits, with some arguing against rewarding those who violate immigration laws. Foreign nationals working in Social Security-covered employment should be eligible for benefits regardless of their employment authorization status, as they have contributed to the system. In 1994, the SSA started sending \"no-match\" letters to employers to address discrepancies in W-2 forms and SSA records. A policy change in 2002 led to an increase in the number of no-match letters sent to employers, drawing attention due to its impact on unauthorized aliens. The SSA revised its policy in 2002, sending no-match letters to employers with discrepancies on W-2 forms. The number of letters increased significantly to approximately 950,000 for tax year 2001. Employers were not required to respond, but could face penalties for hiring unauthorized workers. Due to controversy, SSA quickly reverted to a previous policy. Some argued that SSA should not have reduced the number of no-match letters sent to employers, as they can help locate unauthorized alien workers and assist employers in identifying fraudulent documents. Others believe SSA should not enforce immigration laws and that no-match letters led to foreign nationals leaving their jobs. Some argue that no-match letters are ineffective in combating unlawful employment, as individuals using false documents simply find work elsewhere, increasing the risk of exploitation. Concerns were also raised about revenue loss due to worker shortages or terminated employees moving to competitors. Additionally, there were worries about discrimination based on alienage when employers receive a no-match letter for a noncitizen worker. Under the alien nonpayment provision, noncitizen's benefits are suspended if outside the US for more than six months, except for countries with social insurance or pension systems like Albania, Argentina, Australia, Austria, and others listed in Section 202(t)(2) of the Social Security Act. To receive benefits outside the United States, alien dependents and survivors must have lived in the United States previously for at least five years, and the family relationship to the worker must have existed during that time. Exceptions to the residency requirement are provided for certain countries with social insurance or pension systems. Several exceptions to the five-year U.S. residency requirement for alien dependents and survivors exist, including being a citizen of a treaty obligation country like Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands. Totalization Agreement countries also have exemptions. Totalization Agreement countries exempt certain aliens from the five-year U.S. residency requirement. Lawfully present aliens for Social Security benefits include qualified aliens, those admitted to the U.S. without violating status, and those paroled for less than one year. Aliens exempt from the five-year U.S. residency requirement include those paroled for less than one year, except for specific cases. Aliens permitted to remain in the U.S. for humanitarian or public policy reasons include those in temporary resident status, under Temporary Protected Status, Cuban-Haitian entrants, Family Unity beneficiaries, under Deferred Enforced Departure, or in deferred action status. Applicants for asylum, withholding of removal, and those granted employment authorization under specific conditions are considered lawfully present. Being lawfully present is not solely based on the Service's decision regarding deportation orders."
