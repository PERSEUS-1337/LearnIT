    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act\". It includes findings related to food allergen labeling. Congress finds that approximately 2 percent of adults and 5 percent of infants and young children in the United States suffer from food allergies. Each year, 30,000 individuals require emergency room treatment and 150 individuals die due to allergic reactions to food. Eight major foods account for 90 percent of food allergies, with no current cure available. Allergic consumers must avoid the specific food they are allergic to. In 1999, the FDA found that 25% of sampled foods in Minnesota and Wisconsin failed to list peanuts or eggs as ingredients. Nationally, recalls due to unlabeled allergens increased to 121 in 2000 from about 35 a decade earlier. A recent study showed that many parents of children with food allergies struggled to identify allergens on food labels. FDA regulations require ingredients to be listed by their common or usual name, which may be unfamiliar to consumers. Celiac disease is an immune-mediated condition that damages the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, and other organs. The recommended treatment is to avoid foods containing gluten, which are associated with the disease. A study estimated that celiac disease affects 0.5 to 1 percent of the US population. SEC. 3. FOOD LABELING; REQUIREMENT OF INFORMATION REGARDING ALLERGENIC SUBSTANCES. Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include requirements for labeling major food allergens in non-agricultural commodities. The allergen must be clearly identified in the list of ingredients, either by using the term \"Contains\" followed by the food source or by listing the allergen's common name with the food source in parentheses. The labeling of major food allergens in non-agricultural commodities is required under section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The allergen must be clearly identified in the ingredient list, either by using the term \"Contains\" followed by the food source or by listing the allergen's common name with the food source in parentheses. All major food allergens must be labeled consistently as specified in the regulations. The information may appear in labeling other than the label if deemed sufficient by the Secretary to protect public health. The Secretary can modify labeling requirements for major food allergens if necessary for public health protection. The disclosure of food allergens, excluding major allergens, must be done as specified by the Secretary. This does not affect the Secretary's authority to label other food allergens. The term 'major food allergen' includes milk, egg, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans, along with proteinaceous substances derived from these foods. Effective January 1, 2006, food containing major allergens must be labeled to comply with regulations to prevent allergic responses in humans. SEC. 4. REPORT ON FOOD ALLERGENS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report by June 30, 2004, analyzing unintentional contamination of major food allergens in manufacturing and processing, including cross-contamination on shared production lines and dedicated production lines. The report analyzes unintentional contamination of major food allergens in manufacturing, recommends methods to reduce cross-contact, describes advisory labeling practices, and determines consumer awareness of food allergens. The report analyzes unintentional contamination of major food allergens in manufacturing, recommends methods to reduce cross-contact, describes advisory labeling practices, and determines consumer awareness of food allergens. It also determines consumer preferences for communicating the risk of cross-contact on food labels and identifies appropriate circumstances for advisory labeling. SEC. 5. INSPECTIONS RELATING TO FOOD ALLERGENS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services prioritizes increasing inspections of food facilities to ensure compliance with practices to reduce cross-contact of major food allergens and proper labeling. A biennial report is submitted to Congress detailing the number of inspections conducted and facilities inspected. The biennial report to Congress includes information on compliance of facilities and food labels, violations found, voluntary recalls for undeclared major food allergens, use of advisory language, and addressing cross-contact issues. SEC. 6. LABELING OF GLUTENS AND CELIAC DISEASE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will contract the Institute of Medicine to conduct a review on glutens associated with celiac disease, prevention and treatment methods, and gluten detection in foods. The Institute of Medicine must submit a report to the Secretary and relevant committees within 2 years. The Institute of Medicine will conduct a review with experts in celiac disease to define and permit the use of the term \"gluten-free\" on food labels within 4-6 years of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary will submit a report to assess if additional requirements for gluten labeling are necessary to better inform individuals with celiac disease. SEC. 7. DATA ON FOOD-RELATED ALLERGIC RESPONSES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study within a year to determine if current systems accurately capture data on food allergies, adverse events, and treatment methods. This study will involve consultation with various stakeholders. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study to improve data collection and analysis on the prevalence of food allergies, adverse events, and treatment methods. This will involve educating healthcare providers and publishing national data. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on the prevalence of food allergies, adverse events, and treatment methods. A report will be submitted to Congress on the progress made, and appropriations are authorized for this purpose. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will convene a panel of experts to review and develop a plan for research on food allergies. A report will be submitted to Congress within a year. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will revise the Food Code to provide guidelines for preparing allergen-free foods in various food establishments. Additionally, recommendations will be made regarding responding to food-related allergic responses. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide technical assistance on different modes of treatment and prevention of food-related allergic responses to State and local agencies."
