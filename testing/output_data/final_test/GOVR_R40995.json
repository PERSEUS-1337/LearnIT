    "content": "The USDA announced a 200,000 short ton increase in the FY2010 raw sugar import quota due to the need for additional supplies in the U.S. market. Sugar producers welcomed the decision, while manufacturers of sugar-containing food products urged USDA to raise the quota quickly to avoid a sugar shortage later in the year. The USTR also reallocated shares of the FY2010 raw sugar TRQ to increase imported sugar supplied to U.S. cane refiners by over 90,000 short tons. The USDA increased the FY2010 raw sugar import quota by 200,000 short tons to address the need for additional supplies in the U.S. market. The USTR also reallocated shares of the quota to supply over 90,000 short tons of imported sugar to U.S. cane refiners. Various countries will benefit from this increase in sugar imports to protect their domestic industries from fluctuating world market prices. The close link between sugar production and processing machinery makes price stability crucial for industry survival. The United States has a history of supporting its sugar industry through various Sugar Acts. The Sugar Acts of 1934, 1937, and 1948 regulated domestic sugar consumption and assigned quotas to U.S. growers and foreign countries. Mandatory price support for sugar was reinstated in 1981 and continued through various farm bills until 2012. The sugar program in the United States has evolved over the years, with domestic sugar production increasing and foreign suppliers losing market share. Current law authorizes the sugar program through 2012, aiming to protect domestic sugar producers and maintain prices above the world market price. Despite price protection, the U.S. remains a net sugar importer due to insufficient domestic production. The U.S. sugar program aims to protect domestic sugar producers and maintain prices above the world market price, leading to higher costs for U.S. consumers and manufacturers. Studies show that U.S. sugar users pay between $400 million and $1.9 billion more annually due to the price differential. The sugar program in the U.S. differs from other agricultural programs as it does not involve direct payments to beet and cane growers. This structure is seen as a positive by supporters, but critics argue that the program indirectly subsidizes the production sector through higher prices for sugar. U.S. sugar policy uses loan rates to ensure domestic growers and processors receive a minimum price for their sugar. The U.S. sugar program uses statutorily set loan rates to guarantee support for raw cane and refined beet sugar. Marketing allotments and import quotas also regulate domestic sugar production and foreign sugar imports to balance supply and demand. The program operates on a \"no-cost\" basis and is administered by the Farm Service Agency. The U.S. sugar program, administered by the Farm Service Agency, provides \"non-recourse\" price support loans to processors of sugarcane and sugar beets. These loans are available to processors who agree to pay growers at USDA-set minimum payment levels. The 2008 farm bill increases sugar loan rates by 4% to 5% through FY2012. The 2008 farm bill increases sugar loan rates by 4% to 5% in stages through FY2012. For the 2009 sugarcane and sugar beet crops, the national average loan rate is 18.25\u00a2/lb. for raw cane sugar and 23.45\u00a2/lb. for refined beet sugar. The rate for beet sugar is higher than for raw sugar due to immediate availability in white refined form. USDA adjusts loan rates regionally to reflect marketing costs. Sugar loan rates do not guarantee a price floor for domestically produced sugar. In practice, USDA aims to support raw cane and refined beet sugar at higher price levels that consider processor costs. In FY2009, effective support levels for raw cane sugar ranged from 19.81\u00a2/lb. to 20.6\u00a2/lb. in different states, while refined beet sugar support ranged from 23\u00a2/lb. to 26\u00a2/lb. for six beet-producing regions. These levels include regional loan rates, marketing costs, interest on price support loans, and location discounts. In FY2010, USDA limits sugar marketing through marketing allotments and import quotas to prevent prices from falling below support levels. Loan forfeiture occurs if market prices are below the \"effective\" sugar support level, representing the minimum program benefits for growers and processors. Market prices have remained stable in FY2009 and FY2010 under the sugar program authorized by the 2008 farm bill. In FY2010, sugar prices have remained above loan forfeiture levels, with raw cane sugar futures prices rising in April 2009 and refined beet sugar prices increasing in August 2009. The domestic production sector accepted mandatory limits on sugar sales in the 2002 farm bill for price protection. Sugar producers and processors secured a significant change in the 2008 farm bill to guarantee a minimum 85% market share for the domestic sector by setting an \"overall allotment quantity\" each year. This provision aims to prevent imports from displacing the ability of U.S. sugar processors to sell more. The 2008 farm bill ensured a minimum 85% market share for domestic sugar producers by setting an \"overall allotment quantity\" each year. This change removed USDA's discretionary authority in determining the amount of domestic sugar allowed to be marketed. Sugar processors and food manufacturers influenced USDA's decision on defining \"reasonable\" ending stocks, with processors favoring a smaller OAQ for higher prices and manufacturers advocating for a larger OAQ for lower prices. The 2008 farm bill split the overall allotment quantity (OAQ) between beet and cane sectors, with specific rules on allocation to processing firms. Excess sugar must be held off the market as \"blocked stocks.\" USDA's discretionary authority now focuses on import quotas, with interest groups influencing decisions. For FY2009 and FY2010, USDA set the final OAQ at 9.235 million short tons (ST) of sugar, with a shortfall of 1.0 million ST assigned to imports of raw cane sugar. The imported sugar from Mexico helped cover this shortfall. In FY2010, USDA set the initial OAQ at 9.235 million ST, with domestic processors expected to produce 13% below the announced OAQ. In FY2010, USDA projected domestic processors to produce 13% below the announced OAQ. Due to a shortfall in raw cane sugar output, 200,000 ST was reassigned to imports. No beet sugar allotment will be reassigned to imports at this time. Imports cover the balance of sugar demand that domestic production cannot supply. In FY2010, imports are projected to cover about 21% of U.S. food use. USDA restricts foreign sugar quantity to prevent market price depression and ensure no-cost requirement is met. Quota amounts are determined by U.S. market access commitments under WTO rules and FTAs. The U.S. market access commitment under WTO rules requires a minimum of 1.256 million ST of foreign sugar to enter annually. The Secretary of Agriculture can allow additional sugar imports if domestic supplies are insufficient. The USTR allocates raw cane sugar TRQ among 40 countries, while refined sugar TRQ is first allocated to Canada and Mexico. The 2008 farm bill mandates USDA to set WTO sugar TRQ commitments at minimum levels at the start of the quota year. The 2008 Farm Bill mandates USDA to set WTO sugar TRQ commitments at minimum levels at the start of the quota year. Mexico no longer faces any tariff or quantitative limit on sugar exports to the U.S. market, leading to fluctuating imports in response to price differences between the two countries. In 2010, additional sugar imports are allowed from countries under bilateral FTAs, such as the Dominican Republic-Central American FTA. These countries can ship up to 121,000 ST of sugar to the U.S. market, with quotas increasing annually. Under all trade agreements, sugar imports to the U.S. are subject to quotas and tariffs to limit foreign competition. The policy debate revolves around maintaining or increasing import quotas to affect market prices. The USDA must decide how to implement available authorities to address sugar supply and prices. The United States is the fifth-largest user of sugar for food in the world, with total sugar use increasing in recent years due to population growth and consumer preferences shifting towards diet drinks and bottled waters. Sugar consumption accounted for 41% of total U.S. sweetener consumption in 2008, up from 38% in 1999. In 2008, sugar consumption in the United States accounted for 41% of total sweetener consumption, up from 38% in 1999. HFCS and other corn sweeteners' share of domestic sweetener use was at 40.5%, down from 46% a decade earlier. Analysts are divided on the FY2010 outlook for U.S. sugar food use, which could impact USDA policy decisions on imports. For FY2010, USDA projected a decrease in sugar food use by almost 340,000 ST (-3.25%) to 10.14 million ST. In FY2010, USDA projected lower refined sugar imports from Mexico for direct consumption compared to FY2009, with HFCS deliveries expected to increase to recapture market share lost to sugar in the previous two years. USDA also acknowledged uncertainty about the extent of HFCS use increase. In fall 2009, there was uncertainty about the potential increase in HFCS use in FY2010 at the expense of sugar. Consumer preferences may not change enough to accept HFCS in products that had already switched to sugar. USDA noted that HFCS use will depend on corn refiners aggressively marketing their product to regain market share lost to sugar. USDA admitted that its FY2010 sugar use projection may be conservative. Other analyses project higher food use in FY2010, with one estimating a nearly 100,000 ST increase in sugar deliveries for food consumption compared to FY2009. USDA raised its FY2010 sugar use estimate to 10.3 million ST, projecting FY2011 use at the same level. Calls for additional imports were made due to concerns about domestic sugar shortages. Ending stocks correlate closely with refined sugar prices towards the end of a marketing year. During FY2010, USDA raised its sugar use estimate to 10.3 million ST for FY2011. Concerns about domestic sugar shortages led to calls for additional imports to prevent price spikes. U.S. sugar stocks reached their lowest level in September, with the sugar beet harvest beginning in key producing regions. Ending stocks for FY2009 were estimated at 1.5 million ST, higher than the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in FY2005. Sugarcane processing in Florida and Louisiana further increased the available sugar supply. In FY2010, USDA projects sugar stocks at the end of next year at 844,000 ST, with concerns about domestic sugar shortages leading to calls for additional imports to prevent price spikes. The \"stocks-to-use ratio\" is viewed as an indicator of future sugar prices by market participants. The ending stocks-to-use ratio is seen as a reliable indicator of future sugar prices. A higher ratio suggests lower prices, while a lower ratio indicates higher prices. USDA aims to maintain ending stocks at a level that prevents sugar loan collateral forfeitures. Observers noted that a ratio of around 15% was effective. Over six years, ending stock-to-use ratios ranged from 12.6% to 18.7%, averaging 16.1% annually. In FY2009, USDA aimed for a 13.9% ending stocks-to-use ratio due to lower beet production and other factors. For FY2010, USDA projected a 13.5% ratio to meet objectives including increased reliance on sugar imports from Mexico. In FY2010, USDA projects a tight domestic sugar supply with an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 11.6%, the lowest since 1974/1975. Concerns arise about sugar scarcity in the July-September 2010 period, leading to some beet sugar processors withdrawing from the market. This tight supply outlook has caused prices of raw cane sugar and refined sugar to rise from mid-2009 through early 2010. The U.S. did not increase sugar import TRQ before September 30, leading to a 74% rise in raw cane sugar futures prices from July 2009 to February 2010. Prices have since fallen back to average 31.0\u00a2/lb in April 2010. The 10-year average futures price for raw cane sugar was 21.0\u00a2/lb. During the second half of 2009 and early 2010, global sugar prices soared due to reduced supplies from India and Brazil. The world raw cane sugar price climbed above 30.0\u00a2/lb, leading to a premium for U.S. cane refiners to secure foreign sugar imports. The U.S. raw cane sugar futures price rose in late fall 2009 and early winter 2010 as the world futures price increased. U.S. cane refiners had to pay higher prices to attract foreign exporters. This led to a rise in wholesale refined sugar prices in the U.S. until reports of improved sugar production in Brazil and India caused a drop in world raw sugar prices in early 2010. The decline in raw sugar futures prices in May 2010, below 15\u00a2/lb., was influenced by a drop in the U.S. raw sugar futures price. The world sugar price falling below the U.S. effective raw sugar support level will no longer impact U.S. raw sugar futures prices. The U.S. wholesale refined sugar price also saw fluctuations during this period. The quoted price of refined sugar increased by 50% but has since retreated, averaging 49.0\u00a2/lb. in April. Spot refined sugar prices rose significantly in September 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, reaching 40\u00a2/lb. The 10-year average wholesale price for refined beet sugar was 27.3\u00a2/lb. One-quarter of sugar in the US is purchased at retail by households, while the rest is used by food and beverage manufacturing firms at the wholesale price. Since late 2009, the retail price of refined sugar has lagged behind changes in the wholesale price, averaging 56.0\u00a2/lb. in FY2009 compared to the 10-year average of 46.5\u00a2/lb. Price increases in wholesale refined sugar may impact consumer prices for sugar-containing products, but declines in other agricultural commodity prices have offset some of these costs for food manufacturers. The retail price of refined sugar has increased since late 2009, averaging 56.0\u00a2/lb. in FY2009, compared to the 10-year average of 46.5\u00a2/lb. This rise in price has been reflected in the highest per-pound price of 63.6\u00a2 in March 2010, the highest since December 1974. Sellers and buyers negotiate contracts for future delivery of refined sugar, taking into account projections of future U.S. sugar supply. Before agreeing on price, both sides consider future U.S. sugar supply and demand, USDA decisions on import quotas, raw cane sugar prices in the futures market, existing commercial relationships, and market intelligence on refined sugar from Mexico. Sugar processors aim to sell as much permitted under their marketing allotment at the highest price, while users seek guaranteed deliveries at the lowest price. Pricing is negotiated based on these factors. The pricing agreed upon between sugar processors and industrial sugar users for near-term sales of refined beet sugar serves as a proxy for future refined sugar prices. Prices range from 45\u00a2/lb. to 49\u00a2/lb. for FY2010, with longer-term offers at 38\u00a2/lb. to 40\u00a2/lb. for 2011, 36\u00a2/lb. to 38\u00a2/lb. for 2012, and 34\u00a2/lb. to 36\u00a2/lb. for some of 2013. Multi-year contracts were signed at these prices in April, reflecting a shift from corn sweeteners to sugar by food manufacturers. Sugar users are pushing for increased sugar imports to replenish supplies. Sugar processors argue that the domestic market is adequately supplied after the 2009 crop harvest. The debate revolves around the price levels and future trends of U.S. raw cane futures prices. Market participants are closely monitoring these prices to predict future wholesale refined beet sugar price levels. The current debate revolves around the price of sugar, with sugar processors and food/beverage firms seeking different price levels. Members of Congress have expressed support for both sides. U.S. sweetener trade with Mexico is closely monitored for its impact on sugar supplies and prices. Sugar processors advocate for increased coordination between U.S. and Mexican governments on sugar policies. USDA faces uncertainty in projecting Mexican sugar imports, affecting how it manages U.S. sugar policy. A new provision gives USDA authority in administering sugar TRQs to meet U.S. WTO trade commitments. The USDA has the authority to set sugar TRQs at minimum WTO levels at the beginning of each marketing year. In case of a sugar shortage, steps can be taken to increase imports, such as raising the raw cane sugar TRQ. If there is still a shortage, the sale of domestic sugar must be maximized before further actions are taken. The USDA can increase refined sugar TRQ if there is a sugar shortage and domestic sugar sales are maximized. If the shortage persists in the second half of the marketing year, only raw cane sugar TRQ can be increased. Any import increase must not threaten domestic sugar prices. USDA did not define key terms or circumstances for implementing this policy change. The 2008 farm bill's TRQ directive limits refined sugar entry to emergency situations, ensuring raw cane sugar predominance. This provision addresses uncertainty in sugar imports from Mexico under NAFTA and supports cane refineries during shortages. The USDA set FY2010 sugar import quotas at minimum WTO levels to address a potential sugar shortage. Uncertainty around Mexican sugar exports to the U.S. market is a significant factor. USDA has raised its supply projection for the year due to lower beet sugar output caused by harvesting issues. The USDA projects low ending stocks for beet sugar due to harvesting problems and lower sugar content, but this is expected to be offset by increased raw cane sugar output in Louisiana and additional imports under the sugar TRQ increase. Negotiations between sugar processors and industrial users are influenced by USDA's decision on the sugar TRQ increase. Some sellers raised price offers or contracted sales at higher prices for refined sugar due to USDA's delayed decision. Buyers were hesitant to contract long-term. The impact of potential TRQ increase on supply and prices will depend on the size of the increase and projected ending stocks. USDA aims for a 13.5% to 14.5% stocks-to-use ratio. Applying ratios for additional sugar imports of 200,000 to 300,000 ST may be necessary to meet USDA stocks-to-use ratios. Sugar users have requested increased import quotas to prevent a shortage in domestic supply. The impact on prices would depend on the amount of imports and how quickly they enter the market. The Sweetener Users Association urged quick action to prevent a potential sugar supply shortage, citing low ending-stock levels for FY2009 and FY2010. They called on the USDA to increase raw and refined sugar import quotas to avoid market disruptions, emphasizing the lead time needed for sugar processing. The Sweetener Users Association urged the USDA to increase sugar import quotas due to low ending-stock levels, citing market disruptions if action is not taken promptly. They argued that current market conditions warrant a 1.0 to 1.2 million ST increase in raw and refined sugar TRQs. The Sweetener Users Association urged USDA to increase sugar import quotas by 1.0 to 1.2 million ST due to low ending-stock levels, warning of market disruptions if action is delayed. Food manufacturers welcomed USDA's announcement of a 200,000 ST increase in this year's raw cane sugar import quota and are pushing for further increases to avoid a sugar shortage. SUA's chairman recommended an immediate increase of up to 800,000 ST in raw and refined sugar TRQs to boost stocks for FY2010 and the following year. The American Sugar Alliance (ASA) argued that current strong refined sugar prices indicate tight supplies and strong demand. They praised USDA's decision to set sugar import quotas at minimum levels, ensuring decisions are made with the best market information available. ASA noted USDA's projection of a sugar surplus for the crop year and emphasized the importance of certainty in supply and demand outlook. The American Sugar Alliance (ASA) praised USDA's decision to set sugar import quotas at minimum levels, ensuring decisions are made with the best market information available. ASA acknowledged that adherence to this directive contributed to strong prices for beet and cane refiners. They stated that the Farm Bill is operating as intended and gives USDA the time and tools needed to ensure adequate supplies. The fluctuating sugar imports from Mexico since 2008 have created uncertainty for USDA's sugar program. Mexico's share of U.S. sugar imports varied widely, impacting market prices. USDA's import projections from Mexico have changed significantly, leading to challenges in managing market conditions. USDA import projections for sugar from Mexico have fluctuated, ranging from 165,000 to 760,000 ST before settling at 540,000 ST. Record sugar imports in FY2009 were driven by Mexican mills needing cash and taking advantage of higher U.S. prices. For FY2010, USDA projects 540,000 ST in sugar imports from Mexico, representing 28% of total U.S. sugar imports for food use. The expected lower import level of sugar from Mexico for food use in the U.S. is due to a significant drawdown in Mexican sugar stocks and a potential decrease in sugar output. Mexico's government announced imports of almost 300,000 ST to rebuild low inventories and dampen prices, but USDA projects Mexican stocks at the end of FY2010 will still be about half of recent historical experience. Factors like price gaps between Mexican and U.S. refined sugar introduce uncertainty into USDA's projections for sugar imports from Mexico. The price gap between Mexican and U.S. refined sugar influences sugar imports from Mexico. Mexican mills may ship sugar to the U.S. if prices are higher there, or maintain trading relationships by exporting sugar. Additionally, U.S. exports of high-fructose corn syrup to Mexico could replace Mexican-produced sugar in the soft-drink manufacturing sector. In the early 1980s, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) largely replaced sugar in the U.S. soft drink sector due to cost savings. Mexico's rising sugar prices led to a surge in HFCS demand, with imports from the U.S. meeting much of this need. Mexican sugar surplus may move to the U.S. if prices are higher there. The Mexican government could take measures to rebuild sugar stocks, potentially impacting U.S. sugar imports. Mexico's increased sugar exports to the U.S. market in 2009 led to a decrease in Mexican sugar stocks, prompting the Mexican government to increase imports to prevent shortages and lower prices. U.S. policymakers are concerned about this practice, which they believe creates difficulties in managing sugar policy and affects projections of U.S. sugar supply and prices. Some Members of Congress are calling for this issue to be addressed. The Mexican government announced temporary sugar import quotas to address low stock levels, allowing for the entry of 550,000 metric tons by year-end 2009. A \"loophole\" in recent FTAs limits preferential access to the U.S. market based on each country's net sugar trade surplus. In response to low stock levels, the Mexican government implemented temporary sugar import quotas, allowing for the entry of 550,000 metric tons by the end of 2009. A \"loophole\" in recent FTAs restricts preferential access to the U.S. market based on each country's net sugar trade surplus. Efforts were made to address this issue by presenting a framework for coordinating sugar policies between the U.S. and Mexico. Recommendations included cooperating to address sugar shortages in the combined markets and modifying sugar re-export programs. The recommendations call for the U.S. and Mexico to coordinate sugar policies, establish a joint sugar commission, consult regularly on sugar markets, and improve data collection. U.S. sugar producers believe these actions can be implemented without changes to NAFTA or legislation. The proposal to coordinate sugar policies between the U.S. and Mexico does not require changes to NAFTA or legislation. U.S. sugar users argue that this would interfere with Mexico's right to meet its needs with unlimited imports. The Mexican government is drafting a response to the industry proposal. The USDA will review and present the sugar TRQ allocation to 40 countries based on historical shipments. The quota shortfall of foreign raw sugar has increased in recent years, with FY2009 shortfall at 17.8% of the announced TRQ. The Sweetener Users Association (SUA) has proposed measures to reduce the impact of sugar TRQ shortfalls, suggesting tradable certificates of quota eligibility (CQEs) and carrying over one year's quota shortfall to the next year. Trading would be limited to prevent price manipulation. The Sweetener Users Association (SUA) has proposed measures to reduce sugar TRQ shortfalls, including tradable certificates of quota eligibility (CQEs) and carrying over one year's quota shortfall to the next year. CQEs would be tradable at the end of the fiscal year, quota holders could sell their share to other countries, and refined sugar could enter under the raw sugar TRQ when the price difference is unusually high. The International Sugar Trade Coalition opposes proposals to change the way sugar quotas are administered, suggesting that raising the global raw sugar TRQ is a better solution to address U.S. sugar shortages. They warn that altering quota reallocation methods could lead to a WTO challenge from excluded quota holders. The USTR last reallocated quota shortfalls in March 2010, distributing 90,000 short tons to 25 countries identified by the USDA as capable of increasing sugar shipments to the U.S. market."
