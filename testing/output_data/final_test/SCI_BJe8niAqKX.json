The proposed approach leverages visual knowledge for sentence representations by transferring the structure of a visual representation space to the textual space using cluster and perceptual information. The joint approach encourages beneficial interactions between textual, perceptual, and cluster information during training. The quality of the learned representations is demonstrated on semantic relatedness, classification, and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Semantics in Artificial Intelligence is a significant issue. Distributional Semantic Models like BID36 and BID41 use the distributional hypothesis on text corpora to learn word embeddings. High-quality sentence representations are crucial for models encoding sentences into semantic vectors for tasks like machine translation and question answering. Sentences convey complex knowledge better than individual words. Relying solely on text can lead to biased representations and unrealistic predictions. Human language understanding is grounded in physical reality and perception. One emerging approach in AI is visual grounding of language, leveraging visual information to enhance word representations. Two methods have shown improvements: sequential technique combines textual and visual representations, while joint method learns a common multimodal representation. Visual grounding of sentences is a new challenge in research. The visual grounding of sentences is a new challenge in research. A sequential model proposed by BID26 combines linguistic and grounded vectors separately, hindering interactions between textual and visual modalities. We propose a joint model to learn multimodal sentence representations, where the meaning is grounded in both textual and visual contexts. Textual context is adjacent sentences in a corpus, while visual context is from paired videos and captions. Videos are preferred over images for their temporal aspect. The key challenge in visual grounding of sentences is capturing visual information by preserving overall structure and similarities between related elements across spaces. This involves utilizing cluster information and perceptual information from videos using a pre-trained CNN. The text discusses the use of cluster and perceptual information from videos to improve sentence representations. Three research questions are formulated regarding the effectiveness of this approach. The contribution includes a joint multimodal framework for learning grounded sentence representations, showing the complementarity of cluster and perceptual information, and achieving state-of-the-art performances in multimodal sentence representations. The text introduces a multimodal approach for sentence representations, combining textual and visual contexts. The sentence encoder is learned by optimizing objectives on a text corpus and a video corpus, leading to improved results in multimodal representations. In this paper, the focus is on using SkipThought for sentence encoding and improving over FastSent. The approach proposes a new way to structure the textual space with the help of the visual modality, suggesting that projections between spaces may not be the best approach for incorporating visual semantics. The paper focuses on using SkipThought for sentence encoding and improving over FastSent by leveraging cluster information from visually equivalent sentences to improve the structure of the textual space. The hypothesis is that representations of visually equivalent sentences should be close, while representations of visually different sentences should be separated. The paper utilizes SkipThought for sentence encoding and enhances FastSent by incorporating cluster information from visually equivalent sentences to refine the textual space structure. The hypothesis is that visually equivalent sentences should have close representations, while visually different sentences should be separated. The cluster hypothesis translates into a constraint using cosine similarities to determine visual equivalence. A max-margin ranking loss is employed to ensure a gap between visually equivalent and different sentences. The paper proposes a novel approach to consider the structure of the visual space and use video content to assess the similarity between sentences. It suggests that the similarity between sentences in the textual space should correlate with the similarity between their corresponding videos in the visual space. This approach aims to extract visual semantics without the need for cross-modal projections. The paper proposes a novel approach to assess the similarity between sentences by correlating it with the similarity between their corresponding videos in the visual space. The multimodal loss function is a combination of different objectives weighted by hyperparameters. Visual features are extracted using a pretrained CNN, and different ways to represent a video are discussed. The paper introduces a method to measure sentence similarity by comparing it with the similarity of corresponding videos. Different visual representations of videos are discussed, including setting amounts at keeping the first frame and ignoring the rest of the sequence. An attention mechanism is used to focus on important frames for sentence understanding. The evaluation protocol includes using the Toronto BookCorpus dataset for textual data and the MSVD dataset for visual data. The MSVD dataset BID7 is used as the visual corpus for video captioning, consisting of 1970 videos and 80K English descriptions. Different variants of a multimodal model are tested, depending on initialization and visual representation. Two extensions of multimodal word embedding models to sentences are proposed. Two extensions of multimodal word embedding models to sentences are proposed: Projection (P) baseline projects videos in the textual space, while our model keeps both spaces separated. The visual loss is a ranking objective with trainable projection matrix W and fixed margin m. Sequential (SEQ) baseline learns a linear regression model to predict visual representation from SkipThought representations, resulting in a multimodal sentence embedding. Multiple benchmarks are used to evaluate the quality of learned multimodal representations. The quality of learned multimodal representations is evaluated using semantic relatedness benchmarks (STS BID6 and SICK BID35) and classification benchmarks (MSRP BID11, MPQA BID50, MR BID39, SUBJ). Correlations are measured between learned sentence embeddings and human-labeled scores. Hyperparameters are tuned on SICK/trial with results reported on SICK/train+test. For each dataset, logistic regression classifiers are trained on sentence embeddings for movie review sentiment, subjectivity/objectivity classification, question-type classification, and customer product reviews. Cross-modal retrieval on COCO involves optimizing a pairwise triplet-loss to align sentences and images in a multimodal latent space. Evaluation includes Recall@K and measures like \u03c1 vis, E intra, and E inter on the MSVD test set to assess the quality of the textual space. The text discusses the optimization of a multimodal loss function using a pretrained VGG network and Adam optimizer. Hyperparameters are tuned using the Pearson correlation measure, and experiments are conducted with a SkipThought model. The perceptual hypothesis is applied to ground sentence representations in videos through a perceptual loss function. The text discusses the use of a perceptual loss function to improve representations in videos, showing that incorporating perceptual information from videos enhances semantic relatedness. Random visual anchors and multiple frames in video encoding also contribute to better representation structures. In video encoding, using multiple frames can improve sentence representations. Selecting relevant frames over all frames enhances embedding quality. Despite low discrepancies between modeling choices, selecting the right video model is crucial for effectiveness and efficiency. The influence of perceptual and cluster information on representations is studied. In video encoding, selecting relevant frames improves sentence representations. The influence of perceptual and cluster information on the embedding space structure is studied. Cluster information leads to efficient separation of visually different sentences, while perceptual information correlates textual and visual spaces but does not preserve local neighborhood structure well. Combining both cluster and perceptual information optimizes for well-separated clusters and capturing perceptual information within the representation space. The effectiveness of sentence embeddings from multimodal models is compared to text-only baselines on semantic relatedness and classification tasks. Multimodal models outperform text-only baselines, with discrepancies in benchmarks containing highly visual content. A trade-off between semantic relatedness and classification scores can be adjusted by tuning a parameter \u03b1 T. The effectiveness of multimodal models in capturing visual meaning is highlighted through a comparison with text-only baselines. Tuning the parameter \u03b1 T allows for adjusting the trade-off between semantic relatedness and classification scores. The multimodal model demonstrates superior accuracy in transferring concrete visual knowledge to abstract sentences, even for non-visual content. The multimodal model shows superior accuracy in transferring visual knowledge to abstract sentences, even for non-visual content. The observation that perceptual information propagates from concrete sentences to abstract ones is highlighted. Our model M outperforms the projection baseline P on semantic relatedness tasks and shows comparable results on classification tasks. It achieves a 5%/3% average relative improvement over P on semantic relatedness tasks, indicating that preserving the visual space structure is more effective than learning cross-modal projections. Additionally, our model also surpasses a sequential state-of-the-art model BID26. Our study compares joint and sequential approaches in multimodal models, showing that joint models outperform sequential baselines on classification and semantic relatedness tasks. The discrepancy between the best multimodal model and text-only baseline is higher on various benchmarks. Models trained from scratch perform slightly better than pretrained ones, possibly due to better integration of visual and textual information from the beginning of training. Our study evaluates the quality of embeddings through cross-modal retrieval experiments on the COCO dataset. Results from our best models confirm the effectiveness of our visual grounding strategy with different textual encoders. Various approaches have been proposed for building sentence representations, including supervised techniques for task-specific embeddings. Supervised techniques produce task-specific sentence embeddings using different neural network architectures, while unsupervised methods aim for more general sentence representations. SkipThought and FastSent are examples of unsupervised methods that use the distributional hypothesis to encode sentences. The present paper extends these works by integrating visual information. The paper extends previous works by integrating visual information to ground language in the real world and address biases between text and reality. Leveraging visual resources alongside textual resources is seen as a promising approach to acquire common-sense knowledge and improve semantic models. Multimodal Distributional Semantic Models integrate visual information to improve semantic models by combining textual and visual representations. This approach aims to transfer visual information from concrete words to more abstract words without visual data. The Multimodal Skip-Gram model optimizes the Word2vec objective jointly with a max-margin ranking objective to align concrete word vectors with their corresponding visual features. Our model aims to learn sentence representations by integrating context and visual features, unlike previous models focused on word understanding. Unlike a recent sequential approach, we use a joint method and leverage cluster and perceptual information. In this paper, a joint multimodal model is proposed to learn sentence representations using cluster and perceptual information from videos. The findings suggest that both types of information are beneficial, preserving the visual space structure outperforms projection strategies, and a joint approach is more effective than a sequential one for multimodal representation learning. Future work will explore the temporal knowledge contribution from videos for sentence grounding."
