    "content": "In some environments, only a small number of states result in high rewards, making most interactions with the environment less informative for learning. Therefore, it may be beneficial to focus training on these high-reward states and the likely paths to reach them. The use of a backtracking model predicts preceding states leading to high-reward states. Traces of (state, action) pairs, called Recall Traces, are sampled to improve policy efficiency in RL algorithms. This method enhances sample efficiency in various environments and tasks. Model-based methods in reinforcement learning aim to improve sample efficiency by learning an unsupervised model of the environment's dynamics. This model allows algorithms to simulate future events and make better value estimates without extensive interactions with the environment. In this work, a method is proposed to increase the sample efficiency of model-free RL algorithms by leveraging unsupervised observations of state-to-state transitions. The idea involves using a backward approach in finding paths between states, particularly beneficial when rewards are sparse and high-value states are rare. Proposing a backtracking model to learn backward dynamics from agent experiences, allowing for alternative paths to high-value states. This method aims to increase sample efficiency in model-free RL algorithms by leveraging unsupervised state-to-state transitions. The paper proposes an RL method using a backtracking model to learn alternative paths to high-value states, enhancing learning efficiency in sparse reward environments. The paper introduces an RL method using a backtracking model to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning. It focuses on a Markov decision process (MDP) with state and action spaces, transition probabilities, rewards, and discount factor. The proposed approach shows better sample efficiency in experiments on various RL environments. The text introduces a backtracking model to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning by maximizing the discounted total return R(\u03c0). It refers to experienced trajectories as \u03c4 = (s 1 , a 1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s T , a T ) and simulated experiences as traces\u03c4. The backtracking model B \u03c6 = q \u03c6 (s t , a t |s t+1 ) is a density estimator of the joint probability distribution over the previous (s t , a t )-tuple. It consists of a learned backward policy \u03c0 b = q(a t |s t+1 ) and a state generator q(s t |a t , s t+1 ) to predict previous actions and estimate previous states. The backtracking model B \u03c6 is learned by maximum likelihood, using the policy's trajectories. Generating recall traces involves sampling actions and state changes auto-regressively from the density models q \u03c6 (\u2206 t , a t |s t+1 ). Before recursively sampling from the backtracking model B \u03c6, presumed high-value states are obtained by filtering trajectories based on returns and selecting top k traj for the replay buffer B. Two methods are explored for generating initial high-value states, one of which involves picking the most valuable states from the replay buffer based on estimated expected return V \u03c0 (s). The backtracking model is trained to find plausible trajectories that end at high-value states, using Goal GAN to produce goal states and mapping them to valid points in state space. This model improves the efficiency of the agent's policy and aids in exploration by using maximum likelihood training loss. The backtracking model is trained with a maximum likelihood training loss to aid in exploration by finding plausible trajectories that end at high-value states. The model is updated online using recent experiences to encourage generalization as the distribution of trajectories evolves. Recall traces are used to improve the agent's policy. The backtracking model is continuously updated using recall traces to improve the agent's policy through imitation learning. The agent imitates trajectories from the backtracking model to execute policies and estimate rewards, enhancing exploration and generalization. The backtracking model generates recall traces for high-value states, emphasizing significant returns and aiding exploration in sparse reward environments. It provides new ways to reach known high-value states, improving policy through imitation learning and enhancing generalization. The backtracking model generates recall traces for high-value states, aiding exploration in sparse reward environments. It suggests an EM-style training procedure alternating between training the variational distribution q(\u03c4) towards the posterior p(\u03c4|R > L) and training the policy to maximize L. The backtracking model generates recall traces for high-value states to aid exploration in sparse reward environments. It utilizes a model of backwards transitions to sample trajectories efficiently. Training the approximate posterior q(\u03c4) involves minimizing the KL divergence in the opposite direction, inspired by the wake-sleep algorithm. This approach simplifies sampling trajectories from p(\u03c4 |R > L). The backtracking model generates recall traces for high-value states to aid exploration in sparse reward environments by sampling trajectories efficiently. Training the approximate posterior q(\u03c4) involves minimizing the KL divergence, which can be done by sampling trajectories from p(\u03c4 |R > L) and maximizing their log-probability under q(\u03c4). Gradually increasing the threshold L by using top percentile trajectories sampled by the agent provides a curriculum for training adapted to its performance. The backtracking model generates recall traces for high-value states to aid exploration in sparse reward environments. Training the approximate posterior q(\u03c4) involves minimizing the KL divergence by sampling trajectories efficiently. Gradually increasing the threshold L provides a curriculum for training adapted to its performance, related to evolutionary methods BID17 BID1. The ideal prior q(s T ) is a generative model of final states leading to R > L, estimated either non-parametrically or parametrically. If goal states are known, L can be set as the reward of those states, and backwards trajectories can be seeded from them. The variational objective used to train the policy is a proxy for log-likelihood of reaching a goal state. Control problems can be treated as inference, with the idea of control as inference being around for many years. The idea of treating control problems as inference has been around for many years. Expectation Maximization (EM) for RL, such as the PoWER algorithm, divides learning between estimating trajectories and policy. Variational inference and maximum entropy methods have also been proposed for policy search in RL. Incorporating off-policy trajectories from a backtracking model is another approach. Our method incorporates off-policy trajectories using a separate backtracking model, similar to other approaches combining on-policy learning with off-policy samples. It differs by using the backtracking model to obtain off-policy trajectories independently of the specific RL method. Our work is related to prioritized sweeping and model-based RL methods proposed in the literature. The Dyna algorithm utilizes a model to generate simulated experiences for training data in model-free algorithms. Extensions to Dyna and other approaches combining value and policy-based methods have been proposed. Concurrent work suggests training on imagined reversal steps from known goal states. Another proposal involves modifying transition operator parameters in generative models for reverse cooling processes. Our experimental evaluation aims to improve sample efficiency in off-policy and on-policy RL algorithms by using a backtracking model. Short traces are sampled from the model, with the length adjusted based on the task's time-scale. Results show that using the backtracking model accelerates learning from high value states, and generating high value states with GoalGAN also enhances performance. In experiments, modeling parametrically and generating high value states with GoalGAN accelerates learning. The proposed approach is tested in a four-room environment of various dimensions, comparing it to actor-critic with GAE. As maze dimensionality increases, backtracking model proves more effective in improving sample efficiency. In comparison to Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), recall traces show better performance in the larger 15x15 environment of the Four-room Environment. Recall traces lead to visiting more states and a wider variety of grid positions, outperforming PER in sample efficiency. The backtracking model, when combined with the Goal GAN algorithm, aims to help the agent reach sub-goals efficiently by generating sub-goals of increasing difficulty. This approach encourages exploration and learning in the agent, ultimately improving its ability to navigate the state space. The backtracking model, in conjunction with Goal GAN, enhances data efficiency in robotic locomotion tasks. Experiments on the U-Maze Ant task show a coverage of over 63% in 155 steps, compared to 275 steps without it. Additional visualizations and learning curves can be found in the appendix. These experiments were conducted using the MuJoCo simulator, comparing the approach with a pure model-free method on benchmark locomotion tasks. Our model, using TRPO implementation, outperforms TRPO on benchmark tasks in terms of final performance and learning speed. Comparison with SAC shows our model's efficiency in continuous control tasks. Our model, using TRPO implementation, outperforms TRPO on benchmark tasks in terms of final performance and learning speed. Comparison with SAC shows our model consistently improves SAC performance on benchmark tasks, especially on the hardest task, Ant. The method can be combined with popular RL algorithms like TRPO and soft actor-critic for improved sample efficiency and exploration in RL. Our results show that recall traces from models accelerate learning on various tasks and can be combined with automatic goal generation. The method outperforms a random model, and the sensitivity to factors is analyzed in the Appendix. Future work includes improving theoretical understanding and exploring combinations with forward models in a model-based system. In FIG7, the backtracking model used two multi-layer perceptrons for action and state prediction. Each MLP had two hidden layers of 128 units. The action predictor used hyperbolic tangent units, while the state predictor used ReLU units. The networks output mean and variance parameters of a Gaussian distribution. The backtracking model was trained with a buffer storing states for every 5 training-steps of the RL algorithm. In the backtracking model, a buffer stores high reward states (state, action, nextstate, reward) for training. The model samples a batch from the buffer, normalizes states and actions, and trains on them. During sampling, normalized nextstate is used in the backward action predictor to get normalized action, which is then used in the backward state predictor to get normalized previous state. The obtained states and action are un-normalized using mean and variance for computing Imitation loss. This process ensures stability during sampling. The agent navigates within a U-shaped maze to reach sub-goals defined by Goal GAN in the Four Room Environment. High return trajectories are used for training the backtracking model parameters. The backtracking model uses high reward states stored in a buffer for training. Trajectories are sampled and used to improve the policy via imitation learning. Results show the backtracking model outperforms the Soft Actor Critic baseline, proving its effectiveness in navigation tasks. The Dyna algorithm utilizes a forward model to generate simulated experience. The Dyna algorithm uses a forward model to generate simulated experience, but it performed best with models that are not neural networks. Evaluating the Forward model with On-Policy TRPO on Ant and Humanoid Mujoco tasks did not yield better results compared to the Baseline TRPO. Building a backward model is neither harder nor easier. Building a backward model is neither harder nor easier. It is better to use accurate transitions from different states rather than from the same initial state. Training the forward and backtracking models jointly could help the forward model learn a reduced representation of the state necessary for reward evaluation. This goal-oriented approach optimizes prediction accuracy and avoids modeling irrelevant aspects of the environment. Training a backward model helps optimize prediction accuracy and avoids modeling irrelevant aspects of the environment. Ablations in the four-room environment show the impact of hyperparameters on performance, with training from recall traces improving performance. Increasing the number of iterations of learning from recall traces requires choosing a smaller trace length, which can benefit updates in the real environment. Training from recall traces in the four-room environment can improve performance, but the impact of hyperparameters is significant. More updates with smaller trace lengths benefit learning in the real environment, while too many updates with longer trace lengths can harm the learning process. Regular learning from recall traces is essential for optimal performance. In Mujoco tasks, more updates from recall traces can improve performance, but the balance between training in the actual environment and learning from traces is crucial. The optimal ratio varies depending on the task complexity, with a 1:1 balance performing best in a smaller four-room environment."
