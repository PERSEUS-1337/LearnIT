    "content": "The Act titled \"Protect Our Troops and Our Constitution Act of 2008\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that the President pledged in the Declaration of Principles to negotiate an agreement by July 2008 to replace the United Nations mandate providing legal authority and immunity for US and Coalition forces in Iraq. This agreement would include security commitments to support Iraq in defending itself. The text chunk discusses supporting Iraq in defending its democratic system, providing security assurances against foreign aggression, and combating terrorist groups. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified before the US Senate on this matter in 2008. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates renounced the pledge to defend Iraq, stating that agreements will not contain security commitments. General Douglas Lute mentioned negotiations for permanent US military bases in Iraq. President George W. Bush signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which banned permanent US military bases in Iraq. However, he indicated that he would not be bound by this provision. Secretary of Defense Gates and General Lute both affirmed that the US does not want permanent bases in Iraq. The Department of State has not consulted with congressional leaders on the Declaration of Principles, as required by US law. Secretary of Defense Gates emphasized the need for transparency in negotiations for a status of forces agreement with Iraq. According to the Congressional Research Service, the primary purpose of a status of forces agreement is to provide US Armed Forces with immunity from local prosecution. Secretary of Defense Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice intend for the agreement with Iraq to include the authority for US forces to engage in combat operations. The United States Armed Forces have legal authority to operate in Iraq under the United Nations mandate, with immunity from local prosecution. The Administration's objectives in seeking new agreements with Iraq are questioned due to inconsistencies in statements. The United States has legal authority to operate in Iraq under the UN mandate, but if no agreement is reached by December 31, 2008, they may have to go back to the Security Council for legal cover for foreign forces. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS. No funds can be used to establish or maintain permanent US military bases in Iraq or implement agreements related to US security commitments without Senate approval. The establishment of permanent US military bases in Iraq or implementation of security agreements requires Senate approval or an Act of Congress. SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that the United States Administration taking office in 2009 should determine long-term relations with Iraq. Consultation with Congress, the Government of Iraq, Coalition partners, and Iraq's neighbors is essential. The current Administration should support Iraq in renewing the United Nations mandate to maintain legal authority and immunity for US and Coalition forces in Iraq. The United States Administration should support Iraq in renewing the United Nations mandate for Iraq beyond December 31, 2008."
