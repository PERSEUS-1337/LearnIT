These zones are designated to receive incentives for economic revitalization efforts. The Economic Revitalization Act establishes Economic Revitalization Zones, which are nominated areas designated by the Secretary of Labor for economic revitalization efforts. Up to 10 areas can be designated as economic revitalization zones, with regulations to be published within 3 months of enactment. The Secretary of Labor can designate up to 10 nominated areas as economic revitalization zones within 180 days of enacting procedures and size parameters. The Secretary of Labor can designate nominated areas as economic revitalization zones if local governments and states have the authority to nominate, submit required information, and the information provided is accurate. Priority is given to nominated areas meeting specific criteria. The Secretary of Labor can designate areas as economic revitalization zones if they meet specific criteria, including a 50% decline in employment in a trade-affected industry since 1993 and the loss of over 1000 jobs within the past year. Designations remain in effect until December 31, 2014, or until revoked by the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Labor may revoke the designation of an economic revitalization zone if the local government or state modifies the area boundaries. Designation criteria include a 50% decline in employment in a trade-affected industry since 1993 and the loss of over 1000 jobs within the past year. The eligibility requirements for a nominated area include having a high unemployment rate compared to the national average, certification from states and local governments, and continuous boundaries within trade-affected states. The eligibility requirements for a nominated area include high unemployment rate compared to the national average, employment in trade-affected industries, and a decrease in employment by more than 20 percent from 1993 to 2002. A 'State' is defined as having a certain percentage of workers certified through trade adjustment assistance programs from 1994 to 2002. A 'trade-affected industry' is one with a significant decline in employees since 1993 and a large labor force in 1994. The term 'local government' refers to various political subdivisions of a State recognized by the Secretary of Labor. If more than 1 government seeks to nominate an area as an economic revitalization zone, any reference to, or requirement of, this section shall apply to all such governments. SEC. 1400N.

It is also considered a low-income community for the new markets tax credit. SEC. 3. COMMUNITY COLLEGE EMPLOYMENT GRANTS. Chapter 2 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974 is amended to include a new section on job training programs. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to community colleges on a competitive basis to establish job training programs for adversely affected workers. Community colleges must submit an application describing the population to be served, how grant funds will be used, and the job training programs to be established. Community colleges in economic revitalization zones can receive grants to establish job training programs for affected workers. The Secretary must approve or disapprove applications within 30 days. Grant funds must be used for job training programs related to workforce needs in the area.

The Trade Act of 1974 has been amended to provide immediate assistance for textile workers through job training programs. Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974 is amended to include a new rule for textile and apparel workers. It states that a group of workers at a textile or apparel firm will be presumed eligible for trade adjustment assistance if a significant number of workers are separated or threatened to be separated. The Trade Act of 1974 is amended to provide trade adjustment assistance for textile and apparel workers. Workers are eligible if their firm's sales or production decrease, or if the plant closes or relocates, leading to separation or threat of separation. Certification becomes permanent after 40 days unless criteria are not met."
