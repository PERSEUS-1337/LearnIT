    "content": "DEDUCTION OF PREMIUMS FOR HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS: An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new section allowing for the deduction of premiums for high deductible health plans. An individual can deduct premiums paid for a high deductible health plan if they are eligible. Definitions for \"eligible individual\" and \"high deductible health plan\" are provided. Special rules limit the deduction to only one plan for individuals with multiple high deductible health plans. If multiple individuals are covered by high deductible health plans, only the plan with the lowest premium can be considered for deduction. If only one individual is eligible, only 50 percent of their premium payments can be deducted. No deduction is allowed for group health plan coverage. An individual may not claim a deduction for coverage under a high deductible health plan if they participate in a group health plan, unless the only coverage is employer contributions to a health savings account. An individual cannot claim a deduction for coverage under a high deductible health plan if their only coverage under a group health plan is described in specific clauses. Additionally, deductions for amounts paid or distributed from an Archer MSA or health savings account are not included in gross income. Coordination with deductions for self-employed individuals' health insurance and medical expense deductions is also specified. The taxpayer's deduction under section 213 is not included in the amount taken into account for the deduction under section 224. Deductions for high deductible health plans are allowed regardless of itemizing other deductions. Coordination with the health insurance costs credit is amended to include section 224. A clerical amendment redesignates section 224 as section 225 in the table of sections. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2006. A new section allows for a credit for certain employment taxes paid with respect to premiums for high deductible health plans and contributions to health savings accounts. The new section allows for a credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year for certain employment taxes paid with respect to premiums for high deductible health plans and contributions to health savings accounts. The credit allowed under subsection (a) for any individual in a taxable year is limited to specified employment taxes related to wages and compensation received by the individual during that year. Specified employment taxes include taxes imposed on wages under various sections. The credit under subsection (a) is limited to employment taxes on self-employment income and employment compensation exceeding the Social Security base. The term 'employment compensation' is defined as the sum of wages and compensation received by an individual for any taxable year, with certain limitations on the rates of tax taken into account. The tax code defines employment compensation as the sum of wages and compensation received by an individual for a taxable year. Additionally, there is an increase in the additional tax on distributions not used for qualified medical expenses from health savings accounts. The tax code increases the savings account of a beneficiary by 30 percent of the amount includible in gross income, with exceptions for disability, death, and distributions after Medicare eligibility. The tax code is amended to substitute '15 percent' for '30 percent' in certain provisions. Additionally, there are conforming amendments made to related sections in the Internal Revenue Code. The tax code amendments include changes to employment taxes for high deductible health plans and health savings accounts, as well as overpayments of tax. These amendments will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2006."
