    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Glacier National Park Commemorative Coin Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that President William Howard Taft signed a bill establishing Glacier National Park in 1910, which later joined with Waterton Lakes National Park to become the world's first Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park in 1932. Both parks are Biosphere Reserves and were designated as a World Heritage Site in 1995. Glacier National Park, known as \"The Crown of the Continent\", will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2010. The park's rugged mountains, pristine forests, wildlife, meadows, and lakes have inspired generations to explore nature. In honor of Glacier National Park's 100th anniversary, the Secretary of the Treasury will mint up to 200,000 $1 coins with specific specifications. These coins will weigh 26.73 grams, have a diameter of 1.500 inches, and contain 90% silver and 10% copper. They will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The design of the coins will be determined. SEC. 4. DESIGN OF COINS. The coins minted under this Act will symbolize Glacier National Park with its natural features and wildlife. Each coin will display the coin's value, the year 2010, and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with relevant organizations and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act shall be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities starting on January 1, 2010, and no coins may be minted after December 31, 2010. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing the coins. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will receive a reasonable discount. SEC. 7. SURCHARGES. Sales of coins minted under this Act will include a $10 surcharge per coin. The first $2,000,000 of surcharges will be paid to the Glacier National Park Fund of Whitefish, Montana for park support and infrastructure. The fund will be audited as per regulations."
