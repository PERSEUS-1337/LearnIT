    "content": "The Department of State and the INS can access identifying information in the criminal history records of visa applicants and applicants for admission to the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allow the Department of State and the Service access to criminal history record information for visa and admission applicants. The National Crime Information Center provides access to criminal history records for visa applicants without charge. Unauthorized use of this information may result in fines or imprisonment. The FBI will provide periodic updates of the records to the agency receiving access. The National Crime Information Center provides free access to criminal history records for visa applicants. The receiving agency must update its database and destroy old extracts when new updates are received. Access to extracts does not grant access to full criminal history records; fingerprints and processing fees are required for that. The Attorney General and receiving agency may suspend the current access arrangement in favor of a more efficient method in the future. The Department of State must establish regulations for fingerprinting procedures and information use from the FBI to issue visas and admit aliens, ensuring limited redissemination, confidentiality, and destruction of information. The Attorney General and the Secretary of State must report to Congress on the implementation of amendments related to protecting privacy rights and providing access to criminal history information for enforcing immigration laws. To enforce immigration laws in the United States, terms must align with the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Act of 1998 and section 552a of title 5, United States Code."
