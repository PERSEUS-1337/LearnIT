    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. California is facing its worst water shortage crisis, and increasing the use of recycled water is crucial for expanding the state's water supply. Recycled water has been used beneficially for various purposes for over a century, and can significantly stretch California's potable water supplies. Currently, more than 3.5 million acre-feet of recyclable water is discharged annually to the ocean. The potential for expanding California's water supply through recycled water is substantial. The National Academy of Sciences highlights that reusing municipal wastewater could increase public supplies by 27%. Water discharged to the ocean is considered 'irrecoverable' and constitutes 'new supply'. The State Water Resources Control Board aims to create an additional 2.5 million acre-feet of recycled water by 2030. The delivery of shovel-ready recycled water projects can provide immediate drought relief to California\u2019s struggling communities. Recycled water projects could be expedited by providing relief from the time-consuming provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act while still complying with all state and local laws. Section 21080.21.5 is added to the Public Resources Code to exempt certain projects from the Act. For pipeline projects, the lead agency must hold a public hearing to address traffic impacts and file a notice of exemption within 20 days of project approval. The project applicant must ensure permission to access private property for right-of-way projects and restore public streets to comply with local laws. Compliance with all relevant regulations, including Chapter 3 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, is required. This section does not apply to certain projects involving recycled water pipelines. The section outlines exemptions for projects adjacent to others with exemptions, in resource areas, or involving excavation over half a mile. It expires on January 1, 2020, unless extended by a new statute. No reimbursement is required as local agencies can cover mandated costs."
