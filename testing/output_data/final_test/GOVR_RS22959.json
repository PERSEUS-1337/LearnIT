    "content": "Between the late 1970s and mid-1980s, savings and loan institutions faced challenges including high interest rates, the elimination of Regulation Q, deregulation of depository institutions, and reduced capital requirements, leading to negative impacts on the thrift industry by 1986. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) was passed by Congress in response to the negative impact on the thrift industry, with 441 insolvent thrifts holding $113 billion in assets by 1986. FIRREA created the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) to close and clean up these thrifts, funded by the Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP), a public-private partnership separate from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System. REFCORP issued $30 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds to fund the RTC, with additional funding from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Home Loan member banks totaling about $50 billion. Subsequent legislation increased RTC's funding to about $105.1 billion, overseen by the FDIC board as directed by FIRREA. The FIRREA established an RTC Oversight Board with five members, including federal officials, to oversee RTC policy and budget. The Oversight Board was not involved in detailed operational issues. In 1991, Congress passed legislation to address concerns about the RTC's funding and dual board structure. The RTC Oversight Board was replaced by the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board (TDPO) under the RTC Refinancing, Restructuring, and Improvement Act of 1991. The FDIC's role in managing the RTC was also changed, with some thrifts being sold to healthy acquirers and others being shut down. The RTC controlled assets of insolvent thrifts, with some being shut down and their deposits transferred to other institutions. The assets included cash, mortgages, loans, securities, land, and commercial properties. The RTC frequently paid less than face value for depository accounts due to the value of the customers exceeding the deposits. The RTC managed assets of failed thrifts, including cash, mortgages, loans, securities, land, and commercial properties. Initially criticized for slow resolution, the agency increased efforts to dispose of troubled thrifts faster, leading to a collection of problem assets. Concerns arose over the disposal methods, prompting bulk sales of packaged assets in 1990. The RTC shifted to bulk sales strategy for disposing assets, criticized for lack of competition and lower sale prices. Assets were packaged by product, location, and collateral type, with some packages as small as a few thousand dollars and others in the tens of millions. Some packages were asset-specific like hotels or motels. Despite facing market pricing lower than desired, the agency continued with bulk sales. The RTC pioneered \"equity partnerships\" to liquidate real estate and financial assets at lower pricing. They also led in securitization of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), facing initial challenges in selling due to commercial mortgage value losses. The RTC Completion Act of 1993 terminated the RTC and transferred its assets to the FDIC. The RTC closed 747 thrifts, sold over $450 billion of real estate, and disposed of 95% of their assets with a recovery rate of over 85%. The cost of the entire RTC thrift resolution process was estimated to be between $100 billion to $500 billion, with the majority being taxpayer financed. The RTC thrift resolution process cost an estimated $150 billion, mostly funded by taxpayers, which was below original estimates."
