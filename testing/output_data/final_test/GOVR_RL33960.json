    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the main source of federal aid for K-12 education, with Title I, Part A focusing on Education for the Disadvantaged. The ESEA was first enacted in 1965 and most recently reauthorized by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. The NCLB expanded federal influence on public K-12 education to increase accountability for improving student achievement, especially for disadvantaged students. The 113th Congress is expected to consider amending and extending the ESEA. Accountability requirements in Title I-A of the ESEA mandate states to implement standards and assessments for reading/language arts and math. Results are used to determine annual progress for schools and LEAs, with consequences for those failing to meet standards. Accountability also applies to public school teachers' qualifications. The Administration has made changes to these requirements. Other ESEA programs provide grants for migrant student education, teacher recruitment, and language instruction. The ESEA programs include support for migrant students, teacher recruitment, language instruction for LEP students, drug abuse prevention, after-school care, charter schools, education services for Native American students, and innovative educational approaches. Annual appropriations for these programs are provided through the L-HHS-ED Appropriations Act. The ESEA programs are funded through appropriations, with a list of programs not reflecting the actual number due to single line-item appropriations. President Obama and the Secretary announced ESEA flexibility waivers for states for school years 2011-2014. Congress has not reauthorized the ESEA, but waivers are available for states to apply for. States have the option to apply for waivers for school years 2011-2014, exempting them from certain academic accountability and teacher qualification requirements under NCLB. To receive the waivers, states must agree to four principles set by the U.S. Department of Education to improve student achievement and instruction quality. The ESEA flexibility package, approved for 37 states and the District of Columbia, involves a redesign of accountability and teacher-related requirements. If Congress reauthorizes ESEA, new provisions may override the Administration's waivers. This report focuses on current law and does not delve into the details of the flexibility package. The ESEA flexibility package, approved for 37 states and the District of Columbia, involves a redesign of accountability and teacher-related requirements. Title I-A authorizes the appropriation of necessary funds for School Improvement Grants allocated to states based on their share of funds received under ESEA Title I. States must use at least 95% of the funds for subgrants to LEAs. The School Improvement Grants (SIG) program allocates funds to states under ESEA Title I, with at least 95% used for subgrants to LEAs. Subgrants range from $50,000 to $500,000 for schools in need of improvement, and must be renewable for up to two years if goals are met. Priority is given to LEAs supporting low-achieving schools, with changes made through appropriations acts to enhance the SIG program. The SIG program was amended to provide a maximum grant of $2 million annually to schools not meeting AYP or in the lowest performance quintile. Changes in appropriations acts also affected school eligibility and the maximum amount awarded. Newly eligible schools are those meeting the new criteria outlined in the acts. The FY2012 appropriations act included provisions for SIG funding, allowing the Secretary of Education to reserve up to 5% of funds for capacity-building activities. Title I, Part A of the ESEA provides federal aid to LEAs for disadvantaged students, with requirements attached for receiving grants. Title I-A funds are allocated by the U.S. Department of Education to state educational agencies, which then suballocate grants to LEAs. The funds are distributed under four different formulas based on the number of children in poor families and state expenditure factors. The Title I-A funds are distributed to LEAs based on formulas that consider poverty levels and expenditure equity. Each formula includes weighting schemes, hold harmless provisions, and state minimum grant provisions. These funds are used to provide educational services to students from low-income families in public schools, as well as eligible students in private schools. Title I-A funds are allocated to LEAs based on poverty levels. Schools with over 75% low-income students must receive services. Two types of programs exist: schoolwide for schools with 40% or more low-income students, and targeted assistance for others. Schoolwide programs aim to improve all students' performance through various means. The Title I-A program offers two types of school service models: schoolwide programs for schools with 40% or more low-income students and targeted assistance programs for others. The targeted assistance program provides intensive instruction for the lowest achieving students, such as through specialist teachers or after-school programs. Participating states must conduct annual assessments in reading/language arts and mathematics for students in specific grades. Beginning in the 2007-2008 school year, assessments in reading/language arts and mathematics must be conducted annually for students in grades 3-8 and at least once in grades 10-12. Science assessments must also be administered to students in grades 3-5, 6-9, and 10-12. Performance standards must include three levels: advanced, proficient, and basic. States must meet criteria for accommodations for students with disabilities and LEP students, and align content standards, performance standards, and assessments. States must also assess English language proficiency for LEP students annually and participate in NAEP tests every two years. Annual measurable objectives (AMOs) must be developed separately for reading and mathematics assessments. The Annual Measurable Objectives (AMOs) for reading and math assessments must be the same for all schools and LEAs, with a minimum percentage of students required to meet or exceed proficiency levels. States must ensure all students reach proficiency by the end of the 2013-2014 school year. Results from these assessments are used to determine Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for Title I-A schools, LEAs, and states overall. Consequences for not meeting AYP standards are outlined in the ESEA. Under the ESEA, consequences for failing to meet AYP standards apply to Title I-A schools and LEAs, with limited consequences for states as a whole. AYP is based on student proficiency levels and additional academic indicators, including graduation rates. Results must be disaggregated for various demographic groups. To make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) under the ESEA, schools must ensure at least 95% of students overall and in each demographic group participate in assessments. AYP standards require meeting performance thresholds on assessments and academic indicators for all designated student groups. A \"safe harbor\" provision allows for AYP if a student group shows a 10% reduction in students below proficiency compared to the previous year. The ESEA uses a \"status\" model for AYP determination statewide. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using \"growth\" models to determine AYP. States can apply for a waiver to implement a growth model. Schools failing to meet AYP standards for consecutive years must offer options for students to attend other schools or receive supplemental educational services. Additional corrective actions are required for schools failing to meet AYP for a fourth year. Title I-A schools failing to meet AYP standards for a fourth year must develop a \"restructuring\" plan, which may involve reopening as a charter school. If they fail for a sixth year, the plan must be implemented. Similar procedures apply to LEAs receiving Title I-A grants. States must ensure all public school teachers in core subjects are \"highly qualified\" by holding a bachelor's degree, state certification, and subject area knowledge. Public school teachers must demonstrate subject area knowledge to be deemed \"highly qualified\" by passing state academic tests, completing academic majors, graduate degrees, or advanced certifications. Paraprofessionals in Title I-A programs must have at least two years of higher education, an associate's degree, or meet a rigorous quality standard. Title I-B authorizes the Reading First program, allocating grants based on the number of children in poor families. The Reading First program under Title I-B allocates grants to improve reading programs for students in grades K-3 in schools with high percentages of students from low-income families. Priority is given to schools with a significant number of children aged 5-17 in poverty. The program emphasizes scientifically based reading research and offers performance awards for states showing improvements in student reading. Early Reading First, authorized under Subpart 2 of Title I-B, provides competitive grants for preschool programs. Early Reading First provides competitive grants to LEAs and programs serving preschool children for activities grounded in scientifically based reading research to help children acquire skills for learning to read. The program is not currently funded. William F. Goodling Even Start Family Literacy Programs allocate funds to states based on Title I-A grants, with a minimum state grant amount. Funds are awarded to partnerships to provide services to parents and children, including early childhood education, adult basic education, and parenting skills training. This program is also not currently funded. Title I-B authorizes grants to LEAs for school library services, with funding allocated based on annual appropriations. If appropriations are below $100 million, grants are competitive; if above, grants are made by formula to SEAs. Title I-C provides grants to SEAs for migratory children's education, allocated by formula. Title I-D offers programs for neglected, delinquent, or at-risk students. Title I-E aims to enhance education for neglected, delinquent, or at-risk students through grants for state institutions and programs operated by LEAs in collaboration with correctional facilities. It also mandates a national assessment of Title I programs and evaluations of accountability measures. Title I-E focuses on improving education for neglected, delinquent, or at-risk students through grants for state institutions and programs operated by LEAs in collaboration with correctional facilities. It also includes a national assessment of Title I programs and evaluations of accountability measures. Additionally, Title I-F authorizes grants for comprehensive reform strategies in Title I-A schools, while Title I-G provides grants for advanced placement test fees for low-income individuals and supports activities to expand access to advanced placement programs. Title I-H authorizes competitive grants for dropout prevention and reentry programs in high schools with high dropout rates. Grants are given to SEAs or LEAs based on annual appropriations levels, with the Secretary of Education overseeing a national strategy for dropout prevention and reentry. Title I-I is part of a coordinated national strategy for dropout prevention and reentry, providing federal regulations for Title I programs, state administration, and LEA audits. It prohibits federal control over instructional content and standards, authorizes state grants for teacher development, and does not mandate equalized spending per pupil. Under the Title I-I program, funds are allocated based on the total population aged 5-17 and in poor families. State Education Agencies (SEAs) can reserve funds for administration and statewide services, with at least 95% of grants going to Local Education Agencies (LEAs). LEAs receive a set amount based on previous grants and the remaining funds are distributed based on population demographics. Grants can be used for teacher support programs and recruiting highly qualified teachers. Part A of the Title I-I program authorizes grants for recruiting and retaining highly qualified teachers and professional development activities. Grants are also available for partnerships to provide sustained professional development services for teachers, principals, and paraprofessionals. Eligible partnerships must include an institution of higher education, a high-need LEA, and possibly additional organizations. Additional provisions support national activities like principal recruitment and advanced certification. Title II-B of the program authorizes grants for professional development, recruitment of math and science teachers, and curriculum development. Funds are allocated to states by formula if appropriations are $100 million or more. Subpart 1 includes programs for former armed services members to become teachers and support for alternative certification programs for mid-career professionals.

Subpart 3 authorizes the Ready-to-Learn Television program, providing support for educational programs for preschool and elementary school students and their parents to enhance school readiness and academic achievement. Subpart 4 requires Internet safety policies for LEAs or schools receiving aid under Part D to prevent minors from accessing harmful material. Title III of the ESEA provides funding to support the education of LEP and immigrant students, with Part A focusing on English language acquisition and academic achievement. The program aims to help LEP students attain English proficiency, academic success, and meet state academic standards. Title III of the ESEA provides funding to support the education of LEP and immigrant students, with Part A focusing on English language acquisition and academic achievement. Formula grant allocations are made to states based on the proportion of LEP students and immigrant students in each state. States then make subgrants to eligible entities based on the number of LEP students in schools served. Funds must be used to increase English language proficiency of LEP students. States are also required to reserve up to 15% of the allocation for entities with a significant increase in immigrant students. Funds from Title III of the ESEA must be used to increase English language proficiency of LEP students through high-quality instructional programs and professional development. Grants for immigrant students must support enhanced instructional opportunities. SEAs are responsible for setting annual measurable achievement objectives for LEP students. Title III of the ESEA focuses on improving English language proficiency for LEP students through programs and professional development. It also includes provisions for annual assessments of English proficiency and funding for national programs. The National Professional Development Project awards grants for up to five years to improve classroom instruction for LEP students. The National Clearinghouse collects and disseminates information about language instruction programs. Title IV of the ESEA includes programs for drug abuse prevention and smoke-free environments. Title IV-A is a federal initiative to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. State grant funds are allocated based on population and Title I-A concentration grants. SEAs distribute formula grants to LEAs based on funding and enrollment. State governors receive funds to create programs to deter youth from drug use and violence in schools. National programs support leadership projects for school safety. Title IV-A and Title IV-B funding support activities in schools and nonschool hours for school-aged children. Grants are distributed to states based on Title I-A funds, then awarded to local entities competitively. Funds must be distributed equitably among urban and rural areas. Eligible entities serve students in schoolwide programs under Title I-A and their families, using funds for before- and after-school activities to enhance student academic performance. Title IV-C focuses on providing after-school activities for children and youth, as well as literacy-related activities for their families. Part A of the program authorizes the Innovative Programs block grant for educational services and activities. Funding is allocated to states based on population aged 5-17, with a minimum grant amount for each state. At least 85% of Title V-A funds must be allocated by SEAs to LEAs based on state-developed formulas. Title V-A funds must be allocated by SEAs to LEAs based on state-developed formulas, with adjustments for high-cost students. Part A funds can be used for various programs and services, including education reform and school improvement. LEAs can use their funds for innovative assistance programs. The program authorizes grants to support the development of public charter schools, with priority given to states meeting specific criteria. Up to 5% of funds may be reserved for technical assistance and studies. Grants are also available for entities to support charter schools under federal grant programs. Part C of the federal formula grant programs provides grants for magnet schools, encouraging diverse student enrollment. Part D offers competitive grants for innovative K-12 educational activities, including required studies on various school-related issues. Subpart 3 authorizes grants for expanding public school options but is currently unfunded. The Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) program and the Promise Neighborhoods program were created to address issues like exposure of children to violent entertainment and sexual abuse in schools. TIF provides grants for performance-based teacher and principal compensation systems in high-need schools, while Promise Neighborhood supports distressed communities in implementing family and community services and educational reforms for children from birth through college. The curr_chunk discusses various education programs that are not currently funded, including Character Education, Gifted and Talented Students, Foreign Language Assistance, Arts in Education, and more. These programs cover a wide range of educational initiatives but lack funding at the moment. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of funds for Part D, specifically Subpart 1 of Part A which authorizes grants to states for assessments. Each state initially receives $3 million per year, with remaining funds allocated based on population aged 5-17. Previously, funds exceeding a trigger amount were awarded competitively, but this trigger no longer applies. Funds are now appropriated for both formula and competitive grants. Funds are appropriated for formula and competitive grants, with the majority awarded by formula. LEAs can transfer funds among selected ESEA programs, but not out of Title I-A. States can also transfer funds among ESEA programs, with State-Flex and Local-Flex programs allowing consolidation of funds for various purposes. Under the state and local flexibility demonstration programs, LEAs can consolidate funds from various ESEA programs for authorized purposes, with some requirements such as civil rights and fiscal accountability not being waived. The Secretary of Education reviews states' overall progress in meeting Title I-A and Title III-A requirements, providing assistance to those failing to meet them for two consecutive years. Reports are submitted to Congress listing non-compliant states. Part B of the Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) includes initiatives to assist rural LEAs lacking resources to compete for grants effectively. The Small, Rural School Achievement Program (SRSA) provides flexibility in fund use for rural LEAs with fewer than 600 students.
