    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Foreign Language Economic Enhancement Act\". The Congress recognizes the importance of foreign language proficiency for Americans to understand other cultures, conduct effective foreign policy, and compete in the global business community. However, many of the world's most populous languages are not widely taught in the United States. In the United States, few universities offer translation and interpretation training, with only one providing an undergraduate degree program. Most professional interpreters and translators in the US are foreign-born or trained abroad. Only 8% of universities require foreign languages for admission, and just 5% of college graduates are fluent in a language other than English. American higher education needs to focus on improving foreign language teaching to address these challenges. Many teachers lack international preparation, with only 5% ever taking relevant courses. Less than 5% of elementary students receive foreign language instruction, and only 17% of public schools offer language classes. There is a shortage of foreign language teachers in 35 states as the need for language instruction grows. The Act defines key terms such as \"institution of higher education,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State education agency,\" and \"local educational agency.\" Title I focuses on recruiting foreign language teachers through a grant program to train individuals with language competence for teaching. The Secretary will establish a program to provide grants to State educational agencies for recruiting and training elementary and secondary school teachers. Funds will be allotted based on the needs for foreign language teachers in each State, with grants ranging from $500,000 to $2,000,000. Grant applications will be subject to specific requirements outlined in the regulations. Any State seeking a grant under this program must submit an application to the Secretary with specified information and assurances. The application must ensure that 50% of the funds will be used to provide grants of up to $5,000 per year to individuals for teaching certification. Allocation of funds will be based on factors like the need for foreign language teachers in local educational agencies. The State educational agency must submit an application with specific details and assurances to receive a grant under the program. The application should address the establishment of effective foreign language programs, the need for qualified teachers, and other relevant factors. Additionally, the agency must ensure that institutions of higher education require 2 years of foreign language instruction for admission or graduation. The procedures for selecting institutions or organizations to provide services must also be specified. The agency will choose institutions or organizations to provide teacher certification training, including higher education institutions, local educational agencies, or consortia. SEC. 104.
