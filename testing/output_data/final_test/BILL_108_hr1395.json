    "content": "CORE FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT for transportation and stationary power generation. The Secretary will establish a program for fuel cell technologies with goals including reducing production costs, increasing efficiency, and validating solutions for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The program authorized under this section focuses on achieving low cost, high-efficiency, fuel flexible, modular fuel cell power systems, improved manufacturing processes, high-temperature membranes, cost-effective fuel processing, reliability, durability, and freeze/cold start capability. Authorization of appropriations includes $78,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, $80,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2006, $110,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, and $122,000,000 for fiscal year 2008. The program focuses on developing hydrogen technology for fuel cell power systems, membranes, fuel processing, and reliability. Authorization of appropriations includes funding for fiscal years 2004 to 2008. The Secretary will establish a program for hydrogen technologies with goals including reducing the cost of hydrogen production from natural gas to $1.50 per gallon of gasoline equivalent by 2010, producing hydrogen from renewable resources at $2.60 per kilogram by 2008, and developing a hydrogen storage technology with specific energy and energy density targets by 2010. The Secretary will establish a program for hydrogen technologies with goals including reducing the cost of hydrogen production from natural gas to $1.50 per gallon of gasoline equivalent by 2010, producing hydrogen from renewable resources at $2.60 per kilogram by 2008, and developing a hydrogen storage technology with specific energy and energy density targets by 2010. In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall draft technical specifications for an international agreement on a global technology regulation for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and infrastructure, and educate key target audiences on the concept of a hydrogen economy. Initiate tests of prototype hydrogen production technologies, including coal-based and nuclear initiatives for large-scale, emission-free hydrogen production. Authorization of Appropriations:\n- $104,000,000 for fiscal year 2004\n- $120,000,000 for fiscal year 2005\n- $140,000,000 for fiscal year 2006\n- $160,000,000 for fiscal year 2007\n- $186,000,000 for fiscal year 2008. The Act authorizes funds for fiscal years 2004 to 2008. Awards will be granted based on scientific and technical merit after review by the Department of Energy. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy."
