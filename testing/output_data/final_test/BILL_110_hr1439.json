The \"Supply Our Soldiers Act of 2007\" establishes a postal benefits program for qualified individuals, defined as members of the Armed Forces on active duty in Iraq or Afghanistan or hospitalized due to service-related disease or injury. The postal benefits provided under the \"Supply Our Soldiers Act of 2007\" consist of vouchers entitling qualified individuals, such as members of the Armed Forces on active duty in Iraq or Afghanistan, to make qualified mailings free of postage. Qualified mailings are single mail pieces sent from within a US post office area and addressed to a qualified individual. The mail described in this paragraph includes first-class mail not exceeding 13 ounces and parcel post not exceeding 15 pounds. An individual can receive 1 voucher per month for qualified mailings, which must be used for a single qualified mailing before the voucher expires. The Secretary of Defense will designate a voucher for postal benefits under this Act, in addition to any existing reduced postage rates. Regulations for voucher procedures will be prescribed within 30 days of the Act's enactment. Procedures for timely provision of vouchers to qualified individuals and ensuring compliance with voucher limits are required under this Act. SEC. 3. FUNDING.
