    "content": "Many experts believe that the threat of CBRN weapons is a significant risk to U.S. national security. There is consensus among government officials, analysts, and politicians that the U.S. faces an increasing danger from these weapons. President George W. Bush emphasized this threat in his 2002 National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction. The United States faces a significant security challenge from the threat of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons pursued by violent extremists. Various policy tools, including diplomatic engagement and financial programs, are used to address this threat. The United States implements nonproliferation assistance and global security engagement programs to help other nations secure and eliminate CBRN weapons. These efforts originated from the Nunn-Lugar amendment in 1991, which allocated funds to secure Soviet nuclear weapons after a coup in Moscow raised concerns. The United States has allocated funds to secure and eliminate Soviet nuclear weapons through various programs, including border security enhancements and redirecting weapons scientists towards peaceful purposes. Funding for these programs has decreased over the years, with multiple U.S. agencies now involved in their administration. The United States has allocated funds to secure and eliminate Soviet nuclear weapons through various programs, including border security enhancements and redirecting weapons scientists towards peaceful purposes. Congress has supported these efforts by authorizing and appropriating funds, adjusting program profiles, and questioning goals and effectiveness. The 113th Congress will continue to review funding, assess goals, and raise questions about government-wide coordination and international cooperation in implementing these programs. The report provides information on US programs to secure and eliminate nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, prevent access by hostile nations and terrorists, and address international cooperation. It reviews the evolution of these programs, congressional oversight challenges, and individual program details. The \"Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991\" authorized $400 million in FY1992 Defense Department funds to assist the Soviet Union in destroying nuclear weapons and addressing security concerns following the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program was established to assist the Soviet Union and its successor entities in destroying nuclear, chemical, and other weapons, as well as establishing safeguards against proliferation. Senators Nunn and Lugar warned of the dangers of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Senator Nunn warned of the risk of nuclear proliferation worldwide if control over weapons and components weakened. Concerns persisted about Russia's nuclear weapons being diverted or lost due to its weak economy. Many saw the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program as crucial for long-term threat reduction and nonproliferation efforts. Many viewed the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program as a vital part of long-term threat reduction and nonproliferation efforts. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry described CTR as \"defense by other means,\" helping eliminate Soviet weapons that threatened the United States and containing materials that could pose new threats. By the mid-1990s, U.S. assistance to former Soviet states was seen as crucial in preventing weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists. Congress expanded programs to enhance security at facilities with nuclear and chemical materials to prevent potential terrorist access. Since the mid-1990s, U.S. assistance to former Soviet states has been crucial in preventing weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists. The Department of Energy task force highlighted the urgent national security threat of weapons or materials being stolen and used against the U.S. by terrorists or hostile nations. Analysts agree that helping Russia protect its weapons and knowledge makes it harder for terrorists to acquire CBRN weapons. The George W. Bush Administration considered threat reduction programs in former Soviet states essential to keeping weapons of mass destruction away from terrorists. The George W. Bush Administration increased funding for programs to prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists, focusing on stemming proliferation in former Soviet states. Efforts included export and border control programs, knowledge leakage prevention, and recovery of radiological sources. An agreement with Russia in 2005 accelerated securing Soviet-era nuclear weapons. The 2005 agreement with Russia accelerated efforts to secure Soviet-era nuclear weapons, leading to completion of warhead storage and security projects. U.S. threat reduction programs expanded globally to eliminate nuclear, chemical, and biological materials by collaborating with various countries on security capacity building. The Obama Administration endorsed expanding training programs and equipment for security, biological pathogen security, and border security to prevent proliferation and terrorist threats related to CBRN weapons. These programs aim to keep weapons away from terrorists and states of concern, secure nuclear and biological materials, eliminate chemical weapons, destroy legacy weapons, and build capabilities to prevent and respond to CBRN crises. President Obama prioritized securing vulnerable nuclear materials globally through international partnerships and increased funding. The Obama Administration prioritized expanding global nuclear security programs and funding, shifting focus from the former Soviet Union to regions in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. This shift aims to enhance the flexibility and success of threat reduction efforts on a global scale, with increased cooperation outside of Russia. Congress eventually approved this new global expansion of U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs. Congress took several years to approve new authority for threat reduction and nonproliferation programs. Senator Richard Lugar proposed an amendment allowing DOD to use $50 million in FY2003 CTR funds outside the former Soviet Union for emerging proliferation threats. The Bush Administration supported this, but the House objected. The authority was eventually included in the FY2004 Defense Authorization Act. The FY2004 Defense Authorization Act provided funding for short-term projects in the former Soviet Union, with the Bush Administration using it for chemical weapons elimination in Albania. Congressional support for expanding these programs grew, with the FY2008 Defense Authorization Act indicating a need to strengthen and expand CTR initiatives, including projects in Asia and the Middle East, and denuclearization efforts in North Korea. Congress added $10 million to fund these programs and streamlined project approval processes. The FY2004 Defense Authorization Act funded short-term projects in the former Soviet Union, with support growing for expanding CTR initiatives. The FY2010 Defense Authorization Bill allowed DOD to accept funds from other nations for CTR efforts, supported by the Obama Administration in FY2011 budget request. Congress mandated a study by the National Academy of Sciences to strengthen and expand the CTR Program, recommending a new, broader program to engage nations globally in securing dangerous weapons and materials. Some Members of Congress pushed for the expansion of cooperative threat reduction efforts in the Middle East and North Africa through proposed bills like the \"Next Generation Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2013\" and the Cooperative Threat Reduction Modernization Act. These initiatives aimed to broaden CTR programs in the region, as the U.S. shifted its focus away from cooperation with Russia towards other nations. The future of U.S.-Russian nonproliferation cooperation is changing due to the expiration of the Memorandum of Understanding in 2013. Russia now has the resources and willingness to manage these programs on its own, leading to a shift away from cooperation with the U.S. Reports indicate that Russia was presented with a draft extension of the agreement in 2012, but is now able to finance many programs independently. In 2013, the Memorandum of Understanding expired, leading to a shift in U.S.-Russian nonproliferation cooperation. Russia now has the resources and willingness to manage programs independently, refusing U.S. access to sensitive military facilities. The Pentagon warned of shutting down projects without legal protections. Cooperation continued under a bilateral protocol to the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Program in the Russian Federation Agreement. The Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Program in the Russian Federation (MNEPR) Agreement allows European partners to fund nonproliferation and radiological clean-up projects in Russia. The United States signed the MNEPR agreement in 2003 but did not sign the associated Protocol on Claims, Legal Proceedings, and Indemnification. However, the US signed a MNEPR protocol with Russia in 2013, ensuring liability protection and tax exemption for threat reduction assistance. Cooperation between the US and Russia in nuclear security and nonproliferation areas will continue. The United States and Russia will no longer cooperate on projects related to nuclear security and nonproliferation. Russia's Ministry of Defense will not participate in these projects, and Russia will take full responsibility for them. Projects in these areas were already winding down after successful cooperation. The United States and Russia will no longer cooperate on projects related to nuclear security and nonproliferation. Russia will take full responsibility for monitoring its strategic offensive forces under the New START Treaty. Cooperation on chemical weapons elimination projects has ceased, but discussions on potential technical cooperation continue. The Department of Energy expected to continue cooperation with Rosatom to secure Russian nuclear facilities and materials, but remaining programs did not continue as expected. In late 2014, Russia informed the United States that it would no longer accept U.S. assistance in securing weapons-grade uranium and plutonium. Some in Congress questioned whether projects should continue due to Russia's aggression against Ukraine. The FY2015 NDAA specified that funds for threat reduction and nonproliferation cooperation in Russia could not be spent until certain conditions were met. The final version of the FY2015 NDAA did not include these certification requirements. The FY2015 NDAA did not include certification requirements for threat reduction and nonproliferation cooperation in Russia. The FY2016 NDAA contains limitations on U.S. cooperation with Russia, prohibiting funds for defense nuclear nonproliferation activities to be used for contracts with Russia, with a waiver available for national security interests. The United States government is concerned about the security of weapons of mass destruction in countries facing regime collapse, such as Libya, Iraq, and Syria. Assistance in these scenarios is challenging due to the risk of losing control over WMD. North Korea is also a potential concern for WMD control in case of regime change or disarmament. This issue mirrors the original Cooperative Threat Reduction programs in the former Soviet Union. In Libya and Iraq, Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) faced challenges during regime transitions. In Libya, dismantlement began cooperatively after joining the CWC in 2004, but became more complex after the fall of the Qaddafi regime in 2011. In Iraq, UN inspectors had made progress before 2003, revealing overestimated stockpiles. These cases highlight the difficulties of CTR in non-cooperative environments. The international community faced challenges in engaging former WMD weapons scientists in Iraq and Libya during regime transitions. In Syria, the civil war posed a threat due to the known stockpile of chemical weapons. The United States focused on preventing proliferation by working with neighboring countries instead of securing the weapons directly. The United States provided support to destroy Syrian chemical weapons after Syria joined the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2013. This unique case involved U.S. threat reduction work outside the country. Some in Congress advocate for more funding in the Middle East and North Africa. The Administration was required to produce a strategy for preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and North Africa by March 31, 2014. The report was submitted to congressional committees but not made public. The MENA region poses immediate WMD proliferation challenges due to Syria's chemical weapons program, Iran's nuclear program, and terrorist groups. The Committee emphasizes the need for a comprehensive cooperative threat reduction strategy in the region. Senator Jeanne Shaheen introduced the Next Generation Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2013 (S. 1021) in May 2013, proposing a multiyear assistance strategy to coordinate CTR efforts in the Middle East and North Africa. The bill's language was included in the FY2014 NDAA as a strategy to prevent WMD proliferation in the region. The Nunn-Lugar Amendment in 1991 authorized $400 million for U.S. threat reduction assistance to former Soviet states, involving experts from various agencies like the State Department and Department of Energy. In FY1997, agencies like Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and Department of State took budgetary and management responsibility for U.S. threat reduction programs. The Department of Homeland Security also participates in programs to prevent nuclear or radiological materials from entering the United States. These agencies are seeking nearly $1.65 billion for these programs in FY2014, with the overarching mission to reduce the threat from weapons of mass destruction. The Department of Defense's Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program focuses on eliminating, securing, or consolidating weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and related materials in partner countries. The program aims to prevent the proliferation of WMD materials across international borders through strategic projects funded in areas such as arms elimination, chemical weapons destruction, global nuclear security, biological engagement, and proliferation prevention. In FY2016, Congress authorized $358.5 million for the CTR program. In FY2016, Congress authorized $358.5 million for the CTR program, a slight decrease from the previous year. Reductions in funding were due to the conclusion of strategic arms and chemical weapons programs in Russia and other countries. The program continues to work with non-Russian countries in the former Soviet Union and expand cooperative programs globally. The DOD CTR program receives funds through the Office of the Secretary of Defense for long-range planning and guidance. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) manages CTR programming and contracting. The Department of Energy has also contributed to U.S. threat reduction efforts since the early 1990s. The DOE and DOD collaborated on projects to enhance nuclear material security, leading to the International Nuclear Materials Protection and Cooperation Program. Congress allocated $6.4 billion between FY1993 and FY2014 for this initiative. The DOE also assisted in retraining Soviet-era nuclear scientists to prevent knowledge proliferation. Additionally, the Global Threat Reduction Initiative was established in 2004 to secure and remove vulnerable nuclear materials from civilian facilities. The Department of Energy requested $643 million for nonproliferation assistance programs in FY2015, a reduction from previous years due to project completions and a lapse in the MOU governing the CTR program. The Department of Energy's budget request for nonproliferation programs in FY2016 reflects a significant change in organizational structure, with programs now consolidated into two areas: Global Material Security and Material Management and Minimization. Funding for these programs increased from $698 million in FY2015 to $738.4 million in FY2016. Russia's withdrawal from cooperative efforts with the DOE in 2014 has impacted funding for warhead security work. The Department of Energy funds nonproliferation programs through the National Nuclear Security Administration's Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account. The State Department plays a key role in negotiating agreements for U.S. assistance and managing the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund. The Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund (NDF) has received between $15 million and $40 million per year since 1993, funding projects outside the former Soviet Union, including ongoing activities in the Middle East like Syria's chemical weapons destruction efforts. The State Department also supports nonproliferation goals through programs like the Export Control and Related Border Security Assistance (EXBS) program and the Global Threat Reduction (GTR) program, focusing on engaging scientists to prevent proliferation of WMD materials in countries like Yemen, Pakistan, and Iraq. Additionally, the WMD Terrorism program helps enhance other nations' capacity to respond to WMD terrorist events and nuclear smuggling. The State Department is seeking funding for various nonproliferation programs, including the NDF, EXBS, GTR, and WMD terrorism program. The Department of Homeland Security also implements programs to prevent the illicit transfer of CBRN materials, such as the International Cargo Screening program. DHS implements programs to target high-risk cargo before it reaches the US, working with foreign customs officials and the DOE Megaports Initiative to scan containers for radiological or nuclear materials. The International Cargo Screening program is funded at $69.9 million in FY2016. Congress has addressed issues related to U.S. threat reduction programs in Russia and the former Soviet Union. The United States implements programs through various government agencies to secure CBRN weapons, materials, and knowledge. Different agencies like the State Department, Energy Department, DOD, and DHS fund programs with overlapping goals. Analysts suggest the need for a single coordinating authority to avoid redundant efforts. A high-level program coordinator, either an individual or committee, may be needed to establish priorities, share resources, and resolve budgetary conflicts across agencies. The Implementing the Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 called for the creation of an Office of the United States Coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism. Some argue against a single coordinator, suggesting that coordination can be achieved through the regular NSC structure. President Obama's National Security Strategy highlighted the need for improved coordination across departments and agencies. The Security Strategy emphasizes the importance of fostering coordination across departments and agencies to align resources with national security strategy, adapt education and training of security professionals, review authorities for implementing assistance programs, and strengthen coordination. The Obama Administration appointed a new NSC director to coordinate efforts in preventing WMD proliferation and terrorism, with a deputy director focusing on threat reduction. The Obama Administration appointed a new NSC director to coordinate threat reduction and nonproliferation programs across agencies, emphasizing effective coordination to maximize program effectiveness. The Department of Homeland Security plays a role in combating nuclear terrorism through coordinating executive branch programs. The Safe Port Act established a \"Global Nuclear Detection Architecture\" to protect the US from nuclear threats, with DNDO guiding the global efforts. DNDO coordinates with other agencies like Defense, State, and Energy to prevent duplication in nuclear detection activities. Ambassador Bonnie Jenkins leads the State Department's efforts in nuclear security and threat reduction. Ambassador Bonnie Jenkins leads the State Department's nuclear security efforts and coordinates interagency programs for a coordinated U.S. approach. Policy coordination committees formalize communication across agencies, with informal coordination also playing a role in nuclear terrorism prevention and security efforts. Analysts and officials highlight the importance of long-term professional relationships among senior officials in different agencies for effective coordination in threat reduction initiatives. The sustainability of this coordination is questioned, with past arguments emphasizing the need for high-level attention from senior government officials to secure CBRN weapons. President Bush's Administration set an example by prioritizing these programs, as seen in the agreement with President Putin at Bratislava. During his Administration, President Obama emphasized the importance of nuclear security programs and their goals. He highlighted concerns with nuclear terrorism in various speeches and established the Nuclear Security Summit process. In December 2012, he reaffirmed support for U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs. Some analysts question President Obama's commitment to nuclear security programs due to reduced funding requests for programs like the Global Threat Reduction Initiative and scaled-back goals for the Second Line of Defense Program. These reductions may undermine the programs and suggest a shift in Administration priorities. The reduction in funding for nuclear security programs may indicate a change in Administration priorities. Delays in cooperation with partner countries can slow program implementation, leading to decreased funding levels. Some programs, like strategic arms elimination, have seen success with reduced funding. Major programs like DOE's IMPC&A and DOD's CW destruction are winding down construction projects. The reduction in funding for nuclear security programs in the Russian Federation reflects the completion of major construction projects. New areas of work focus on security and border control training, with some budgets remaining steady. Critics argue for maintaining funding levels to address new threats, while others advocate for increased funding in specific regions like the Middle East. Congress questions the effectiveness of U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs. Members have questioned the effectiveness of U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation programs, particularly in justifying continued funding allocation. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 directed the Secretary of Defense to develop metrics to measure the impact of DOD's CTR activities, with some programs showing measurable success in reducing nuclear weapons and enhancing security systems. The success of U.S. threat reduction programs is measurable through examples like the removal of weapons-usable material from Libya and the dismantlement of biological weapons infrastructure in Iraq. However, measuring progress has become more complex as programs focus on cooperative engagement and capacity-building. The challenge lies in developing metrics for partner capabilities and relationships established. The State Department's EXBS program uses a Rating Assessment Tool with a 419-point survey to measure progress in partner countries' strategic trade control systems, effectiveness of prior assistance activities, and areas needing improvement. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 mandated DOD to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to review the effectiveness of EXBS assistance programs. The National Academy's report highlighted challenges in measuring success and reducing threats to U.S. national security in capacity-building and scientist engagement programs. The NAS report emphasizes the need for clear, measurable objectives in EXBS assistance programs to align with U.S. national security goals. Measuring success can be complicated by changing objectives and steps. The value of personal relationships and cooperation may be challenging to capture. Partner countries and projects are chosen based on proliferation risk assessment before initiation. The United States is shifting focus to global security engagement, emphasizing the importance of identifying threats and prioritizing work based on risk in program management. Congress is seeking metrics to measure the impact and effectiveness of DOD's CTR activities, ensuring transparency and accountability in the use of U.S. funds for assistance to Russia. Russia limited access and transparency to protect sensitive facilities, hindering cooperative biological and nuclear engagement programs with the United States. Concerns about U.S. demands for access and transparency were raised in discussions on the future of the CTR umbrella agreement. Russian officials argue that the current provisions in the CTR umbrella agreement give the United States extensive access to Russian facilities and forces without offering similar access to the U.S., which they see as unfair. They seek a more balanced approach in any future agreement, considering Russia's improved financial position and desire to be treated as a partner in security programs. However, there are limitations on how much the U.S. can change the access and transparency provisions due to DOD contracting rules. The umbrella agreement between the United States and Russia includes provisions for access and transparency in threat reduction programs. Russia's desire for more balanced access due to financial improvements is hindered by DOD contracting rules. The level of access and transparency required for threat reduction programs may vary depending on the country's possession of WMDs. Working with nuclear-armed states like India, Pakistan, and China presents greater challenges in this regard. The \"cooperative engagement\" model for threat reduction programs may face legal or procedural barriers, especially if partner countries are sensitive about working with U.S. government agencies. Different federal agencies may lead projects in such cases. There is consensus on the potential proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to rogue nations or terrorists. The United States sought international cooperation to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction after the 9/11 attacks. The G-8 Global Partnership was established in 2002 to address this global threat, with the US pledging $10 billion over 10 years. The United States, through the 10+10 over 10 program, pledged $10 billion over 10 years for threat reduction programs in Russia. Other G-8 nations also committed to providing up to $10 billion over the same period, with Russia pledging $2 billion. Global Partnership funding has totaled $21 billion since 2002, with an additional $10 billion promised by the US for 2012-2022. Russia and other recipients must adhere to guidelines for monitoring, auditing, and transparency. The Global Partnership program, initiated in 2002 by G-8 leaders, focuses on threat reduction and nonproliferation programs worldwide. It includes 27 members such as Canada, France, Germany, and the United States, with Mexico joining in 2012. The program ensures free assistance for donor countries, liability protections, and access for donor representatives at work sites. The Global Partnership program, initiated in 2002 by G-8 leaders, focuses on threat reduction and nonproliferation programs worldwide. It includes 27 members such as Canada, France, Germany, and the United States, with Mexico joining in 2012. The program coordinates activities with international organizations and prioritizes projects like destruction of chemical weapons, dismantlement of nuclear submarines, and employment of former weapons scientists. Each nation allocates funds to high-priority projects independently. The Global Partnership program, initiated in 2002 by G-8 leaders, focuses on threat reduction and nonproliferation programs worldwide. Partners share project information through the annual publication of the GP Annex. The United States advocated for expanded funding in biosecurity and promoted the expansion of the Partnership to new regions during its 2012 G8 GP chairmanship. Mexico joined in December 2012, becoming the first Latin American state to participate. The US also created a sub-working group on biological security under its 2012 chairmanship. The Global Partnership program, initiated in 2002 by G-8 leaders, focuses on threat reduction and nonproliferation programs worldwide. Under its 2012 chairmanship, the United States created a sub-working group on biological security to encourage and coordinate projects in this area. The United Kingdom's 2013 presidency focused on increasing projects, expanding GP membership, strengthening information security, and implementing UN Security Council Resolution 1540. Russia's planned G8 presidency in 2014 was cancelled after the remaining seven nations suspended Russia's participation in response to its annexation of Crimea and aggression against Ukraine. The G-7 participants reaffirmed their commitment to the Global Partnership in their Declaration on Non-Proliferation and Disarmament for 2014, highlighting the program's expansion to include additional nations around the world. No references were made to continuing or future efforts to support programs in Russia. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it had over 11,000 warheads deployed on land-based ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers in four former Soviet republics. Russia agreed to reduce its nuclear forces under the START treaty, with assistance from the U.S. CTR program. The United States provided financial and technical assistance through the CTR program to help deactivate and dismantle missiles, launchers, submarines, and bombers in former Soviet republics. The program helped deactivate thousands of warheads, missiles, launchers, bombers, and submarines. The work is mostly complete, and the Memorandum of Understanding governing these projects has expired. The United States no longer supports strategic launcher and missile elimination in Russia. The United States assisted Russia in eliminating various types of missiles and launchers through the CTR program. Funding supported dismantlement activities for SS-18, SS-19, SS-20, SS-25, SS-24 ICBMs, and Russian submarines. In Ukraine, efforts were made to eliminate rocket motors from SS-24 ICBMs. However, funding for this project area was not requested in FY2006 due to disagreements on the elimination method. The United States and Ukraine have resumed funding for the elimination of rocket motors from SS-24 missiles. Ukraine is financing the construction of a water washout facility, while the US plans to purchase the casings after the propellant is removed. The US has helped Ukraine start an elimination facility, which opened in May 2013. Congress has allocated $50-70 million annually for arms elimination, with the US committing to support Ukraine until all motors are eliminated. The Obama Administration requested $23.3 million for strategic offensive arms elimination activities in Russia and Ukraine in FY2013. Funding for this project area decreased to $10 million in FY2014 due to completion of activities required by the New START Treaty. Operations ceased in June 2013 as the MOU governing the programs expired. The Senate Armed Services Committee reduced funding to $5.7 million in its version of the FY2014 Defense Authorization Bill. The Senate Armed Services Committee reduced funding for strategic offensive arms elimination projects in Russia and Ukraine to $5.7 million. The committee also allocated $75 million from programs in Russia to CTR nonproliferation efforts in the Middle East, specifically related to Syrian chemical weapons. The Obama Administration requested minimal funding for the program in Ukraine in FY2015 and FY2016. DOD restructured its CTR program areas in the FY2012 budget, creating a new program area called Global Nuclear Security. The Global Nuclear Security program aims to enhance training for nuclear security and material control. Funding for the program decreased from $164.5 million in FY2011 to $86.5 million in FY2014. The focus of the program is shifting to nations outside the former Soviet Union, with an emphasis on global cooperation. Many projects funded by the program concluded in mid-2013. The Global Nuclear Security program funding decreased from $164.5 million in FY2011 to $86.5 million in FY2014, with a shift towards global cooperation. Projects funded concluded in mid-2013, leading to a decrease in funding to $19.4 million in FY2014. DOD requested $20.7 million for FY2015 and $20.6 million for FY2016, with $3 million allocated to projects in Russia for nuclear security. Funding will support nuclear security centers, with a focus on transporting spent naval fuel in Russia. Russia. The remaining funds in this program area will support nuclear security centers of excellence, provide equipment and training for partner countries to secure nuclear material, and enhance nuclear security capabilities for key functions like secure transportation and emergency response. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, nuclear weapons were spread among four states, with the United States assisting Russia in improving the safety and security of nuclear weapons in transit. The program provided assistance to enhance the safety and security of transporting nuclear weapons from deployment to storage or dismantlement facilities. The United States supported the transportation of approximately 48 trainloads of deactivated nuclear warheads from deployed locations to enhanced security storage sites or dismantlement facilities. The CTR program has helped Russia improve security at storage facilities for nuclear warheads, transitioning transportation security projects to the Russian Ministry of Defense in 2013. DOD enhanced security at various storage sites, including national stockpile storage sites and smaller sites at military bases. Upgrades included perimeter fencing and alarm systems. The Department of Energy has addressed security needs at storage sites for nuclear warheads, including upgrades such as fencing and alarm systems. Russia initially slowed down security efforts by not providing information on sites needing upgrades, but agreements in 2003 allowed the US some access for planning security installations. In 2005, Presidents Bush and Putin pledged to accelerate work on weapons storage security. Bush and Putin agreed to accelerate work on weapons storage security. The United States provided assistance at 15 sites, completing security upgrades by the end of 2008. DOD established a Security Assistance Training Center to train Russian students in maintaining security upgrades. Between FY1995 and FY2011, Congress appropriated around $840 million for weapons storage security. Funding peaked in FY2006 at $74.1 million, with additional funding requested in the FY2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations package. Funding has since declined to $10 million-$20 million per year as DOD completed many accelerated projects. In FY2014, DOD indicated it would continue to help Russia build capacity for weapons storage security. DOD continued to assist Russia in enhancing security at nuclear weapons storage sites and rail transfer points. The effort transitioned to the Russian Ministry of Defense in 2013 after the CTR program expired. DOE's MPC&A program upgraded security at nuclear sites by installing enhanced security systems, including rapid upgrades like hardened doors and windows. The U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) identified 105 nuclear sites with 243 buildings that needed security upgrades, including monitoring systems, guard force relocation, and electronic access control. These sites include Russian Navy and Strategic Rocket Forces facilities responsible for warhead security. The MPC&A program supported security enhancements at Russian nuclear sites, including Navy warhead and fuel storage sites. DOE completed upgrades at all naval nuclear fuel storage sites by 2004 and warhead sites by 2009, with continued assistance until 2013 for sustainability. Training and maintenance were provided to ensure long-term security. DOE worked with Russia to install security upgrades at 25 sites on 11 SRF bases, completing the work ahead of schedule in late October 2007. Upgrades were also done at nine sites under the 12th Main Directorate, with the process based on agreements with Russia's Navy. Congress allocated $367.6 million for security upgrades at Russian Navy sites and $675 million for SRF sites between FY2002 and FY2012. Funding for naval sites decreased in the mid-2000s. Funding for security upgrades at Russian Navy sites and SRF sites fluctuated between FY2002 and FY2012. The budget for naval sites declined in the mid-2000s but increased towards the end of the decade for sustainment activities. Similarly, funding for SRF sites peaked in FY2007 and then declined in FY2009, reflecting completion of upgrades. Budgets for both types of sites increased in FY2010-FY2012 to support sustainment and training programs. The Obama Administration requested $8.3 million for security projects at Russian Navy sites and SRF sites in FY2013, but funding remained at $59.5 million in FY2012. The funding was used for training centers, maintenance, and replacing outdated security equipment. In FY2014, DOE combined funding for these projects into a new category called \"Nuclear Warhead Protection\" with a budget of $23.2 million for training, workshops, and sustainability initiatives. Funding declined in recent years due to completion of security projects and a shift to sustainment efforts. In FY2015, DOE did not request additional funding for security projects due to Russia's MOD no longer participating in threat reduction activities. In FY2016, DOE moved security upgrade programs to the International Nuclear Security portion of the Global Material Security program area, with no plans for further projects. Russia inherited over 30,000 nuclear warheads from the Soviet Union and is dismantling them with assistance from DOD's CTR program. The program helped Russia improve security for fissile materials and build a secure storage facility at Mayak. Russia inherited over 30,000 nuclear warheads from the Soviet Union and is dismantling them with assistance from DOD's CTR program. The program helped improve security for fissile materials and build a secure storage facility at Mayak, which can hold the equivalent of fissile material from 25,000 nuclear warheads. DOE has helped Russia enhance security at sites housing a significant portion of the former Soviet Union's weapons-usable nuclear materials, including 11 sites in the Rosatom weapons complex and 31 civilian sites. DOE installed security upgrades at Rosatom sites and civilian nuclear sites in the former Soviet Union, housing weapons-usable materials. Funding and cooperation increased during the Bush Administration, with over $765 million allocated for Rosatom sites and $447 million for civilian sites between FY2002 and FY2012. Upgrades were completed at most facilities, including research facilities with nuclear reactors. The Obama Administration requested reduced funding for security upgrades at Rosatom sites in FY2015, with a further decline in FY2016 as projects neared completion. This decrease was due to completed sustainability efforts at certain Russian sites and upgrades in Belarus and sustainability activities in Kazakhstan. The Obama Administration did not request additional funds for the civilian sites program in FY2014 and FY2015, as it is now part of the Materials Consolidation and Civilian Sites program area. The DOE's reorganization in its FY2016 budget request included Weapons Material Protection, Material Consolidation and Civilian Sites, and National Infrastructure and Sustainability under the International Nuclear Security effort within the Global Material Security Program area. The Materials Consolidation and Conversion Program supports efforts to consolidate Russian nuclear materials and convert them to less attractive forms. Congress appropriated $243.4 million for this program area. The Obama Administration requested $17 million in FY2013 for materials for nuclear weapons. In FY2014, DOE combined this program with MPC&A efforts at civilian sites in a new Materials Consolidation and Civilian Sites program, requesting $132.3 million. The budget increase of $58.9 million aimed to expand efforts in Russia and support MPC&A activities in countries outside Russia, including former Soviet states. In FY2016, DOE requested $116.6 million for Material Consolidation and Civilian sites projects in former Soviet states outside Russia. The Global Material Security program area aims to find partnership opportunities with Russia, but new joint projects seem unlikely after Russia's withdrawal from cooperative programs. The MPC&A budget also supports building infrastructure in Russia for sustained operations after upgrades. The program operates regional technical support facilities for equipment maintenance and training programs. Congress appropriated $586.7 million between FY2002 and FY2012, with $37.8 million for FY2014 and $32.3 million for FY2015. Funding declined to $1.3 million in FY2016, supporting projects for long-term MPC&A operations in Russia and other countries. Efforts are being coordinated to establish Nuclear Security Centers of Excellence worldwide. The Nuclear Security Centers of Excellence initiative was established to enhance countries' training capabilities in nuclear security. The US has provided technical support to centers in Japan and South Korea, and is also supporting the establishment of a center in Beijing, China. Additionally, nuclear security engagement is being pursued with India to develop a partnership through India's Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership. The US is involved in nuclear security efforts, focusing on best practices through workshops and training. Congress has placed limitations on funding for Centers of Excellence in non-former Soviet Union countries. The DOD Global Nuclear Security request for FY2015 was $20.7 million, while the DOE request for the IMPC program was $138.6 million. Funding details are not specified in agency budget requests. Since its establishment in 2004, DOE/NNSA's Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) has focused on securing and removing nuclear and radiological materials worldwide to prevent terrorists from obtaining them. The program repatriates highly enriched uranium (HEU) from research reactors in third countries, converting some reactors to operate with low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) converts reactors to use low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel, enhancing security. GTRI also enhances physical security at nuclear sites, recovers radioactive sources, and has seen budget fluctuations over the years due to congressional support and international agreements. The FY2015 budget request for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) decreased funding, citing program success in material removal. Critics question the lower priority given to the program and call for additional funds for radiological security projects. International donors have supported GTRI activities in the past, and the program components are divided between material protection and elimination in the FY2016 budget request. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) has successfully converted 49 HEU research reactors to LEU fuel or verified their shutdown in 25 countries. They have also verified the cessation of HEU targets for isotope production in Indonesia and established partnerships for producing medical isotope molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) without HEU. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative has removed 4,100 kg of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, eliminated HEU from 23 countries, recovered over 32,000 radiological sources domestically, and prevented smuggling of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons-related materials. U.S. programs focus on strengthening border controls and export control systems. The Departments of State, Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security manage cooperative programs with countries worldwide to prevent illicit transfer of WMD technology. The State Department's EXBS program helps nations improve their ability to interdict nuclear smuggling and stop illicit trafficking of materials for weapons of mass destruction. The program builds capacity to ensure transfer authorizations support legitimate trade and detect illicit transfers at borders. The United States designs nation-specific plans for border control assistance in four key areas. The EXBS program helps recipient nations establish legal and regulatory basis for export controls, develop licensing procedures, enhance enforcement capabilities, provide detection equipment and training, and promote government-industry interaction. Funding initially focused on former Soviet Union but has expanded globally in recent years. The EXBS program, initially focused on the former Soviet Union, has expanded globally. Funding allocation has shifted over the years, with the Obama Administration seeking slight increases annually. The Nuclear Smuggling Outreach Initiative aims to enhance countries' ability to detect and prosecute nuclear smuggling. The Nuclear Smuggling Outreach Initiative (NSOI) is a program funded through the State Department's WMD Terrorism program. It aims to strengthen countries' capacity to detect and prosecute nuclear trafficking incidents. Partner countries include a wide range of states, and the program collaborates with various donor countries and organizations. The Obama Administration has requested $5 million for the WMD program. The Obama Administration has requested funding for the WMD Terrorism program, including NSOI and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. The Proliferation Prevention Program has cooperated with several countries to improve border controls and establish WMD monitoring capabilities. The Proliferation Prevention Program began in Uzbekistan in 2008 and expanded to Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan to enhance WMD surveillance and interdiction along their borders. The program later partnered with countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East to train and equip border security staff to prevent the unauthorized movement of weapons across borders. Secretary Hagel mentioned a $70 million funding for these efforts in 2013. The Proliferation Prevention Program received funding of $70 million in 2013 to prevent the transfer of weapons of mass destruction across Jordan's border with Syria. The program's budget grew to between $80 million and $120 million per year in recent years, with funding decreasing to $87.3 million in FY2013 and increasing to $110.4 million in FY2014 to support projects in Jordan. The Proliferation Prevention Program in Jordan received increased funding in recent years, with a FY2014 reprogramming action adding $21 million to complete postponed projects. The FY2015 request declined to $40.7 million, and the Obama Administration requested $40 million for FY2016. The Second Line of Defense program aims to improve nuclear smuggling detection capabilities at international borders through the SLD Core Program and the Megaports Program, working with partner countries worldwide. The Second Line of Defense program enhances nuclear smuggling detection at international borders by providing radiation detection systems to partner countries. It aims to strengthen their capability to deter, detect, and interdict illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. The program has signed agreements with 24 countries and deployed systems at over 449 priority sites by 2013. In FY2004, Congress added $28 million to the Second Line of Defense program for the Megaports initiative, deploying radiation detectors at major foreign seaports handling 70% of US-bound container traffic. The Megaports Initiative aims to detect nuclear or radioactive materials trafficking and has agreements with 35 partner countries. A strategic review in FY2013 recommended addressing fixed detection gaps, expanding mobile detection, and ensuring full funding for sustainability. The funding for the SLD Core Program and Megaports declined from $271 million in FY2013 to $117.7 million in FY2015. The decrease was attributed to a one-time funding increase in FY2014 and adjustments for higher NNSA priorities in FY2015. In FY2016, the Second Line of Defense program was moved to the Nuclear Smuggling, Detection, and Deterrence portion of the Global Material Security program area with an additional $142.5 million requested for the program. In FY2016, an additional $142.5 million was requested for the Second Line of Defense program to install radiation detectors. Congress debated funding for fixed radiation detectors, with some arguing they were ineffective while others believed they could deter smuggling. The final FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act restricted the use of funds for fixed site radiological portal monitors. The Defense Authorization Act (S. 1356, Sec 3122) restricts funds for installing fixed site radiological portal monitors in foreign countries until a report assesses their effectiveness in addressing nuclear nonproliferation and smuggling threats. The legislation also requires a plan for transitioning the monitors to be sustained by the host countries. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implements initiatives like the Container Security Initiative and the Secure Freight Initiative to enhance nuclear material detection during shipping. DHS collaborates with the DOE Megaports Initiative and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) to screen high-risk cargo in foreign ports. CSI operates in 58 ports across 35 countries, screening over 80% of maritime cargo bound for the United States. DHS allocated $81 million in FY2012 and $75 million in FY2013 for this program. The Secure Freight Initiative, jointly implemented with the Department of Energy, aims to enhance nuclear material detection during shipping. DHS requested funding for FY2014-2016 but received varying amounts. The initiative provides additional capacity to select CSI ports for 100 percent scanning, with Qasim, Pakistan being the only port currently doing so. Russia, after joining the Chemical Weapons Convention, declared a stockpile of 40,000 metric tons of chemical weapons stored at seven sites. Russia declared a stockpile of 40,000 metric tons of chemical weapons stored at seven sites. Five sites contain nerve agents in bombs and artillery shells, while three sites have bulk stocks of blister agents. Russia committed to eliminating the stocks by 2012 under the CWC, with assistance from the international community due to financial constraints. Destruction facilities were constructed at Gorny and Shchuch'ye with help from Germany and the United States, respectively. Russia plans to complete destruction by December 2015. The CTR-financed destruction facility at Shchuch'ye destroyed nearly half of Russia's stockpile of nerve agent-filled artillery shells, totaling around 5,450 metric tons. The majority of DOD's $1 billion funding supported the facility's design, construction, equipment installation, and personnel training. Construction began in March 2003 with the goal of completing operations by the end of 2008 to meet the 2012 deadline for stockpile destruction. However, the schedule slipped, and the process has been slower than planned. The facility at Shchuch'ye began operations in March 2009, with DOD requesting funding for technical support until July 2013. The CTR program also provided assistance to Russia's chemical weapons destruction facility at Kizner, which started operations in late 2013. FY2015 and FY2016 budget requests did not include funds for chemical weapons destruction technical support in Russia. The CTR program has also assisted Albania in destroying its chemical weapons stocks and is currently helping Libya eliminate legacy chemical weapons from the Qadhafi era. The CTR program, in partnership with the German government, focuses on safety and security upgrades at the Ruwagha Chemical Weapons Storage Facility. Significant efforts were made in FY2014-15 for the removal and destruction of Syrian chemical weapons. The DOD CTR program has been a major contributor to international efforts. Cooperation between the US and Russia on chemical weapons destruction ended with the expiration of the Umbrella Agreement. Work in Libya and Syria concluded in FY2014 and FY2015 respectively. No additional funding was requested for Syria in subsequent years. The DOD CTR biological threat reduction program has evolved over the past 20 years, with a budget request of $942,000 in FY2016. It has expanded geographically to promote best practices in physical security and safety at biological laboratories and develop disease surveillance systems in various regions. The DOD CTR biological threat reduction program has evolved over the past 20 years, expanding geographically to promote best practices in physical security and safety at biological laboratories and develop disease surveillance systems in various regions, particularly Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The program's name has changed to Cooperative Biological Engagement (CBE) to reflect partner countries' sensitivities, with Congress concerned about measuring its effectiveness. Section 1303 of the FY2012 NDAA set a limitation on funds for the CBE program until certifications by the Secretary of Defense are provided regarding its effectiveness in countering the threat of state and non-state actors worldwide. The CBE program aims to counter the threat of biological weapons by destroying or securing biological agents at their source and enhancing disease outbreak detection capabilities. The DOD's CTR program collaborates with various entities to implement this strategy, while the Department of State funds bio-security programs focusing on scientist training, biosafety, and industry partnerships. The State Department's Biosecurity Engagement Program focuses on preventing terrorist access to dangerous pathogens in high-risk countries like Pakistan, Turkey, and Iraq. Concerns about the potential proliferation of biological weapons and materials from Russia have been addressed since the Soviet Union's large biological weapons program. Russia continued to develop biological agents into the 1990s, despite deteriorating security systems. The United States provided CTR assistance to improve safety at Russian biological weapons sites and support unemployed scientists. Biological pathogens pose a proliferation risk due to easy transport. The CTR program supported four BTR programs in Russia at numerous weapons facilities. The United States provided CTR assistance to improve safety at Russian biological weapons sites and support unemployed scientists through four BTR programs in Russia. DOD funded physical security upgrades at some facilities, but access to key military biological facilities was limited, hindering the scope of programs. Cooperative biodefense research projects were carried out through the ISTC due to the inability to reach implementing agreements with Russian ministries. The closure of the Moscow ISTC has halted new projects in Russia through that mechanism. The Obama Administration continues to prioritize cooperation with Russia and Uzbekistan in the DoD Cooperative Biological Engagement Program, despite limited activities in these countries. The CTR program plans to allocate $2.4 million in FY2015 for CBE programs in Russia. Former Soviet Union states have been cooperative in dismantling Soviet biological weapons legacy. Abandoned facilities in these countries posed dangers due to unknown pathogen collections. The United States provided assistance to former Soviet Union countries to secure dangerous pathogen collections left in abandoned facilities. The CTR program supported activities in several countries to dismantle biological weapons production complexes and decontaminate testing sites. The CTR program has established secure Central Reference Laboratories in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan, with upgrades completed at 39 \"Secured Labs\" in Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. The program aims to improve security and disease surveillance in Central Asia, where natural disease outbreaks and zoonotic diseases are common. As the region faces challenges with limited resources and the emergence of militant Islamic groups, a new generation of experts will need to manage public health and biosecurity programs. The former Soviet Union has seen a rise in militant Islamic groups, raising concerns about terrorist access to biological pathogens. The DOD plans to continue bio-engagement efforts in the region, including biosafety and biosecurity equipment upgrades, disease detection enhancements, and completing various projects in Kazakhstan, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. The Global Cooperative Biological Engagement program has also expanded to Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East. The DOD's Cooperative Biological Engagement program has expanded to Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East in recent years. It assesses security and safety at facilities with dangerous pathogens, provides training, and helps countries build disease surveillance systems. This effort is not only for public health reasons but also to protect U.S. troops deployed overseas. The program works with various U.S. agencies and Combatant Commands to address the evolving threat landscape. Director Kenneth Myers highlighted the evolving threat landscape, with groups shifting focus to new geographic areas for WMD sources. The Cooperative Biological Engagement Program secures pathogens for diseases like Ebola and Anthrax. The program aims to initiate bio-engagement efforts in select areas of Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia to contain outbreaks like Ebola. The CBE program contributed to containing the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, while enhancing biosurveillance in multiple African countries. Proposed activities in FY2016 include laboratory equipment upgrades and training in various countries in Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. Between FY1997 and FY2015, Congress appropriated around $2.4 billion to DOD for biological threat reduction projects, with significant increases in funding levels in recent years. The largest increase in funding was seen between FY2007 and FY2008, reflecting growing concerns about biological weapons proliferation. Senator Richard Lugar sought to add $100 million for additional bio-safety and bio-security assistance. Senator Richard Lugar pushed for increased funding for the CTR program in FY2008, with the Senate ultimately adding $50 million. Concerns were raised in Congress about DOD's role in biological engagement and potential neglect of other programs. The House Armed Services Committee called for stronger biological threat reduction efforts and interagency coordination. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, experts feared that scientists from Russia's nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons programs might sell their knowledge. Many of these scientists lost their jobs due to economic and political crises, leading to concerns about proliferation of weapons-related materials and expertise. Budget cuts affected civilian research science programs in Russia, leading to scientists facing income declines. The State Department and Department of Energy implemented programs to prevent weapons scientists from selling their knowledge. These programs now focus on preventing terrorists from exploiting scientists and materials for weapon development through shared best practices and training. The State Department's Global Threat Reduction Program supports international science centers and scientist engagement programs focused on redirecting former weapons scientists to civilian work through grants or industry partnerships. The programs also train lab personnel about international security standards and improve personnel reliability programs to address the \"insider threat.\" The State Department's Global Threat Reduction Program focuses on security training programs for scientists and partnerships with U.S. biotech and pharmaceutical companies. The programs have shifted from funding nuclear scientists in Russia to supporting biologists and chemists with expertise in security-related areas. Additionally, the programs have expanded beyond the former Soviet Union to engage scientists in countries like Iraq, Libya, Indonesia, Yemen, Egypt, and Pakistan. The Global Threat Reduction Program focuses on security training for laboratories handling sensitive nuclear material, biological agents, and chemicals in countries like Indonesia, Yemen, Egypt, and Pakistan. The International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) and Science and Technology Center in Ukraine (STCU) were established in the 1990s with support from various countries, funding 2,702 proposals totaling $836.5 million by 2010. The ISTC has funded 2,702 proposals totaling $836.5 million since its inception, with the United States contributing about $220 million. Russia withdrew from participation in the center in 2010, leading to a shift in headquarters to Kazakhstan. The Biological Weapons Redirection Program redirects scientists to non-military projects with support from the United States. The STCU collaborates with U.S. agencies to provide grants to scientists in several countries. Eligibility requirements have broadened over the years, with a focus on former weapon scientists. The Iraq Scientist Engagement Program engages Iraqi scientists with WMD skills. The Iraq Scientist Engagement Program supports former Iraqi WMD scientists in transitioning to civilian careers through partnerships, training, and grants. The program was established after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 to prevent the proliferation of weapons expertise. The United States allocated $31 million to this program between FY2002 and FY2010. The Iraqi Scientist Engagement Program was established after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 to prevent the proliferation of weapons expertise. It supported former Iraqi WMD scientists in transitioning to civilian careers through partnerships, training, and grants. The program faced challenges in matching scientists to civilian work and was eventually phased out. In 2009, the State Department established the Iraqi Scientist Engagement Program to train scientists and improve security at facilities with dangerous materials. Additionally, the State Department managed a scientist redirection program in Libya from 2004 to 2010 to support former WMD scientists in transitioning to civilian work. The Libyan Scientist Engagement Program (LSEP) aimed to transition scientists from the Tajoura Nuclear Research Center to civilian work through partnerships. Funding fluctuated over the years, with $8 million spent from 2004 to 2010. The program resumed after the civil war, focusing on promoting nuclear security culture and improving biorisk management in Libya. The State Department collaborated with Libyan researchers to address threats and enhance disease outbreak response capabilities. In the 1990s, the Department of Energy initiated programs to retrain scientists and engineers from the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons enterprise to prevent knowledge leakage. The programs aimed to help Russia reduce its nuclear weapons complex and create sustainable non-weapons-related work for scientists. The programs evolved over time to address concerns about scientists working with CBRN materials, expanding beyond the former Soviet Union. The Department of Energy established programs in the 1990s to retrain scientists from the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons enterprise to prevent knowledge leakage. The programs evolved over time to address global engagement, with name changes reflecting this shift. The Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) Program was funded in 1994, matching U.S. weapons labs with scientists. The Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) Program was established in 1994 to match U.S. weapons labs and industry with Russian weapons scientists for cooperative research projects with commercial potential. The program received $35 million in funding before moving to the Department of Energy, establishing nearly 200 research projects by 1995. However, a 1999 report raised concerns about the program's oversight and funding distribution, with nearly half of the funds being spent at U.S. nuclear weapons labs and Russian institutes receiving only around one-third of the funds. The DOE's oversight of the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) Program was questioned due to lack of knowledge on scientist recipients and lack of commercial successes. Congress responded by reducing funding, limiting spending at U.S. labs, and requiring agreements with Russia to prevent taxes. A subsequent report in 2007 found that DOE had overstated the number of supported scientists and job creation from the program. The DOE's oversight of the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) Program was criticized for overstating job creation and lacking an exit strategy. The program was reorganized to prioritize projects with commercial potential and expand globally. The Nuclear Cities Initiative aimed to bring commercial enterprises to Russia's closed nuclear cities to prevent proliferation. Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of the NCI program. The NCI program, which aimed to address employment problems in Russia's closed nuclear cities, received nearly $87 million between FY1999 and FY2003 before being absorbed into the Russian Transition Initiative. The program underwent several name changes to reflect different partnerships, with the Bush Administration requesting around $40 million per year for the program in FY2005 and FY2006. By FY2006, the Administration planned to phase out the NCI programs in Russia's closed cities. The funding levels for the GIPP/GSSP programs in Russia's closed cities declined from around $40 million per year during the last years of the Bush Administration to around $15 million per year in recent years. The Administration requested $13 million for FY2014, but no funds were appropriated as DOE shifted resources to nations outside the former Soviet Union. Concerns have grown about scientists in other nations, with the Department of Energy noting in a 2010 review the \"WMD expertise\" among them. In 2010, the Department of Energy found that the \"WMD expertise proliferation threat\" extends beyond the former Soviet Union. The program was renamed Global Security for Science Engagement (GSSP) in FY2013 to address this threat globally. Activities have increased in non-Russian states and Iraq, engaging over 200 Iraqi scientists on various projects. The Global Security for Science Engagement (GSSP) program engaged over 200 Iraqi scientists in R&D projects in various areas with a budget of $7 million between FY2006 and FY2012. The DOE requested $13 million for the program in FY2014, but no funds were allocated. The NNSA FY015 budget stated that the GSSP program was not established, but its knowledge security curriculum will be integrated into other programs."
