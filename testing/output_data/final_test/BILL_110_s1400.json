    "content": "The \"Student Information Means a Positive Loan Experience Act of 2007\" aims to enhance repayment plans for borrowers of loans under the Higher Education Act of 1965. It also seeks to improve borrowers' understanding of repayment options, loan cancellation or forgiveness conditions, and the impact of deferments, forbearance, and consolidation on loan balances and total interest paid. The \"Student Loan Requirements\" and \"FFEL Repayment Plans\" sections of the Higher Education Act of 1965 are being amended to include options for delaying repayment or principal for the first 2 years of the repayment period. The changes aim to improve borrowers' understanding of repayment options and ensure informed agreement between lenders and borrowers. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is being amended to include an extended repayment plan for new borrowers accumulating over $20,000 in loans, with a fixed annual or graduated repayment amount over a maximum of 25 years. Additionally, lenders must offer new borrowers the option to delay repayment or principal for the first 2 years. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to allow new borrowers to delay repayment of principal for the first 2 years, regardless of the repayment plan chosen. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to allow new borrowers the option to delay repayment of principal for the first 2 years, starting from October 7, 1998. SEC. 4. REVISED DEFINITION OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to change the definition of economic hardship for student loans. SEC. 5. USEFUL AND COMPREHENSIVE STUDENT LOAN INFORMATION FOR BORROWERS. Provides borrowers with comprehensive student loan information. Amendment to insurance program agreements under the Higher Education Act of 1965 includes providing borrowers with information on the impact of interest capitalization. Amendment to Guaranty Agreements under the Higher Education Act of 1965 requires lenders to provide borrowers with information on interest capitalization and maintain regular contact with them. The borrower must be contacted every 180 days during forbearance to provide updates on unpaid principal, accrued interest, interest accrual, capitalization details, and borrower's options. The borrower's ability to pay accrued interest before capitalization and the option to end forbearance at any time are key considerations. Lender agreements must include providing information on the impact of loan consolidation upon application for a consolidation loan. Consolidation considerations include total interest and fees, repayment length, potential loss of loan benefits, and impact on Federal Perkins Loan. Borrowers lose interest-free periods when adding Perkins Loan to consolidation. The borrower may lose interest-free periods and eligibility for cancellation of a Federal Perkins loan if they consolidate their loans. The borrower is informed about the ability to prepay, change repayment plans, varying borrower benefit programs, consequences of default, and the non-obligation to accept a consolidation loan. Information dissemination regarding loan consolidation is also addressed in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require eligible institutions to provide counseling to borrowers of loans under parts B, D, and E before completion of their course of study or departure from the institution. The Higher Education Act of 1965 now mandates eligible institutions to offer counseling to borrowers of loans under parts B, D, and E. This counseling includes information on repayment plans, debt management strategies, prepayment options, and the ability to change repayment plans. The counseling required by the Higher Education Act of 1965 for borrowers of loans includes details on forgiveness, deferment, forbearance, default consequences, and consolidation loan effects. The Higher Education Act of 1965 requires counseling for borrowers on loan forgiveness, deferment, forbearance, default consequences, and consolidation effects, including interest, fees, repayment length, underlying loan benefits, prepayment options, and borrower benefit program variations. Borrowers are also informed about the National Student Loan Data System for loan status information. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to update a section related to borrower's loans. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require an annual briefing on the enforcement of student loan provisions."
