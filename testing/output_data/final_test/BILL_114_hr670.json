The \"Special Needs Trust Fairness and Medicaid Improvement Act\" amends Section 1917(d)(4)(A) of the Social Security Act to ensure fairness in Medicaid supplemental needs trusts. It also includes Medicaid coverage of tobacco cessation services for mothers of newborns. The amendment applies to trusts established after the enactment of the Act. The Social Security Act is amended to extend Medicaid coverage for pregnant women for up to one year after giving birth. Conforming amendments are made to ensure coverage for tobacco cessation services for pregnant women. The amendments made by this section will apply to items and services provided two years after the enactment of the Act, with an exception for State plans under title XIX of the Social Security Act. The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services will submit a report to Congress assessing the use of the tobacco cessation service benefit under the Medicaid program, including how States are promoting the benefit and identifying gaps in its delivery. The amendment eliminates federal financial participation for Medicaid expenditures on agents used for cosmetic purposes or hair growth, except when medically necessary. This change applies to calendar quarters after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, a Medicaid Improvement Fund is established. The Medicaid Improvement Fund is amended to include additional funding of $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2021 and $14,000,000 for fiscal year 2022. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 20, 2016."
