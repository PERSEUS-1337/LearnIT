It prohibited nonbanks from accepting deposits and depository institutions from affiliating with securities firms. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 separated commercial banking from investment banking to prevent risky activities. The lack of consensus on its meaning stems from changes in laws, interpretations, and economic conditions over nearly 70 years until its partial repeal in 1999. The policy debate focuses on the permissible activities of financial firms in light of associated risks. The permissible activities of financial firms are regulated to manage risks. Commercial banking is risky due to deposit withdrawals and loan defaults, mitigated by policies like deposit insurance. Securities markets are volatile, with a firm's exposure depending on proprietary trading. The Glass-Steagall debate does not aim to ban risky services. The Glass-Steagall debate revolves around allowing risky commercial and investment banking activities within firms holding federally insured deposits. The debate questions whether the repeal of parts of the Glass-Steagall Act contributed to the financial crisis, with some arguing it did while others believe it did not. The Dodd-Frank Act was Congress's response to the crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act was Congress's response to the financial crisis, including provisions to promote financial stability and reduce speculative activities of banks. Some argue that fully reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act would be a more effective way to achieve these policy objectives. Multiple bills have been proposed in this regard. The Glass-Steagall Act is being considered for reinstatement through various bills in the 114th Congress, such as S. 1709 / H.R. 3054 and H.R. 381. These bills aim to restore Glass-Steagall in different ways, reflecting a lack of consensus on its meaning. Some argue that the Act may not be suitable for the current financial system, while others believe it could prevent future financial crises. The Glass-Steagall Act was enacted in response to economic turmoil, but faced erosion and partial repeal by the GLBA. The Act's relationship with financial stability and its comparison to the Dodd-Frank Act are analyzed. The Federal Reserve System was established in 1913 to address banking issues, but many banks collapsed during the Great Depression, unable to access Fed lending facilities. During the Great Depression, small and mid-sized banks struggled to find private alternatives to Fed loans due to disruptions in securities markets. Bank depositors withdrew funds en masse, leading to severe mark-downs in securities values and causing financial firms to sell at distressed prices, exacerbating the crisis. During the Great Depression, small and mid-sized banks faced challenges finding private alternatives to Fed loans as securities markets were disrupted, leading to distressed prices. The Senate authorized an investigation, known as the Pecora Commission, which identified conflicts of interest and abuses in commercial and investment banking that contributed to the financial crisis. During the Great Depression, the Pecora Commission investigated conflicts of interest and abuses in commercial and investment banking. Affiliated investment companies of large commercial banks were used to speculate in their own stock, manipulate securities prices, and engage in activities forbidden by law. This led to violations of fiduciary duty to depositors, excessive compensation to bank officials, and encouraged speculation. Congress addressed these issues through legislative enactments from 1932-1935. The Pecora Commission identified banking and securities market issues through legislative acts from 1932-1935. These included broadening collateral for Fed loans, establishing the FHLB system, creating the FDIC, capping interest rates, and prohibiting certain bank securities activities. Some measures have been repealed or altered, while others have been continued or expanded. The Banking Act of 1933, also known as Glass-Steagall, created regulatory regimes for commercial banks and securities firms in the United States. It aimed to ensure the safer use of bank assets, regulate interbank control, and prevent funds diversion into speculative operations. The Act included sections 16, 20, 21, and 32, reinforcing a regulatory system for banks and securities firms. The Glass-Steagall Act, consisting of Sections 16, 20, 21, and 32, aimed to prevent banking firms from engaging in speculative securities operations. It addressed abuses identified by the Pecora Commission, such as commercial banks using securities affiliates for speculative activities and violating fiduciary duties to depositors. Specifically, Section 16 of the Act focused on regulating these practices. Section 16 of the Glass-Steagall Act limits national banks to engaging in banking activities and certain authorized securities dealings, distinguishing between bank eligible and bank ineligible securities. Section 20 prohibits member banks from affiliating with businesses primarily involved in securities activities. The Glass-Steagall Act, in force today in an amended form, prohibits firms from engaging in both deposit taking and investment banking, except for \"bank eligible securities\" allowed under Section 16. It also prohibits interlocking directorates between member banks and securities firms. The Act led to the separation of commercial banks and securities firms, exemplified by J.P. Morgan & Co. splitting into two distinct firms with separate boards and management. The Glass-Steagall Act led to the separation of commercial banks and securities firms, with J.P. Morgan & Co. splitting into two separate entities - a commercial banking business led by John Pierpont Morgan, Jr., and a securities firm called Morgan Stanley. The Act prohibited depository banks from competing in securities markets, but did not restrict securities firms from using securities markets to fund private debt. During the Glass-Steagall era, commercial entities and consumers could borrow through either securities markets or commercial banks. Loans could be obtained exclusively through commercial banks, exclusively through securities markets, or through a combination of both. J.P. Morgan & Co. had to split into separate entities due to the Act, with one focusing on commercial banking and the other on securities. The Act prohibited depository banks from competing in securities markets but allowed securities firms to use securities markets for private debt funding. The Glass-Steagall Act required J.P. Morgan & Co. to split into separate entities for commercial banking and securities activities. It did not aim to limit the size of banks or prevent them from becoming \"too-big-to-fail.\" During the Glass-Steagall era, the separation of commercial banking and securities activities gradually eroded due to various factors like market changes and economic challenges. This erosion was not a violation of the Glass-Steagall Act for firms like JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley to grow significantly after being separated. During the Glass-Steagall era, economic challenges led to difficulties in sustaining profitability for institutions. Regulatory features of the era, including interest rate caps on deposits, may have contributed to instability in banking and securities markets. Rising inflation in the 1970s prompted consumers and corporate clients to seek alternative investment options offered by securities firms. During the late 1980s, economic challenges led to a decline in bank deposits as firms turned to securities markets for short-term lending. Smaller commercial banks struggled with high mortgage concentrations, while lenders in oil-producing states faced high default rates. This led to a wave of depository institution failures, including smaller regional banks and thrift institutions. Securities markets also faced challenges, with the stock market crashing in 1987. During the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, economic changes led to banks and securities firms expanding their services to compete with each other. This shift resulted in calls for regulatory changes to banking and securities policies. Laws were enacted to allow banks to engage in a wider range of securities-related activities, including adding new classes of securities to the list of bank-eligible securities. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 required companies with a controlling interest in a bank to register with the Fed as bank holding companies. Bank holding companies were generally prohibited from owning nonbanking companies, except those closely related to banking activities. The OCC and Fed were empowered to interpret and enforce the Glass-Steagall Act and the BHC Act. The BHC Act's \"closely-related\" provision allowed commercial banks to engage in activities resembling securities products and services, approved by courts. In 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Investment Company Institute v. Camp challenged the OCC's authority to authorize national banks to offer pooled investment funds, paving the way for a broad reading of the Glass-Steagall Act. The OCC's authorization for banks to offer pooled investment funds was challenged by a securities industry group, questioning the scope of bank authority under the Glass-Steagall Act. The Supreme Court appeared inclined to defer to the Comptroller's interpretation of the Act, citing the principle of giving weight to regulatory agency decisions. The Court concluded that the Comptroller failed to provide an administrative interpretation of the Glass-Steagall Act, leading to the Court conducting its own interpretation. The Act reflected concerns about the hazards and financial dangers of commercial banks engaging in certain activities, outweighing potential benefits. The operation of a pooled investment fund was seen to involve subtle hazards according to Congress. The Court ruled against the OCC in a case involving the operation of a pooled investment fund, citing subtle hazards such as potential damage to the bank's reputation, pressure to rescue a failing fund, and risks of extending credit or giving poor advice. This decision influenced subsequent laws by establishing deference to the OCC's reasoned conclusions on authorized activities under the Glass-Steagall Act. After the Camp decision, the OCC and Fed provided detailed legal reasoning in their approvals of bank activities. Courts focused on the reasonableness of regulators' interpretations rather than the best interpretation. Courts generally upheld the OCC's and Fed's decisions as valid interpretations of banking laws. The OCC broadened its interpretation of bank powers under the Glass-Steagall Act Section 16 in response to requests from banks. The OCC approved banks' ability to engage in activities beyond traditional securities and insurance products under Section 16. The Supreme Court validated the OCC's legal tests in NationsBank of North Carolina v. VALIC, stating that the \"business of banking\" is not limited to enumerated powers. The Comptroller has discretion to authorize additional activities within reasonable bounds. The Comptroller's discretion in authorizing activities for national banks must be reasonable. Ventures like running a general travel agency may exceed these bounds. The OCC's interpretation of the VALIC decision affirmed its broad reading of Section 16 of the Glass-Steagall Act. Activities within this authority must be functionally equivalent to traditional banking, benefit customers, and involve similar risks. The OCC approved banks and their subsidiaries to engage in various activities, including membership in security and commodity exchanges, discount brokerage, investment advising, securities lending, IRA management, private placement of securities, brokering in options and futures, municipal bond underwriting, and dealing in derivative contracts. This includes equity derivative swap contracts. Banks were also allowed to buy and hold certain equity securities for hedging purposes. The Fed provided guidance on when a company is considered \"engaged principally\" in the securities business for Glass-Steagall Act Section 20 and what activities are \"closely related\" to banking for the BHC Act. Bank holding companies could only engage in investment banking through separately capitalized subsidiaries known as \"\u00a720 subsidiaries.\" The Fed set a limit on bank-ineligible securities activities for subsidiaries, increasing the threshold to 25% in 1996. By the time GLBA was enacted, the Fed had approved at least 41 \"\u00a720 subsidiaries\" for underwriting and dealing in various securities, as well as providing investment advice and brokering services. The Fed approved an increasing number of activities closely related to banking under the BHC Act, including securities-related activities with conditions and limitations. The distinction between agency functions for customers and transactions as principal was established to manage price-volatility risk. GLBA repealed Sections 20 and 32 of the Glass-Steagall Act, allowing affiliations between banking and securities firms and expanding bank holding companies into financial holding companies. This enabled a broader range of financial activities and ownership of nonbanking companies. GLBA authorized financial holding companies to offer universal banking services through a single ownership structure, allowing affiliations between banking and securities firms. However, it left certain restrictions in place, such as Sections 16 and 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited depository institutions from underwriting securities and engaging in proprietary trading activities. GLBA authorized financial holding companies to offer universal banking services through a single ownership structure, allowing affiliations between banking and securities firms. It continued Section 21's prohibition on accepting deposits by broker-dealers and other nonbanks. GLBA also preserved laws restricting relationships and transactions within financial holding company conglomerates. Some argue that GLBA's repeal of Glass-Steagall Act's restrictions may have contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. The Glass-Steagall Act's affiliation restrictions played a role in financial stability and the repeal of these restrictions likely impacted the recent crisis, especially the housing bubble burst. The policy aimed to reduce conflicts of interest and protect the payment system but may have led to reduced financial institution stability. Reinstating a strict separation between commercial and investment banking may not eliminate all risks to the financial system. Commercial banks are subject to regulatory caps on asset classes to diversify portfolios and prevent destabilization. However, under Glass-Steagall Act Section 16, commercial banks can invest in certain securities like U.S. Treasury securities without limitations. The Glass-Steagall Act allows commercial banks to invest in certain securities like U.S. Treasury securities without limitations, which could lead to significant losses and potential financial crises. Activity restrictions reduce the risk of destabilizing the banking market but also limit diversification. Under a Glass-Steagall-like regime, commercial banks face a tradeoff between reduced losses from securities offerings and limited ability to offset losses from core lending activities. Proponents argue that financial stability improved after Glass-Steagall was passed, citing past banking crises in the United States. The Banking Act of 1933, including the Glass-Steagall provisions and the establishment of the FDIC, reduced depositor bank runs by shoring up confidence in commercial bank deposits. The FDIC insurance provides a direct connection to reducing bank runs by insulating depositors from losses. Comparing historical records of different countries shows mixed results in financial stability, with many developed economies not separating commercial banking from investment banking. For example, Canada did not experience intense bank runs like the United States in the 19th century. Canada's financial system remained stable following World War II, avoiding the intensity of bank runs seen in the United States during the Great Depression and recent mortgage crisis. Despite not being restricted like U.S. banks by the Glass-Steagall Act, Canada still faced economic hardship during the Great Depression. European countries with universal banking also experienced relative financial stability during the same period. However, financial crises affected various European and emerging market economies in the 1990s. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 involved the expansion of mortgage-related debt, housing bubble burst in 2007, financial market illiquidity, and major financial institutions requiring emergency assistance. Various securities markets also faced disruptions during this period. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 involved the housing bubble burst, financial market illiquidity, and emergency assistance for major financial institutions. Analyzing the events requires considering the activities and regulation of banks, securities firms, and nonbanks. Some argue that the mortgage crisis could have been avoided if the Glass-Steagall Act had not been eroded and partially repealed by GLBA. This section evaluates whether the mortgage crisis could have occurred without the erosion of Glass-Steagall's separation of commercial and investment banking within a single financial conglomerate. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 involved the housing bubble burst, financial market illiquidity, and emergency assistance for major financial institutions. The erosion of the Glass-Steagall Act's separation of commercial and investment banking within a single financial conglomerate is seen as a factor that contributed to the mortgage crisis. Losses on securitized mortgages significantly impacted financial stability, leading to taxpayer support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to maintain solvency. Holding mortgages in portfolio is a core business activity for commercial banks, putting the banking system's capital at risk during the crisis. The Glass-Steagall Act did not prohibit banks from holding whole mortgages on their balance sheets, regardless of origin. Prudential regulators limited banks' exposure to mortgage-related assets due to maturity mismatch. Bank regulators encouraged securitization to remove mortgages from the banking system. Glass-Steagall Act Section 16 further limits bank acquisition of private-label assets. The Glass-Steagall Act Section 16 limits bank acquisition of private-label mortgage-backed securities, but the mortgage crisis of the 2000s still occurred despite this limitation. The erosion and repeal of Glass-Steagall Act's affiliation restrictions may not have been the primary cause of the growth of private label securitization or the rise and fall in real estate prices. The potential effects of Glass-Steagall Act on mortgage underwriting standards and firm losses involve trade-offs that could mitigate or exacerbate problems during the crisis. The Glass-Steagall Act did not directly address loan qualification standards but could impact mortgage originators' incentives. It did not aim to prevent the erosion of mortgage underwriting standards or anticipate future contingencies leading to increased mortgage defaults for commercial banks. The Glass-Steagall Act did not prevent the increase in mortgage defaults for commercial banks, as it did not address loan qualification standards or anticipate future contingencies. It limited the investment activities of commercial banks but did not stop nondepositories from extending mortgages that compete with commercial banks. The Glass-Steagall Act did not address the financial incentives of institutions involved in mortgages and securities. It focused on conflicts of interest in commercial banks but did not prevent the decline in underwriting standards attributed to nondepositories through securitization. The repeal of the Act's restrictions could have led to lower mortgage underwriting standards due to incentives associated with universal banks. One ECB study compared default rates of securities issued by universal banks with broker-dealers like Morgan Stanley. Securities from universal banks had a higher default rate. No evidence of self-dealing was found, but universal banks were found to underestimate default risk by lowering prices. Universal banks lowered prices to increase market share, potentially leading to excessive loosening of credit standards and heightened default rates. The Glass-Steagall Act's enforcement could have prevented bank-affiliated participants with higher default rates from entering the market. The financial crisis also affected broker-dealers and nonbank financial firms. The financial crisis exposed vulnerabilities in financial markets such as instability due to uncertain collateral values and maturity mismatch. The Glass-Steagall Act did not address these issues, leading to the 2007-2008 securities market crash. The 2008 financial crisis highlighted vulnerabilities in financial markets, including the risk of collateral value declines. The Reserve Primary Fund's failure to prevent its shares from falling below $1 triggered a panic in the money market fund industry, resembling a bank run. Policymakers feared that industries relying on money market funds for short-term financing would also face stress. The Department of the Treasury created a temporary program to insure money market funds in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act included provisions to reduce speculative activities of commercial banks and address sources of financial instability, similar to the objectives of the Glass-Steagall Act. The Dodd-Frank Act, including the Volcker Rule, prohibits proprietary trading by banking entities but allows customer-driven securities transactions. It applies to depository institutions, affiliates, and subsidiaries, restricting their ability to engage in risky trading activities. The Volcker Rule restricts banking entities from making investments in hedge funds and covered funds exempt from SEC or CFTC registration. The Dodd-Frank Act includes titles promoting financial stability, applying heightened prudential regulations to large banks and nonbank financial institutions. It also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor systemic risks and gave the Fed enhanced regulatory powers over systemically important banks. The Dodd-Frank Act enhances regulatory powers over systemically important financial firms, strengthens mortgage standards, and maintains restrictions on bank investments from the Glass-Steagall Act. It introduces policy tools to address financial instability beyond what the Glass-Steagall regime could handle. The Dodd-Frank Act expands regulatory powers to address financial instability in non-commercial banking sectors, providing prudential regulation for large systemic financial firms and an alternative to bankruptcy for nondepository institutions. The separation of commercial and investment banking aims to protect insured depositories from market volatility and conflicts of interest, but may reduce revenue diversification. However, it does not address regulation of investment banks in securities markets or how nonbanks use securities activities to compete with depository banks. The Glass-Steagall Act established a separation between commercial and investment banking to protect insured depositories from market volatility and conflicts of interest. However, over time, economic conditions and legislative changes eroded this separation, leading to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) which allowed for the affiliation of commercial banks with securities broker-dealers. The Dodd-Frank Act aims to promote financial stability and limit speculative activities of commercial banks through measures like the Volcker Rule, but it does not fully restore the Glass-Steagall Act. The Dodd-Frank Act aims to promote financial stability and limit speculative activities of commercial banks through measures like the Volcker Rule, but it does not completely restore the Glass-Steagall Act. Regulatory walls have historically been difficult to maintain or enforce."
