    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act\" and includes provisions for student loan repayment for public attorneys under the Higher Education Act of 1965. The \"Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act\" aims to encourage qualified individuals to work as prosecutors and public defenders. A prosecutor is a licensed attorney who handles criminal cases at the state or local level, while a public defender is also a licensed attorney employed by a state or local agency or a nonprofit organization. The \"Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act\" encourages qualified individuals to work as prosecutors and public defenders by assuming the obligation to repay student loans for those employed in defender organizations providing legal representation to indigent persons in criminal cases. The \"Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act\" offers repayment benefits to borrowers who work as prosecutors or public defenders for a specified period of time, as long as they are not in default on their loans. If a borrower voluntarily leaves their employment before the specified period, they must repay any benefits received. Failure to repay may result in the government recovering the amount owed. The Secretary has the discretion to waive recovery if it is deemed unfair. The Secretary has the discretion to waive recovery of student loan payments if it is deemed against equity or the public interest. Any repayments or recoveries will be credited back to the original appropriation account for future use. The Secretary can make student loan payments under certain conditions, with a maximum limit of $6,000 per borrower per calendar year or $40,000 in total. The Secretary is not authorized to reimburse borrowers for payments made before a certain date. The Secretary can provide repayment benefits on a first-come, first-served basis, with priority given to borrowers who have completed the required service period. Additional agreements for a successive period of service can be made between the borrower and the Secretary. The Secretary can issue regulations to implement the repayment benefits program for borrowers who have completed less than 3 years of required service. $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2006, with additional funding for future years. Loan cancellation is available for public defenders. The amendment allows for the inclusion of public defenders and full-time Federal defender attorneys in the repayment benefits program. It applies to eligible loans made before or after the enactment of the Act, and covers service as a prosecutor or public defender provided after the enactment date.
