Congress finds a crisis in developing countries regarding the availability of contraceptives for family planning, safe motherhood, and HIV/AIDS prevention. The upcoming increase in the number of young people entering their reproductive years will lead to a higher demand for contraception worldwide. The gap between the need for contraceptives and funding is expected to grow significantly. Access to modern contraceptives is crucial in reducing unintended pregnancies and abortion rates. In developing countries, over 200 million women lack access to contraceptives, leading to higher birth rates compared to the United States. Countries like Haiti, Ethiopia, and Pakistan have significant percentages of married couples without access to contraceptives. The projected cost for contraceptives is expected to reach hundreds of millions of dollars annually by 2015. The provision of modern contraceptives in developing countries could prevent millions of pregnancies, abortions, infant deaths, and pregnancy-related deaths. The White House reaffirmed its commitment to family planning assistance in 2001. Experiences in various countries show the effectiveness of long-term family planning methods. Increased use of modern contraceptives in countries like Russia, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Chile, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, and Romania has led to a significant decline in abortion rates. Condoms play a crucial role in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, with the majority of HIV infections being sexually transmitted. Condoms are crucial in preventing HIV transmission, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV prevalence is high. Family planning services and contraceptives also play a key role in reducing HIV infections between pregnant women and their infants. Access to family planning services and contraceptives can significantly reduce HIV transmission from mother to infant by 35 to 45 percent. It also helps in preventing high-risk pregnancies, reducing maternal and child mortality rates, and avoiding complications related to pregnancy and childbirth, which are leading causes of death for women in developing countries. Access to modern, safe, and effective contraceptives and reproductive health care services in developing countries is crucial to prevent pregnancy-related complications and ease population pressures on natural resources. However, there is a significant shortfall in these services, leading to rapid population growth in ecologically sensitive areas. The cost of contraceptives for family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention remains a challenge in these regions. The cost of contraceptives for family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention in developing countries is projected to increase from $954 million in 2002 to $1.8 billion in 2015. Donor support for contraceptives in 2002 was less than 20 percent of overall funding needs, leading to devastating consequences such as unintended pregnancies, induced abortions, maternal deaths, and infant deaths. The United States is commended for its leadership role in providing reproductive health services in developing countries. The United States has not increased funding for reproductive health services in developing countries despite a growing demand for contraceptives due to youth entering reproductive age and the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Bilateral assistance for family planning programs has decreased by 35 percent since 1995. Policy restrictions have also reduced donations of contraceptives for developing countries, hindering efforts to reduce the need for abortion and the spread of HIV/AIDS. The Mexico City Policy, reinstated in 2001, limits access to contraceptives by prohibiting US family planning assistance to foreign NGOs that provide abortion services or lobby for abortion rights. This policy has worsened the shortage of contraceptives in developing countries by cutting off shipments from the US to 16 countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The Mexico City Policy has led to the closure of family planning clinics in Kenya, severely disrupting women's access to contraceptives and healthcare services. The purpose of this Act is to provide assistance for contraceptives in developing countries to prevent unintended pregnancies, abortions, and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. The Act aims to provide assistance for contraceptives in developing countries to prevent unintended pregnancies, abortions, and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. Section 104 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to provide assistance for contraceptives in developing countries to prevent unintended pregnancies, abortions, and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. Nongovernmental organizations in developing countries are not subject to stricter requirements on the use of non-United States Government funds compared to foreign governments for assistance with contraceptives. $150,000,000 is authorized for each of the fiscal years 2007 and 2008 to carry out this subsection. The Reproductive Health Supplies Fund is authorized to remain available until expended and is in addition to amounts otherwise available for such purposes."
