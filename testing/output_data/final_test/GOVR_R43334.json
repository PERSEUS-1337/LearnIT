    "content": "This report responds to Congress's interest in campaign finance policy post the McCutcheon decision. It offers a preliminary analysis of key policy issues and implications for fundraising and disclosure. The report does not provide a legal analysis but highlights arguments made in the case. McCutcheon v. FEC involves a challenge to the aggregate amount an individual can contribute to federal candidates, political parties, and PACs. Alabama donor Shaun McCutcheon wanted to contribute more than the existing limits during the 2012 election cycle. The report does not address all arguments for and against contribution limits but will be updated as policy implications become clearer. In McCutcheon v. FEC, Shaun McCutcheon challenged the aggregate contribution limits enforced by the FEC. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which struck down the limits in April 2014. Individuals can now give limited contributions to an unlimited number of candidates, parties, and PACs. After the McCutcheon v. FEC decision, individuals can now contribute up to $5,200 to as many candidates as they choose, removing the previous aggregate limits on contributions. The decision also specified individual limits on contributions to single candidates, parties, or PACs during a single election. Individuals can now contribute up to $5,200 per candidate, per election, and $5,000 annually to PACs, with a total annual limit of $32,400 to national parties. Before the McCutcheon decision, aggregate limits capped individual contributions at $123,200 for 2013-2014, with $48,600 for candidates and $74,600 for parties and PACs. The decision invalidated these aggregate limits, allowing for unlimited contributions to super PACs and other political committees. The McCutcheon decision invalidated aggregate limits on individual contributions, which have been a key aspect of campaign finance policy since the 1970s. Contribution limits are meant to prevent corruption, with Congress setting individual limits to balance donor support for candidates while limiting potential corruption. The concept of the \"anti-circumvention rationale\" supports overall aggregate limits to protect against individual circumvention. Supporters argue that overall aggregate limits are necessary to prevent donors from having outsized influence in elections and policymaking, potentially corrupting the system. Opponents claim that these limits restrict political speech and association, acting as an unconstitutional spending limit. They argue that the arbitrary threshold set by aggregate contribution limits can lead to corruption. Opponents of existing limits on campaign contributions argue that aggregate limits may lead to corruption and restrict political speech. They also suggest that current regulations already protect against circumvention of individual contribution limits. Additionally, limits on contributions to parties may push donors towards less-regulated outside groups like super PACs. The implications of the McCutcheon decision on the campaign environment and related legislation remain uncertain. The McCutcheon decision has implications on campaign finance laws. Some believe existing regulations are sufficient to prevent corruption, while others argue that exceeding contribution limits could lead to corrupting influence. The decision's impact on legislation and the campaign environment is still uncertain. The McCutcheon decision has raised concerns about potential corrupting influence due to larger aggregate contributions. Donors can now contribute amounts above previous limits, leading to more money in elections overall. Observers have speculated on how donors might react to the opportunity for unlimited aggregate contributions, with scenarios including donors reallocating their spending towards candidates, parties, or PACs. Justice Breyer's dissenting opinion proposed scenarios where an individual donor could contribute up to $3.6 million to candidates and parties. One estimate suggests a single contributor could give up to $5.9 million to candidates and parties, but actual outcomes may vary. In 2012, 646 donors gave the maximum amount of $117,000. Disclosure requirements do not guarantee identification of donors who reach the limit. Political committees must report donor information to the FEC for contributions over $200, but tracking donors across committees can be challenging due to inconsistencies in reporting. To simplify donor identification, a consistent donor identification number could be considered to track individual donor activity more effectively. During Supreme Court oral argument in McCutcheon, the discussion focused on \"joint fundraising committees\" (JFCs) that act as intermediaries for contributions to multiple political committees to avoid exceeding individual limits. JFCs have been a common fundraising method for both major parties since the late 1970s, despite some controversy. During Supreme Court oral argument, discussion focused on hypothetical scenarios where a single contributor could give $3.5 million to a party joint fundraising committee for distribution to other party committees and candidates, raising concerns about outsized influence and composition of JFCs. The absence of aggregate limits to national parties could lead to contributions being directed to multiple arms of each party. After the Supreme Court's ruling in McCutcheon, contributors can now give significantly more to national party committees like the DNC, DCCC, and DSCC. The absence of aggregate limits allows for increased support to district, state, and local parties as well. Joint fundraising committees may play a larger role in facilitating this increased giving, potentially boosting party influence compared to independent groups like super PACs. Eliminating aggregate contribution limits could increase party clout compared with independent groups like super PACs. Leadership PACs, formed by congressional leaders to support other lawmakers' campaigns, could see further proliferation post-McCutcheon ruling. Currently, individuals can contribute up to $5,000 annually to leadership PACs and up to $5,200 per candidate for the 2014 election cycle. Some suggest implementing a shared contribution limit for leadership PACs and affiliated candidates to prevent circumvention of candidate contribution limits. Others argue that separate limits align with FEC rules and longstanding campaign practices. Some suggest that traditional PACs could emerge post-McCutcheon era to bypass individual limits. The ruling may incentivize both leadership and traditional PACs to solicit donors who previously maxed out. Congress may need to reexamine contribution flow through parties or PACs, especially regarding coordinated party expenditures, coordination, and earmarks permitted by FECA. In 2014, coordinated party expenditures are subject to limits based on office sought, state, and voting-age population. Limits for Senate candidates range from $94,500 to $2.8 million in California. Parties can make up to $47,200 in coordinated expenditures for each House candidate in multi-district states, and $94,500 in single-district states. Some argue that with larger aggregate funds flowing to parties, coordinated party expenditure limits should be raised or eliminated. Some suggest raising or eliminating coordinated party expenditure limits to address financial competition from outside groups like super PACs and 501(c) organizations. Existing FEC regulations establish criteria to determine impermissible coordination and whether contribution limits were exceeded. Some observers argue that current regulations on coordination are complex and easily avoided. Congress could reduce ambiguity by specifying coordination standards in statutory language. Earmarking provisions in FEC regulations require attributing contributions to their original source, even if passed through an intermediary. Earmarking provisions discussed in McCutcheon oral argument as a safeguard against circumventing contribution limits. Court suggests alternatives to aggregate limits, such as limits on transfers among committees and segregated accounts for large contributions. Congress faces decisions on policy approaches. The Supreme Court ruling in McCutcheon discusses contributions above certain limits, revisions to fundraising committee restrictions, and potential disclosure options. The FEC is now tasked with implementing the ruling, which may involve issuing policy guidance or initiating rulemaking. The FEC may struggle to reach consensus on implementing policy decisions related to campaign finance, particularly in light of the Supreme Court's rulings in Citizens United and McCutcheon. The debate over contribution limits is expected to continue, with potential implications for campaign finance regulation. The elimination of aggregate limits in campaign finance could have significant implications for individual campaigns, parties, and PACs. This may lead to increased contributions from donors who were previously maxed out, as well as the development of scenarios where contributions are spread across multiple political committees. Donor behavior and fundraising practices will ultimately depend on individual preferences and strategic decisions."
