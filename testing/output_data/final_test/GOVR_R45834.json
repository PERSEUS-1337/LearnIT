    "content": "In FY2019, around 20 million veterans lived in the US, with 9.3 million receiving care through the VA. The VA is required to provide health care services to eligible veterans through the VHA, which has nearly 1,700 medical facilities. Meeting veterans' care needs has been challenging, with some facing barriers like long wait times and travel distances. The VA has implemented measures like the Veterans Choice Program and the VA MISSION Act to expand veterans' access to care, including using telehealth in VA health care facilities. Telehealth utilizes health informatics and technology to provide care outside of traditional facilities, aiming to deliver the right care at the right time to designated individuals and populations. Telehealth uses ICT to provide care to veteran patients without requiring in-person visits. It supplements VA in-person care but does not replace it. This approach allows veterans to access healthcare services conveniently and actively participate in their healthcare decisions by using mobile apps to connect with VA providers. Legislation and regulations aim to expand veterans' access to VA telehealth services, focusing on rural veterans who face geographic barriers to in-person care. Approximately 33% of the 9.2 million veterans enrolled in the VA health care system in FY2019 were rural veterans, who are typically older, poorer, and sicker than their urban counterparts. Rural veterans face access barriers to VA telehealth services due to a lack of broadband internet. Urban veterans also experience access barriers, such as long wait times for care. The VA is struggling to meet the increasing demand for veterans' health care, leading to partnerships with private sector vendors. The VA has partnered with private sector vendors like Philips Healthcare, T-Mobile, and Walmart to expand veterans' access to telehealth services. This report provides an overview of VA telehealth programs, veteran eligibility, copayment requirements, and issues Congress could consider, including access barriers to in-person care and conflicting guidelines for prescribing controlled substances via telehealth across state lines. The report provides a summary of VA telehealth programs, veteran eligibility, copayment requirements, and issues Congress could consider. It includes conflicting guidelines for prescribing controlled substances via telehealth across state lines and details on the Office of Connected Care established by the VA in 2016. The Office of Connected Care administers VA telehealth programs to improve veterans' access to care and participation in their health care. These programs include My Health e Vet, VHA Innovation Program, and VA Mobile Health. The VA has requested funding for these telehealth programs. Not all veterans are eligible for VA care. Veterans' eligibility for VA care is based on veteran status, service-connected disability, and income. Enrolled veterans can receive primary and specialty care via telehealth. The VA medical benefits package covers a range of services for eligible veterans. In FY2018, over 9.3 million veterans were enrolled in VA care. In FY2018, 9.3 million veterans were enrolled in VA care, with 2.29 million telehealth episodes provided to 782,000 veteran patients. The Faster Care for Veterans Act of 2016 required the VA to allow veterans to schedule their own telehealth appointments. The U.S. Government Accountability Office found that VA systems did not allow veterans to schedule their own telehealth appointments. Veterans must work with their care team to determine if telehealth services are appropriate, and if so, they can opt in to schedule a telehealth appointment. A telehealth copayment for veteran patients is usually less than in-person care at VA facilities. Copays are not required for service-connected disabilities, former POWs, low-income veterans, or Medal of Honor recipients. Other veterans may receive free VA care under certain criteria. The VA determines veteran patients' copays for telehealth based on location and internal protocols. The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act allows the VA Secretary to waive copay requirements for telehealth services provided to veteran patients at home since March 2012. The Department of Veterans Affairs Codification Act requires VA providers to have a state license to deliver in-person and telehealth services to veteran patients. VA-employed or VA-contracted providers can choose to offer telehealth services to veterans. The VA MISSION Act allows VA-employed providers to offer telehealth services to veteran patients across state lines using only one state license, as long as they meet specific requirements. The VA MISSION Act allows VA-employed providers to offer telehealth services across state lines with one state license, following VA policies. VA-contracted providers must hold licenses in each state they practice in. Specialty licenses are not required for telehealth practice, but providers are encouraged to complete the Telehealth Master Preceptor Certification Program. The Telehealth Master Preceptor Certification Program offers education on VA telehealth delivery. Over 56,000 VA providers completed training in FY2018. VA telehealth includes internet, telehealth modalities, VA Mobile Health, and teleconsultations. Health informatics and data visualizations are not covered in this report. A veteran patient accessing VA telehealth services must be willing to perform telehealth tasks, such as accessing ePHI using the internet. In 2017, 77% of veteran enrollees reported using the internet, with 33% scheduling medical appointments, 45% accessing EHRs, and 77% searching for health information. The VA's findings show that veterans in the VA health care system use the internet for telehealth tasks. Veterans can access VA telehealth services from various locations without needing their own internet service. Accessing VA telehealth services on mobile devices requires sufficient cellular data storage. Veterans accessing VA telehealth services on personal devices face cybersecurity and privacy risks, as unauthorized parties can compromise mobile devices and internet connections. The responsibility for ensuring a trustworthy device and connection lies with the user. The VA coordinates restoration activities with key stakeholders in case of cybersecurity threats. Some veterans can access VA telehealth services on VA-issued mobile devices. The VA provided 6,000 tablets with 4G LTE connectivity to low-income and rural veterans to reduce broadband infrastructure barriers for telehealth. Veterans access telehealth services on trustworthy devices via secure connections, protected by the VA's Cybersecurity Program. Telehealth services are offered through home telehealth, store-and-forward telehealth, and clinical video telehealth modalities. The VA offers telehealth services through three modalities: home telehealth, store-and-forward telehealth, and clinical video telehealth. VA Mobile Health is not considered a telehealth modality but an essential element of healthcare delivery. In FY2019, the VA will measure the performance of addressing healthcare needs of eligible veterans using these modalities. The VA aims for at least 15% of eligible veteran patients to access VA telehealth services. The VA anticipates that 15% of eligible veteran patients will use VA telehealth services in FY2019. Home telehealth allows remote VA providers to manage chronic conditions like heart disease or diabetes by monitoring medical data from devices worn by patients. Telehealth episodes via home telehealth have minimal location restrictions. From FY2012 to FY2018, the VA conducted 6.7 million telehealth encounters for 1.0 million veteran patients. In FY2018, 872,705 telehealth episodes were provided to 136,741 veteran patients. The VA has seen an increase in veteran patients accessing telehealth services for hypertension management via the HT modality. The total population accessing these services has grown by 142.1% from FY2009 to FY2018. However, the percentage of veteran patients accessing VA telehealth services via the HT modality has shown a downward trend. The number of telehealth encounters via the HT modality has fluctuated over the years. The VA's financial obligations for telehealth services via the HT modality have increased, with $270.6 million obligated in FY2019. The VA has requested $279.8 million for FY2020 and $291 million for FY2021. The store-and-forward telehealth modality allows VA providers to interpret patients' clinical information remotely. The VA provides telehealth services via the SFT modality, including data, images, sound, and video medical records from radiology and dermatology examinations for veteran patients. The VA has conducted 2.7 million telehealth encounters from FY2009 to FY2018 and provided 344,853 telehealth episodes of care in FY2018. Teleretinal imaging is used to screen for diabetic eye disease in veteran patients. The VA utilizes telehealth services through the SFT modality, where a special camera captures an image of a veteran patient's eye, which is then sent to an eye care specialist for review. This allows VA providers to access expertise not available locally due to a shortage of healthcare providers. The increase in telehealth encounters via the SFT modality suggests a growing reliance on peer expertise. The VA provides telehealth services through the CVT modality, allowing VA providers and veteran patients to interact via live video technology. From FY2009 to FY2018, 5.7 million telehealth encounters were conducted with 2.1 million veteran patients. In FY2018 alone, 1,074,422 telehealth episodes of care were provided to 393,370 veteran patients. Telemental health services were the most accessed via the CVT modality. The VA's telehealth services via the CVT modality have seen an increase in veterans receiving services and the number of telehealth encounters from FY2009 to FY2018. The CVT program is well established and publicized, being the VA's oldest method of telehealth delivery. Veterans have been accessing telemental health care services through the CVT modality since the VA started providing telehealth services. VA Mobile allows veterans to access health services and ePHI via mobile apps on devices like smartphones and computers. The National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics reported high smartphone and computer ownership among VHA-enrolled veterans. VA Mobile aims to improve veterans' health by expanding clinical care beyond traditional office visits through mobile apps. It enables veterans to schedule medical appointments, access health information, and connect with VA providers remotely. VA Mobile allows VA providers to manage veteran patients' disabilities/illnesses remotely and share best practices for improving health outcomes. The VA App Store offers 47 mobile apps for veterans, caregivers, and providers, with two-thirds dedicated to veterans. Some apps are accessible to non-enrolled veterans and not all are healthcare-specific. VA mobile apps provide access to a range of VA benefit services and information, including consulting with a VA pharmacist, reviewing disability benefits, and obtaining information on depression. The VA-Department of Defense (DOD) Veteran Link app is a secure social networking app for veterans and current servicemembers. To download VA mobile apps, veterans need login credentials for a DOD Self-Service Logon (DS Logon) account, a My Health e Vet account, or an ID.me account. The DOD Self-Service Logon (DS Logon) Account and MyHealth e Vet Premium Account are federal accounts that provide access to VA and DOD websites for veterans. The DS Logon offers Basic and Premium levels for viewing general or personal information, while the MyHealth e Vet account is for healthcare-related tasks and requires authentication of VA care enrollment. The ID.me Account authenticates veterans' affiliation to the VA and DOD for accessing healthcare-related tasks. It provides secure identity proofing and is free to veterans. The VA mobile app requires a web-based, iOS, or Android platform to operate. A VA iOS app is accessible to veterans using Apple devices, while a VA Android app is available for non-Apple devices. Veterans can download these apps from the VA App Store or Apple App Store for iOS, and from the VA App Store or Google Play Store for Android. The VA Video Connect (VVC) app allows veteran patients to connect with VA providers via live video regardless of location. The app requires a mobile device with a web camera, speakers, and microphone, as well as internet access. Encryption is used for privacy. The VVC app was launched in August 2017 and has facilitated over 105,300 telehealth visits from October 2017 to September 2018. VA has partnered with Philips Healthcare and T-Mobile to expand veterans' access to the VVC app. The new partnership with Philips Healthcare aims to place telehealth equipment in VSO posts, specifically Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion. This initiative will expand VA telehealth services to veterans who frequent these VSOs, but non-members will also have access. Positive outcomes could encourage non-VSO members to visit VSOs. The VA's partnership with T-Mobile allows veterans to access the VVC app on their mobile devices without extra charges. It is unclear if veterans with other wireless providers would incur additional fees. The VA has not announced plans to partner with all wireless providers for VVC app access. The VA partners with T-Mobile to provide free access to the VVC app for veteran patients on mobile devices, ensuring no extra charges. Telehealth services offered align with in-patient care services, with no change in quality. The VHA is the largest U.S. provider of telehealth services, delivering 2.29 million episodes of care to 782,000 veteran patients in FY2018. 9% of patients were female, and 45% lived in rural areas, accessing a range of telehealth services through the VHA. The VA offers telehealth services in seven categories: consultative, disease-specific, gender-specific, preventative, rehabilitative, rural-specific, and wellness. Veterans can access these services at various VA sites and may be referred to private providers for certain care. The VA offers telehealth services in various categories at VA sites and non-VA locations. Veterans must get prior authorization from the VA to access care from non-VA providers. The VA is developing new telehealth services to meet veterans' needs, such as the COMPACT team testing a telehealth-based self-management training system. The VA announced a partnership with Walmart to provide telehealth services for underserved veterans in Walmart retail stores. Walmart will offer operational support, and locations will be based on the number of veterans and health resources available. This decision was made because more Americans live near Walmart stores than VA medical centers. The VA announced a partnership with Walmart to provide telehealth services for underserved veterans. Walmart will offer operational support, and the VA reported 172 VAMCs in 2019. The VA also has other medical facilities like health care centers, vet centers, and outpatient clinics. Congress is interested in how many veterans live near these facilities compared to Walmart stores. The Veterans Rural Health Advisory Committee raised concerns about challenges in expanding telehealth services to rural veterans. The VHA faces challenges in expanding telehealth services to rural veterans, focusing on technology and bandwidth. Current law defines teleconsultation for mental health and traumatic brain injury assessments. The VA aims to improve health outcomes for rural veterans through teleconsultations, using models like Project ECHO. The Expanding Capacity for Health Outcomes Act required the HHS Secretary to create a Specialty Care Access Network-Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (SCAN-ECHO) learning model. Project ECHO is a collaborative learning model where medical educators disseminate best practices to primary care providers through teleECHO. The VA launched SCAN-ECHO in 2011 to improve health outcomes for rural and underserved patients. The VA launched SCAN-ECHO in 2011 to expand care to rural and underserved veterans. SCAN-ECHO provides specialty care consultation and training to primary care providers through video teleconferencing. The hub-and-spoke model involves specialty care teams (hubs) collaborating with primary care providers (spokes) to develop treatment plans for patients. The specialty care team collaborates to recommend treatment plans and provide clinical education. The ECHO Act mandated the HHS Secretary to assess technology-enabled collaborative learning models. ASPE's report to Congress highlighted the VA's use of SCAN-ECHO for various medical conditions, including chronic liver disease and diabetes, with a study on 62,750 veterans showing improved health outcomes. Between 2011 and 2015, 513 veteran patients with chronic liver disease received virtual teleconsultations through SCAN-ECHO, resulting in lower mortality rates compared to those without consultations. The VA aims to enhance telehealth capabilities to improve access to care for veterans, potentially reducing the need for travel benefits and hospital admissions. Telehealth is a growing industry in both federal and private sectors, with increasing access, utilization, and innovation. The VA is expanding telehealth capabilities to improve access to care for veterans, addressing barriers to in-person VA care and internet access. Congress may need to examine guidelines for prescribing controlled substances via telehealth. The VA predicts a decrease in the U.S. veteran population. The VA predicts a 32% decrease in the U.S. veteran population by 2037. Despite this, a large portion of veterans may still choose to access care through the VA health care system. Congress may need to assess the expansion of in-person and telehealth services to ensure cost-effective and quality care for veterans. The goal of the MISSION Act and VA telemedicine rule is to enhance veteran patients' access to care through telehealth services, contingent on internet access. The VA is exploring ways to improve veteran patients' access to telehealth services by considering alternative internet access points like libraries and schools, especially for veterans in remote areas with limited internet connectivity. The RAY BAUM's Act of 2018 addressed the lack of broadband internet access for veterans, particularly in rural areas and those with low incomes. The FCC submitted a report to Congress on promoting broadband access for veterans, highlighting barriers such as affordability and limited development in certain areas. In future discussions, Congress may consider costs of deploying broadband infrastructure in underserved areas. Some veteran patients are provided tablets with 4G LTE mobile broadband for VA Video Connect where infrastructure is lacking. Congress addresses concerns about prescribing controlled substances like opioids to veteran patients not receiving services from VA facilities or in the same state as the prescribing physician. The Controlled Substance Act allows for special registration for telemedicine to increase patient access to practitioners prescribing controlled substances. Practitioners can deliver controlled substances via telemedicine to patients without an in-person examination. The Controlled Substance Act allows for special registration for telemedicine to increase patient access to practitioners prescribing controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement Administration has yet to finalize a rule on the registration's application process and procedures. The Ryan Haight Act exempts VA providers from needing a special registration in each state if they meet certain conditions. The special registration for telemedicine under the Controlled Substance Act, not yet implemented by the DEA, MISSION Act, or VA's final rule on telehealth, may cause confusion for VA providers regarding licensing requirements for prescribing controlled substances. Unlike the special registration, the MISSION Act and VA's rule do not override state laws on prescribing controlled substances. VA providers must be licensed in each state where they prescribe controlled substances. Congress could consider urging the VA to develop guidelines for prescribing controlled substances to veteran patients not receiving telehealth services within VA facilities. The VA has provided telehealth services to veteran patients to improve access and address delivery challenges. In the 1950s and 1960s, the VA faced difficulties in recruiting psychiatrists and neurologists, leading to long waiting lists for inpatient care. To address this, the VA started testing telehealth services to provide care for psychiatric and neurological conditions. The VA tested telehealth services using CCTV technology in the 1960s to improve healthcare outcomes for veteran patients. The results showed its effectiveness in treating psychiatric patients and training personnel, with potential applications in other medical fields like surgical education. The VA has utilized telehealth technologies to address veterans' access barriers to in-person care. Legislative history shows laws passed to support VA telehealth, such as the Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006. The VA Secretary was required by various Acts of Congress to expand telehealth services for veterans, including peer outreach, support, and mental health services. The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 allowed contracting with community mental health centers to improve veterans' access to care. The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012, Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, and Faster Care for Veterans Act of 2016 aim to expand veterans' access to VA telehealth services by waiving copay requirements, improving access via mobile centers, and allowing patients to schedule their own appointments. The John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-182; VA MISSION Act of 2018) allows veteran patients to schedule their own medical appointments for VA telehealth services without geographic barriers, enabling access to telehealth services from any location in the United States, U.S. territories, District of Columbia, and Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Veteran patients may also benefit from accessing out-of-state telehealth providers in non-VA health care facilities. The White House and the VA announced the Anywhere to Anywhere initiative on August 3, 2017, to remove geographic barriers for veterans accessing telehealth services from out-of-state providers in non-VA health care facilities. State licensing laws can hinder providers from offering services across state lines, impacting rural and underserved populations. The VA's Anywhere to Anywhere initiative aims to remove geographic barriers for veterans accessing telehealth services from out-of-state providers. However, providers face licensing restrictions when practicing telemedicine across state lines, hindering the expansion of telemedicine within the VA health care system. The VA published a final rule exempting its providers from state licensing laws for telehealth services, allowing them to practice outside VA facilities. State licensing boards can no longer penalize VA providers for delivering telehealth services across state lines. This change addresses concerns of providers facing penalties for unauthorized practice of medicine. The VA published a final rule exempting its providers from state licensing laws for telehealth services, allowing them to practice outside VA facilities. The rule does not preempt state laws on controlled substances prescribing and only applies to VA providers. It became effective on June 11, 2018, after the VA MISSION Act removed geographic barriers to VA telehealth services. The VA published a final rule exempting its providers from state licensing laws for telehealth services, allowing them to practice outside VA facilities. The VA MISSION Act codified the core principles of the rule to protect VA providers from liability issues related to state licensure laws. Nearly 10,000 VA providers gained authority to provide out-of-state telehealth services to veteran patients in non-VA health care facilities."
