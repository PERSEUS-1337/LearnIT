The Birmingham Civil Rights District in downtown Birmingham, Alabama, played a significant role in the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. The area includes historic sites like the A.G. Gaston Motel, 16th Street Baptist Church, and the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. Birmingham was known for being one of the most segregated cities in the South during the 1960s, with segregation present in various aspects of daily life and violence used to uphold the status quo. In the 1960s, Birmingham was heavily segregated with violence used to maintain the status quo. The city witnessed numerous bombings targeting African-American homes and businesses. Governor George Wallace famously declared his support for segregation. Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth led the Civil Rights campaign \"Project C\" in Birmingham, aiming to end segregation through mass protests and sit-ins at the A.G. Gaston Motel. The A.G. Gaston Motel, a historic monument to black entrepreneurship, served as headquarters for Project C and housed SCLC leadership, including Dr. King. The motel, built by Arthur George Gaston, was the starting point for the Project C campaign in 1963, leading to Dr. King's arrest and the writing of his famous \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\". In response to the opposition of segregation by eight White Alabama clergymen, Dr. King wrote a letter defending his presence in Birmingham, stating \"injustice is here.\" Phase two of Project C in May 1963 involved mass protests led by children, resulting in over 900 arrests and police actions to prevent further marches. Youth protestors in Kelly Ingram Park were violently dispersed by police dogs and water on May 3, 1963. On May 10, 1963, the Birmingham business community and local leaders agreed to release peaceful protestors, integrate lunch counters, and begin hiring African-Americans after violent police response to protests. The compromise was announced at the A.G. Gaston Motel, which was later bombed. On September 15, 1963, a bomb exploded at the 16th Street Baptist Church during worship, escalating racial tensions. On September 15, 1963, a bomb exploded at the 16th Street Baptist Church, killing four young girls and injuring 22 others. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered the eulogy, and this act of domestic terrorism spurred the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Just south of the church is the 4th Avenue Historic District, a hub for Black-owned businesses during segregation. The district was home to a prominent African-American owned radio station that played a crucial role in supporting the civil rights movement by sending coded messages. Bethel Baptist Church, led by Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, served as the headquarters for the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights and provided refuge for members of the 1961 Freedom Ride. The church was targeted in multiple bombings in the 1950s and 1960s. The Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, opened in 1992, is located in the Birmingham Civil Rights District. It serves as a center for learning about the American Civil Rights Movement, with a permanent gallery designed to transport visitors back to the deeply segregated 1950s Birmingham. The institute attracts children, students, adults, and scholars interested in this historical period. The Birmingham Civil Rights Institute in deeply segregated Birmingham serves over 140,000 individuals annually, promoting awareness of civil rights history, equality, and justice. Collaboration among Federal, municipal entities, and community organizations is crucial for preserving and managing the historical resources of the Birmingham Civil Rights National Historical Park.
