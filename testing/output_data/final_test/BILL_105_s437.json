    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997\". Congress recognizes the Federal Government's responsibility to support commerce and infrastructure development, including roads and bridges. There is a unique relationship with tribal governments and a trust responsibility to protect tribal assets and resources. The Federal Government has a responsibility to work with tribal governments to improve physical infrastructure for economic well-being. There is a need for improvements to roads on Indian land, with over 50,000 miles serving Indian tribes, including 21,000 miles managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. State and county roads make up the majority of roads serving Indian tribes. The Indian reservation roads program, established under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, targets the Bureau of Indian Affairs road system, which makes up less than half of the total mileage of roads on Indian reservations in the United States. Only 11 percent of Bureau of Indian Affairs roads are in good condition, with 90 percent of unpaved roads known to be in poor condition. Annual funding from the Highway Trust Fund is the main source for new road construction on Indian land, as the Bureau of Indian Affairs road construction budget has decreased significantly. Minimal funding is provided for road maintenance, with a peak in funding in the late 1950s and 1979. The funding for Indian reservation roads fluctuated over the years, reaching a peak of $80,000,000 per fiscal year before declining rapidly. In 1982, funding stabilized at $100,000,000 annually through the Highway Trust Fund, then reduced to $80,000,000 from 1987 to 1991. Since 1992, funding has been set at $191,000,000 per fiscal year to support economic development, education, and health on Indian reservations. The Indian reservation roads program requires increased funding to address poor transportation conditions on reservations and align with national standards. Federal assistance should respect Indian self-determination and governance rights. The Indian reservation roads program aims to improve transportation conditions on reservations while respecting tribal self-governance. SEC. 3. INDIAN RESERVATION ROADS. Section 1003(a)(6)(A) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 is amended to allocate specific funding amounts for fiscal years 1998 to 2002.

Additionally, the amendment extends the years for certain provisions from 1995-1997 to 1995-2002. The amendment to Section 1047 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 includes Indian tribes in various subsections and extends certain provisions from 1995-2002.

SEC. 10 addresses Indian technical centers. SEC. 10 amends Section 326(c) of title 23 to increase funding for Indian technical centers, allocating at least $1,000,000 per fiscal year for each center.
