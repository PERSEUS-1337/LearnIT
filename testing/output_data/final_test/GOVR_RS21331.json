The Administration requested $48 million for FY2007, with the House and Senate providing the requested funding. The Senate Energy and Water bill limits Corps funding to $35 million and suggests DOI should solely fund the project as it benefits Everglades National Park. The Modified Waters Deliveries Project (Mod Waters) in southern Florida is jointly funded by the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. There is controversy over the Corps' authorization to receive appropriations for the project. The Administration's position is for the Corps to pay for two-thirds of the remaining $146 million needed to complete the project from FY2007 to FY2009. Funding for Mod Waters in FY2006 was split between DOI and the Corps, with a provision in the Interior Appropriations Act conditioning funding on meeting state water quality standards. The EPA and Attorney General report that water entering the A.R.M. Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge and Everglades National Park does not meet state water quality standards. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations disapprove further expenditure of funds. The Modified Water Deliveries Project aims to improve water deliveries to Everglades National Park and restore natural hydrological conditions. The Mod Waters project is a significant step towards implementing the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. It includes structural modifications to improve water flow to the Northeast Shark River Slough, aiming to enhance water supplies in the Everglades ecosystem. The project consists of four components: flood mitigation, Tamiami Trail modifications, conveyance and seepage control features, and a Combined Structural and Operational Plan. The Mod Waters project includes flood mitigation measures and Tamiami Trail modifications to address potential flooding in residential and agricultural areas near the park. Legislation mandates the development of a flood protection system if these areas are at risk. Alternative 6D is one of the mitigation features aimed at protecting residents in the 8.5 SMA from flood waters. The Tamiami Trail modification aims to improve water flows for Northeast Shark River Slough. The Mod Waters project aims to improve water flows for Northeast Shark River Slough and Everglades National Park by constructing two bridges across the highway. Construction is set to begin in 2007. Debates surround funding levels, project delays, and land acquisition in the 8.5 SMA. The Corps' authorization to fund Mod Waters was questioned during deliberations over the FY2006 Energy and Water Appropriations. Arguments cite the Everglades National Park Protection and Expansion Act of 1989 as potential authorization. The National Park Protection and Expansion Act of 1989 authorizes funding for Mod Waters, but debates continue over the Corps' authority to directly fund the project. Rising costs and project delays have raised concerns about its viability. The cost of completing Mod Waters has increased significantly from the original estimate in 1990. Approximately $252 million has been spent on the project so far, with an additional $146 million needed to finish it by FY2009. Changes in the implementation plan, land acquisition costs, and flood mitigation requirements have contributed to the higher costs. The project, originally scheduled for completion in 1997, now faces uncertainty regarding its completion date. Funding for the project will be requested according to the FY2006 Administration request. Some delays in completing Mod Waters are attributed to undefined roles of DOI and the Corps, lack of unified restoration approach, redesigning issues, and litigation over the 8.5 SMA and Tamiami Trail. Concerns arise about jeopardizing CERP projects, causing degradation in Everglades National Park, and setting a precedent for delays in land acquisition. Proponents believe ongoing land acquisition in the 8.5 SMA will prevent future delays, but controversy surrounds the process due to unwilling sellers and eminent domain use by the Corps. The Corps is using eminent domain to acquire lands in the 8.5 SMA, a region next to ENP that frequently floods. The 1992 flood mitigation plan was deemed unworkable, leading to the development of a new plan in 1999, including Alternative 6D which considered buying out the 8.5 SMA. In 2000, the Corps proposed Alternative 6D for flood protection in the 8.5 SMA, which involves acquiring 2,500 acres and 77 residential tracts. Some residents sued the Corps in 2001, claiming lack of authority to implement a partial buyout plan. The Corps proposed Alternative 6D for flood protection in the 8.5 SMA in 2000, involving acquiring land and residential tracts. Residents sued the Corps in 2001, questioning the authority for a partial buyout plan. In 2002, a judge restricted the Corps from acquiring land in the area, but the decision was later appealed. Congress authorized the Corps to implement Alternative 6D for flood protection in the 8.5 SMA as part of Mod Waters, with conditions for acquiring residential property and land from willing sellers. The Corps is authorized to acquire land from willing sellers in the flood-protected portion of the 8.5 SMA for flood protection. Critics argue against land acquisition in the area, citing concerns about eminent domain and delays due to litigation. The Corps is authorized to acquire land from willing sellers in the 8.5 SMA for flood protection. Approximately 78% of the needed tracts have been acquired, with 57% in negotiations and 43% expected to be condemned if condemnations proceed. Delays due to litigation could harm the ecosystem."
