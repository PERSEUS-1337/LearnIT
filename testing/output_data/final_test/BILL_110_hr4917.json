    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"NEO Preparedness Act\". The Congress finds that asteroid and comet collisions are costly natural disasters, with a 140-meter asteroid generating the power of a 100 megaton explosion. There are around 100,000 near-Earth objects of this size, and it takes decades to mitigate the threat of a collision. Unlike earthquakes and hurricanes, asteroids and comets provide collision information to prepare for potential disasters. The United States aims to incorporate asteroid and comet collision disaster recovery and avoidance into its public safety structure. Basic information is crucial for decision-making to create a comprehensive program to address the threats posed by near-Earth asteroids and comets. Establishing situation analysis processes and resources before a collision threat arises is essential to effectively eliminate and mitigate the risks. Without these processes in place, options to address collision risks are limited or lost. The public safety of the United States and the planet relies on NASA's expertise to prepare for and mitigate collisions with near-Earth objects. The Act defines key terms related to near-Earth objects, including potentially hazardous objects, the Administrator of NASA, adequate-warning, short-warning, and comets. Establishment of the Office of Potentially Hazardous Near-Earth Objects, identification of factors, and selection of procedures and systems. The Administrator establishes the Office of Potentially Hazardous Near-Earth Object Preparedness to prepare the US for potential collisions with near-Earth objects by identifying key analysis factors and decision-making criteria in collaboration with other agencies. The Office of Potentially Hazardous Near-Earth Object Preparedness focuses on key factors for decision-making regarding threat elimination, human skills needed, technical and policy questions, time periods for decisions, deflection and mitigation strategies, and critical information needs for public confidence. The Office of Potentially Hazardous Near-Earth Object Preparedness focuses on key factors for decision-making regarding threat elimination, human skills needed, technical and policy questions, time periods for decisions, deflection and mitigation strategies, and critical information needs for public confidence. The Office selects procedures and systems by surveying existing deflection proposals, examining critical elements, performing an architectural tradeoff assessment, and selecting a set of deflection proposals for preparation. The Office of Potentially Hazardous Near-Earth Object Preparedness focuses on selecting procedures and systems for deflection-preparation, including identifying backups, defining steps for key technologies, developing models, analyzing predicted results, projecting readiness time, formulating implementation phases, and establishing timelines with measurable goals. The Office of Potentially Hazardous Near-Earth Object Preparedness focuses on selecting procedures and systems for deflection-preparation, including identifying backups, defining steps for key technologies, developing models, analyzing predicted results, projecting readiness time, formulating implementation phases, establishing timelines with measurable interim goals, identifying crucial policy decisions for implementation, and coordinating with other agencies. SEC. 5. REPORTS.\n\nThe Administrator must provide Congress with two reports: \n(1) An interim report within 1 year of the Act's enactment summarizing preliminary results of Office activities.\n(2) A concluding report within 2 years summarizing all Office activities.\n\nSEC. 6. NASA ADVISORY COUNSEL. The NASA Advisory Council must convene within 90 days after submitting the interim report to provide advice for the concluding report, and within 90 days after submitting the concluding report to provide advice for subsequent activities."
