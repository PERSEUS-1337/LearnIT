    "content": "The \"National Guard and Reserve Educational Benefits Fairness Act of 2007\" allows for educational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill for members of the National Guard and Reserve who serve extended periods of continuous active duty in certain theaters of operation. The \"National Guard and Reserve Educational Benefits Fairness Act of 2007\" provides educational assistance for National Guard and Reserve members who serve at least 20 months of continuous active duty in the Armed Forces after September 11, 2001, in certain theaters of operation. The National Guard and Reserve Educational Benefits Fairness Act of 2007 offers educational assistance to members who serve at least 12 months in designated theaters of operation, complete secondary school requirements or equivalent college credits, and receive an honorable discharge after service. Members of the Reserve, including the National Guard, who are characterized as honorable by the Secretary concerned or continue their service, are entitled to basic educational assistance. To claim this assistance, individuals must notify the Secretary of their election in the prescribed form and manner. This notification must be made at the specified times, as jointly determined by the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense. Members of the Reserve, including the National Guard, are entitled to basic educational assistance upon notifying the Secretary of their election. However, to receive this assistance, individuals must meet the requirements of subsection (a) and have their basic pay reduced by $100 per month if on active duty in the Armed Forces. If they cease active duty before 12 months, the Secretary of Defense will collect the remaining reduction amount. Before receiving basic educational assistance, the Secretary of Defense will collect $1,200 from individuals, minus any reduction in basic pay. If an individual not on active duty makes an election notice, they must also pay $1,200 before receiving assistance. The Secretary may collect this amount through pay reductions if the individual returns to active duty before payment is made. The Secretary of Defense will collect $1,200 from individuals before providing basic educational assistance. Any reduction in basic pay will revert to the Treasury and not be considered as received by the individual. Amounts collected will be deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. The duration of basic educational assistance for National Guard and Reserve members on extended active duty is 36 months. The amount of basic educational allowance payable to individuals entitled to educational assistance under section 3012A is determined under subsection (a), with a conforming amendment made to section 3014(b)(2)(C) of the title."
