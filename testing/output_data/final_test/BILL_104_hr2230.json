Congress finds that methyl bromide is a crucial pesticide for American farmers, with no safe alternatives available. Nonchemical pest control methods are untested for commercial use, posing potential risks to human health and the environment. The Montreal Protocol was amended in 1992 to include methyl bromide, but research shows it is mostly naturally occurring and does not pose the threat initially believed. Agricultural use accounts for less than 3% of ozone layer damage, and scientists believe the ozone layer will recover by the middle of the next century even if methyl bromide continues to be used. The Environmental Protection Agency listed methyl bromide as an ozone-depleting chemical under the Clean Air Act in 1993, freezing US production at 1991 levels and ending production by January 1, 2001. The ban is predicted to cause a 43% decline in affected vegetable acreage in Florida, with estimated costs of up to $1.5 billion in five states where methyl bromide is most utilized. The Clean Air Act listed methyl bromide as an ozone-depleting chemical in 1993, freezing US production and ending it by January 1, 2001. Definitions for the section include terms like \"use as a pesticide,\" \"pesticide,\" \"control,\" and \"Administrator.\" The Administrator is restricted from controlling the production, importation, or export of methyl bromide for pesticide use under the Clean Air Act. The Administrator may take action to control the consumption or use of methyl bromide as a pesticide, or require labeling of agricultural products treated with methyl bromide if viable substitutes or alternatives are available, as certified by the Secretary of Agriculture. This control applies only to specified applications, commodities, and products certified by the Secretary. The Administrator may take action under the Montreal Protocol to control the production, importation, or export of methyl bromide for use as a pesticide. Any control implemented must align with the requirements of the Montreal Protocol and apply equally to all parties, including exemptions and flexibility for production, importation, export, and consumption. The Montreal Protocol allows control of methyl bromide for pesticide use, with regulations aligning with its requirements. EPA actions inconsistent with the Protocol are repealed, while certain regulatory provisions granting exemptions remain unaffected."
