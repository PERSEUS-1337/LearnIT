    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Helping Individuals Return to Employment Act\" or the \"HIRE Act\". It includes provisions for Community Employment Grants. The \"Helping Individuals Return to Employment Act\" authorizes the Secretary of Labor to award competitive grants for hiring unemployed individuals to work for community benefit. Eligible entities include local governments, workforce investment boards, and non-profit organizations. Grants are targeted at areas with unemployment rates exceeding 7 percent. Grants awarded under the \"Helping Individuals Return to Employment Act\" target areas with high unemployment rates. Eligible entities can hire unemployed individuals from designated renewal communities, empowerment zones, and historically underutilized business zones. Priority is given to individuals unemployed for over a year, with limitations on union consultation for funded employment. An individual employed under the grant must have consent from the labor organization at the employer with a collective bargaining agreement. They cannot displace other non-funded employees and cannot be hired to replace furloughed employees. The Act establishes grants for employment, where individuals receive a portion of unemployment compensation. Recipients must consult with community leaders to determine qualifying activities, such as public works and education, for individuals hired with grant funds.
