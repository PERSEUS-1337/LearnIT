    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers benefits such as medical care, disability compensation, education, and home loan guarantees to eligible veterans. It operates through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA), with the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) handling compensation and pensions, and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintaining national veterans' cemeteries. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides health care services and medical research programs to veterans through the VA health care system. Eligibility for enrollment is based on military service, disability, and income. The VHA offers free medical care for service-connected conditions and low-income veterans for nonservice-connected conditions. This report focuses on appropriations for VHA within the VA's budget. The report focuses on appropriations for VHA within the VA's budget for FY2011. It includes an overview of VHA's budget formulation, accounts funding VHA, and recent legislative developments for the FY2012 VHA budget. Advance appropriations were authorized for three VHA accounts in 2009 under the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009. The Department of Veterans Affairs received advance appropriations for VHA accounts starting in FY2010. The funding for advance appropriations is scored in the fiscal year when the funds are available for obligation. The Department of Veterans Affairs received advance appropriations for VHA accounts starting in FY2010. Budget authority for FY2012 includes funding from P.L. 112-10 and additional funding from P.L. 112-74. The VA's budget consists of mandatory and discretionary spending accounts, with mandatory funding supporting various benefits and services. Figure 1 shows the breakdown of FY2011 budget allocations for both mandatory and discretionary spending. In FY2011, the VA's total budget authority was $120.6 billion, with discretionary funding accounting for 47% ($56.3 billion) and mandatory funding accounting for 53%. Discretionary funding mainly supported VA health care programs, while mandatory funding went towards disability compensation and pension programs. The VA formulates its budget request about 10 months before the President submits it to Congress, starting with the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model. The Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) estimates VHA's budgetary resources needed to meet health care service demand based on projected enrollment, utilization, and unit cost. Projections are made 3-4 years in advance using data from the previous fiscal year. VHA's budget request is developed using EHCPM data, with funding coming from four appropriations. The VHA is funded through four appropriations accounts, including medical care, research, and administration. Congress also appropriates funds for construction of medical facilities. In FY2004, Congress changed the VHA's appropriations structure for better oversight and accurate accounting of funds. The VHA is funded through four appropriations accounts: medical services, medical administration (now known as medical support and compliance), medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The medical services account covers expenses for inpatient and outpatient care for veterans and dependents, including care in non-VA facilities, outpatient care on a fee basis, medical supplies, employee salaries, hospital food service, and aid to state veterans' homes. The medical support and compliance account funds expenses related to hospital administration, billing activities, public health programs, quality management, medical inspection, research oversight, and training programs. The medical facilities account covers expenses for maintenance, operation, planning, design, construction, and renovation of VHA facilities. The medical and prosthetic research program focuses on research into the special health care needs of veterans, funding various types of research. VA researchers receive funding from multiple sources including the Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, and private organizations. The VA's research program is intramural, conducted by VA investigators at VA facilities and approved off-site locations. Unlike other federal agencies, VA does not have the authority to make research grants to non-VA entities. Congress allows VHA to bill veterans and health care insurers for nonservice-connected care to help cover the cost of medical services. The VA health care facility retains First and Third Party bills for veteran care. MCCF collections increased from $1.7 billion in FY2004 to $2.8 billion in FY2010. First-party collections increased by 17% to $870 million, while third-party collections increased by 98% to $1.9 billion. In FY2010, first-party collections represented 31% and third-party collections accounted for 67% of total MCCF collections. The Obama Administration released its FY2011 budget on February 1, 2010. The Obama Administration released its FY2011 budget on February 1, 2010, requesting $48.8 billion for VHA, including $590 million for medical research. The total VHA funding level for FY2011 was estimated to be $52.1 billion, $4.1 billion above FY2010 levels. Additionally, the budget requested $50.6 billion in advance appropriations for FY2012. The Administration's FY2011 budget requested $39.6 billion for medical services, $5.5 billion for medical support, and $5.4 billion for medical facilities. The House passed a bill providing $48.8 billion for the Veterans Health Administration in FY2011, including $590 million for medical research. Advance appropriations of $50.6 billion were also approved for medical services, support, and facilities for FY2012. The Senate Committee on Appropriations marked up its version of the MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2011, providing $48.9 billion for VHA, including additional funding for medical services, facilities, and research. This amount was $120 million more than the President's request. In FY2012, $50.6 billion was allocated for medical services, support, and facilities in the VA accounts. Funding levels for most VA accounts in FY2011 were not enacted by Congress at the beginning of the fiscal year, except for the three VHA accounts with advance appropriations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provided advance appropriations for medical services, support, and facilities accounts, unaffected by continuing resolutions passed by Congress. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 allocated a total of $52.0 billion. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2011 allocated $52.0 billion for the VA, including $48.6 billion in new budget authority and $3.4 billion in medical care collections. The President's FY2012 budget request for the VA was $128.3 billion, with $51.4 billion allocated for VHA. Additionally, a $953 million contingency fund was proposed in the budget. The President's budget for the VA in FY2012 includes a $953 million contingency fund to address changes in economic conditions. This fund would be funded by revising advance appropriations and requesting additional funds for the medical services account. Additionally, the budget requests $52.5 billion in advance appropriations for FY2013 for medical care accounts. The House Budget Committee reported a concurrent resolution on the FY2012 budget for veterans programs, calling for $128.3 billion in budget authority and $127.1 billion in outlays. Discretionary spending for veterans' health care is $59.0 billion in budget authority. Mandatory spending in 2012 is $69.4 billion in budget authority. The House passed the MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2012 (H.R. 2055) with a total of approximately $127.8 billion for the VA, including $51.1 billion for VHA. The bill also provides $52.5 billion in advance appropriations for FY2013 for three relevant accounts. The MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2012 (H.R. 2055) passed by the House provides $52.5 billion in advance appropriations for FY2013 for three relevant accounts. Additionally, $531 million is allocated for medical and prosthetic research, a 4.3% increase over the President's request. The House measure did not include the additional $240 million requested by the President. The committee report states that the economy's recovery makes it unlikely for unmet medical services needs to arise, as the account has managed without budget shortfalls during the recession. The committee's recommendation does not involve rescinding $664 million of funding from previous years. The FY 2012 funding in medical care accounts from cancelled pay raises will remain to cover unanticipated medical service costs. $664 million will be available in the fourth quarter upon approval for unanticipated needs. An amendment set aside $20 million for suicide prevention outreach. The Senate passed the MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2012, providing approximately $128.1 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, a 6.2% increase from FY2011.

The FY2012 MILCON-VA Appropriations bill provides $52.5 billion in advance appropriations for FY2013, including $581 million for medical research. The Senate did not approve the President's request for a $953 million contingency fund for increased demand for VA medical services. The Committee is hesitant about creating a contingency fund controlled by OMB, believing it takes control away from the VA. The VA's FY2013 request assumes carrying over $500 million from the previous year. The Department's fiscal year 2013 request assumes carrying over $500 million from fiscal year 2012. The Committee recommends utilizing available funding before requesting a contingency fund. $664 million remains in the medical care accounts for addressing unanticipated demand. Congress funded most of the VA through short-term continuing resolutions for FY2012. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-74) provided $122.2 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, a 4.7% decrease from the President's request.
