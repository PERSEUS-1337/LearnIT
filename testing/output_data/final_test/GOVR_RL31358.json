    "content": "The term \"cloning\" is used by scientists to describe processes involving making copies of biological material like genes, cells, plants, or animals. Cloning of genes has led to new treatments for diseases. Human embryos produced via cloning involve somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), where the nucleus of an egg is replaced by a nucleus from a mature body cell. Concern over human cloning increased after the first cloned adult mammal, Dolly the sheep, was produced in 1996 using SCNT. The Roslin Institute in Edinburgh successfully cloned Dolly the sheep using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Dolly was born from a sheep egg with the nucleus of a mammary gland cell from an adult sheep. Despite being the only lamb born out of 277 embryos transferred, Dolly's genetic material confirmed her origin. She was euthanized in 2003 due to a lung infection, with some attributing her early death to being a clone. Scientists believe her ailment may be due to being raised indoors rather than as a pastured sheep. Although SCNT has been used to clone other animals, the procedure's efficiency remains low. Despite low efficiency and abnormal development in cloned animals (e.g. pig, mouse, rabbit), cloning holds potential for agriculture and human health research. Stem cells from cloned human embryos have faced ethical and scientific controversies, with advancements in creating human cloned embryos and isolating stem cells offering hope for conditions like spinal cord injury, diabetes, and immune deficiency. The SNU group, led by Woo Suk Hwang, faced ethical misconduct accusations in 2005 for using freshly harvested eggs from younger women for research on spinal cord injury, diabetes, and immune deficiency treatments. Junior scientists in the lab secretly donated their own eggs and received payment, halting collaboration plans with US and UK labs. In December 2005, there were allegations of fabrication in the stem cell research conducted by Woo Suk Hwang's team at SNU, leading to investigations and calls for retraction of the 2005 paper. Sung Il Roh admitted to the fabrication, prompting Hwang to agree to the retraction while still defending the scientific results. In December 2005, allegations of fabrication in stem cell research by SNU were confirmed, with nine out of eleven stem cell lines found to be deliberately fabricated. The remaining two lines were still under investigation. Additionally, the 2004 paper reporting the first derivation of stem cells from a cloned human embryo was also revealed to be a deliberate fabrication. Scientists in the UK and US are working on deriving patient-matched stem cells from cloned human embryos. The Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA) regulates cloning and embryonic stem cell research. Scientists at various universities, including the University of Newcastle and the University of Edinburgh, are conducting therapeutic cloning experiments with human embryos. The Harvard Stem Cell Institute is also planning to produce cloned human embryos for research on diseases like juvenile diabetes and Parkinson's. In January 2005, a committee granted preliminary permission for research on cloned embryos with specific restrictions. Approval was later received from a second committee overseeing human subjects' use in research. In June 2006, after a lengthy review process, the Harvard group obtained final approval for their research on ethical, legal, and intellectual property issues. In May 2006, scientists at UCSF and ACT independently announced their own advancements in cloning research. Both UCSF and Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) announced they would resume efforts to produce cloned human embryos for research, following the success of cloning in South Korea in February 2004. Clonaid claimed the birth of the first cloned human, a baby girl named Eve, in December 2002, but no proof has been provided yet. Clonaid, founded by the leader of the Raelians, claims to have 13 cloned babies alive and performs monthly implantations. The FDA is investigating the company for illegal human cloning activities. Advanced Cell Technology announced creating the world's first human embryos. Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) of Massachusetts created the world's first human embryos via cloning using SCNT and parthenogenesis techniques. Eggs from seven women were used, and in the SCNT approach, the nucleus from adult cells was replaced. Some eggs did not divide or stopped at the four-to-six-cell stage. In parthenogenesis, chemicals were used to induce division in egg cells, but only six matured before division stopped. None of the embryos developed further. Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) aimed to produce human embryonic stem cells for therapeutic purposes, such as treating diseases like diabetes and Parkinson's. Stem cells could potentially replace damaged tissue in patients. The SCNT technique, where the cell nucleus is from the patient, may offer the best hope for successful tissue transplantation using stem cells. Dr. Richard Seed's announcement heightened concerns over human cloning. Dr. Richard Seed's announcement about human cloning in 1998 led to proposed legislation in Congress to ban or impose a moratorium on human cloning. Other scientists, such as Dr. Panos Zavos and Dr. Severino Antinori, also expressed interest in reproductive cloning. Dr. Antinori claimed to have implanted cloned human embryos in women, but his claims were disputed. In 1998, Dr. Richard Seed announced human cloning, leading to proposed legislation in Congress. Dr. Zavos claimed to have implanted a cloned embryo into a woman, but the pregnancy failed. Federal funding for research involving human embryos, including IVF and cloning, has been blocked for 25 years. The Ethics Advisory Board found IVF research acceptable in 1979. The Ethics Advisory Board's recommendations on human IVF research were not adopted by HHS, leading to a de facto moratorium on such research. This moratorium was lifted in 1993 with the NIH Revitalization Act, which nullified the regulatory provision requiring EAB review of IVF proposals. The Human Embryo Research Panel released guidelines and recommendations on human embryo research in September 1994. They identified certain areas of research as unacceptable or needing additional review, including cloning techniques without transfer to the uterus. Federal funding for cloning techniques followed by transfer to the uterus was deemed unacceptable for the foreseeable future. The Panel recommended federal funding for some areas of human embryo research, such as SCNT, stem cells, and embryos created solely for research purposes. The Human Embryo Research Panel's report on human embryo research was accepted by the NIH Advisory Committee to the Director in December 1994. President Clinton directed NIH not to support the creation of human embryos for research purposes, but research using spare embryos and human parthenotes was allowed. NIH's plans to develop guidelines for embryo research were halted in January 1996 with the enactment of P.L. 104-99. Research on human embryo creation for research purposes was halted in January 1996 with the enactment of P.L. 104-99, which included the Dickey Amendment prohibiting the use of funds for such research. This provision has been attached to appropriations acts from FY1997 to FY2006. The Dickey Amendment prohibited the use of funds for research on human embryos, including those derived by fertilization, parthenogenesis, cloning, or other means from human gametes or diploid cells. President Clinton extended the ban on federal funds for human cloning beyond HHS to all federally supported research. President Clinton urged a voluntary ban on human cloning in the private sector. The NIH Guidelines on Stem Cell Research under the Clinton Administration prohibited funding for reproductive cloning or using stem cells derived through SCNT. President Bush later allowed federal funds for existing stem cell lines but opposed human cloning. Federal funds were not to be used for cloning human embryos. President Bush established the President's Council on Bioethics to address medical and ethical issues of biomedical innovation. The Council, chaired by Dr. Leon Kass, discussed human cloning with members divided on therapeutic cloning support. Dr. Kass proposed that the Council's final report reflect arguments for and against cloning for medical treatment. Nine Council members initially supported cloning for research, but two later changed their votes in favor of a moratorium for further discussion. Some on the Council believe that the moratorium option was hastily added without proper discussion. The final vote of 10 to 7 in favor of a moratorium may not accurately represent the majority's stance on the ethics of biomedical cloning. The FDA regulates human cloning under certain acts, but some legal scholars question the basis for this regulation. The National Academies recommended banning human reproductive cloning due to safety concerns for both women and fetuses. The ban should be legally enforceable with penalties and reconsidered in five years with new data on safety and efficacy. The biotechnology industry and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine support FDA regulation of cloning. The National Academies recommend banning human reproductive cloning for safety reasons, with penalties and a review in five years. Research using SCNT for stem cells is supported for its potential in therapy and biomedical knowledge. The National Academies call for a global ban on human reproductive cloning and focus on therapeutic and research uses of stem cells. The National Academies released guidelines for human embryonic stem cell research in 2005, recommending oversight committees and a national panel. Certain types of research, like culturing embryos for over 14 days or inserting stem cells into embryos, are not permitted. The National Academies released guidelines for human embryonic stem cell research in 2005, recommending oversight committees and a national panel. The document provides guidance on informed consent of donors and prohibits breeding of animals with human embryonic stem cells. Legal scholars debate whether a ban on human cloning infringes on reproductive rights protected under the constitutional right to privacy and liberty. The Supreme Court recognizes human cloning research as a fundamental right, raising constitutional issues such as personal liberty and free speech. 15 states have passed laws regarding human cloning, with some prohibiting reproductive cloning and others addressing the use of public funds for cloning. Louisiana previously had legislation against reproductive cloning, but it expired in 2003. Six states also prohibit cloning for research or therapeutic purposes. Six states prohibit cloning for research or therapeutic purposes (Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota). Virginia law may also prohibit therapeutic cloning, but it is unclear due to the lack of definition of 'human being'. California and New Jersey laws permit cloning for research purposes. Rhode Island law is silent on therapeutic cloning and cloning for research purposes, with a sunset date of July 7, 2010. The 109th Congress addressed cloning and embryo research in the Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations Act of 2006, including the Dickey Amendment banning publically funded human embryo research. The Science, Justice and Commerce Appropriations Act, 2006, also prohibits the Patent and Trademark Office from issuing patents on claims related to human organisms. The 109th Congress addressed cloning and embryo research in the Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations Act of 2006, including the Dickey Amendment banning publicly funded human embryo research. The Science, Justice and Commerce Appropriations Act, 2006, also prohibits the Patent and Trademark Office from issuing patents on claims related to human organisms, potentially impacting human embryo and stem cell research. H.R. 810 (Castle), the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, passed the House on May 24, 2005, directing the Secretary of HHS to support research using human embryonic stem cells regardless of derivation date, with ethical guidelines set by the NIH. The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act allows for the derivation of stem cells from embryos not needed for fertility treatments. Written consent is required for embryo donation, and federal funds cannot be used for research on unapproved stem cell lines. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on stem cell research. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist announced an agreement on scheduling a vote on stem cell research legislation in 2006. The package of three bills required 60 votes to pass, including H.R. 810, S. 2754 (Santorum) for Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act, and S. 3504 (Santorum) for Fetus Farming Prohibition Act. S. 2754 aims to develop techniques for stem cell research without using human embryos, potentially leading to improved treatments for diseases. The Secretary would be required to provide guidance on research steps, prioritize research with clinical benefits, and consider bioethics techniques. An annual report on activities and research must be submitted to Congress. Funding is authorized for FY2007 through FY2009. Companion bills H.R. 5526 and S. 3504 were introduced. S. 3504 aims to prohibit the solicitation or acceptance of human fetal tissue obtained from deliberate pregnancies. The bill H.R. 810, related to human embryonic stem cell research, was passed by the Senate but vetoed by President Bush in 2006. A companion bill, H.R. 5719, was also introduced. Additionally, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2005, H.R. 1357, was introduced to ban human cloning. H.R. 1357, known as the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2005, aims to ban human cloning and the importation of products derived from cloned embryos. The bill includes penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment and a $1 million fine. A similar bill, S. 658, was introduced with some differences, such as not banning the importation of products from therapeutic cloning. S. 658, part of the Public Health Service Act, includes penalties for human cloning, with a study required to assess the need for changes in the prohibition. It has been referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The Cloning Ban and Stem Cell Research Protection Act of 2005, introduced on April 26, 2005, would ban human reproductive cloning but allow cloning for medical research purposes, including stem cell research. It includes criminal penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment and civil penalties ranging from $1 million to $10 million. Reports are required to be prepared within one year of enactment to monitor enforcement of the prohibition on human reproductive cloning. H.R. 1822 and S. 876 aim to regulate human SCNT in accordance with ethical requirements, including informed consent and protections for safety and privacy. They also prohibit SCNT on fertilized human eggs and mention \"unfertilized blastocysts.\" The bills require reports on enforcement actions at federal, state, and local levels, as well as laws adopted by foreign countries related to human cloning. Both S. 876 and H.R. 1822 regulate human SCNT, prohibiting its use on fertilized human eggs and unfertilized blastocysts after 14 days. They require voluntary egg donation with informed consent and prohibit the acquisition of eggs for valuable consideration. Violations of ethical requirements could result in a civil penalty of up to $250,000. Supporters of a ban on human cloning argue that a partial ban like S. 876 would be difficult to enforce, while critics claim it would hinder medical research. The ethical implications of using cloning technology for reproduction raise moral questions. The Bush Administration and National Academies have taken clear stances on human cloning. In 2002, the President's Council on Bioethics issued a report on Human Cloning and Human Dignity, with majority and minority opinions opposing reproductive cloning. The Council was split on therapeutic cloning, with the majority against and the minority in favor. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission recommended a moratorium on federal funding for reproductive cloning and legislation banning cloning for reproductive purposes with a sunset clause. Various organizations and individuals also weighed in on the issue. Various organizations and individuals have issued opinions on cloning, with differing views on its ethical and practical implications. The debate includes opposition to human cloning for any purpose, support for regulated cloning for therapeutic reasons but not for reproduction, and advocates for cloning for reproductive purposes. Key figures in the debate include the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, a group of Nobel Laureates, Nancy Reagan, Gerald Ford, Dr. Severino Antinori, and Clonaid. The ethical and moral issues surrounding human cloning are at the center of the discussion. The discussion surrounding human cloning delves into ethical, moral, and factual beliefs, highlighting the complexity of the issues. Supporters of reproductive cloning advocate for it to help infertile couples have genetically-related children, prevent genetic diseases, replicate specific individuals, or create ideal transplant donors. These arguments are based on principles of individual liberty and the personal nature of human reproduction. The idea of cloning for reproductive purposes is presently rejected by most groups and organizations, with only Clonaid and Dr. Antinori favoring it at this time. Despite the uniform rejection of reproductive cloning, there are varying lines of reasoning underlying objections, such as the moral law opposing attempts to obtain a human being through cloning. Most groups reject reproductive cloning, with safety concerns being the main objection. The President's Council on Bioethics and the National Bioethics Advisory Commission both highlight the risks and ethical issues associated with cloning-to-produce-children. Current scientific information indicates that human reproductive cloning is not safe, as demonstrated by animal experimentation showing low success rates, high mortality rates during gestation, and abnormal newborn clones. Safety concerns are widely held but may decrease as research advances. Other objections, more philosophical in nature, are less likely to be alleviated by scientific progress and have been acknowledged by various organizations. The President's Council and the UCSSB have varying moral concerns about reproductive cloning. Some fear cloned children will struggle with identity, but others dismiss this as genetic determinism. Philosophical objections include the fear of cloned children being seen as manufactured products. Reproductive cloning raises concerns about children being viewed as products of a manufacturing process, potentially leading to increased commercialization and a new form of eugenics. Some argue that similar worries were raised with other assisted reproduction methods without leading to objectification. Additionally, the benefit to the child is seen as a key factor in determining whether objectification occurs. Reproductive cloning raises concerns about family relationships and societal impacts, with potential for confusion and strain on social ties. The effects on children born through assisted reproductive technologies are debated, with concerns about objectification and commercialization. The debate over cloning extends beyond participants to society as a whole, with concerns about societal views on children and future interventions in genetics. While some reject these objections, arguing that people can adapt to new technologies, others support therapeutic cloning due to safety concerns not applying in this context. The scientific community, including the National Academies, is largely in favor of therapeutic cloning. The debate over therapeutic cloning involves support from the scientific community, including the President's Council and Nobel Laureates, for potential research benefits in treating diseases. However, opponents like the USCCB raise ethical concerns about the transformation of human life into a resource tool. The USCCB opposes the idea of regarding embryos as equivalent to human persons, stating that embryos in their earliest stages have developing moral worth. They argue that embryos at the blastocyst stage are not yet individuals and could potentially split into twinned embryos. The minority also points out that the development of a human child from a cloned embryo would require transfer to a uterus, similar to the process in IVF where unimplanted embryos are created and permitted in the United States. Therapeutic cloning is supported by the Council minority, NBAC, Nancy Reagan, Gerald Ford, and Nobel Laureates. Dr. Paul McHugh and Dr. William Hurlbut, members of the President's Council, have proposed using SCNT for research while ensuring ethical conduct. Dr. Hurlbut proposed a technique using nuclear transfer to generate embryonic stem cells without creating human embryos, which has been both criticized and praised for its potential to address moral concerns. Dr. Leon Kass, a critic of embryo destruction, sees the proposal as a way for scientific progress and protection of human life to work together. The debate surrounding the creation of human life for research purposes involves moral considerations about using embryos for biomedical research. The President's Council and USCCB argue that creating life for research purposes devalues human life, while the minority view suggests using embryos for the greater good of medicine. This debate is reminiscent of the ethical dilemma of sacrificing unborn life to save the mother, highlighting the complexity of moral precedents in medical research. The NBAC, Nancy Reagan, Gerald Ford, and Nobel Laureates support using cloned embryos for biomedical research, citing moral precedent. The President's Council majority expresses concerns about negative societal effects of therapeutic cloning, such as subjugation of weak members and genetic manipulation. They argue that approving therapeutic cloning would harm society by crossing moral boundaries. The USCCB and some others support genetic manipulation and control of human life through cloning. Counter arguments highlight the importance of maintaining intellectual freedom and note that cloning is replication, not transformation. NBAC, Nancy Reagan, Gerald Ford, and Nobel Laureates share this perspective. Some Nobel Laureates and other advocates believe that policies allowing therapeutic cloning could lead to moral hazards like cloning-to-produce-children or research on later-stage embryos. However, others, including NBAC, Nancy Reagan, Gerald Ford, and the Council minority, argue that good policy can regulate acceptable practices. They suggest that government regulations on researchers' methods can protect research subjects and community safety, including secure handling of embryos, licensing of research projects, protection of egg donors, and equal access to benefits. The topic of egg procurement gained public attention in 2005 with allegations related to Dr. Hwang's research. In November 2005, allegations surfaced regarding the procurement of human eggs in Dr. Hwang's laboratory, raising concerns about coercion and lack of informed consent. A 2002 study highlighted the issue of insufficient information provided to egg donors for reproductive purposes. There is debate on whether payment for eggs constitutes coercion, with a consensus on the need for an information-rich, coercion-free method of obtaining eggs. The debate over paying women for their eggs has been ongoing, with varying amounts offered by IVF programs. Dr. Huang's laboratory reportedly paid $1,400 per egg donation. The legality of such payments is questioned, leading to discussions on the acceptability and appropriate amount for egg donation compensation. Payment for egg donation has been debated, with arguments in favor including creating incentives for more donors, giving women parity with sperm donors, fairness for donors, and minimizing coercion. ASRM recommended up to $5,000 for typical egg donation in 2000. In 2000, ASRM recommended sums of up to $5,000 for typical egg donation, with potential justification for up to $10,000 in cases of particular difficulties. Arguments against payment for egg donation include fears of exploitation, commodification of reproductive tissues, and undermining public confidence in research. The NAS and PCBE recommend against payment for egg donation for research purposes. There is also the possibility of procuring eggs from cadaver ovaries to alleviate coercion concerns. The debate surrounding payment for egg donation revolves around concerns of exploitation and commodification of reproductive tissues. One alternative is for women to undergo egg retrieval for their own reproductive purposes, removing the need for payment. Governmental policies on therapeutic and reproductive cloning range from permitting to banning, with varying justifications required for interference in individual activities. The most permissive approach to cloning, allowing it with regulations, is supported by various individuals and organizations. They believe in supporting therapeutic cloning within sensible limits imposed by regulation to provide relief to millions of Americans. Another approach, a voluntary prohibition on reproductive cloning by the private sector, was recommended as an immediate response. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) recommended a temporary ban on reproductive cloning, calling for compliance from the private sector and federal legislation to prohibit creating a child through somatic cell nuclear transfer. The legislation should include a sunset clause for Congress to review the prohibition after three to five years. The National Academies recommended a ban on reproductive cloning, with a suggestion to reconsider it every five years. The Council proposed a temporary moratorium on therapeutic cloning to uphold moral norms and support science. Nancy Reagan and the Council majority advocated for a permanent ban on cloning for reproduction, aligning with the ethical consensus and public opinion. The USCCB and various groups support federal funding for therapeutic cloning, citing potential advancements and ethical protections. No proposals have been made for federal funding for reproductive cloning. Opponents fear it would mandate the destruction of human life, while proponents argue for the benefits of research. The USCCB and various groups support federal funding for therapeutic cloning, citing potential advancements and ethical protections. No proposals have been made for federal funding for reproductive cloning. Opponents fear it would mandate the destruction of human life, while proponents argue for the benefits of research. Federal dollars would bring ethical protections to the research."
