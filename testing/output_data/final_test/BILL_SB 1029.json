    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that California's 4,200 local government units have accumulated $1.5 trillion in debt since 1984. The California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission (CDIAC) was established in 1982 to provide guidance on debt issuance and investments to public agencies. CDIAC has become a national leader in public finance over the past three decades. State and local government debt in the U.S. totals around $3.7 trillion, with 75 percent held by households and mutual funds. Transparency in public debt is crucial for government and market integrity. State and local agencies should follow debt management policies recommended by the Government Finance Officers Association to comply with laws and regulations. The California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission is created to oversee debt issuance by state and local governments. The commission consists of nine members, including the Treasurer, Governor, Controller, and local government finance officers. The Legislature aims for transparency by publishing all debt issuance in a single online database for public analysis. The California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission consists of nine members, including the Treasurer, Governor, Controller, and local government finance officers. Appointed members serve at the pleasure of the appointing power for a four-year term. Legislators appointed to the commission must participate in its activities. The Treasurer serves as the chairperson of the commission. The California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission members do not receive a salary but are entitled to a per diem allowance and expenses. The commission may adopt bylaws, meet when called by the chairperson or Governor, and a majority constitutes a quorum. The Treasurer's office provides administrative assistance, and the commission is responsible for specific duties. The California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission assists state financing authorities, local government units, and bond issuers in planning, marketing, and selling debt issues to reduce costs and protect credit. They collect and provide comprehensive information on state and local debt, maintain contact with bond issuers and investors, and aim to improve the market for government debt issues. The California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission aims to reduce costs and improve credit ratings of state and local debt issues. They recommend changes in laws and practices, provide education for local officials, collect information on local agency investments, and publish a monthly newsletter on their operations. The issuer of any proposed debt issue of state or local government must submit a report to the commission 30 days before the sale, including details on the debt issuance and certification of local debt policies. The issuer must provide details on the purposes, types of debt, relationship to capital improvement program, policy goals, and internal control procedures for the proposed debt issuance. If the bonds will be used by another governmental entity, that entity must certify adoption of the issuer's policies. The issuer of any state or local government debt issue must submit a final sale report to the commission within 21 days, along with relevant documents. The commission may request additional information as needed, and confidential information can be redacted before submission. The public agency must submit an annual report for any debt issued after January 21, 2017, covering a reporting period from July 1 to June 30. The report should be submitted within seven months after the reporting period ends, using an approved method. The report should include details on authorized debt during the reporting period. Debt reporting requirements include details on authorized, issued, and outstanding debt during the reporting period, as well as the use of proceeds from issued debt. Debt reporting requirements mandate disclosure of remaining debt proceeds at the end of the reporting period for each issue of debt. The commission may develop an alternate reporting method if technology allows, consulting with debt issuers to streamline the process."
