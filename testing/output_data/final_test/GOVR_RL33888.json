    "content": "In recent years, \"527 organizations,\" \"527 groups,\" and \"527s\" have been used interchangeably to describe groups influencing federal elections outside federal election law. These organizations are tax-exempt under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, which applies to various organizations beyond those involved in federal elections. The controversy arises from differing definitions in federal election and tax laws regarding political activity regulation. Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code provides tax-exempt status to political organizations involved in federal elections. The focus of controversy lies on 527 organizations that aim to influence federal elections outside the scope of federal election law. These organizations are interchangeably referred to as 527 groups or 527s. The addition of Section 527 in 1975 aimed to grant tax-exempt status to political organizations, initially correlating with political committees under federal election law. Some political committees claimed tax-exempt status under IRC \u00a7 527 without being regulated by FECA. FECA governs financial activity in federal elections, imposing limitations and requiring public disclosure. The Supreme Court's Buckley v. Valeo ruling struck down spending limits in federal elections. In the landmark 1976 Buckley v. Valeo ruling, federal law does not impose mandatory limits on campaign spending by candidates or groups. Prohibitions include unions and corporations being banned from making contributions or expenditures in federal elections. Contribution limits apply to candidates, parties, and PACs in federal elections. Foreign nationals are also prohibited from contributing or spending money in any American election, with an exemption for permanent resident aliens. Contribution limits for federal elections include $2,300 per candidate, per election for individuals, $5,000 per year to a PAC, and an aggregate of $108,200 in a two-year election cycle to all federal candidates, parties, and PACs. Most PACs and party committees can give a candidate $5,000 per election. Disclosure requirements mandate registration with the FEC and filing periodic reports on receipts and expenditures for candidates, PACs, and parties involved in federal elections. Only funds raised and spent according to federal law requirements can be used to influence federal elections. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) defines \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" as funds used to influence federal elections. The Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo limited these terms to funds donated or spent for express advocacy. The Buckley Court also established the \"major purpose test\" to determine if an organization is under the control of a candidate or primarily focused on nominating or electing a candidate. The \"major purpose test\" determines if an organization is subject to regulation under FECA as a \"political committee\" based on fundraising and expenditures. The debate revolves around how to ascertain an organization's major purpose, with some arguing for a broader examination of activities beyond express advocacy. The Supreme Court precedent limits FECA regulation to organizations engaging in express advocacy. Prior to 1975, the IRS did not require organizations influencing elections to file tax returns or pay taxes. However, in 1973, the IRS started taxing political committees and parties with income from investments and other sources. Congress responded in 1975 by limiting tax-exempt status to organizations engaging in express advocacy. In 1975, Congress added Section 527 to the Internal Revenue Code in response to IRS actions. Section 527 applies to political organizations primarily involved in influencing elections. Section 527 political organizations are taxed on their gross income, excluding exempt function income, at the highest corporate income tax rate. However, the income of the principal campaign committee of a congressional candidate is taxed using the graduated corporate tax rate schedule. The tax treatment of Section 527 political organizations differs from campaign committees of candidates for state or local office. Political organizations were only required to contact the IRS if they had taxable income under P.L. 93-625. This law focused on tax treatment rather than regulation, possibly due to political organizations being viewed as candidate funds and political parties. The 1996 election cycle saw a shift in campaign conduct and efforts to regulate money flow in federal elections. In 1995 and 1996, political parties and interest groups engaged in issue advocacy through broadcast communications to influence federal races. These activities did not explicitly endorse candidates but aimed to shape public opinion. Issue advocacy allowed for the use of soft money without disclosure requirements, becoming a significant aspect of political campaigns. The rise of issue advocacy in the late 1990s saw a significant increase in spending on broadcast communications, reaching over $500 million by 2000. This trend raised concerns about circumventing election laws, prompting efforts for campaign finance reform. Efforts in Congress to address concerns about money in politics focused on the high costs of seeking office and the role of political action committees in funding federal elections. Legislative proposals aimed to curb PAC money and impose spending limits in exchange for public funding or other benefits. Comprehensive reform bills were passed by the House and Senate in the 101st, 102nd, and 103rd sessions. In the 101st, 102nd, and 103rd Congresses, comprehensive reform bills were passed addressing campaign finance issues, including spending limits and public funding. Senators McCain and Feingold introduced a reform bill in the 104th Congress, continuing the push for campaign finance reform. In response to concerns about the high cost of congressional elections and the influence of private funds, reform advocates in Congress introduced legislation in the 105th Congress to curb campaign spending and regulate election-related activity. Senators McCain and Feingold, along with Representatives Shays and Meehan, proposed bills that redefined \"express advocacy\" to allow for federal regulation of more election-related activities. In 1997, a revised S. 25 was introduced with provisions addressing party soft money and issue advocacy, eliminating key elements of reformers' objectives. The campaign finance debate shifted towards saving the regulatory system from new campaign practices, leading to the enactment of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act in 2002. In 1996, the IRS issued private rulings on activities influencing elections under IRC \u00a7 527, leading to awareness that issue advocacy groups could qualify for tax-exempt status. Post-1996 election, attention focused on 527 groups engaging in election-influencing activities without following FECA rules. Several politically active non-profit groups are reclassifying themselves as political groups to take advantage of tax breaks for donors and maintain secrecy over their activities. Two groups, Citizens for Reform and Citizens for the Republic Education Fund, are switching their tax status to 527 status. The controversial Triad Management Services, Inc., a conservative consulting and fundraising organization, is under Senate investigation for its role in the 1996 elections. Senator Lieberman introduced a bill to regulate election-related activities of tax-exempt organizations, mentioning the shift of some groups to 527 status for tax benefits and less political activity restrictions. Groups claiming they are not subject to FECA because they don't engage in express advocacy, despite being defined similarly to Section 527. 527s were established by various groups for election-related issue advocacy campaigns. Issue advocacy became a contentious topic in campaign finance debates by 2000 due to the interpretation of Supreme Court precedent, allowing regulation of communications with express advocacy. Groups could promote their views without explicitly urging the election or defeat of federal candidates. A group called Republicans for Clean Air entered the political scene during the 2000 presidential primaries, spending over $2 million on TV ads attacking Senator John McCain and supporting Governor George W. Bush's environmental record. This drew attention to 527 organizations and their activities, leading to increased focus on them in the media. In 2000, news accounts began focusing on 527 groups, which were being used for issue advocacy campaigns and creating soft money leadership PACs. The emergence of 527s raised questions about regulating election-related issue advocacy by tax-exempt groups under the IRC. Congress was grappling with regulating non-express advocacy activity amidst the 527 issue. Congress took a different approach to regulating non-express advocacy activity by focusing on the nature of the entity engaging in it rather than the nature of the activity itself. This led to the requirement of disclosure to the IRS by groups with tax-exempt 527 status in P.L. 106-230. This action was seen as a provisional measure to address the urgent need for regulation under election law. Senator Feingold emphasized the importance of promptly passing a bill to address these issues. The Means Committee and the full House are working on passing a bill to increase transparency for 527 organizations. While this is a crucial first step in campaign finance reform, more comprehensive measures, such as banning soft money, are still needed. The focus is on addressing the 527 problem in this Congress, without letting broader reforms delay progress. The 106th and 107th Congresses passed laws on disclosure by 527 organizations and the BCRA addressed various campaign finance issues. The 106th and 107th Congresses passed laws on disclosure by 527 organizations, requiring them to report information to the IRS, FEC, or a state. The first law added disclosure requirements in 2000 and the second in 2002. Organizations must notify the IRS of their existence within 24 hours of formation unless exempt. The 106th and 107th Congresses passed laws requiring 527 organizations to report to the IRS, FEC, or state. P.L. 107-276 added an exemption for state and local political committees. Organizations must disclose contributions and expenditures, including contributor information for donations over $200, on a quarterly or monthly basis. The disclosure requirements for expenditures made to a person if the total annual expenditures to that person was at least $500 include the person's name, address, occupation, and employer. Exemptions apply to certain political organizations, independent expenditures, and state and local political committees. Changes in rules for filing tax and information returns were made by P.L. 106-230 and P.L. 107-276. P.L. 106-230 and P.L. 107-276 changed the rules for filing tax and information returns for political organizations. Organizations with at least $25,000 in gross receipts must file a tax return, and if they file a tax return, they must also file an information return. P.L. 107-276 reversed the requirement for tax returns, so now only organizations with taxable income need to file. Information returns are required for political organizations with gross receipts of at least $25,000, unless they are exempt state or local committees. Under P.L. 106-230 and P.L. 107-276, organizations must file tax and information returns if they have at least $25,000 in gross receipts. The rules apply to various political organizations, with exceptions for certain committees and parties. The legislation also mandates public disclosure of Section 527 status, expenditures, contributions, and tax returns, with the IRS required to post this information online. Additionally, electronically submitted disclosure reports must be made available online, and the IRS is tasked with improving its online database. P.L. 107-276 eliminated the requirement for tax returns to be made public under P.L. 106-230. It also grants the IRS the authority to waive penalties for failure to disclose if due to reasonable cause. H.R. 2356, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, created the term \"electioneering communications\" for political ads referring to federal candidates near elections. This was done to enhance the law's chances of withstanding judicial scrutiny. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, known as BCRA, regulates electioneering communications near federal elections. It prohibits funding such communications with union or corporate treasury funds and requires disclosure of donors over $1,000. Despite legal challenges, the Supreme Court largely upheld BCRA in McConnell v. FEC in 2003. The Supreme Court largely upheld the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 in McConnell v. FEC, including Title II. The Court determined that BCRA's regulation of \"electioneering communications\" is constitutional, even though they may not contain express advocacy. This decision clarified that the distinction between express and issue advocacy in Buckley v. Valeo was a matter of statutory interpretation, not a constitutional requirement. The Supreme Court clarified in McConnell v. FEC that a statute not vague or overbroad wouldn't need to meet the same express advocacy standard. The presence of magic words doesn't distinguish electioneering speech from issue ads. Despite BCRA's electioneering provisions, 501(c) and 527 organizations can still engage in federal election activities like voter registration and advertising. Groups can use soft money for activities not covered by BCRA Title II, especially after the prohibition on national party use of non-federally-permissible funds for voter mobilization. Enactment of P.L. 106-230 allowed for disclosure of financial activity of 527 groups, with reports showing receipts of $73.5 million and expenditures of $103.0 million. Key groups involved in federal elections had receipts of $61.3 million and expenditures of $88.6 million. During the 2000 elections, key 527 groups related to federal elections raised $61.3 million and spent $88.6 million. Democratic-oriented groups raised $39.7 million, while Republican-oriented groups raised $21.6 million. Citizens for Better Medicare was the largest 527 group, spending $40-$65 million on issue advocacy. Established interest groups like the Sierra Club and the NAACP also formed 527s. Receipts totaled $215.2 million, with prominent donors contributing to these groups. In the 2002 election cycle, reports showed receipts of $215.2 million and expenditures of $229.5 million. Key groups had receipts of $183.6 million and expenditures of $193.6 million, with $104.3 million raised by Democratic-oriented groups and $78.2 million by Republican-oriented groups. In the 2004 elections, 527 organizations saw a significant increase in financial level and importance due to various factors. In the 2004 election cycle, 527 committees played a major role in determining the outcome of the national election, with receipts of $582.1 million and expenditures of $595.5 million. Key groups raised $431.5 million, more than double the amount spent in 2002, with $264.0 million raised by Democratic-oriented groups and $165.7 million by Republican-oriented groups. In the 2004 election cycle, Democratic-oriented groups raised $264.0 million and Republican-oriented groups raised $165.7 million. Tables 5 and 6 provide data on the largest 527 groups and donors in the 2004 election cycle. Analysts studied the impact of the prohibition on party soft money in BCRA on donations to 527s. The Campaign Finance Institute found that while some unregulated money flowed to outside groups, it did not replace the majority of soft money banned by the McCain-Feingold law. The study contrasted a $273 million increase in 2004 receipts by 527s with the $591 million raised in soft money by party committees in 2002. Despite this, BCRA did not stop large donations by wealthy individuals and entities, with top donors contributing a significant portion of 527 receipts in 2004. The study found that donors gave three times more to 527s in 2004 than to parties in 2000 and 2002 combined. Of the $405 million in 527 receipts, $256 million was from individual donors, $112 million from labor unions, and $30 million from businesses. The impact of 527s on the 2004 campaign was significant, with major Democratic-leaning groups playing a key role in keeping the presidential race close. In 2004, major Democratic-leaning groups like AFL-CIO, MoveOn, and America Coming Together played a significant role in the presidential race. Republican-leaning groups like Swift Boat Veterans For Truth and Progress for America had a substantial impact later in the election. The ground strategy run by the Republican National Committee and the ground work of the liberal America Votes coalition were highlighted. The legal prohibition against coordinating activities with candidates and political parties may have limited the effectiveness of the major 527s in 2004. In 2004, the legal prohibition against coordinating activities with candidates and political parties limited the effectiveness of major 527s. The most novel aspect of 527 activity related to voter mobilization efforts, which had a clear impact on the election. Reports showed significant financial activity in the 2006 election cycle. In the 2006 election cycle, key groups had receipts of $215.2 million and expenditures of $234.7 million, with Democratic and Republican-oriented groups raising $109.4 million and $103.0 million respectively. This marked an increase over 2002 and showed near parity between the parties for the first time since 2000. Tables 7 and 8 provide data on the largest 527 groups and donors in the 2006 election cycle, while Table 9 summarizes spending and receipts by 527 organizations involved in federal elections. Efforts to address the activity of 527 organizations involved in federal elections have been ongoing since the 2004 elections. Supporters of BCRA insist that these groups must register as political committees and comply with federal election law. Concerns have been raised over the FEC's failure to enforce regulations, leading to court challenges and lawsuits, including one filed by the Bush-Cheney campaign. The Bush-Cheney campaign filed a lawsuit to block 527 groups during the 2004 elections; House and Senate committees held hearings in 2004 and 2005, reporting bills to regulate 527 organizations under FECA in the 109th Congress. The House passed legislation in 2006. Concerns about 527s have different origins, with BCRA supporters blaming FEC enforcement failures and launching efforts to replace the agency, while critics attribute the issue to the ban on soft money activities by national parties. The FEC did not adopt any new regulations addressing the regulation of 527 organizations before the 2004 presidential election, despite receiving public comments and holding hearings on the issue. The FEC has not adopted new regulations for 527 organizations, except for political committee rules in 2004. FECA defines a political committee as a group receiving or spending over $1,000 in a calendar year for influencing elections. The Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo cautioned that the definition of political committee should avoid overbreadth by focusing on organizations controlled by candidates or with a major purpose of influencing elections. The FEC discussed amending regulations to include the \"major purpose test\" in defining nonconnected political committees under FECA. The proposed two-part test would determine if an organization is a political committee based on receiving or spending over $1,000. The FEC proposed a two-part test to determine if an organization is a political committee based on receiving or spending over $1,000 per calendar year and having the major purpose of nominating or electing a federal office candidate. Three alternative tests were considered, involving different thresholds of spending on contributions, expenditures, electioneering communications, and federal election activities. The FEC proposed a two-part test to determine if an organization is a political committee based on receiving or spending over $1,000 per calendar year and having the major purpose of nominating or electing a federal office candidate. This includes voter registration drives, voter identification, Get-Out-the-Vote drives, public communications related to federal candidates, and services by state or local party employees in connection with a federal election. The FEC also considered alternative methods for determining the major purpose of nominating or electing federal office candidates, specifically for 527 organizations. Alternative 2-A proposes criteria for determining the major purpose of 527 organizations in relation to nominating or electing federal office candidates, with specific exceptions outlined. Alternative 2-B would classify all 527 organizations as meeting the major purpose test, subjecting them to FEC regulation. This includes registration, disclosure reports, use of PACs for contributions, and contribution limits for individuals and organizations. Opponents argue against these proposed regulations. The proposed regulations aim to limit campaign contributions to no more than $5,000 per candidate per election. Opponents argue that these regulations could wrongly subject non-profit groups to FEC regulation, potentially threatening grassroots advocacy. Proponents believe that non-profits would not be affected as they cannot have a major purpose of influencing federal elections. The NPRM also suggests redefining what constitutes a political committee and amending FECA regulations regarding expenditures. The Supreme Court in Buckley adopted a narrow construction of FECA's definition of expenditure, limiting it to \"funds used for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\" This was to avoid vagueness and potential overbreadth in the statutory definition. Many in the campaign finance reform community have criticized the Court's express advocacy test as articulated in Buckley. The reform community criticized the Court's express advocacy test in Buckley for failing to distinguish between issue ads and campaign ads. The Supreme Court, in McConnell v. FEC, clarified that communications can influence elections regardless of express advocacy. The FEC proposed changes in line with the Court's jurisprudence. The FEC proposed amending the definition of expenditure to include payments for public communications supporting or opposing candidates or political parties. Critics fear the broadened definition may classify non-party groups as political committees, while supporters argue it is narrowly tailored. The FEC amended the definition of expenditure to include payments for public communications supporting or opposing candidates. A new regulation in October 2004 focused on political committees and fundraising with solicitations that support or oppose federal candidates. Organizations with $1,000 or more in contributions are subject to FECA regulation, but the new rule did not address key questions. The FEC amended the definition of expenditure to include payments for public communications supporting or opposing candidates. A new rule in October 2004 focused on political committees and fundraising with solicitations that support or oppose federal candidates. The rule failed to address when nonparty groups must register with the FEC as political committees. EMILY's List filed a lawsuit against the FEC in January 2005, arguing that the new rule violated their First Amendment rights. The court denied EMILY's List motion for a preliminary injunction regarding state and local election activities, upholding the FEC's new rule to prevent corruption in elections. The court found that the FEC followed proper procedures and the regulations were constitutionally sound. The FEC issued a \"Supplemental Explanation and Justification\" in 2007 regarding political committee status and 527 organizations. The FEC stated that Section 527 status alone is not enough to determine political committee status under FECA and Supreme Court requirements. The IRS's criteria for tax exemption under Section 527 are different from the FEC's criteria for political committee status. The FEC will continue to follow FECA and Supreme Court precedent in determining political committee status. The FEC will determine political committee status based on contributions or expenditures over $1,000 in a calendar year and the organization's \"major purpose\" being campaign activity. They will consider if solicitations resulted in contributions for supporting or opposing a federal candidate and analyze if independent expenditures for communications constituted express advocacy. The FEC's recent enforcement actions and guidance demonstrate an effective mechanism for compliance. The FEC's recent enforcement actions and guidance show an effective mechanism for regulating organizations that should be registered as political committees under FECA, regardless of tax status. The FEC has fined some 527 activities in recent elections and determined that certain 527s should have registered as political committees. Settlements were reached with three 527 organizations accused of violating FECA during the 2004 presidential election cycle. In the 2004 presidential election cycle, the FEC fined several organizations for failing to register as political committees and comply with campaign finance laws. The organizations agreed to pay civil penalties for their violations. In 2007, the FEC fined America Coming Together (ACT) $775,000 for improper spending on federal election activities. The FEC also fined The Media Fund (TMF) $580,000 for failing to register as a political committee and accepting contributions that exceeded limits. The FEC has emphasized enforcement actions against 527 organizations. The FEC has taken enforcement actions against 527 organizations, imposing large fines. Some groups argue that fines are insufficient compared to illegal campaign spending. The House Administration Committee investigated tax-exempt 527 political organizations post-BCRA, issuing subpoenas for testimony. In 2004, the committee held an oversight hearing on the FEC's postponement of a decision on redefining \"political committee\" to include many 527 groups. The 527 Reform Act of 2004 sought to address issues with 527 organizations influencing elections, bridging differences in federal election and tax law definitions. It aimed to include 527 groups under the FECA definition of \"political committee,\" subjecting them to regulations unless exempt. The 527 Reform Act of 2005 aimed to include 527 political organizations under FECA regulations, with revised bills dropping the \"major purpose\" standard to address concerns of tax-exempt organizations. The Senate Rules and Administration Committee, chaired by Lott, held a hearing on S. 271 (McCain-Feingold-Lott) on March 8, 2005. The bill aimed to regulate 527s in federal elections, with amendments added to loosen hard money restrictions and lower broadcast rates. The original bill was reported as S. 1053 on May 17, 2005, supplanting S. 271. On March 15, 2005, Representatives Mike Pence and Albert Wynn introduced H.R. 1316, the 527 Fairness Act of 2005, as a response to the perceived 527 problem. The bill aimed to loosen restrictions on other players in the political process to offset the influence of 527 groups. The House Administration Committee held a hearing on H.R. 1316 on April 20, 2005, and on June 7, the bill was ordered reported favorably with new provisions added. The House passed H.R. 513 (Shays-Meehan) on April 5, 2006, as the 527 Reform Act of 2006, with a 218-209 vote. The bill included a floor amendment removing political party coordinated expenditure limits. The text of H.R. 513 was later added to H.R. 4975, the Lobbying Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which passed the House on May 3, 2006. The House passed H.R. 513 (Shays-Meehan) on April 5, 2006, as the 527 Reform Act of 2006, with a 218-209 vote. Rules prohibit leadership PAC funds from being converted to personal use but allow transfer to national party committees. H.R. 4975 was substituted for S. 2349 for a conference with the Senate, which did not include 527 provisions. Conflict between House and Senate on 527s delayed resolution in the 109th Congress. H.R. 4696 by Rep. Mike Rogers would restrict 527 organizations from making electioneering communications. Several bills were introduced in the 109th and 110th Congress to address issues related to 527 groups' lack of accountability. These bills aimed to enhance disclosure requirements in the Internal Revenue Code to provide voters with more information about these groups and their financiers. Notable bills included H.R. 471, H.R. 914, H.R. 1942, H.R. 2204, H.R. 420, and S. 463 sponsored by various representatives and senators. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to address issues with 527 groups. Two bills, S. 463 and H.R. 2316, focused on disclosure requirements for lobbyists and 527 organizations reporting to the IRS. Another bill, H.R. 1204, aimed to change periodic disclosure requirements for 527 organizations. The bill in the 110th Congress aimed to address issues with 527 groups by focusing on disclosure requirements for lobbyists and organizations reporting to the IRS. It also aimed to change periodic disclosure requirements for 527 organizations, including filing reports with the FEC. The key question remains whether additional regulation should occur through legislation, new FEC regulations, or enforcement of existing regulations, with uncertainty about court support for further regulation of 527 activity. Controversy surrounds whether regulation should be limited to organizations engaging in express advocacy, amid criticism that recent 527 activity threatens federal election law regulation effectiveness. The 110th Congress bill aimed to address issues with 527 groups by focusing on disclosure requirements for lobbyists and organizations reporting to the IRS. There is uncertainty about court support for further regulation of 527 activity, with controversy surrounding whether regulation should be limited to organizations engaging in express advocacy. In the event of further regulation, money might flow to other tax-exempt organizations like social welfare organizations and trade associations, which have limitations on political campaign activity under the IRC. Tax-exempt organizations under IRC \u00a7 501(c) are taxed if they spend on IRC \u00a7 527 exempt functions like influencing elections. They are taxed at the highest corporate rate on net investment income or exempt function expenditures. Additionally, they must comply with election laws, such as bans on unions and corporations contributing to federal elections."
