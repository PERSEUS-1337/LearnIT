Part L of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is further amended to establish survivor pensions for the beneficiaries of deceased public safety officers. The Bureau is required to pay an annual pension to one or more survivors in addition to other benefits. Survivor pensions are established for beneficiaries of deceased public safety officers under Part L of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. An annual pension is paid to survivors, with 80% going to a surviving spouse, and varying percentages to surviving children based on the number of children.

The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 provides survivor pensions for deceased public safety officers. The pension amount varies based on the relationship of the survivor to the officer, with percentages allocated to surviving children, spouses, or parents. If there are no surviving children or spouses, the pension is paid to the parents in equal shares. If none of the above apply, a pension equal to 20 percent of the applicable amount is paid to a designated beneficiary or to the individual who survived the officer. The pension under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is payable to the designated beneficiary or the individual who survived the officer, without regard to marital status or any other status.
