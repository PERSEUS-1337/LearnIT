    "content": "The Act titled \"Drill Responsibly in Leased Lands Act of 2008\" amends the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska by requiring the Secretary to conduct competitive leasing of oil and gas with at least one lease sale each year from 2009 to 2013. Additionally, it includes provisions for pipeline construction in the Reserve. The Secretary of Transportation will facilitate environmentally responsible pipeline construction in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve to transport oil and gas to existing infrastructure on the North Slope. Additionally, there will be facilitation of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Project. The Congress acknowledges the significant natural gas reserves on Federal and State lands in Alaska, which could help meet the energy needs of the United States. However, the lack of a natural gas transportation system has hindered the reserves from reaching markets in the lower 48 States. The President is tasked with coordinating with relevant parties to facilitate the construction of a natural gas transportation system. The Congress acknowledges the need for a natural gas pipeline from Alaska to the United States to access significant reserves and meet energy needs. The President is tasked with coordinating to expedite the construction of the pipeline. SEC. 5. PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS AND OTHER PIPELINE REQUIREMENTS. The President must require project labor agreements for pipelines under Federal law permits, emphasizing labor stability and meeting specific pipeline needs. The Secretary of Transportation must ensure pipeline operators transporting oil and gas in Alaska adhere to maintenance requirements. The Alaska Pipeline, or any federally approved pipeline transporting oil and gas from the North Slope of Alaska, must certify annually to the Secretary of Transportation that it is being fully maintained and operated efficiently. Violations of this requirement will result in civil penalties assessed by the Secretary of Transportation. SEC. 6. BAN ON EXPORT OF ALASKAN OIL. Repeals provision authorizing exports and reimposes prohibition on crude oil exports. SEC. 7. ISSUANCE OF NEW LEASES. After the issuance of regulations, the Secretary of the Interior cannot issue new oil or gas exploration leases on Federal lands unless the lessee certifies diligent development or production on existing leases. The Secretary will establish regulations defining \"diligently developing\" for oil and gas leases on Federal lands. Failure to comply with these regulations will result in civil penalties. The term \"lessee\" includes any entity controlling or producing oil or gas from Federal leases. The term \"lessee\" includes any person or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is in common control with a lessee, excluding those with a minority ownership interest in a lease for oil or natural gas exploration or production. SEC. 8. FAIR RETURN ON PRODUCTION OF FEDERAL OIL AND GAS RESOURCES. The Secretary of the Interior must ensure prompt and accurate royalty payments from lessees on Federal lands for oil and gas exploration. Recommendations for legislative action to improve royalty collection must be submitted to Congress within 180 days."
