Congress finds a shortage of qualified individuals willing to adopt or foster children in the child welfare system, leading to thousands of foster children without permanent homes. To address this, child welfare agencies should eliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and marital status in adoption and foster care procedures. Out of 400,000 children in foster care, over 101,000 are legally free for adoption, with 50,608 children adopted in 2013 and 23,090 youth aging out of the system. Research shows that youth who age out of the foster care system are at high risk for poverty, homelessness, incarceration, and early parenthood. Increasing adoption rates and establishing permanency for foster youth can lead to significant national cost savings. LGBT youth in foster care often face discrimination, harassment, and violence, with a majority of homeless LGBT youth having been in foster care previously. According to the Urban Justice Center, many young people find living on the streets safer than in group or foster homes. The Williams Institute estimates that 19% of same-sex couple households have children under 18. Additionally, 3 million LGBT individuals have had a child, and 6 million American adults and children have an LGBT parent. Same-sex couples are raising 1.4% of children as of 2013. As of 2013, same-sex couples are raising 1.4% of adopted children and fostering 1.7% of foster children with 2 parents. Studies show that children with same-sex parents have similar advantages and expectations for health, social, and psychological development as children with heterosexual parents. According to the Williams Institute, over 1/3 of child welfare agencies in the US reject gay, lesbian, and bisexual applicants, limiting the number of qualified adoptive and foster parents. This practice also denies these individuals the opportunity to care for their own kin. Over 22,000 children are raised by same-sex adoptive couples. If more States discriminated against qualified individuals based on sexual orientation, foster care costs could increase by $87-130 million annually. Some States allow one member of a same-sex couple to adopt but don't recognize both as legal parents, denying children equal rights and security. Professional organizations in various fields support qualified gay, lesbian, bisexual, and unmarried couples to foster and adopt children, citing research that shows sexual orientation does not determine parental success. Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in foster or adoptive parenting is condemned. The Act aims to decrease wait times for children in foster care and prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status in adoption and foster care placements. SEC. 3. EVERY CHILD DESERVES A FAMILY. An entity receiving Federal assistance for adoption or foster care placements cannot discriminate based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status of the person or child involved. They also cannot delay or deny placements based on these factors or require additional screenings. The section prohibits discrimination in adoptive or foster placement decisions based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. It defines placement decision as the decision to place a child in a foster or adoptive home, including seeking termination of birth parent rights. Individuals aggrieved by violations can seek equitable relief. The Act prohibits discrimination in foster care and adoption placement decisions based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide guidance and technical assistance to ensure compliance with the Act, including identifying inconsistent laws and regulations and providing training to bring them into compliance. The Act mandates guidance and training to ensure compliance with non-discrimination laws in foster care and adoption, including cultural competency training and recruitment efforts for all prospective parents. Training for judges and attorneys involved in these cases is also required. Compliance deadline is specified. Entities receiving Federal assistance for adoption or foster care must comply with non-discrimination laws within 6 months of guidance publication or 1 year of the Act's enactment. States can request deadline extensions for statutory law changes. After the 1st State legislative session, states must comply with guidance within a specified timeframe. The Secretary has the authority to withhold funds if a state fails to comply. A study will be conducted by the Comptroller General to assess state compliance with the Act within 5 years of its enactment. The States must eliminate barriers based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status for adoptive or foster parents and children. The Comptroller General must submit a report to Congress containing the results of a study on eliminating barriers based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status for adoptive or foster parents and children."
