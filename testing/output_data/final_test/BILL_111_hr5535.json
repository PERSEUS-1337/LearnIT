    "content": "The Federal Real Property Disposal Pilot Program amends Chapter 5 of title 40, United States Code, by adding a new subchapter for expedited disposal of real property. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will conduct a pilot program called the Federal Real Property Disposal Pilot Program to dispose of real property not meeting Federal Government needs. Criteria will be identified to determine such properties, with a target of generating at least $19 billion in proceeds from 2010 to 2019. Properties to be closed are excluded from the program. The Federal Real Property Disposal Pilot Program, established to dispose of real property not meeting Federal Government needs, will terminate on September 30, 2019. Agencies will recommend properties for disposal, and expedited disposal requirements involve selling real property for cash in accordance with specific regulations. The pilot program for real property disposal requires properties to be sold at fair market value to generate monetary proceeds for the Federal Government. Non-cash transactions are not allowed, and agencies still have other disposal authorities under different laws. The expedited disposal of Federal real property under this section is not subject to certain provisions of law, and agencies conducting these disposals will be reimbursed from the proceeds. After the expedited disposal of Federal real property, agencies will be reimbursed for administrative expenses from the proceeds. 80% of the remaining proceeds will go to the Treasury, while 20% will be allocated to the agency for real property capital improvements and disposal activities. Upon termination of the pilot program, any unobligated amounts will be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury. A clerical amendment will be made to the table of sections in chapter 5 of title 40, United States Code. \"Subchapter VII outlines the expedited disposal of real property through a pilot program, selection of properties, disposal requirements, and special rules for proceeds use.\""
