    "content": "SECTION 1. AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN AREAS FOR LEASING. Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to define terms like 'Atlantic Coastal State' and 'Governor' and to clarify 'qualified revenues' as sums due to the United States from leases. The Act defines terms related to natural gas exploration leases in Virginia, allowing the Governor to petition the Secretary for exploration activities beyond the coastal zone. The Act allows the Governor of Virginia to petition the Secretary for natural gas extraction activities beyond the coastal zone, with a detailed plan required in the petition. The Secretary must approve or deny a petition for natural gas exploration or extraction in the coastal zone, based on State legislation supporting the activity. The plan in the petition must align with relevant legislation. Atlantic Coastal States can provide comments on the petition, which the Secretary will consider but not be bound by. The Secretary cannot approve a petition that conflicts with military operations. The Secretary cannot approve a drilling activity if it conflicts with military operations. Revenues from the activity will be split with 50% going to a Clean Energy Fund and 50% to a special account for disbursement to states. The curr_chunk states that 12.5 percent of funds will be allocated to a reserve fund for mitigating environmental damage from extraction activities, regardless of the cause."
