They operate under the Federal Acquisition Regulation and have unique access to government data and resources. Congress has expressed concerns about the oversight and management of FFRDCs. FFRDCs have their origin in World War II, established to mobilize scientific talent for war efforts. The appropriate role of FFRDCs in federal R&D remains a concern for Congress. FFRDCs were established during World War II to support the development of the atomic bomb. They bring scientific and technical expertise to R&D challenges and offer flexibility in hiring and pay compared to the federal government. The name was changed to FFRDCs in 1967, with criteria including conducting basic and applied research. An FFRDC is required to conduct research or development under the direction of the federal government, receive 70% or more of its funding from one agency, have a long-term relationship with its sponsoring agency, be government-owned, and have an average annual budget of at least $500,000. The governance of FFRDCs was revised in 1984 by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, with regulations issued in 1990. The FAR now defines the purposes and policies governing FFRDCs. Currently, 12 federal agencies sponsor a total of 42 FFRDCs, providing R&D capabilities in various areas. DOE and DOD sponsor the majority, with NSF, DHS, HHS, NASA, NIST, DOT, NRC, Treasury, VA, and US Courts also sponsoring FFRDCs. FFRDCs are classified into three activity types under a system established by DOD. FFRDCs are classified into three activity types: R&D laboratories, study and analysis centers, and system engineering and integration centers. NSF maintains a master list of FFRDCs across the federal government, with 26 R&D laboratories, 10 study and analysis centers, and 6 system engineering and integration centers currently in operation. FFRDCs are R&D laboratories, study and analysis centers, and system engineering and integration centers governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation. They are intended to address R&D needs that cannot be met effectively by the federal government or private sector alone. FFRDCs have special access to government data and operate in the public interest with objectivity. The FAR requires FFRDCs to operate in the public interest with objectivity, disclose activities to their sponsoring agency, and avoid conflicts of interest. FFRDCs cannot use privileged information to compete for federal R&D contracts but can work for other agencies if their capabilities are unique. The long-term relationship between an FFRDC and its sponsoring agency is a defining characteristic, with initial contracts up to five years and the possibility of renewal. The period of an FFRDC contract can be up to five years and renewed in increments of up to five years. Long-term contracts are encouraged by the FAR to provide stability, continuity, and attract high-quality personnel. A long relationship enables the FFRDC to maintain expertise, respond quickly, and stay objective and independent. Before establishing an FFRDC, the sponsoring agency must ensure there are no other alternatives for addressing R&D needs. The federal government or private sector must ensure expertise and cost controls for FFRDCs. In FY2015, $11.1 billion was spent on R&D by FFRDCs, 8.6% of total R&D spending. In FY2015, FFRDCs spent 22% on basic research, 38% on applied research, and 39% on development activities. The distribution of R&D expenditures has remained stable for the past three years. Federal R&D spending trends for FFRDCs from FY1967 to FY2015 show varying proportions, averaging 9.1% of federal R&D spending. Federal funding for FFRDCs has grown steadily over the years, reaching $11.25 billion in FY2015. This represented a compound annual growth rate of 0.90%, higher than the overall federal R&D spending growth rate. DOE accounted for the majority of FFRDC funding in FY2015, with $7 billion, indicating the significant role FFRDCs play in fulfilling the agency's research needs. FFRDCs play a central role in fulfilling agency research needs, with DOD, NASA, NSF, and DHS allocating significant portions of their R&D budgets to FFRDCs. Congress has long been concerned about the growth, cost, management, and oversight of FFRDCs. Congressional oversight and management of FFRDCs remain ongoing concerns, with a focus on controlling costs and addressing mismanagement. In 1992, a Senate subcommittee report highlighted inadequate federal controls at FFRDCs leading to wasteful use of federal funds. In 2016, a hearing on DOE's FFRDCs management emphasized the need for sustained improvement. Congressional scrutiny is driven by high-profile incidents like the 2000 LANL missing hard drives. In 2000, two LANL computer hard drives went missing, leading to accusations of selling nuclear information to China. In 2004, mishandling of data and a laser accident closed LANL for seven months, costing $370 million. Recent incidents include mishandling hazardous waste and injuries during maintenance. GAO has designated DOE's contract management as high-risk for fraud and mismanagement. In 2013, GAO narrowed its high-risk designation to major contracts and projects within DOE's Office of Environmental Management and the National Nuclear Security Administration. In 2015, GAO noted progress in addressing oversight and management challenges. Since 2002, DOE has been transitioning its FFRDC oversight to a systems-based approach using contractor assurance systems (CAS). While stakeholders see CAS as a positive step, NAPA warned DOE to verify CAS maturity to prevent problems. Some critics find DOE's oversight burdensome and counterproductive, distorting the FFRDC model's original flexibility. Critics argue that DOE's micromanagement has diminished the flexibility of the FFRDC model. Decisions are now preapproved and double-checked by a long chain of command, leading to delays and increased costs. Some suggest returning to the original intent of the FFRDC model for more autonomy in decision-making. Critics argue that DOE's micromanagement has reduced the flexibility of the FFRDC model, leading to delays and increased costs. They recommend restoring trust between DOE and its laboratories by providing FFRDCs with more authority and flexibility, while holding them to high standards of transparency and accountability. If an FFRDC fails to meet its obligations, corrective actions such as punitive restrictions or contractor firing are suggested, without imposing new regulations on all DOE FFRDCs. The Senate committee expressed a desire for comprehensive defense lab governance reform, calling for a study on governance models used by federal laboratories, including FFRDCs. The study aims to identify different governance models, their benefits and drawbacks, and their success in fostering efficiency and innovation. It will also compare the autonomy of lab directors and provide recommendations on best governance practices. Congress and the executive branch have long been interested in promoting competition in federal procurement, including R&D. The federal law exempts FFRDCs from competitive practices in federal procurement, including R&D. Critics argue that this exemption hinders the government from getting the best R&D at competitive prices. They believe that FFRDCs should focus on R&D that cannot be effectively done by the private sector or the government. Critics also question the use of FFRDCs for systems engineering and integration services. The Professional Services Council (PSC) asserts that private sector systems engineering and integration (SE&I) capabilities are as good as or better than those of FFRDCs. Reforms initiated through the Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 have led to conflict-free private sector companies capable of performing SE&I work currently done by FFRDCs. Congress included a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 to address concerns about conflicts of interest and unfair competitive advantages. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 addresses conflicts of interest and unfair competitive advantages in SE&I services. The provision requires DOD to review and issue policy guidance related to identifying, mitigating, and preventing potential unfair competitive advantages for technical advisors to acquisition programs. Technical advisors include contractors, FFRDCs, university-affiliated research centers, non-profit entities, and federal laboratories providing systems engineering and technical direction services. The DOD is directed to review conflict-of-interest policies, use of non-disclosure agreements, regulations, and resource allocation decisions. The private sector may not fully address the work performed by FFRDCs, which are essential for maintaining specialized test and evaluation facilities beyond government capabilities. FFRDCs play a crucial role in the nation's science and technology community, contributing to U.S. technological and economic leadership. Concerns about mission creep and competition with the private sector arise due to the poorly defined scope of FFRDC activities. Some analysts have raised concerns about mission creep in FFRDC activities, cautioning against broadening into new fields or taking on work for other agencies. Diversification of FFRDC tasks may not align with their intended purpose of serving a special R&D need. Task forces have emphasized the importance of managing the application of technical competencies to new problem areas without expanding into already addressed science and technology domains. Some agencies have addressed concerns about mission creep in FFRDC activities by placing limits on the amount of work they can perform for other entities. However, a 2013 report by GAO indicated that DOE is not consistently fulfilling requirements to ensure its work for others program is not negatively affecting its research needs. In regards to DOD, Congress has placed limits on the number of Staff Years of Technical Effort (STE) that DOD FFRDCs can use, driving prioritization of needs and ensuring appropriate work scope. The STE limitation does not apply to work for other agencies, but federal agency approval of FFRDC R&D plans should ensure activities align with the FFRDC's mission and purpose. The FFRDC should ensure activities align with its mission and purpose. Long-term relationships with sponsoring agencies provide stability and continuity. Critics advocate for competitive procedures for FFRDC contracts to decrease costs and increase quality. The Blue Ribbon Commission report in 2003 highlighted the benefits of competition for DOE labs. Congressional mandates between FY1998 and FY2009 required competition for FFRDC contracts unless a waiver was granted. A policy on competition for FFRDC management was released in 2009. The DOE policy on competition for the management of its FFRDCs emphasizes a preference for full and open competition, with decisions made on a case-by-case basis. The agency uses competition when FFRDC performance is unsatisfactory, potential for improvement is identified, viable alternatives exist, or when the focus or mission of an FFRDC changes. A 2014 GAO report noted that DOE has competed 6 of its 16 FFRDCs since 2004. Some experts believe competition for FFRDC contracts can be disruptive and costly. DOE states that FFRDC competition takes 18 months and costs $3-5 million for a bid. Despite some efficiencies, new contractors' performance has not surpassed old ones. GAO found in 2008 that most agencies require full competition for FFRDCs. In 2008, GAO found that DOD awarded noncompetitive contracts to its FFRDCs, but started conducting more detailed reviews in response to criticism. NASA's OIG reported in 2009 that NASA did not assess possible competitors for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's operation, hindering the determination of best value for its FFRDC."
