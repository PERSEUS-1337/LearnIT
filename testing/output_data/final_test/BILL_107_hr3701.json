The \"Public Safety Ex-Offender Self-Sufficiency Act of 2002\" introduces the Temporary Ex-Offender Low-Income Housing Credit under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code. This credit is determined based on the applicable percentage of the qualified basis of each qualified ex-offender residential building. The applicable percentage is defined similarly to qualified low-income buildings but adjusted to yield a present value equal to 70 percent of the qualified basis. The term 'qualified basis' refers to the adjusted basis of a qualified ex-offender residential building at the end of the first taxable year of the credit period. The qualified basis can be increased by the portion of the building used for ex-offender support services, up to 20 percent of the total qualified basis. Rules similar to section 42 apply for determining the adjusted basis, rehabilitation expenditures, and credit period of a qualified ex-offender residential building. The building must meet specific requirements during the compliance period to be considered a qualified ex-offender residential building. The qualified ex-offender residential building must meet specific requirements, including single occupancy units for ex-offenders who meet residency criteria and have not failed to meet requirements for more than 14 days. The building is not disqualified if some units are single room occupancy. The Housing Act of 1937 requires a self-sufficiency center for ex-offenders in qualified residential buildings, offering support services and rent limitations for occupants. The rent payable by occupants in a qualified ex-offender residential building is capped at 30% of their adjusted monthly income. Ex-offenders must meet residency requirements, including having low income, participating in a support services program, not being prohibited from residency, and moving in by a specified date. Ex-offenders must meet residency requirements, including having low income, defined as not exceeding 60 percent of the area median gross income. They can move into a qualified residential building 12 months after discharge from a correctional facility or conviction. Ex-offenders must meet residency requirements, including low income not exceeding 60 percent of the area median gross income, to move into a qualified residential building 12 months after discharge from a correctional facility or conviction. An ex-offender support services program is created and managed by an individual or entity with experience in ex-offender needs, specifically designed to meet their support service needs for a specific duration. An ex-offender support services program must have specific goals, a defined duration for services, continual oversight for monitoring progress, and participation through a written agreement. The ex-offender must enter into a written agreement with the program coordinator outlining support services, duration of the program, attendance at meetings, and obtaining services as conditions for residency. Ex-offender support services include job training, employment counseling, entrepreneurial training, financial management training, homeownership and rental counseling, and drug and alcohol abuse counseling. Ex-offender residential facilities offer a range of support services including drug and alcohol abuse counseling, self-esteem and peer development assistance, anger management counseling, health care services, probation services, family and crisis management counseling, and general educational assistance. Ex-offenders are limited to a 2-year residency in these facilities. Ex-offender residential facilities provide support services such as counseling, health care, and educational assistance. The term 'ex-offender' refers to individuals convicted of a felony. Rules similar to section 42(h) apply for allocating credits. The State housing credit ceiling is calculated based on a specific formula. The State housing credit ceiling for any State after December 31, 2007, will be zero. The State ratio is calculated by dividing the number of released prisoners in a State by the number released in the United States. The section discusses the reported number of sentenced prisoners and the involvement of qualified non-profit organizations. Rules similar to those of section 42 are applied for recapture of credit, application of at-risk rules, and certification and other reports to the Secretary. The rules of section 42(l) apply for this section, along with responsibilities of the Secretary and Housing Credit Agencies. The ex-offender low-income housing credit is included as a current year business credit. A clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code. The ex-offender low-income housing credit applies to qualified residential buildings placed in service after December 31, 2002."
