    "content": "Under the U.S. Constitution, states have the authority to administer elections, including provisions for recounts and election contests. Recounts involve re-tabulating votes, while election contests address allegations of fraud or irregularities in election administration. Courts are cautious in overturning election results based on fraud or irregularities. The burden of proof is on the challenger to provide specific evidence and show that any proven fraud or irregularity would have changed the election outcome. Courts are cautious in overturning election results based on fraud or irregularities. The burden of proof is on the challenger to provide specific evidence and show that any proven fraud or irregularity would have changed the election outcome. Even if the number of fraudulent votes exceeds the margin of victory, it may not necessarily invalidate the election results unless it can be proven that those votes were for the winning candidate in such numbers that would have affected the outcome. In recent American history, in-person voting fraud that could impact statewide or nationwide elections appears to be unprecedented. Studies show that cases of actual fraud are relatively uncommon, with only 31 credible allegations out of over one billion votes cast in the US. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported the scarcity of examples of voting fraud in states, noting no apparent cases of in-person voter impersonation charged by the Department of Justice from 2004 through July 3, 2014. Procedures for election contests vary by state, and challengers must follow state statutes, procedures, and deadlines for filing challenges and contests. In Colorado, the state supreme court has original jurisdiction over contests concerning presidential electors. Qualified electors must file a statement of intent to contest within 35 days of the secretary of state's canvass, followed by a complaint within 35 days. The court will hear and determine the case without a jury. In Florida, election contests can be filed in the circuit court by unsuccessful candidates or electors. In Florida, election contests can be filed in the circuit court by an unsuccessful candidate, elector, or taxpayer within 10 days after the election is certified. The complaint must allege one of four statutory grounds for overturning the election results. The burden of proof lies with the filing party to show fraud or illegality that would have changed the election outcome. In Nevada, election contests can be filed within five days after a recount or 14 days after the election. Grounds for contesting an election include malfeasance by the election board, ineligibility of the elected candidate, and illegal votes cast for the defendant. The grounds for contesting an election in New Hampshire include errors in conducting the election, illegal votes, bribery, and possible malfunctions of voting devices. New Hampshire law does not have a specific statutory scheme for election contests related to federal elections, but rather provides for a recount process with an appeal and hearing on the recount results. The New Hampshire statutes allow any candidate to request a recount within a specific timeframe after the election. Candidates and their representatives can protest the recount process, with the secretary of state ruling on any protests. Recount results can be appealed to the state ballot law commission and then to the state supreme court. There are no specific statutory grounds for an election contest in federal elections in New Hampshire. In New Hampshire, candidates can request a recount within a set timeframe after an election. Recount results can be appealed to the state ballot law commission and then to the state supreme court. For federal elections, there are no specific statutory grounds for an election contest in New Hampshire, but a common law cause of action can be pursued in the superior court for questions related to the legality or regularity of general elections or their results. In North Carolina, election contests are typically filed with the county board of elections, but if an election spans multiple counties, a petition can be filed directly with the State Board of Elections regarding irregularities or misconduct in the votes for presidential electors. In North Carolina, election protests must be filed with the county board of elections before 5:00 P.M. on the second business day after the canvass meeting. The State Board of Elections can authorize a county board to address issues like unretrievable votes or incorrect ballot styles. The State Board of Elections in North Carolina may authorize a new election if certain conditions are met, such as ineligible voters affecting the outcome, eligible voters being prevented from voting, irregularities changing the election outcome, or improprieties casting doubt on the fairness of the election. Appeals can be made to the Superior Court after a decision by the State Board of Elections. In North Carolina, the State Board of Elections can authorize a new election under specific conditions. Appeals can be made to the Superior Court within 10 days. Ohio has exceptions for election contests regarding federal office elections, while Pennsylvania requires election contests for electors to be filed within 20 days after the election. In Pennsylvania, a petition must be filed by at least five registered electors who voted in the contested election, alleging fraud or wrongdoing that could change the election results. In Virginia, unsuccessful candidates can contest the election of electors for President and Vice President in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. The special judicial panel must receive a notice to contest within two days of the State Board certifying the election results. The complaint must be served to each contestee within five days. Grounds for the complaint can be objections to eligibility or conduct/results of the election. The contest is to be heard promptly without a jury and completed at least six days before the electors' meeting. Congress will meet to count and certify electoral votes for President. When Congress counts electoral votes, objections can be made to votes from a state, following the Electoral Count Act of 1887. Objections must be in writing, signed by a Senator and Representative, and state the grounds concisely. During the joint session of Congress, objections to electoral votes can be made following specific procedures outlined in the Electoral Count Act of 1887. If an objection is properly made, each house of Congress must separately consider and agree to it for it to be sustained. An example of this process occurred in January 2005 when an objection was made to Ohio's electoral votes due to alleged irregularities. However, neither the House nor Senate agreed to accept the objection, so Ohio's electoral votes were ultimately counted as cast. The burden of proof in Congress to challenge a certified election is significant, as states are initially responsible for resolving election disputes. The \"safe harbor\" provision in the Electoral Count Act ensures final and conclusive determinations of presidential electors' election results. State-certified election results are officially recognized in Congress, even without contests, through the Electoral Count Act procedures. The burden of proof in Congress to challenge a certified election is significant, with states responsible for resolving election disputes. The practice places a clear burden on the objecting party to overcome the presumption of validity of an election certified by state officials. The House and Senate use a \"but for\" test for contests in their own elections, requiring proof that alleged fraud or irregularity would have changed the election outcome. The burden of proof in challenging a state-certified election of presidential electors is influenced by congressional precedents, requiring proof that alleged fraud or irregularity would have changed the election outcome."
