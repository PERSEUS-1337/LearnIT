    "content": "President Trump's FY2019 budget request included $49.1 billion for agencies funded through the FSGG appropriations bill, with $282 million allocated for the CFTC. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a bill with a total funding of $45.7 billion for FY2019, including $255 million for the CFTC in the Agriculture appropriations bill. This total was about $3.2 billion below the President's request, with differences in funding for the General Services Administration. The House passed H.R. 6147, which included funding for the General Services Administration and government-wide transfers. The Senate reported S. 3107 with $45.9 billion in funding, $3.2 billion below the President's request, with differences in GSA funding and government-wide transfers. The Senate began considering H.R. 6147 on July 24, 2018. The Senate started considering H.R. 6147 on July 24, 2018, which included S. 3107 as Division B of the amendment. The amended H.R. 6147 was passed on August 1, 2018. A conference committee convened on September 13, 2018, but no report was issued before the fiscal year ended. Continuing appropriations were provided through P.L. 115-245 and P.L. 115-298, leading to a funding lapse for FSGG agencies from December 22, 2018. The House passed two consolidated appropriations bills in January 2019, H.R. 21 and H.R. 648, containing six full FY2019 appropriations bills. H.R. 21 would have provided $45.9 billion for FSGG agencies, while H.R. 648 would have provided $46.0 billion. Neither bill included financial regulatory provisions from the House-passed bill in the 115th Congress. The House and Senate agreed on a conference report for the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, providing full FY2019 funding for government operations. The act included $45.7 billion in FSGG funding, but did not include Title IX financial regulatory provisions from the House in the 115th Congress. The final FSGG appropriations for FY2019 were approximately $3.4 billion less than the President's request, with differences in funding for various agencies and programs. Tables 1, 2, and 3 outline the status of appropriations measures and the amounts requested and enacted by Congress across the 115th and 116th Congresses. The FSGG bill focuses on financial services but does not fund regulation of the industry. Banking, insurance, and securities are regulated by various agencies like the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC, CFPB, and NCUA. These agencies do not receive primary funding through appropriations, except for the FDIC inspector general and a small NCUA program. The FSGG bill does not fund regulation of the financial services industry. Banking, insurance, and securities are regulated at the state level with some Federal Reserve oversight. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) has no regulatory authority, and funding for regulatory agencies like the SEC and CFTC comes from appropriations or fees collected by the agencies. Legislative provisions affecting financial regulation are often included in FSGG bills. In the 115th Congress, various bills included provisions amending financial regulations and funding for regulators. H.R. 6258 and H.R. 6147 aimed to amend the Dodd-Frank Act and bring the CFPB under the FSGG bill for funding. However, these provisions were not enacted. In the 116th Congress, S. 3107 and H.R. 6147 passed by the Senate did not include financial regulatory provisions similar to previous bills. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures, creating a new Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee. The House FSGG Subcommittee's jurisdiction includes agencies previously under the Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, the District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies. The House FSGG Subcommittee now oversees four independent agencies previously under the Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Subcommittee: FCC, FTC, SEC, and SBA. The Senate FSGG Subcommittee's jurisdiction includes agencies from three previous subcommittees, including those from Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and the District of Columbia. Additionally, four independent agencies from the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee are now under the FSGG Subcommittee. The House and Senate FSGG Subcommittees now oversee various departments and agencies, including the FCC, FTC, SEC, and SBA. The CFTC is under the jurisdiction of the FSGG Subcommittee in the Senate and the Agriculture Subcommittee in the House."
