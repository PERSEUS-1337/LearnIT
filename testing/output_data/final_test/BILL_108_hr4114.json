    "content": "The \"Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act of 2004\" excludes non-native species from certain prohibitions under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act is amended to limit its application to native bird species in the United States, excluding introduced species resulting from human-assisted introduction. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act now applies only to native bird species in the United States, excluding those introduced through human-assisted methods. Native status is determined by being extant in 1918, extirpated post-1918, and reintroduced by a Federal agency. The Secretary of the Interior will publish a list of non-native bird species not covered by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act within 3 months of this Act's enactment. This list will include species from biological families covered by bird conventions with certain countries. Public comment will be allowed, and the publication of this list will not delay other provisions of the Act. Additionally, a title within the Act is named the \"Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Improvement Act of 2004.\" AMENDMENTS TO NEOTROPICAL MIGRATORY BIRD CONSERVATION ACT. Amendments to the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act include changes to definitions, purposes, and cost-sharing requirements. These changes involve specifying birds that breed in Canada and the United States, expanding the definition of the Caribbean to include Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, and increasing cost-sharing from 25% to 50%. Amendments to the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act involve changes in cost-sharing requirements for projects in different regions. The non-Federal share for projects in the United States and Canada must be paid in cash, while projects in Latin America and the Caribbean can be paid in cash or in kind. Additionally, a report deadline under the Act is amended. Amendments to the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act include changing the deadline to 12 months after the enactment of the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Improvement Act of 2004 and adding a description of the advisory committee's activities. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund section is also amended. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund is amended. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund is established in the Treasury as a separate account. It consists of donations and appropriations deposited by the Secretary of the Treasury. Administrative expenses are increased to $150,000. Amendments are made to the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund is defined as the Fund established by section 9(a). The Secretary of the Treasury can transfer amounts from the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account to the Fund.
