    "content": "House Rule X, clause 5(c)(2), implemented in 1995, limited committee chairs to three consecutive terms of service. However, exemptions were made for the Intelligence Committee chair in 2003 and the Rules Committee chair in 2005. In 2009, term limits were removed but reinstated in 2013 for all committee chairs except the Rules Committee chair. Republican Conference rules outline procedures for selecting committee chairs and ranking minority members. The Speaker nominates chairs for the House Administration Committee and Rules Committee when Republicans are in the majority. The Speaker or minority leader nominates committee chairs and ranking members, with the full Republican Conference ratifying the appointments. The Republican Steering Committee nominates other standing committee chairs or ranking members. The Steering Committee interviews prospective candidates, and seniority is not always the determining factor for chair or ranking member positions. The Steering Committee is composed of party leaders, selected committee leaders, class leaders, and regional representatives. It is reconstituted each Congress with regions reflecting an equal number of Republican Members. The House Republican Conference adopted a resolution in 2015 redesigning the composition of the Steering Committee, removing chairs of certain committees. The Steering Committee composition was redesigned in 2015, removing certain committee chairs. Six at-large members are to be elected, with the Speaker appointing one designee. Elections for at-large members must be held within 30 days of the resolution. The Republican Conference elected the six members on December 10, 2015. Regional allocation may be reviewed in the future. The Democratic Steering Committee selects committee chairs and ranking members based on merit, length of service, commitment to the party's agenda, and diversity. The committee is reconstituted each Congress to ensure equal representation among regions. The Democratic Steering Committee reconstitutes each Congress to ensure equal representation among regions and can change the number of appointments made by the party leader. Table 2 shows the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee as of July 1, 2017."
