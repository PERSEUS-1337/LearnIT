    "content": "Congress has a long-standing interest in the criminal alien population and has supported efforts since the late 1980s to identify, detain, and remove these individuals. The Congressional Research Service estimates that about 184,000 non-citizens were incarcerated in 2011, with a total non-citizen correctional population of around 572,000. Alien removals originating within the United States are a basic element of immigration control, with the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement operating programs to identify and remove criminal aliens and other removable aliens. The Criminal Alien Program (CAP) identifies, detains, and initiates removal proceedings against criminal aliens. Secure Communities screens for removable aliens as people are booked into jails. \u00a7287(g) agreements allow DHS to delegate immigration enforcement functions to state and local law enforcement officers. The National Fugitive Operations Program pursues known criminal and fugitive aliens. Funding for interior enforcement targeting criminal aliens has increased since FY2005. Congress appropriated about $567 million to ICE. ICE received increased funding for interior enforcement programs targeting criminal aliens, with a total of $567 million appropriated by Congress in FY2013. The number of aliens arrested through these programs rose from 11,000 to 270,000 during this period. While critics argue that many identified aliens have no criminal record, others point out that all unauthorized aliens have violated immigration laws and may face removal. This raises key policy issues for Congress regarding the timing and criteria for enforcing removal. ICE's interior enforcement programs have increased the agency's ability to identify potentially removable criminal aliens. The Obama Administration has guidelines for prioritizing enforcement cases and exercising discretion. Some Members of Congress oppose these policies and seek to limit discretion. Questions also arise about the involvement of state and local law enforcement in immigration enforcement. The report discusses the concerns surrounding state and local involvement in immigration enforcement, particularly with programs like Secure Communities. The Obama Administration no longer allows local jurisdictions to opt out of these programs. The report also delves into defining and quantifying the criminal alien population and describes various programs targeting this population, such as CAP, \u00a7287(g) program, and NFOP. The report reviews the recent appropriations history and enforcement statistics of programs targeting criminal aliens, such as Secure Communities and the \u00a7287(g) program. U.S. immigration law identifies crimes that make an alien ineligible for admission or subject to deportation, but the term \"criminal alien\" is not specifically defined. The report defines a \"criminal alien\" as any noncitizen convicted of a crime in the United States. Not all criminal aliens are unauthorized or removable, and most removable aliens are not criminals. Three groups of criminal aliens can be distinguished: unauthorized aliens, legal aliens, and removable criminal aliens subject to removal under the INA. The report distinguishes three groups of criminal aliens: unauthorized aliens, legal aliens, and removable criminal aliens. Not all criminal aliens are removable, and most removable aliens are not criminals. Publicly available arrest and incarceration data for criminal aliens from 2001 to 2011 is presented, along with other relevant studies. The report discusses the criminal alien population, presenting data from the Department of Justice on federal arrests by citizenship status. Noncitizen arrests for federal offenses increased between 2001 and 2010, with most arrests being for illegal entry. Arrests for illegal entry, which notably rose after 2003, accounted for almost all of the increase in noncitizen federal arrests. Noncitizen arrests for other federal offenses decreased from 19% in 2001 to 5% in 2010. The rise in illegal entry cases led to a decrease in U.S. citizen federal arrests from 62% in 2001 to 45% in 2010. These trends may be due to changes in enforcement and prosecution policies rather than increased noncitizen criminality. Border Patrol apprehensions have consistently exceeded illegal entry arrests, with policies seeking criminal charges against more aliens since 2005. The total prisoner population in 2011 was 2,334,381, with noncitizens making up 7.9% of the combined federal, state, and local prisoner population. Noncitizens comprised 26.9% of the federal prison population, 5.2% of the state prison population, and 7.3% of the local jail population. Comparatively, noncitizens made up 7.1% of the total U.S. population in FY2011. The noncitizen proportion of the total prisoner population in 2011 was 7.9%, up from 6.3% in 2001. The noncitizen proportion of federal prisoners increased to 27% in 2011, while state prisoners increased to 5.2% and local jail prisoners increased to 7.3%. The growth rate of noncitizens in prisons and jails exceeded that of the native-born, reflecting broader demographic changes. The foreign-born population in the U.S. grew from 31.5 million to 40.4 million between 2001 and 2011, representing 13.0% of the total population. The noncitizen proportion of the incarcerated population closely mirrored the proportion of noncitizens in the overall population. Data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission show that violent crimes made up less than 1% of crimes committed by criminal aliens, compared to 4.5%-6% of crimes committed by citizens. Immigration crimes grew as a proportion of total federal offenses for noncitizens. The proportion of crimes committed by criminal aliens increased from 50% in 2001 to 66% in 2012, while immigration crimes made up less than 5% of all crimes for citizens. The U.S. Census American Community Survey provides additional information on the criminal alien population. The Microdata Sample estimates the noncitizen incarcerated population in group quarters to be 8.09% of the total, with 187,684 individuals aged 18-55 in 2011. This aligns closely with the Bureau of Justice Statistics' figure of 2,334,381 persons living in correctional facilities. Studies suggest that foreign-born individuals are less likely to commit crimes and be incarcerated compared to native-born individuals. In California, the foreign-born population made up 35% of adults but only 17% of the adult prison population. When focusing on males aged 18-40, native-born institutionalization rates were 10 times higher than foreign-born rates. These findings indicate that the noncitizen proportion among U.S. criminals is not significantly higher. The noncitizen proportion among U.S. criminals is no greater than the foreign-born proportion of the total U.S. population. Estimates suggest that the incarcerated criminal alien population is around 303,470. ICE estimates that approximately 900,000 aliens are arrested for crimes annually, with 550,000 criminal aliens convicted of crimes exiting law enforcement custody each year. Additionally, ICE estimates that 1.9 million criminal aliens currently reside in the United States. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) used data from the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) to report 52,929 criminal aliens in federal prisons and 91,823 in state prisons and local jails. The SCAAP data may not accurately reflect the actual incarcerated criminal alien population at a given point in time. In 2009, GAO reported 52,929 criminal aliens in federal prisons and 91,823 in state prisons and 204,136 in local jails. The total foreign-born correctional population was estimated to be around 572,000 to 945,000. Deporting aliens convicted of certain crimes became a priority with the Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986. The former INS established the Institutional Removal Program (IRP) and the Alien Criminal Apprehension Program (ACAP) in 1988 to deport aliens convicted of crimes expeditiously. These programs partnered with corrections facilities to identify deportable aliens before their release and initiate deportation proceedings during their incarceration, focusing on aggravated felons. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 defined aggravated felonies to include murder, drug trafficking, and illegal trafficking in firearms. Congress expanded the definition of aggravated felons between 1990 and 1996, leading to the INS prioritizing the removal of criminal aliens, especially after the September 11 attacks. After the September 11 attacks, the Department of Homeland Security focused on suspected terrorists and homeland defense. Programs targeting criminal aliens also remained a priority, with ICE managing various programs like CAP, Secure Communities, \u00a7287(g) program, and NFOP. The Criminal Alien Program (CAP), Secure Communities, and \u00a7287(g) programs are jail enforcement programs that screen individuals for immigration violations and criminal grounds for removal in prisons and jails. The National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP) targets at-large criminal aliens, including fugitive aliens and those released from prison. CAP aims to identify and detain foreign-born nationals in jails and prisons to prevent the release of criminal aliens. The Criminal Alien Program (CAP) aims to prevent the release of criminal aliens from jails and prisons in the United States by securing final removal orders before the end of their sentences. CAP officers screen and prioritize potentially removable aliens during booking and while serving sentences, conducting database searches and interviews. They may issue immigration detainers to hold aliens for up to 48 hours for ICE to take custody for removal. ICE's Criminal Alien Program (CAP) allows for the detention of criminal aliens in U.S. jails and prisons for up to 48 hours to initiate removal proceedings. CAP officers monitor over 4,300 facilities, including through the Secure Communities program, using onsite deployment and video teleconference equipment. They work with state and local correctional departments to analyze inmate rosters and compare prisoner data to immigration databases. CAP also manages the Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) for database searches on arrestees' identity and immigration status. ICE's Criminal Alien Program (CAP) conducts searches to verify the identity and immigration status of arrestees for ICE, state, and local law enforcement. CAP oversees specialized programs targeting high priority criminal aliens, such as the Violent Criminal Alien Section (VCAS) and the Rapid Removal of Eligible Parolees (REPAT) program. In FY2012, VCAS secured thousands of indictments and convictions, while REPAT facilitates the early release of eligible incarcerated criminal aliens who agree to be removed from the United States. CAP also collaborates with Phoenix-area law enforcement through the Law Enforcement Area Response (LEAR) program. ICE's Criminal Alien Program (CAP) collaborates with local agencies through the Law Enforcement Area Response (LEAR) program, responding to requests 24/7. In FY2012, LEAR encountered over 4,200 aliens, resulting in 2,900 arrests and 1,500 immigration detainers. CAP also operates Joint Criminal Alien Removal Taskforces (JCART) in New York and Los Angeles, partnering with various agencies to arrest high-priority criminal aliens. Secure Communities, an information sharing program, screens for removable aliens using biometric data during jail bookings. The Criminal Alien Program (CAP) collaborates with local agencies through the Law Enforcement Area Response (LEAR) program to screen for removable aliens during jail bookings. The program checks fingerprints against the FBI and DHS databases to identify potential matches for immigration violations and criminal histories. ICE agents at the Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) confirm the identity of matched prints and evaluate the alien's criminal history to determine if they may be a removable alien. The Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) evaluates the criminal history of potential removable aliens and notifies the ERO field office. The ERO supervisor reviews the record and decides on removal proceedings based on priorities and resources. ICE issues immigration detainers for removal proceedings, with CAP managing Secure Communities operations. ICE is set to oversee all Secure Communities operations starting in FY2014, with \u00a7287(g) agreements allowing state and local officers to assist in immigration enforcement. These agreements, authorized in 1996, have seen a significant increase since 2006, with over 1,300 officers completing ICE's training program by December 31, 2012. ICE's \u00a7287(g) program, which included task force programs and jail enforcement agreements, was phased out by the Obama Administration in 2012. Trained officers in state and local corrections facilities can still identify criminal aliens using DHS databases and ICE's ENFORCE system. ICE's National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP) was created in 2003 to locate, arrest, and remove fugitive aliens. With support from Congress, the NFOP expanded its focus in 2009 to include at-large criminal aliens, national security threats, gang members, sex offenders, and violent criminals. As of July 2013, the NFOP consisted of 129 fugitive operations teams covering all ICE field offices. Teams use data from the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) to track down these individuals. ICE's National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP) collaborates with various law enforcement agencies to target criminal aliens and priority cases. NFOP teams make arrests and enforcement actions at different locations, contributing to a reduction in fugitive alien cases. NFOP is a task force program, unlike jail enforcement programs, which are less targeted. ICE's National Fugitive Operations Program (NFOP) collaborates with law enforcement agencies to target criminal aliens and priority cases. NFOP is a task force program that focuses on specific serious criminal aliens, fugitive aliens, or other criminals identified by ICE. ICE agents conduct immigration screening and select targets for task force operations based on criminal records and immigration histories. The \u00a7287(g) program involves local corrections officers in immigration-related screening and target selection. ICE's jail enforcement programs, including the \u00a7287(g) program, target criminal aliens at various stages of the criminal justice process. Screening is conducted during the booking process to identify potentially removable aliens, regardless of criminal charges or convictions. CAP also screens convicted individuals who are incarcerated, while the NFOP program focuses on fugitive aliens, even those not convicted of crimes. Funding for ICE's identification and removal of unauthorized immigrants has increased significantly since FY2004. Congress has shown interest in programs like CAP and NFOP by tripling funding in FY2005 and FY2006. \u00a7287(g) program is funded under ICE's Office of State, Local, and Tribal Government Coordination. In FY2005 and FY2006, funding for CAP and NFOP was tripled by Congress. ICE was directed to study expanding the Institutional Removal Program nationwide. In FY2008, appropriators increased funding for the Criminal Alien Program and allocated $200 million for a program to identify and remove deportable aliens convicted of crimes. ICE received additional funding to support programs targeting criminal aliens, such as CAP and Secure Communities. Funding for these programs increased significantly from $6.6 million in FY2004 to $392.5 million in FY2010 before dropping to $354.3 million in FY2013. Overall, funding for DRO/ERO operations increased from $959.7 million in FY2004 to a high of $2.75 billion in FY2012 and FY2013. Enforcement data from 2004 through 2011 show primary actions by CAP, Secure Communities, \u00a7287(g), and NFOP programs. Data on administrative arrests, alien identifications, removals, and returns are presented. Interpret data with caution, especially for Secure Communities, as it identifies removable aliens but does not make arrests or initiate removal proceedings. The data in Table 6 shows consistent increases in the number of aliens identified and arrested by CAP, \u00a7287(g), NFOP, and Secure Communities programs. CAP made over 1.3 million administrative arrests between FY2004 and FY2012, while \u00a7287(g) and NFOP made about 240,000 and 243,000 administrative arrests, respectively. Secure Communities identified over 436,000 potentially removable aliens per year. Between FY2009 and FY2012, Secure Communities identified over 436,000 potentially removable aliens, leading to 324,811 administrative arrests and 227,590 aliens removed or returned. Approximately 5% of submissions to Secure Communities identified potentially removable aliens, with about 20% of those individuals being removed or returned. Table 7 shows the cost per individual identified, arrested, and removed or returned for each program. Investments in ICE's interior enforcement programs since 2004 have led to a significant increase in potentially removable aliens identified in the United States. The cost per arrest for CAP increased to $982 in FY2012, after stabilizing at slightly over $800 per arrest in FY2007-FY2009. The cost per case has declined as the number of arrests and identifications for the programs have increased, particularly for Secure Communities identifications and CAP arrests. The Obama Administration has supported Secure Communities and the \u00a7287(g) program, which have been controversial for screening 100% of people passing through certain law enforcement jurisdictions, identifying potentially removable aliens. Some Members of Congress criticize these programs for casting too broad a net. Some Members of Congress criticize the enforcement programs for casting too broad a net and object to the Administration's discretion. Secure Communities and the \u00a7287(g) program rely on partnerships with state and local law enforcement agencies, expanding ICE's enforcement capacity. Some Members of Congress support involving state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement, while others raise civil rights and police-community relations concerns. ICE has taken steps to address these concerns. DHS estimates 11.5 million unauthorized immigrants in the US in 2011. ICE identifies over 700,000 removable aliens annually but can only remove 400,000 due to limited capacity. ICE prioritizes certain aliens for removal based on enforcement priorities and prosecutorial discretion criteria outlined in agency guidance memos since 2011. DHS applies ICE memos to all enforcement agencies and has a policy of deferring enforcement action. ICE's enforcement priorities include apprehending aliens who pose a danger to national security, recent illegal entrants, and fugitives. The 2011 guidelines also target aliens involved in terrorism, espionage, or convicted of crimes. The memo outlines ICE's enforcement priorities for removing criminal aliens, including those involved in terrorism, espionage, violent crimes, and gang activities. It categorizes offenders into three levels based on the severity of their crimes, with special focus on Level 1 and Level 2 offenders. ICE Director John Morton published a memo in June 2011 to guide ICE officers in targeting criminal aliens for enforcement by exercising prosecutorial discretion to prioritize efforts. This includes categorizing offenders into three levels based on their criminal records. In June 2011, ICE Director John Morton issued a memo outlining the use of prosecutorial discretion to prioritize enforcement efforts by categorizing offenders into three levels based on their criminal records. This discretion may involve actions such as canceling detainers, not issuing NTAs, releasing aliens on bond, granting deferred action, or joining motions for relief from removal. Factors to consider when exercising discretion are also outlined, with some factors favoring discretion and others against it. In 2012, Director Morton published a memo on ICE's use of immigration detainers, aligning with civil enforcement priorities. The memo directs officers to issue detainers only for specific cases involving felony offenses, multiple misdemeanors, certain threats to public safety, immigration offenses, or national security risks. Detainers must indicate the reason for filing, and they are not required in all cases. The memo on ICE's use of immigration detainers emphasizes evaluating merits and exercising discretion on a case-by-case basis. DHS Secretary Napolitano announced that the guidance would apply to all DHS immigration agencies, with DOJ resources targeted towards high-priority cases. The White House clarified that enforcement priorities were set under the president's direction, and DHS and DOJ would review backlogged removal cases. An inter-agency group of DHS and DOJ attorneys reviewed backlogged cases to identify low-priority cases for prosecutorial discretion, closing 23,063 cases as of July 31, 2013. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was announced on June 15, 2012, for certain individuals brought to the US as children. The DACA program is based on prosecutorial discretion and is part of a broader policy debate on legalization for certain unauthorized migrants. It aims to free up law enforcement resources by granting deferred action to low-priority cases. As of June 7, 2013, DHS had received over 539,000 DACA applications, with 68% approved. Some Members of Congress have objected to ICE and DHS policies on prosecutorial discretion, including the DACA program. Legislation in both chambers aimed to suspend or tighten provisions related to prosecutorial discretion in immigration policy. The 113th Congress has also held hearings on ICE's exercise of prosecutorial discretion, with legislation seeking to limit DHS' discretion during immigration enforcement. For example, the House-passed FY2014 DHS appropriations bill would prohibit funds for implementing ICE and DHS policy guidance on prosecutorial discretion. The Senate-Passed Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744) and the Strengthen and Fortify Enforcement Act (SAFE Act, H.R. 2278) would limit DHS and ICE's prosecutorial discretion in immigration enforcement. The legislation aims to place restrictions on visa overstays and detainment of aliens identified through DHS jail enforcement programs. The SAFE Act would limit DHS and ICE's prosecutorial discretion in immigration enforcement, requiring custody of aliens within 48 hours and reimbursement of expenses to states. It also prohibits the use of funds for certain programs involving state and local law enforcement agencies in identifying and detaining removable aliens. Concerns about state and local involvement in immigration enforcement programs, such as the \u00a7287(g) program and Secure Communities, have prompted reviews by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the DHS Inspector General (IG). ICE has taken steps to address these concerns, while some Members of Congress also share similar apprehensions. Legal issues and court cases related to state and local laws on immigration are discussed in other reports. Interior enforcement programs like \u00a7287(g) and Secure Communities involve cooperation between ICE and state/local law enforcement, leveraging a large number of state/local agents compared to ICE agents. In 2011, state/local/federal agencies made 12,408,899 arrests, far surpassing the approximately 55,762 arrests made by ICE. This disparity highlights the significant role of state and local law enforcement in immigration enforcement. State and local law enforcement play a significant role in immigration enforcement, with programs like Secure Communities and \u00a7287(g) being efficient tools to identify removable aliens. These programs leverage natural \"choke points\" in the criminal justice system, such as jails, where biographic and biometric records are created for arrestees. This cooperation between ICE and state/local law enforcement agents can enhance ICE's enforcement efforts by utilizing the connections these agents have with local communities. ICE utilizes fingerprints, photographs, and other identifying information to efficiently identify potentially removable aliens in law enforcement custody. Electronic checks against DHS databases occur within minutes of fingerprint data submission, allowing for early identification of removable aliens in the criminal justice process. The LESC reviews matches and notifies ICE within four hours of identification. Screening at booking through programs like Secure Communities and the \u00a7287(g) program aids in this process. Screening at booking and during the criminal justice process allows for early identification of removable aliens by ICE. Secure Communities automates immigration screening through data matching and prioritization at the centralized LESC, requiring minimal additional personnel or infrastructure compared to other programs like CAP and the \u00a7287(g) program. The Secure Communities program allows ICE to have control over enforcement by screening and transmitting information about removable aliens. In contrast, the \u00a7287(g) program has faced criticism for potentially giving state and local law enforcement too much discretion in shaping immigration enforcement decisions. The CAP and \u00a7287(g) programs place immigration enforcement agents directly in state and local jurisdictions, allowing for a more significant force multiplier for ICE compared to Secure Communities alone. The \u00a7287(g) program offers greater local control for immigration enforcement compared to Secure Communities. Concerns have been raised about ICE's enforcement programs detaining noncriminal aliens and those convicted of minor offenses. In FY2007-FY2011, noncriminal offenses were the majority of arrests under the \u00a7287(g) program. However, in FY2012, non-criminal arrests dropped to just 6% when the program was scaled back to only include jail screening programs. For Secure Communities, around a quarter of aliens removed were Level 1 criminal aliens, with the proportion increasing to 30% in FY2012. Over half of the aliens removed were Level 3 criminals or non-criminals. Overall, 15% of aliens identified by Secure Communities are classified as criminal aliens and have been removed or returned. The evaluation of these statistics is a subject of debate, with some arguing that ICE resources should focus on identifying and removing aliens convicted of violent crimes. Some argue that using ICE resources to remove non-criminal or minor offenders diverts resources from high-priority cases. However, DHS is required to present a strategy for ICE to identify every criminal alien in custody. ICE's mission includes targeting aliens who pose a danger to national security or public safety, as well as those who undermine immigration laws. ICE's jail enforcement programs remove noncriminal aliens who are ICE fugitives or have prior removal orders. These programs rely on state and local law enforcement agencies for contact with potentially removable aliens, which may harm community-police relationships by eroding trust in law enforcement. This could lead to reluctance in reporting crimes or cooperating with authorities. Increased involvement of police in immigration enforcement has heightened fears among Latinos, leading to social isolation and mistrust of law enforcement. Community policing is crucial for immigrant communities due to their lack of trust in law enforcement agencies. Maintaining strong relations between immigrants and local law enforcement agencies is important for gathering intelligence about security threats. The potential chilling effect of immigration enforcement programs on community-police relations must be balanced against the public safety benefits of identifying and removing unauthorized aliens. Some officials see the threat to community relations as outweighing the benefits, while others view these programs as powerful tools in combating illegal immigration. ICE and supporters of Secure Communities view the program as a powerful tool in combating illegal immigration and criminal activity. Critics argue that involving state and local law enforcement in immigrant enforcement may lead to racial profiling, as officers may arrest individuals based on racial or ethnic characteristics. Universal screening during the booking process does not necessarily prevent biased actions. The DHS Secure Communities task force found inadequate complaint procedures to guard against racial profiling in immigration enforcement. Research shows evidence of racial profiling following the implementation of certain programs, but statistical studies are lacking. Critics have raised concerns about the use of immigration detainers in the Secure Communities program, citing issues with detainer authority and lack of mechanisms for detainees to challenge their detention. Critics have raised concerns about the lack of clear policies for local law enforcement agencies on how to respond to ICE immigration detainers. Issues include treating detainers as a requirement not to release individuals on bond, creating barriers for defense against criminal charges, prolonged detention even if charges are dropped, and holding individuals for more than 48 hours. ICE has implemented changes to address these concerns. ICE implemented changes in July 2009 to address concerns about the lack of clear policies for local law enforcement agencies regarding ICE immigration detainers. These changes included requiring revised Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) for participation in the \u00a7287(g) program, strengthening ICE oversight, additional training requirements, and deploying more ICE supervisors to \u00a7287(g) jurisdictions. ICE also established an internal advisory committee in 2009 with the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) to approve new agreements at a slower rate starting in 2010 and discontinued task force agreements in 2012. ICE made changes in July 2009 to address concerns about local law enforcement agencies' lack of clear policies regarding ICE immigration detainers. These changes included revised MOAs for the \u00a7287(g) program, increased oversight, more training, and deploying additional ICE supervisors. In 2012, task force agreements were discontinued. ICE also announced three major changes to the \u00a7287(g) program in 2009 and Secure Communities in 2011 to address specific concerns. Enforcement priorities were imposed on both programs, with guidance memos clarifying ICE agents' discretion in the immigration enforcement process. Additionally, a Homeland Security Advisory Council Task Force on Secure Communities was created. ICE made changes in 2009 to address concerns about local law enforcement agencies' lack of clear policies regarding ICE immigration detainers. This included revised MOAs for the \u00a7287(g) program, increased oversight, more training, and deploying additional ICE supervisors. In 2012, task force agreements were discontinued. ICE also announced changes to the \u00a7287(g) program in 2009 and Secure Communities in 2011 to address specific concerns. A Homeland Security Advisory Council Task Force on Secure Communities was created to recommend focusing the program on high-priority offenders and ensure discretion in Secure Communities jurisdictions. ICE developed new record-keeping requirements and tools to guard against pretextural arrests and racial profiling. ICE's ENFORCE tracking system was modified to track data on the circumstances leading to aliens' arrests for better oversight. New statistical data is being developed to evaluate if Secure Communities is being implemented in a biased way. ICE and CRCL have developed new materials and training to reduce racial profiling and misuse in enforcement programs like Secure Communities and the \u00a7287(g) program. New immigration detainer forms clarify detainment limits and provide information on filing complaints for civil rights violations. Monitoring for bias in Secure Communities is still in development as of July 2013. The Obama Administration proposed budget cuts for the \u00a7287(g) program in FY2013 and FY2014, aiming to reduce spending from $68 million to $51 million and then to $24 million, respectively. Despite Senate support for the cuts, the funding level remained at $68 million in FY2013. Legislative debates continue on the state and local role in federal immigration enforcement. During the House's debate on the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, 2014, funding for the Secure Communities program was discussed. Some Members of Congress opposed the program, calling for jurisdictions to suspend their participation. Unlike the \u00a7287(g) program, Secure Communities operates as an information sharing program among federal agencies and does not require active participation from local jurisdictions. ICE determined it has the authority to operate Secure Communities as a mandatory program. Some jurisdictions limited their cooperation with ICE detainers due to concerns over costs and wrongful detentions. Cook County, IL passed an ordinance requiring federal government to pay detention costs. New York City, Los Angeles, Newark, NJ, and Washington, DC also limited their cooperation. Orleans Parish, LA sheriff's office must decline ICE detainer requests unless subject is held on certain felony charges. Some jurisdictions have limited their cooperation with ICE detainers, such as Cook County, IL, which passed an ordinance requiring the federal government to pay detention costs. California and Connecticut have issued guidance and enacted laws to restrict cooperation with ICE detainers unless certain criteria are met. The SAFE Act (H.R. 2278) aims to increase state and local participation in ICE's interior enforcement programs. The SAFE Act (H.R. 2278) aims to increase state and local participation in ICE's interior enforcement programs by authorizing states and localities to enforce criminal penalties mirroring federal immigration law and allowing law enforcement agencies to investigate, identify, arrest, and detain aliens for immigration law enforcement. It also requires DHS to provide states with access to federal programs and technology, enter into agreements with jurisdictions requesting them, provide training materials, and reimburse states for enforcement costs. The SAFE Act (H.R. 2278) aims to increase state and local participation in ICE's interior enforcement programs by authorizing states and localities to enforce criminal penalties mirroring federal immigration law. It requires states and localities to provide DHS with identifying information about removable aliens and reimburses jurisdictions for reporting costs. Certain federal funds would be withheld from jurisdictions that do not fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. No consistent definition of \"criminal alien\" exists, but in this report, CRS defines it as any noncitizen convicted of a crime with immigration-related consequences. Definitions of key terms related to immigration enforcement programs are discussed, including \"absconder,\" \"aggravated felon,\" and \"at-large criminal alien.\" An aggravated felon is a noncitizen convicted of specific crimes listed in the Immigration and Nationality Act, making them subject to removal and ineligible for certain forms of relief. The curr_chunk discusses key terms related to immigration enforcement programs, including at-large criminal aliens, criminal aliens, criminal immigration offenses, fugitive aliens, and removable aliens. These terms are defined based on their legal status and actions related to criminal activities and immigration violations. Prior to FY2007, aliens were referred to as \"absconders.\" Removable aliens are those subject to formal removal from the United States, including nonimmigrant aliens who violate visa terms. Removable criminal aliens are those convicted of criminal offenses described in the Immigration and Nationality Act. The federal level compiles arrest data through the U.S. Marshals Service and incarceration data through the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The most recent data on noncitizen arrests is from 2010, while data on noncitizen prison populations from 2001-2011 include sentenced and non-sentenced inmates. The noncitizen incarcerated population data for 2011 is only available as of mid-year for federal, state, and local levels. Data for 2012 is unavailable as of August 2013. State incarceration data is obtained from BJS reports and the National Prisoner Statistics program. BJS also conducts an Annual Survey of Jails to estimate the number of inmates in local jails. The Bureau of Justice Statistics conducts a Census of Jails every five years to estimate the number of inmates in local jails. However, data quality and limitations hinder accurate enumeration of the criminal alien population due to inconsistencies in data collection at the state and local levels. There is no consistent national enumeration of prisoners in the United States. Attempts to quantify the U.S. criminal alien population have relied on estimation techniques, assumptions about the criminal alien proportion of the total criminal population, and federal surveys and censuses of prison inmates. Data limitations exist in collecting data at various stages of the criminal justice system, as arrests and incarcerations are imperfect indicators of immigrant criminality. Arrest data overestimate criminality, and local incarceration data also over-count certain individuals. In the U.S., data on the criminal alien population is estimated using various techniques and federal surveys of prison inmates. Arrest and incarceration data are imperfect indicators of immigrant criminality, with arrests overestimating criminality and local incarceration data over-counting individuals. The total correctional population includes those on probation, parole, and in prisons or jails, caution is needed when interpreting these numbers as they may not always reflect changes in criminal activity but could be due to enforcement policy shifts. The limitations in estimating the criminal alien population include data validity issues and lack of availability and reliability in state and local data reporting. There is a lack of recent and complete publicly available data on arrests at the state and local levels, and BJS's state and local incarceration data relies on voluntary participation, limiting the analysis to federal statistics. The challenges in estimating the criminal alien population stem from varying definitions across states, inconsistent reporting practices in local jails, and the lack of reliable data. GAO concluded in 2005 that there is no accurate data on criminal aliens in state prisons and local jails due to these factors. Criminal aliens may have strong incentives to lie about their legal status, making it difficult to quantify their population accurately. Serious crime tends to be intra-racial and intra-ethnic, leading unauthorized alien victims to fear reporting crime due to potential removal. Differences in criminal justice data counts also pose challenges in estimating the criminal alien population. Differences in data sources and decision rules can lead to variations in estimating the population of criminal aliens. Inconsistencies between raw data analysis and published figures by BOP can result in slightly different numbers. Reconciling these discrepancies is not always clear from the reports."
