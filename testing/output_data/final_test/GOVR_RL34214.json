    "content": "The Higher Education Act of 1965 authorizes federal student aid programs and institutional support, administered by the U.S. Department of Education. It accounted for 70% of all aid awarded to postsecondary students in 2005-2006. Last reauthorized in 1998, temporary extensions have kept the programs active since its expiration in 2003. The Higher Education Act of 1965 has had temporary extensions, with the latest extension to April 30, 2008. The Act aims to expand postsecondary education opportunities, especially for low-income individuals, and increase affordability for moderate-income families. The student aid programs under Title IV are at the core of the legislation. The Higher Education Act of 1965 focuses on student aid programs under Title IV, providing grants, loans, and work-study assistance. The Act has seven titles, each authorizing programs to assist postsecondary students and institutions. Title I establishes general provisions, including definitions for institutions of higher education. The Higher Education Act of 1965 defines institutions of higher education in two sections: Section 101 for non-Title IV programs and Section 102 for Title IV programs, including for-profit, vocational, and foreign institutions. Section 102 sets requirements for all Title IV eligible institutions regarding courses, enrollment, and management. Title I, Part B of the Higher Education Act (HEA) addresses general provisions such as anti-discrimination, student speech, accrediting agencies, and drug/alcohol abuse on college campuses. It prohibits the use of federal funds for projects that discriminate based on race, religion, sex, or national origin. The section also includes a Sense of Congress on protecting student speech and association rights, and grants waiver authority to the Secretary of Education. Additionally, it authorizes the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) to advise the Secretary on decisions. The Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity advises the Secretary on accrediting agencies. Provisions include disclosure of foreign gifts to IHEs. Part B also addresses reducing binge drinking on college campuses and requires IHEs to certify drug and alcohol prevention programs. Failure to certify makes institutions ineligible for federal funds. Part B also authorizes Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Grants. Title I, Part C of the legislation focuses on collecting data on college costs and prices, including redesigning postsecondary education data systems, developing standard definitions for data elements, conducting a national study of expenditures at IHEs, and creating a higher education market basket. Part C also authorizes the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). Title I, Part D establishes a performance-based organization (PBO) called the Office of Federal Student Aid to manage information processing and delivery systems for student assistance programs under HEA Title IV.

Students may receive a TEACH Grant of $4,000 per year for agreeing to teach in a high-poverty school for at least four years. Title III of the legislation provides support for less-advantaged institutions serving students from low-income or racial minority backgrounds, including historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions, and tribally controlled colleges and universities (TCCUs).

Loans are originated by private lenders, with state and nonprofit guaranty agencies administering federal loan insurance. FFEL loans include Stafford, PLUS, and Consolidation loans with set limits, repayment plans, and interest rates determined by statutory provisions. Subsidized Stafford loans are available to support postsecondary student expenses. Subsidized Stafford loans are available to undergraduate and graduate students with financial need, where the government pays the interest while the student is in school. Unsubsidized Stafford loans are also available to students regardless of financial need, with the government not covering the interest during school or deferment periods. PLUS loans are for parents of dependent undergraduates and graduate students, with no interest coverage by the government during school or deferment periods. Consolidation loans allow borrowers to combine existing federal student loans and possibly extend repayment.

Priority is given to students with exceptional financial need, and interest rates on Perkins Loans are fixed. The Perkins Loan program offers low-interest loans to students with exceptional financial need. Interest is fixed at 5% per year, with no interest accruing before repayment begins. The federal need analysis system determines eligibility for federal student aid by calculating the expected family contribution (EFC) based on financial data provided through the FAFSA. The EFC represents the amount a family can contribute towards education expenses. The expected family contribution (EFC) for federal student aid is calculated based on total income, available assets, living expenses, retirement needs, and tax liability. The EFC is determined by subtracting allowances from total income and assets, then dividing the sum by the number of family members in college. Dependency status affects the EFC calculation, with three classifications for applicants.
