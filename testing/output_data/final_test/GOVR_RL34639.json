    "content": "The 111th Congress will face the question of the Department of Defense's role in foreign assistance. DOD has been involved in assisting foreign populations, militaries, and governments due to its unique capabilities and resources. Congress has shaped DOD's role through various authorities in statutes and annual legislation. Some view DOD's role as a result of Congress prioritizing defense funding over foreign affairs budgets. The Department of Defense's role in foreign assistance is a product of Congress prioritizing defense funding over foreign affairs budgets. DOD participates in activities that serve an institutional purpose for the U.S. military, providing training, military contacts, and information gathering on foreign countries. This role can be seen in responding to humanitarian needs, providing aid in disasters, famines, and forced population movements. The Department of Defense provides humanitarian assistance in various circumstances, including military training and operations. It also builds foreign military capacity by offering equipment, weapons, and training to friendly countries for missions like counternarcotics and counterterrorism. Additionally, DOD helps foreign governments secure their territories against threats using non-military tools. The Department of Defense supports foreign governments in securing their territories against internal and international threats through state-building efforts and non-military tools. This includes strengthening police forces, undertaking small-scale projects, and providing support for border protection and nuclear non-proliferation initiatives. Congress has granted DOD new authorities to prosecute wars and conduct counterterrorism activities in response to immediate needs. Congress granted DOD new authorities post-9/11 to reshape U.S. capabilities. Critics fear DOD's large role in foreign assistance could harm U.S. foreign policy due to lack of coordination with State Department, sustainability issues, and militarization of U.S. image abroad. Analysts call for clarity and reforms in defining DOD's foreign assistance role. This report provides Congress with historical context and current information on DOD's role in foreign assistance activities, including types of assistance provided, authorities, and coordination mechanisms with other agencies. It also discusses the evolution of DOD's role and State Department's perception based on national security needs. The report discusses the evolution of the DOD's role in foreign assistance activities, including the use of military troops or civilian contractors. It highlights varying perspectives within the DOD on the appropriate non-combat role for the U.S. military based on national security needs. The DOD's evolving role in foreign assistance activities and the use of military in non-combat roles have sparked differing perspectives within the organization. Post-9/11 strategy emphasizes preventive, deterrent, and preemptive actions, leading to increased international partnerships and expanded DOD involvement in foreign assistance. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review Report reflects this shift in DOD's thinking towards more flexible authorities for current strategic operations. The DOD's request for new authorities, including the Partnership Strategy, is driven by the need to counter decentralized networks of violent extremists using terrorism and potential weapons of mass destruction. This strategy involves long-duration, complex operations with the U.S. military, other agencies, and international partners in multiple countries to assist in protecting populations and territories. In the 2006 QDR, DOD emphasizes the importance of developing foreign capabilities to enhance domestic and collective security through a \"whole of government\" approach. DOD Directive 3000.05 mandates DOD to support civilian agencies in conducting Stability, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction (SSTR) operations, but also highlights doubts about civilian agencies' ability to perform state-building tasks. DOD recognizes the importance of indigenous, foreign, or U.S. civilian professionals in state-building tasks but also sees the need to develop its own capability to establish or maintain order. The 2006 QDR emphasizes the need for DOD to develop its own capability to establish or maintain order when civilians cannot do so. DOD is placing a new emphasis on non-combat foreign assistance activities and expects to continue playing an important role in U.S. foreign assistance in the developing world. Defense Secretary Robert Gates highlighted the role of DOD in reviving public services, rebuilding infrastructure, and promoting good governance until civilian agencies are adequately resourced. These nontraditional capabilities have become mainstream in military thinking and strategy. The June 2008 National Defense Strategy emphasized the need for U.S. forces to maintain long-term reconstruction, development, and governance capabilities. The State Department advocated for new permanent DOD authorities to enhance whole-of-government coordination in security efforts. The curr_chunk discusses DOD's roles in disaster assistance, humanitarian activities, and assistance to foreign militaries. It also mentions recent proposals for enhanced authorities. DOD has a long history of involvement in disaster relief and humanitarian assistance, dating back to the 19th century. Additionally, they provide aid in humanitarian emergency situations and engage in routine assistance activities abroad. Since the mid-1980s, Congress has granted specific DOD authorities for humanitarian aid, including providing nonlethal excess property, military transportation for supplies, and civic assistance programs. These programs have been modified and expanded over time to include disaster response and environmental mitigation aid. The DOD has expanded its disaster response and humanitarian programs to include aid for environmental disasters and demining training, as well as separate health programs. Congress established the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid (OHDACA) DOD budget account in 1994 to fund these programs. The DOD's role in providing disaster relief to foreign populations serves both foreign affairs and military needs, with USAID being the lead authority for disaster response. The DOD plays a crucial role in responding to foreign disasters and humanitarian crises, often being the first agency to provide aid due to its deployable resources. These international emergency responses help alleviate suffering abroad, enhance the country's international image, and are undertaken for strategic or foreign policy reasons. Activities like the Berlin airlift in 1948-1949 demonstrate the commitment of the U.S. and U.K. to strategically important areas. Humanitarian and civic assistance programs are integrated into training exercises and military operations. Humanitarian assistance activities in military operations are carried out for situational awareness and support of local populations. Under Title 10 U.S. Code, the primary purpose is to train U.S. armed forces without duplicating other assistance. Section 401 authority is used for training exercises for National Guard and military personnel in specialties like medical personnel. U.S. Special Operations Forces conduct humanitarian assistance as part of stability and counterinsurgency operations. During stability and counterinsurgency operations, Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET) exercises are conducted with friendly foreign militaries primarily for training Special Operations Forces. Humanitarian assistance programs like medical and veterinary visits may be included to build goodwill among local populations and train foreign troops. U.S. Special Operations Forces collaborate with foreign militaries on small-scale humanitarian and civic action projects in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations. The U.S. military conducts humanitarian assistance programs during stability and counterinsurgency operations to build relationships and trust with local populations. Congress has added new health programs to the military's humanitarian assistance portfolio, including educating foreign military forces in HIV prevention activities. Special funding and authorities are provided for programs with a humanitarian assistance component in war zones like Afghanistan and Iraq. The U.S. military conducts humanitarian assistance programs in Afghanistan and Iraq to promote stability and support local governments. Integrated civilian and military teams use humanitarian aid to extend government reach, strengthen local governance, and stimulate economies. Commanders utilize Commander's Emergency Response Program funds for urgent relief and reconstruction needs. Funding for these projects was previously allocated through the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Assistance Account. The Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Assistance (OHDACA) Account covers disaster response and humanitarian assistance programs. Congress increased appropriations for OHDACA from $49.7 million in FY2002 to $63.204 million in FY2007. Funds were available for one fiscal year, with additional appropriations for disaster relief in FY2008 and FY2009. The Bush Administration also sought funds for humanitarian purposes through the Combatant Commander Initiative Fund (CCIF) in FY2009. The Combatant Commander Initiative Fund (CCIF) provides funds for humanitarian relief and reconstruction needs. Congress has appropriated $25 million annually for the CCIF, with additional amounts in supplemental appropriations. For FY2009, Congress allocated $50 million for the account. DOD has instructed military commanders to use humanitarian assistance as a tool for achieving U.S. security objectives. The 2006 QDR emphasizes humanitarian assistance as a tool for achieving U.S. security objectives and complementary security goals such as improving DOD visibility, access, and influence, building security and stability, generating positive public relations, bolstering disaster response capacity, and enhancing operational readiness skills of US military personnel. State Department officials appreciate the U.S. military's capability in delivering disaster relief. State Department officials value the U.S. military's ability to provide timely disaster and humanitarian relief assistance, as well as routine humanitarian projects that allow for the distribution of supplies and medical services. These projects help create goodwill and personal connections for the United States in underserved areas. DOD and military personnel attitudes towards disaster response and humanitarian relief vary, with favorable views towards immediate response and training exercises, but ambivalence towards prolonged humanitarian assistance. U.S. military personnel are often utilized for humanitarian assistance in conventional operations, raising concerns about the effectiveness and impact of such projects. Critics argue that poorly planned projects can undermine credibility and exacerbate conflicts. The Bush Administration has implemented new coordination mechanisms to address these issues. Since the early years after World War II, U.S. military assistance programs have been crucial in training and equipping foreign military forces. While the State Department oversees major train and equip efforts, the Department of Defense (DOD) plays a significant role in building foreign military capacity. Military assistance programs initially aimed to bolster defense capabilities against the Soviet Union but have since evolved to serve political, diplomatic, and military purposes. Military assistance programs, conducted through the State Department's FMS and IMET programs, have been vital in strengthening bilateral relations and rewarding allies. New programs aim to train foreign peacekeepers and equip military forces for counterterrorism and stability operations. DOD now views training foreign military forces as a key mission. The MDAA of 1949 laid the foundation for post-World War II military assistance efforts. The MDAA of 1949 was the precursor to post-World War II military assistance programs, providing weapons to NATO and other countries. The MSA of 1951 and 1954 followed, until the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 became law. The MSA of 1951 established the Mutual Security Agency under the President for foreign aid coordination. DOD administered military assistance programs under White House guidance in the early 1950s. The State Department took over non-military aid coordination from Congress, working with DOD on military aid to achieve foreign policy goals. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 entrusted the State Department with leading foreign assistance, including military aid, to counter Soviet influence. Since the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, foreign military assistance programs like Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Foreign Military Financing (FMF), and International Military Education Training (IMET) have been overseen by the State Department but implemented by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). Congress also established the Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) in 2005 for peacekeeping training. Additionally, DOD conducts various military-to-military education and training programs. DOD conducts military-to-military education and training programs for foreign military personnel, approved by the Secretary of State. Combatant commanders can use up to $5 million from the CCIF for this purpose. DOD is the lead agency for detecting and monitoring illegal narcotics transit into the US. Since the 1990s, DOD has provided training and support to foreign militaries and law enforcement for counternarcotics purposes under Section 1004 and Section 1033 authorities. This falls under the oversight of the Secretary of State, who coordinates counternarcotics assistance. DOD provides patrol, boats, vehicles, aircraft, and equipment to designated foreign governments for counternarcotics efforts. Human rights concerns have influenced congressional decisions on DOD's role in these programs. Restrictions on training foreign military units with human rights violations have been in place since 1998. The Congress authorized DOD to conduct a train and equip program for foreign militaries to enhance their counterterrorism capabilities. This program, known as \"Foreign Military Capacity Building\" under Section 1206 of the NDAA, received funding up to $200 million in FY2006 and up to $300 million in FY2007 and FY2008. In the Duncan Hunter NDAA for Fiscal Year 2009, funding authority was increased to $350 million, and the program was extended through FY2011. The Section 1206 authority was extended through FY2011 and expanded to include building the capacity of foreign maritime security forces for counterterrorism operations. The program requires the Secretary of Defense to authorize with the concurrence of the Secretary of State. In 2007, Congress rejected a request to expand the authority further. The Partnership Capacity of Foreign Military and Other Security Forces would provide a new, permanent DOD authority to spend up to $750 million per year to train and equip foreign military and security forces for counterterrorism operations or military and stability operations. The extension would allow training for various forces without strict conditionality, with the Secretary of State able to waive restrictions. In 2007, the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) expressed skepticism about extending the program without a proven record of success. The Bush Administration requested Congress to expand Section 1206 to include a wider range of security forces with an annual authorization of $750 million. The House version of the bill proposed extending authority through FY2010, while the Senate version suggested extending it through FY2011 with an annual authorization of $400 million. This would also allow funds to be used for security forces focused on counterterrorism, subject to certain restrictions. DOD seeks expanded authorities for training foreign military and security forces, including non-military law enforcement. Secretary of Defense Gates emphasized mentoring indigenous army and police as a key mission. Defense analysts urge policymakers to develop faster mechanisms for US involvement post-9/11. Analysts recommend faster mechanisms for the US to provide military training and support, citing the slow and cumbersome traditional State Department processes. Some Members of Congress criticize Section 1206 for lacking added value and funding areas for military relations rather than meeting emerging needs. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee suggests reevaluating all security assistance programs. The committee recommended placing all security assistance under State Department control, including Section 1206. DOD seeks broader reimbursement authority for coalition support forces and expanded logistics support for partner states. Congress has been responsive to these requests. DOD supports foreign governments in countering threats beyond military assistance, playing a significant role in nation-building tasks. The U.S. military plays a significant role in state-building efforts by supporting rule of law capabilities, strengthening central and local governments, and boosting national economies to deter internal and international threats. This assistance is often carried out in combat situations or due to a lack of trained civilian personnel. Notable examples include post-World War II military occupations of Germany and Japan. The U.S. military provides assistance in state-building efforts through various activities such as peacekeeping, post-conflict operations, counterterrorism, and civic assistance projects. Special operations forces and Provincial Reconstruction Teams are involved in strengthening local leaders and defusing rivalries. Congress authorizes DOD to train foreign law enforcement officials for counternarcotics operations. Teams (PRTs) conduct state-building activities, including political and economic tasks, along with humanitarian aid. U.S. military personnel are involved in reconstruction projects in Iraq and Afghanistan using CERP funds, with commanders able to approve grants up to $500,000. CERP has become a primary source of funding for infrastructure development, despite Congress denying requests to extend its authority worldwide. DOD plays a significant role in infrastructure reconstruction in Iraq. In Iraq, DOD's large role in infrastructure reconstruction has been unusual. DOD was called on in 2004 to carry out the largest infrastructure projects, initially contracting with private companies. State Department assumed responsibility in 2005 for most aid programs, but DOD developed a program to rehabilitate Iraqi firms without their input. DOD's state-building activities have been carried out within the context of military operations. In 2005, DOD Directive 3000.05 recognized state-building as crucial for stability operations, stating that U.S. military forces should be prepared to establish or maintain order when civilians cannot. Critics highlight issues with strategic planning, economic development practices, civilian integration, and oversight in DOD's state-building efforts. Some critics recognize the ad hoc nature of state-building activities by DOD, but concerns arise over extending CERP authority worldwide without more State Department control. Defense experts acknowledge the need for civilians to handle political, social, and economic tasks. DOD officials are grappling with preparing military forces for political, social, and economic tasks in the absence of civilian personnel. This includes determining a civil-military division of labor in non-combat areas and expanding training for foreign police and security forces. Since the 1970s, Congress has been concerned about the human rights implications of U.S. assistance to foreign police forces, including DOD assistance. Analysts argue that more foreign police personnel, especially gendarmes with dual police and military training, are needed for post-conflict operations. Some suggest DOD should provide personnel to fill this training gap in major post-conflict zones. DOD is involved in various foreign assistance activities, including deploying military personnel as first responders to disasters, providing humanitarian relief, medical and veterinary assistance, and civic support. Military personnel provide medical, veterinary, and civic support as part of their training and operations. They also train foreign military and police forces for counternarcotics missions. In recent years, they have been involved in humanitarian assistance and state-building tasks in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan. The Department of Defense (DOD) has been working to enhance its capabilities for state-building and has urged Congress to enhance civilian agencies' capabilities for partnerships with DOD in these activities. Critics question DOD's involvement in foreign assistance, citing human rights concerns. The United States and the U.S. military benefit from DOD foreign assistance activities in various ways, including rapid response in emergencies, promoting a humanitarian image, providing security and intelligence in conflict situations, and fostering good relations with foreign populations and governments. Military training and security cooperation also contribute to U.S. diplomacy efforts. Since 9/11, DOD training and security assistance have been crucial for enabling foreign militaries to participate in peacekeeping operations and joint missions with the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan. This has helped soldiers enhance their skills and establish contacts with foreign military personnel for future operations. Critics have raised concerns about the DOD's role in these activities. Observers have critiqued the DOD's role in humanitarian activities, foreign policy objectives, and the effectiveness of civilian versus military personnel. NGOs have mixed views on DOD humanitarian assistance, with some criticizing military involvement in conflict areas. Military forces can provide security in unstable environments, but their involvement in humanitarian assistance can be problematic in some situations. The U.S. military's humanitarian role in Afghanistan raised concerns among non-governmental aid workers about compromising their neutrality. While some NGOs now appreciate the security military forces can provide in hostile areas, others still feel endangered by soldiers involved in humanitarian activities. Local populations in areas without U.S. military involvement may also be wary of military personnel. The use of U.S. military personnel for activities such as counterterrorism and counternarcotics programs can be seen as a prelude to military intervention, hindering foreign policy goals. In Latin America, military and intelligence efforts are met with suspicion, making cooperation on counterterrorism challenging. Mexico has resisted counternarcotics assistance involving the U.S. military, while African countries are concerned about increasing military engagement. Some analysts question the impact of U.S. military involvement on economic development. Some analysts question whether U.S. military objectives in small-scale infrastructure projects align with long-term development goals. In Iraq and Afghanistan, operational realities often overshadow normal development practices. Lack of integration with long-term plans in non-conflict areas can lead to unfulfilled economic growth expectations. The use of U.S. military personnel in state-building activities may send mixed signals in promoting democracy and civilian control. Some analysts believe that the use of U.S. military forces in state-building efforts may undermine civilian control and reinforce stereotypes in underdeveloped nations. The lack of expertise within the military to carry out coherent plans for economic and political development in foreign nations is also considered problematic. Placing USAID officers within combatant commands may help alleviate some issues, but their presence may not be sufficient to ensure best practices are routinely followed. Military forces have advantages in providing security and air support in humanitarian missions, but civilians are deemed more effective in various tasks like acquiring supplies, interacting with locals, and managing refugee camps. Studies show that civilian personnel excel in carrying out a wide range of humanitarian tasks in conflict situations. Personnel assisting with the Rwanda crisis in 1994 lacked expertise in refugee camp construction, health, and shelter management. Military forces are generally more costly than civilian means for humanitarian missions, according to a 1998 study. The 1998 study found that military forces are generally more costly than civilian means for humanitarian missions due to their emphasis on fail-safe procedures. However, in certain circumstances where military assets are already deployed, they can be a cost-effective means of delivering humanitarian assistance. The cost of using military forces for humanitarian missions can be influenced by various factors such as economies of scale and force protection. Some analysts believe that in certain situations, military forces are essential, and decisions on division of labor should be based on comparative advantage. Improving interagency coordination between DOD and the State Department is crucial for effective foreign assistance. Some analysts believe the imbalance between DOD and State Department resources may be a continuing problem, especially for activities in the context of military operations. Congress can mandate the type and degree of interaction between DOD and civilian agencies in foreign assistance. It can maintain or strengthen the State Department's leadership role or enhance the DOD role based on concerns of defense officials and analysts. Congress has historically made the Secretary of State the lead official for oversight of foreign assistance, including military aid. U.S. Ambassadors or officials in charge of diplomatic missions play a key role in coordinating military assistance with foreign policy, as outlined in Section 622 of the 1961 FAA. The Secretary of State is responsible for supervising and directing assistance programs to ensure they align with U.S. foreign policy goals. Congress has the authority to determine the level of interaction between the Department of Defense and civilian agencies in foreign assistance. The 1961 FAA charges the Secretary of State with supervising economic and military assistance programs, including military education and training. The Chief of Mission's responsibility involves coordinating these programs under the President's procedures. The Chief of Mission is responsible for coordinating foreign assistance programs among U.S. government representatives in each country, with a focus on military assistance. The Secretary of Defense is charged with providing military equipment and supervising the training of foreign military and related civilian personnel. Congress often requires the Department of State to oversee these programs. The Department of State oversees military assistance programs, with Congress often requiring its approval for activities involving civilian personnel. DOD needs approval from the Secretary of State for various programs, including educational, capacity building, and logistic support for allies. Coordination or consultation with the State Department and other agencies is mandated in some cases. The Department of Defense (DOD) must coordinate with the State Department and other relevant agencies for counternarcotics and counterterrorism activities. Despite legislative mandates, interagency coordination has varied over time due to factors like individual personalities and a lack of personnel. (See Appendix G, Appendix J, and Appendix K.) The DOD Defense Security Cooperation Agency coordinates project proposals from combatant commanders, requiring approval from the U.S. ambassador in the country where programs will be conducted. DSCA manages approval processes in Washington, D.C. for State Department and DOD programs, with Security Affairs Officers at U.S. embassies implementing these programs. The Bureau of Political-Military Affairs in the State Department coordinates the Department's position on these programs. The Bureau of Political-Military Affairs in the State Department coordinates military assistance, interagency responses, humanitarian assistance, and vetting of foreign forces. It also coordinates State Department responses to military exercises and has created new mechanisms for planning and coordinating DOD foreign assistance activities. The DOD has established new interagency groups and posts for civilian agency representatives at geographical combatant commands. These commands are integrating more civilian personnel, with the U.S. Southern Command and Special Operations Command already incorporating civilians. The planned Africa Command will also include diplomats and development experts. The USAID Office of the Military Advisor provides officials to combatant commands and Special Operations Command for foreign assistance planning. Concerns exist about eroding State Department leadership in civil-military coordination for foreign assistance activities. Some suggest increasing the DOD's role in these activities. Increasing the DOD's role in foreign assistance activities is a proposed solution, while others advocate for strengthening the State Department and USAID's capacity. Recommendations include increasing civilian staff, establishing an interagency group under the National Security Council, and reinforcing the role of U.S. ambassadors in approving foreign assistance activities. Some analysts suggest creating new regional mechanisms for State Department coordination to enhance control over foreign assistance activities. DOD's regional organization allows for better planning compared to the State Department's bilateral focus. Some analysts propose new regional mechanisms for State Department coordination to improve oversight of foreign assistance activities. Congress could fund regular meetings of regional ambassadors and military personnel for enhanced coordination, potentially locating regional Assistant Secretaries abroad for better collaboration with combatant commands. Some defense officials argue for greater DOD autonomy in foreign assistance activities to expedite urgent operations. Analysts suggest increasing budgets for combatant commands and expanding authority for state-building activities. The Section 1206 authority expands state-building activities and future employment capacity for U.S. partners. DOD's resource advantage sometimes causes friction with the State Department. DOD's \"Partnership Strategy\" emphasizes its resource advantages, but DOD officials believe Congress should support the State Department. In a July 2008 speech, Secretary of Defense Gates emphasized the need for Congress to provide resources to the State Department and USAID to strengthen their capacity for foreign assistance. He highlighted the chronic underfunding and understaffing of these civilian agencies compared to the military. DOD has greater planning, execution capabilities, and budgetary resources, with the ability to muster more manpower than any other agency. Despite military personnel being stretched in wartime, there are substantial reserves available for planning and carrying out activities. Combatant commands have more personnel focused on planning, while State Department personnel focus on diplomacy. CENTCOM created a Joint Task Force in the Horn of Africa with 2,000 military personnel for foreign assistance efforts. In Iraq, DOD temporarily filled State Department PRT posts until they could hire experts. Congress provides significant funding to DOD for foreign assistance. Congress provides substantial funding to the Department of Defense (DOD) for foreign assistance activities, such as the OHDACA appropriation which received $60 million annually from FY2005-FY2007 and $103.3 million in FY2008. This funding exceeds what the State Department provides to many countries for foreign assistance. However, the OHDACA funding only covers incremental costs, not the total cost of activities. In FY2009, Congress authorized $83.3 million for OHDACA, similar to the amount authorized in 1994 when the account was created. In FY2009, Congress authorized $83.3 million for OHDACA, which has decreased in constant terms from the initial $131 million in FY2009 dollars. DOD has been given an advantage with increased allocations for foreign assistance activities, including funds for Afghanistan and Iraq. However, despite greater resources, DOD may lack the competence and expertise needed for effective foreign assistance activities. The civil affairs specialty lacks personnel for state-building tasks, raising concerns about organization, training, and resources. Some U.S. embassies criticize military personnel for being poorly trained in information gathering and lacking regional expertise. DOD Directive 3000.05 emphasizes the need for qualified personnel for state-building and economic reconstruction activities, debating whether to invest in developing expertise internally or rely on civilians. The need for more civilian federal agencies to handle state-building and economic measures is emphasized by DOD officials and analysts. Urgency is highlighted by the State Department's inability to provide specialized personnel for PRTs in Iraq. There is a call for an increase in USAID permanent staff due to a significant decrease in numbers since the Vietnam war. The State Department Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) has received funding from DOD for preventive, transitional, and post-conflict activities. However, there are criticisms of S/CRS for not fully performing its functions due to lack of State Department commitment and funding. In 2008, the Bush Administration requested $248.6 million from Congress to fund Civilian Stabilization efforts. The Administration requested $248.6 million from Congress for a Civilian Stabilization Initiative to enhance U.S. civilian capabilities in responding to conflicts abroad. This initiative includes a civilian response corps with federal employees and citizens with state-building and economic skills. Congress allocated $50 million for the corps in 2007 and authorized a civilian reserve corps in 2009. The DOD is interested in increasing U.S. government capacity to train and equip foreign military and police forces. There are debates on whether DOD should enhance its training capacity or if Congress should allocate funds to the State Department for this purpose. Some suggest further exploration of using private sector civilian personnel for DOD missions. The DOD, along with InterAction and the U.S. Institute of Peace, is involved in disaster relief and humanitarian assistance overseas. Some analysts suggest the need for improvements and reexamining the role of for-profit contractors in supporting or replacing U.S. military forces in these activities. The USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) leads in disaster assistance, while the State Department assists refugees. DOD humanitarian assistance is conducted in various contexts, including military operations. DOD cooperates with international organizations and NGOs for humanitarian aid. The DOD's role in humanitarian assistance is discussed, with a focus on activities under 10 U.S.C. 401. The DOD plays a key role in providing humanitarian assistance in response to natural or manmade disasters, working closely with USAID and other agencies. Their efforts are primarily focused on coordinating emergency assistance for foreign disasters under the President's authority, rather than providing disaster relief under Title 10 U.S. Code. The DOD provides humanitarian assistance and transportation under Title 10 U.S. Code authorities, primarily through 10 U.S.C. 2561 for transporting humanitarian supplies worldwide as requested by the Secretary of State. Military personnel may assist USAID OFDA assessment teams in providing specific assistance like helicopter transport or road repair. The DOD provides humanitarian assistance and transportation under Title 10 U.S. Code authorities, primarily through 10 U.S.C. 2561 for transporting humanitarian supplies worldwide as requested by the Secretary of State. Military personnel may assist USAID OFDA assessment teams in providing specific assistance like road and bridge repair. The law requires an annual report to Congress on the use of funds, and donated goods can be shipped using Section 2561 funds. The \"Denton Amendment\" authorizes shipment of privately donated humanitarian goods on U.S. military aircraft and ships on a space-available basis. The DOD provides humanitarian assistance through various authorities, including 10 U.S.C. 2557, for nonlethal excess supplies for relief efforts. This assistance includes food, shelter, medical evacuation, and logistical support. Additionally, DOD conducts humanitarian activities during military operations and exercises. The DOD conducts humanitarian activities during military operations and training exercises, including providing humanitarian relief such as Operation Provide Comfort in Iraq and Operation Provide Relief in Somalia. Special Operations Forces also carry out humanitarian activities as part of their operations and training exercises with foreign forces under 10 U.S.C. 2011. The CCIF, authorized in 1991, provides funds for training foreign personnel and humanitarian assistance. In 2006, it was expanded to prioritize urgent humanitarian relief and reconstruction assistance in foreign countries where the armed forces are engaged in contingency operations. The CCIF, authorized in 1991, provides funds for training foreign personnel and humanitarian assistance, prioritizing urgent relief and reconstruction in countries where the armed forces are engaged in contingency operations. DOD has used just under $1 million for humanitarian purposes from FY2005 through FY2007, with a request for $100 million in CCIF funds for urgent relief and reconstruction in the FY2009 budget. Section 401 of Title 10 U.S. Code authorizes the military to perform specific humanitarian and civic action projects. Section 401 of Title 10 U.S. Code authorizes specific humanitarian and civic action projects, including technical assistance, construction of transportation systems, sanitation facilities, and public facilities. Projects must meet certain conditions, such as serving the basic needs of the recipient country's people, promoting security interests, and not benefiting military or paramilitary groups. These activities are carried out under combatant commands as part of authorized military operations. The statute stipulates that the Secretary of State must approve humanitarian and civic assistance under Section 401 of Title 10 U.S. Code. DOD instructions require approval from the Department of State, USAID, and other relevant agencies for all Section 401 activities. Combatant commanders endorse and forward proposed projects from host nation governments to DSCA for review to ensure compliance with U.S. policy and legislation. The review process for Section 401 humanitarian and civic assistance projects involves representatives from various government offices and agencies, including the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the DOD General Counsel's office, the Department of State, and USAID. Approval is required from the U.S. ambassador to the country where the project will take place and the Secretary of State. The origins and evolution of DOD's humanitarian programs date back to military civic action initiatives, with a history tracing back to the 18th and 19th centuries. The military civic action program, known as MCA, was established as a nation-building tool endorsed by President John F. Kennedy. Congress placed restrictions on MCA projects in 1965 to prevent overlap with USAID. The program became controversial in the 1960s due to its connection with international development. The MCA program, initially endorsed by President Kennedy, faced controversy in the 1960s due to its ties to counterinsurgency in Vietnam. Despite this, Congress funded non-counterinsurgency projects abroad, including an Africa program in the 1980s. Funding for the Africa program decreased from almost $5 million in FY1985 to under $2 million by FY1989. In the 1980s, MCA controversy in Central America led to Congress authorizing specific activities through a new statute, Section 401 of Title 10 U.S. Code in 1986, granting DOD greater flexibility for humanitarian and civic assistance activities in foreign nations. In FY1995 and FY2006, humanitarian and civic action activities took place in 43 countries under Section 401 authority. The number of recipient countries in Western Hemisphere, Middle East/Arab, and Asia/Pacific decreased, while Africa and Greater Europe saw growth. In FY2007, activities expanded to 46 countries, including new European and former Soviet Union locations. The MCA program has shifted towards granting DOD greater flexibility for assistance. The number of projects under Section 401 authority has significantly increased over the years, with a nearly eightfold increase from the early 1990s to FY2007. Costs for these projects have also risen, ranging from $4.7 million in FY1998 to $11.03 million in FY2007. Despite the rise in costs, they have not increased at the same pace as the number of projects. DOD humanitarian assistance is often praised for its flexibility in emergency relief situations. Humanitarian and civic assistance provided by U.S. military troops can be a flexible tool for relieving human suffering, but controversy arises in longer-term situations. Assistance is sometimes used for political purposes such as maintaining contact with countries, mitigating tensions, and promoting democracy. Concerns about project suitability and costs have been ongoing since the 1960s. Some analysts believe civic action projects fill a gap in U.S. assistance, but concerns arise about the suitability of using military forces for humanitarian interventions and state-building projects. Many argue that experienced civilians with subject area expertise could better perform these tasks. Military leaders questioned the use of military personnel for humanitarian interventions due to concerns about diverting resources from primary functions, lack of coordination with civilian agencies, and clashes in culture and operations. Issues from past interventions resurfaced in Iraq and Afghanistan, including the impact on civilian humanitarian workers' safety. The use of military personnel for humanitarian and civic assistance projects in Iraq and Afghanistan has raised concerns about the perception of humanitarian assistance being compromised. Incorporating civilians into Provincial Reconstruction teams has been challenging due to a lack of civilian personnel. Questions persist about the effectiveness and coordination of DOD activities with civilian agencies to align with U.S. foreign policy objectives. USAID personnel have been placed in U.S. regional combatant commands to oversee and develop proposed humanitarian and civic initiatives. The involvement of military forces in humanitarian aid and small-scale economic projects in U.S. regional combatant commands aims to synchronize USAID and DOD planning efforts. It also raises concerns about civilian control over the military in developing countries and the role of U.S. military forces as a democratic model for local military forces. DOD is engaged in global health programs focusing on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS. Programs include DHAPP and DOD-GEIS, as well as humanitarian assistance efforts funded by OHDACA. The DOD is involved in global health programs related to infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, with little publicly available documentation on other related programs. There is uncertainty regarding leadership and coordination of DOD global health policy, with informal policies in some offices but no agency-wide strategy. The Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (GEIS) supports prevention programs through partnerships among DOD labs, the military health system, and other agencies. President Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive NSTC-7 in June 1996, establishing a national policy to address emerging infectious diseases through improved surveillance, prevention, and response measures. The DOD Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (DOD-GEIS) was developed in response to this directive to facilitate early recognition and control of diseases threatening national security. DOD-GEIS aims to strengthen prevention, surveillance, and response to infectious diseases that pose a threat to military personnel, families, medical readiness, or U.S. national security. DOD-GEIS was established to increase emphasis on preventing infectious diseases, strengthen surveillance and response efforts, and coordinate resources with U.S. and international partners. It collaborates with Navy and Army labs, as well as the World Health Organization, to collect and analyze avian influenza isolates. The budget for DOD-GEIS has significantly increased over the past decade, reaching $52 million in FY2007, with a focus on pandemic and avian influenza surveillance. In 2006, Congress allocated $39 million for avian and pandemic influenza surveillance through DOD-GEIS, with an additional $40 million provided in 2007. DOD-GEIS made advancements in disease surveillance, including understanding biological threats, improving vaccination efforts, standardizing malaria diagnostics, and strengthening international efforts. The program also monitored infectious disease deaths in US military forces and enhanced surveillance systems in developing countries. DOD plays a role in global HIV/AIDS prevention through military-specific programs, assisting foreign militaries in policy development, program implementation, and training. DOD funds totaled $73.9 million from FY2000 to FY2009 for HIV/AIDS prevention. Additional funds are transferred from the Department of State through the Global program. The Department of State transfers additional funds to DOD through the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative for prevention programs. DOD's role in global health is under scrutiny for possible \"securitization\" of health resources. Lack of public information raises questions about the scope, funding, coordination, and integration of DOD global health programs. The Department of Defense participates in the Humanitarian Mine Action Program, training personnel from other nations to deactivate land mines and explosive remnants of war. The program is authorized by 10 U.S.C. 407 and falls under the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. Funding comes from DOD's Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid appropriation. Assistance is provided by U.S. Special Operations Forces when DOD conducts the training. The Humanitarian Mine Action Program, authorized by 10 U.S.C. 407, is overseen by the Department of Defense and complements the efforts of the Department of State's Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement. Assistance is provided by U.S. Special Operations Forces and approved by an interagency U.S. Government Policy Coordination Committee Sub-group. The U.S. Humanitarian Demining Program was established in 1993 by the National Security Council, followed by similar programs by the Defense Department and the Department of State. In 2003, Congress consolidated these efforts into an interagency humanitarian demining program in response to the international concern over the impact of land mines on civilian populations. The U.S. Humanitarian Demining Program, established in 1993, aims to provide assistance to other nations in detecting and clearing landmines through training, education, and technical support. Congress specified that funds should be used for activities supporting landmine clearance, providing equipment to foreign governments, and contributing to experienced NGOs. The Secretary of Defense is directed to ensure DOD's participation is limited to training and technical assistance. The U.S. Humanitarian Demining Program, established in 1993, provides training and technical assistance to other nations for detecting and clearing landmines. Congress directed that funds should support landmine clearance activities and provide equipment to foreign governments and NGOs. The Secretary of Defense ensures that U.S. armed forces only participate in training and technical assistance, not in physical mine detection or destruction unless for specific military operations. HMA activities include training host nation personnel and providing equipment to support demining efforts. These activities contribute to combatant commanders' regional cooperation strategies and provide unique training opportunities for U.S. military personnel. The U.S. Humanitarian Demining Program, established in 1993, provides training and technical assistance for detecting and clearing landmines. The program is supported by the Demining Training Center at Ft. Leonard Wood, MO, and the Mine Action Information Center at James Madison University, Harrisonburg, VA. HMA funding also supports the Humanitarian Demining Research and Development Program. The DSCA provides a report of activities to congressional committees annually. HMA funding has decreased since FY2000, but the number of countries receiving assistance is substantial. The U.S. Humanitarian Demining Program, established in 1993, provides training and technical assistance for detecting and clearing landmines in around 30 countries. The program is supported by the Demining Training Center at Ft. Leonard Wood, MO, and the Mine Action Information Center at James Madison University, Harrisonburg, VA. The U.S. Foreign Military Sales Program (FMS) is the principal vehicle through which the U.S. government makes sales of weapons and associated equipment and training to friendly foreign nations on a cash basis. The U.S. Foreign Military Sales Program (FMS) allows the government to monitor procurement processes and deliver purchased items. Foreign Military Financing (FMF) provides loans or forgiven payments for countries in need of military equipment. The State Department formulates the annual budget justification for Foreign Operations, with input from the Department of Defense (DOD). DOD handles the implementation of the FMS cash and credit, as well as the Military Assistance Program (MAP) before 1976. The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) specifies conditions for countries to purchase defense articles from the United States. The President determines a country's eligibility based on U.S. security interests. Eligible countries must commit to using purchased items for self-defense and internal security, and not transfer them without U.S. consent. The responsibility for implementing FMS programs lies with the State Department. The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program requires U.S. government consent for countries to purchase defense articles. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) manages FMS programs through Security Assistance Officers (SAOs) in U.S. embassies. FMS originated during the Cold War to support NATO allies with military equipment and training. The Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949 authorized FMS and the Military Assistance Program (MAP) to aid allied countries with surplus World War II equipment. During the Cold War, the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program provided military assistance to allied countries by selling surplus World War II equipment. The core rationales for this assistance were to enhance allies' defense capabilities, deter aggression, and show support for political actions. As economies grew, industrialized nations began paying cash for major military equipment instead of receiving grant aid. The United States transitioned from providing grant military aid to selling major weapons systems under the FMS program in the 1970s. The goal of using arms sales to enhance the military capabilities of American allies remains constant, despite changes in global threats. Initially, industrialized allies participated in the FMS program, while the grant MAP program aided less developed countries friendly to the United States. The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program transitioned from grant military aid to selling weapons systems in the 1970s. Initially, industrialized allies participated, while less developed countries friendly to the US received grant aid. Today, Middle Eastern nations, especially major oil-producing states, are significant buyers. Israel and Egypt have been leading recipients of FMS sales and Foreign Military Financing (FMF) credits since the late 1970s. Israel received over $2.257 billion in FY2006. In FY2006, Israel received $2.257 billion in FMF financing, with repayment waived. Egypt received $1.287 billion in waived FMF financing. The total FMF appropriation for FY2006 was $4.45 billion for all recipients. There have been no significant controversies over the management of FMS cash or FMF financing programs between the Defense and State Departments. Both departments agree on the need for more funding to provide defense articles to countries in need. State Department security cooperation programs like FMS/FMF lack flexibility to respond quickly to changing environments. DOD noted in a FY2009 budget document that traditional security assistance takes too long to execute, prompting a request for train and equip authority. IMET, under State Department policy authority, is funded through Foreign Operations Appropriations and implemented by DOD through DSCA, providing opportunities for foreign military personnel to attend U.S. military educational institutions. The IMET program allows foreign military personnel to attend U.S. military educational institutions and training courses. Policy decisions are primarily made by the State Department with input from DOD. IMET originated from the Military Assistance Program (MAP) and was established as a separate program in 1976 under the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act. In 1990, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees directed the Defense Department to establish a new program within IMET focused on training foreign civilian and military officials in managing military establishments, maintaining effective military judicial systems, and promoting civilian control of the military. Congress allocated $1 million for this program in the FY1991 IMET budget. The Expanded IMET (E-IMET) program was established in FY1991 with $1 million from the IMET budget to train foreign civilian and military officials in promoting civilian control of the military. Congress has since broadened the program to include members of national legislatures and individuals not part of the government. E-IMET is funded as part of the annual IMET appropriation for various training programs conducted by the Defense Department. The Defense Department conducts training programs at various venues, including the National Defense University and Service War Colleges. These programs focus on national security policy and military aspects. Foreign students are invited to participate in these programs, which are categorized as professional military education. The specific schools include National Defense University in Washington, D.C., Army War College in Carlisle Barracks, Navy War College in Newport, and Air War College in Maxwell Air Force Base. Foreign military students participate in training programs categorized as professional military education (PME) at various Service Command and Staff Colleges in the United States. Programs are tailored based on the students' military rank and responsibilities. Training includes basic and advanced officer courses in specialized areas like finance, ordnance, artillery, and medicine. Some senior officers may also attend U.S. senior service schools such as the Army Command and Staff College and Air Force Institute of Technology. PME and senior service school programs make up half of the annual IMET appropriation, with most training conducted at DOD and U.S. military schools. The Defense Language Institute English Language Center (DLIELC) at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas provides English language training for foreign military students to improve their proficiency. DLIELC conducts training surveys and assigns instructors to assist in establishing and maintaining English language programs in host countries. In FY2006, over 110 countries participated in grant IMET training programs with an appropriation of over $81 million. The E-IMET initiative focuses on educational programs in the United States. The E-IMET initiative, funded with over $81 million, focuses on educational programs in the United States through DOD and U.S. military service schools. It emphasizes longer training experiences in the U.S. to maximize exposure to American life. New courses were introduced in FY1991, addressing military justice, human rights, and civil-military relations through schools like the Defense Resource Management Institute and Naval Postgraduate School. The IMET programs are managed through three schools: Defense Resource Management Institute, Naval Postgraduate School, and Naval Justice School. There have been no significant controversies over the division of management tasks between the Defense and State Departments. Both departments wish for additional funding to provide training to allied nations. DOD has argued that IMET lacks flexibility to respond to rapidly changing environments. The DOD global train and equip authority provided in Section 1206 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2006 was intended to offer a quicker response to rapidly changing environments. DOD has multiple roles in counternarcotics, including detecting illegal drug movements and providing assistance to foreign countries in building institutional capacity. The DOD plays a role in counternarcotics by assisting foreign countries in building institutional capacity and controlling ungoverned spaces used by drug traffickers. Interagency coordination between DOD and the State Department on counter-narcotics assistance varies, with differences often due to priorities of countries and issues. The origins of U.S. concern about narcotics trafficking date back to the late 1960s, with President Nixon declaring a \"war on drugs\" in 1971. President Richard Nixon coined the term \"war on drugs\" and labeled illicit drugs as \"public enemy number one.\" Calls for U.S. military involvement in anti-drug efforts grew in the 1970s and 1980s due to concerns about law enforcement's ability to combat drug cartels. Former Secretaries of Defense Caspar Weinberger and Frank Carlucci objected to the military's increasing role in drug-related activities. In the 1980s, DOD officials objected to military involvement in drug-related activities, citing concerns about its impact on military readiness and democratic processes. Despite this, DOD increasingly participated in anti-drug operations and training foreign anti-narcotics personnel. Reagan and Bush administrations expanded DOD's role in counter-narcotics assistance. During the Reagan and Bush administrations, DOD became actively involved in U.S. counter-narcotics efforts in Latin America. President Reagan issued NSD-221, declaring narcotics trafficking a national security concern and directing military support. President Bush's NSD-18 instructed the Secretary of Defense to prioritize counter-narcotics. Congress granted DOD authority in 1989 to lead in detecting and monitoring drug transit. This expanded to include training and equipping assistance in the Andean region in the 1990s. Congress authorized DOD to provide CN-related training and transport of law enforcement personnel to foreign agencies under the NDAA for FY1991 and equip foreign CN personnel under the NDAA for FY1998. Section 1033 allows DOD to assist 18 countries' CN efforts by providing non-lethal equipment. Congress has also supported efforts to restrict DOD's role in CN assistance. Senator Patrick Leahy sponsored a provision in the 1997 Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Appropriations Act to prohibit U.S. CN funds from supporting countries with human rights violations. The provision was later extended to DOD in 1998, but with a narrower scope than the State Department's restriction. This difference allows DOD to provide CN assistance to countries that the State Department may not. DOD provides CN assistance to Colombia and the Andean region under Section 1004 and Section 1033 authorities, focusing on combating paramilitary and terrorist groups linked to drug trafficking. Concerns include the effectiveness of CN foreign assistance in reducing drug availability in the US and unintended consequences of strengthening Latin American military capabilities. In Afghanistan, DOD supports CN efforts as part of a broader strategy to combat drugs and terrorism. The NDAA for FY2004 and FY2007 added Afghanistan to the list of countries eligible for DOD CN assistance, including weapons and ammunition for CN security forces. Critics have raised concerns about DOD's role in CN in Afghanistan, with some viewing it as a diversion from stability and counterterrorism operations. The U.S. military requested authorization from Congress for counterdrug activities in Afghanistan, but legislation has not expanded DOD's CN assistance beyond previous authorizations. Congressional resistance to expanding DOD CN authorities is evident, with a focus on not taking on roles that other countries or U.S. government agencies are responsible for. In Mexico, the M\u00e9rida Initiative was announced in 2007 as a $1.4 billion bilateral commitment. The M\u00e9rida Initiative is a $1.4 billion bilateral commitment to reduce drug trafficking and strengthen Mexican security forces. Congress appropriated $400 million for Mexico in FY2008 and FY2009. DOD spent $58 million on equipment and training for CN support to the Mexican military from 2000 to 2006. It is unclear how the M\u00e9rida Initiative will impact current levels of DOD CN assistance to Mexico. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, under Section 1022 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, extends train and equip authorities to Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Analysts debate DOD's role in counter-narcotics assistance, with proponents citing national security threats and military resources, while opponents argue against military involvement in CN foreign assistance. Critics fear that DOD's involvement in counter-narcotics assistance may disproportionately favor the military, with plans to expand the U.S. Southern Command's role in non-traditional military activities like CN assistance. The 2018 plan aims to enhance interagency coordination of international programs among military and civilian agencies in SOUTHCOM. However, some analysts are concerned that this new strategic direction may militarize U.S. foreign policy in the region and antagonize foreign partners like Mexico. Mexico's military cooperation under NORTHCOM remains limited, with concerns about balancing military and civilian roles in CN assistance. Some analysts worry about the challenges in coordinating DOD and State Department CN policy planning. DOD's CN planning differs from the State Department's, making cross-agency coordination difficult. DOD and State Department have different approaches to counterterrorism planning and funding. DOD focuses on capabilities rather than geographic basis, allocating funds by function, while State Department provides CN assistance summaries by country and function. Both departments contribute resources to enhance foreign governments' counterterrorism capabilities. The State Department conducts an Anti-Terrorism Assistance program to train and equip foreign police forces. DOD participates in counterterrorism programs like the Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership and provides assistance through its own programs and authority. The U.S. government has significantly increased post-9/11 counterterrorism assistance to foreign governments, focusing on detecting, deterring, combating, and solving terrorism-related activities through training and equipping foreign personnel. The U.S. government provides counterterrorism assistance to foreign governments by training and equipping their military and security forces to combat terrorist threats. Programs may include economic and social components, especially in ungoverned areas. The Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership focuses on addressing extremism and terrorism in the Sahel region. The Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP) is an interagency initiative aimed at addressing violent extremism and terrorism in the Sahel and Maghreb regions. It involves various agencies such as DOD, State, Justice, Homeland Security, Treasury, FBI, and USAID, with goals to build military and law enforcement capacity, foster regional cooperation, counter radicalization, and enhance public diplomacy. TSCTP is a successor program to the Pan Sahel Initiative (PSI) and includes development programs to improve health, education, and governance. The Pan Sahel Initiative (PSI) aimed to train and equip rapid-reaction companies in Saharan nations. U.S. Marines and Army Special Forces provided training in marksmanship, planning, and equipment. The PSI was succeeded by the Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Initiative (TSCTI) in 2005, expanding to include more Sahel countries and strategic support for U.S. public diplomacy efforts. The program now includes Algeria, Nigeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Senegal under Operation Enduring Freedom\u2014Trans-Sahara. The DOD component of the TSCTP, Operation Enduring Freedom\u2014Trans-Sahara, provides basic infantry training and advanced counterterrorism capabilities. It includes Military Information Support Teams and Civil Military Support Elements for public diplomacy efforts. The combined budget from DOD, State Department, and USAID is approximately $150 million per year to support TSCTP activities. The State Department and USAID contribute one-third of the budget for TSCTP activities, with DOD providing the remaining two-thirds. Plans are in place to maintain this funding level until FY2011. The State Department's Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism has established eight regional interagency strategy groups chaired by ambassadors to assess terrorist threats and develop counterterrorism strategies. These groups aim to create a common understanding of the strategic situation in various regions and coordinate efforts to eliminate terrorist safe havens. In January 2002, DOD established the Regional Defense Counterterrorism Fellowship Program (CTFP) with $17.9 million appropriated by Congress. The program funds foreign military officers' attendance at U.S. military education institutions and selected regional centers for non-lethal training. In 2003, the program was expanded to include civilians and other venues, with an annual authorization limit of $20 million. This allows DOD to pay for the attendance of foreign military officers, ministry of defense officials, and security officials at U.S. military educational institutions. The Title 10 U.S. Code statute allows for education and training of foreign military and civilian personnel involved in counterterrorism efforts, with a $25 million limit and expanded venues. The program aims to educate, create a counterterrorism network, provide intellectual resources, and promote cooperation in combating terrorism. The DOD supports the TSCTP program and Regional Strategic Initiatives to combat terrorism. Concerns have been raised about potential duplication of efforts and lack of coordination between DOD and civilian agencies. The expansion of the program has led to questions about the inclusion of lethal training activities and the differences from other counterterrorism programs. Some view cooperation on counterterrorism as a model for DOD-State Department cooperation, but there is room for improvement. Interagency cooperation in the TSCTP program is progressing, but is heavily reliant on individual personalities. Impediments to better coordination include separate policy development, institutional culture differences, and varying perspectives between agencies. The CSIS report highlights a lack of coherent strategic vision and planning in counterterrorism efforts across DOD, the State Department, and USAID. There is criticism that the TSCTP fails to address economic, social, and political sources of instability effectively. Despite the agreement that counterterrorism strategy should focus more on development and governance activities, budgets have been skewed towards military efforts, hindering the program's ability to address underlying issues. Coordination of counterterrorism assistance programs with the overall U.S. strategy is crucial for success. The lack of coordination in counterterrorism efforts across DOD, the State Department, and USAID may negatively impact a foreign country's support for U.S. national security policies. Training and services offered by these departments can influence a foreign country's approach to addressing terrorism. If federal government organizations do not coordinate with counterterrorism activities, conflicting policy signals may be sent to host countries. Inefficient use of resources and lack of transparency in interagency counterterrorism programs may lead to conflicting policy signals to host countries. Congress lacks a comprehensive account of multiple counterterrorism programs, including the Section 1206 authority for training and equipping foreign military forces. The Section 1206 authority allows for train and equip programs administered by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, with coordination between the State Department and DOD. Proposals are reviewed by U.S. embassies and Combatant Commands before being vetted by State Department and DOD officials. The Section 1206 authority allows for train and equip programs administered by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, with coordination between the State Department and DOD. Proposals selected as priority activities are sent to congressional committees for reprogramming approval. Established in 2005, this authority was amended and extended in 2007 to enhance DOD's ability to respond to emerging terrorist threats. Funding has been primarily used for counterterrorism programs and is in effect through FY2008. Section 1206 authorized the provision of training, supplies, and equipment for foreign military forces to perform counterterrorism operations or support military and stability operations. The Secretary of Defense could transfer funds from the defensewide operations and maintenance account for these programs, with strict conditions to observe human rights and civilian authority. Congress set the original funding limit at $200 million for FY2006. Congress amended Section 1206 provisions through the John Warner NDAA for FY2007 to extend the authority through FY2008, raise the funding limit to $300 million, and allow the Secretary of Defense to use all DOD operations and maintenance accounts for funding. The initiation of programs was also changed to allow the Secretary of Defense, with the Secretary of State's approval, to authorize training without requiring a presidential decision. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense was required to notify relevant congressional committees. Congress amended Section 1206 provisions through the John Warner NDAA for FY2007 to extend the authority through FY2008, raise the funding limit to $300 million, and allow the Secretary of Defense to use all DOD operations and maintenance accounts for funding. The Secretary of Defense was authorized to train and equip foreign military and security forces, with a proposed spending limit of $750 million and the ability to waive restrictions on assistance. Congress declined a DOD request to expand Section 1206 authority in May 2007 and denied additional funding in FY2008. In its FY2009 budget request, DOD asked for $500 million. In FY2009, DOD requested $500 million for Section 1206 capacity-building. A proposal was made to codify Section 1206 at Title 10 U.S. Code, Chapter 20, with an annual authorization of up to $750 million for building foreign military and other forces. DOD and the State Department would jointly formulate programs, with coordination by the Secretaries of Defense and State. In February 2008, a proposal was made to grant waiver authority to the President and the Secretary of State for Section 1206 programs. In FY2006, DOD used Section 1206 authority for counterterrorism projects in 11 countries, costing over $100 million. In FY2007, programs in over 20 countries cost almost $280 million, mainly providing equipment and training by contractors. DOD assisted Chad and Nigeria in developing an information-sharing system for counterterrorism efforts in the trans-Saharan region. In FY2007, Section 1206 funds were used to enhance maritime capabilities in various countries including Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Lebanon, Yemen, Pakistan, Djibouti, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Additionally, a 15-country African Maritime Security program was initiated, along with a multinational maritime program in the Caribbean Basin. Bahrain also received assistance for coastal patrol boat development. In FY2007, Section 1206 funds were used to enhance intelligence and counterterrorism capabilities in various African countries, Albania, Georgia, Kazakstan, Macedonia, Ukraine, Yemen, and Mexico. Funds also supported the East Africa Regional Security Initiative and multinational civil-military operations training. Obligations for FY2008 projects in Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Lebanon, and the Philippines totaled $24.8 million as of May 2008. Section 1206 funding has been controversial in DOD foreign assistance programs. The December 2006 Senate Foreign Relations Committee report rejected special authority to DOD for security assistance programs, recommending that the Secretary of State oversee all funding. SFRC staff found that Section 1206 programs lacked embassy input and did not address emergency situations. Some improvements in planning have been noted. Some improvements in planning and coordination have been observed since the SFRC report. The GAO reported better coordination in formulating FY2007 proposals, attributing it to more time and explicit guidance. DOD and State Department coordination on Section 1206 programs is praised for its effectiveness in addressing emerging threats. However, concerns have been raised about the heavy reliance on private contractors in the program. The new interagency process has expedited project selection. The new interagency process has expedited project selection for Section 1206 activities, potentially allowing for the use of U.S. military personnel. The FY2008 selection process is ongoing, and proposed provisions in the FY2009 NDAA could permit funds to be used over multiple years, facilitating military training. The State Department's Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) aims to train and equip foreign military and security forces for international peacekeeping operations. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report raises concerns about the Department of Defense's authority under Section 1206 for security assistance, recommending a larger State Department budget for counterterrorism funding. CSIS supports extending Section 1206 training to foreign security forces. The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) aims to train soldiers from developing nations in peacekeeping skills with the support of the Department of Defense and State Department. GPOI also assists the Italian Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units (COESPU) and is overseen by the State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) is implemented through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) and military Combatant Commands. Training in Africa is mainly conducted by private sector personnel under a State Department contract, while U.S. military personnel handle training elsewhere. The State Department's Africa Bureau is heavily involved in program development and oversight in Africa. GPOI was created to enhance the State Department's peacekeeping training program in Africa, providing training, equipment, and support to potential African peacekeepers. The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) was designed to improve international capabilities to control conflicts, with a focus on Africa through the African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) program. The goal of GPOI was endorsed by the Group of 8 (G8) major industrial countries to create 75,000 peacekeepers by 2010. President George W. Bush emphasized the need for permanent capabilities to respond to crises and stabilize regions in turmoil. The Clinton Administration created the ACRI program in response to similar concerns. The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) was initiated by the Clinton Administration in response to concerns about conflicts and instability. By the end of 2007, GPOI had trained 40,000 potential peacekeepers worldwide, with the majority from sub-Saharan Africa. The program is funded by the State Department with a budget of $660 million for FY2005-FY2009. If Congress approves the full FY2009 request, funding will total $487.7 million. Despite general support for its purposes, GPOI's implementation has faced challenges. The Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) has faced implementation challenges despite being generally supported. Congress requested a report on concerns regarding record-keeping, training quality, equipment readiness, mobilization capacity, deployment rates, and contractor usage. The report in June 2008 noted progress in achieving GPOI goals in certain areas. The State Department and DOD have made progress in achieving GPOI goals in training peacekeepers, providing equipment for missions, and building peacekeeping skills. Challenges remain in meeting these goals. Recommendations include improving oversight of equipment delivery, assessing training program outcomes, screening trainees for human rights violations, and assessing resources needed to develop African countries' peacekeeping capabilities. The Department of Defense (DOD) plays a key role in the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, securing and eliminating weapons. The program was established in response to concerns about the safety of Soviet nuclear weapons after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The Cooperative Threat Reduction program was established in response to concerns about the security of Soviet nuclear weapons. Congress allocated significant funds to assist with transportation, storage, and dismantlement of weapons, with the total budget for U.S. nonproliferation and threat reduction programs in the former Soviet Union reaching around $1 billion per year. DOD played a major role in implementing projects and receiving funding, while other agencies like DOE and the State Department also participated in some programs. The State Department coordinated umbrella agreements with former Soviet states for funding programs, while the DOD served as the executive agent for project design and funding. A deputies committee from various agencies met regularly to discuss priorities and coordinate U.S. threat reduction assistance. The State Department coordinated funding programs with former Soviet states, while the DOD oversaw project design and funding. A deputies committee from various agencies met regularly to discuss priorities and coordinate U.S. threat reduction assistance. In FY1996, responsibility for some nonproliferation programs shifted to DOE and the State Department, with State taking over Science and Technology centers in Moscow and Kiev, and DOE taking over the Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting program. The DOD and DOE supported the shift in funding and administration for nonproliferation programs in the former Soviet Union. This change allowed each agency to focus on programs that aligned with their expertise, reducing tensions and enabling DOE to expand contacts with scientists in the FSU. The division of programs between the DOD, DOE, and State Department proved to be a financial boon to the threat reduction and nonproliferation effort, with funding increasing to around $1 billion per year by the end of the decade. This increase was mainly due to the expansion of DOE's programs at materials and storage facilities for nuclear warheads. Initially, U.S. assistance under the Nunn-Lugar amendment was seen as a response to chaos in the former Soviet Union. Concerns about nuclear weapons diversion persisted even after the immediate crisis passed. The Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program was viewed as a long-term effort to reduce threats. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry described CTR as \"defense by other means\" to eliminate Soviet weapons and prevent new threats. The Nunn-Lugar legislation was tightly focused on this mission. The initial Nunn-Lugar legislation focused on the transport, storage, and destruction of weapons of mass destruction. The United States provided assistance with destruction and dismantlement projects in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Projects included removing warheads, deactivating missiles, and enhancing safety and security over nuclear weapons. The CTR program funded projects at storage facilities for nuclear weapons. The CTR program in Russia funded projects to improve security and accounting systems at storage facilities for nuclear weapons and materials. Demilitarization projects encouraged Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine to convert military efforts to peaceful purposes. The focus of CTR funding has shifted towards securing and eliminating chemical and biological weapons, as well as securing storage sites for nuclear warheads. Russia has received most of the funding in recent years. In recent years, the United States has increased funding for projects to secure borders and track materials, aiming to prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists. This shift in funding was partly due to concerns about the security of Russian nuclear and chemical facilities, which experts warned could be vulnerable to terrorist exploitation. Congress expanded programs to enhance security at these facilities. Since September 11, 2001, analysts have emphasized the importance of helping Russia protect its weapons, materials, and knowledge to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. The Administration expanded the CTR program to support the war on terrorism and increased funding for export and border control programs to enhance security measures. The Bush Administration has focused on stemming proliferation of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union, including efforts to secure Soviet-era nuclear weapons. Analysts have raised concerns about the lack of coordination among DOD, DOE, and the State Department in setting priorities and allocating funding for nonproliferation programs. The White House has been advised to appoint a nonproliferation czar to oversee threat reduction and nonproliferation programs. Congress has addressed various issues related to CTR projects, including funding restrictions and questions about Russia's contributions. Some argue for increased funding to secure weapons and materials in Russia more quickly. The United States is debating whether to increase funding for securing weapons and materials in Russia, with concerns that this could potentially undermine U.S. security by freeing up funds for Russia's defense budget. There have been disputes over funding programs through DOE or DOD, but collaboration between the agencies has improved. Some Members of Congress question allocating funds to the CTR program from the DOD budget, as the focus shifts towards securing borders and preventing the loss of WMD materials and knowledge. The President and Senate supported allocating CTR program funds outside the former Soviet Union. The Bush Administration requested $50 million in FY2004 Defense Authorization Bill. The Senate approved, but the House preferred State Department management. $78 million was authorized for threat reduction efforts outside the former Soviet Union. The Conference Committee approved the President's request with the funding designated for short-term use. The committee language specifies that CTR funding should be used for short-term projects and the President should determine if DOD is the best agency for implementation. The United States has only spent CTR funding outside the former Soviet Union once, assisting Albania in 2004. DOD has retained the authority to use funds outside the former Soviet Union. In Iraq and Afghanistan, DOD has taken on economic reconstruction and state-building roles beyond its military duties. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the Department of Defense (DOD) has taken on economic reconstruction and state-building roles beyond its military duties, sometimes overshadowing civilian agencies like the Department of State and USAID. The Department of Defense (DOD) plays a significant role in economic reconstruction and state-building in Iraq and Afghanistan through programs like CERP and PRTs. DOD's involvement in post-invasion planning in Iraq was formalized with the establishment of ORHA and later the CPA, which made decisions on U.S. assistance direction. The Office of the President established the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF) in 2003, with DOD responsible for implementing infrastructure programs. Congress approved $18.4 billion for the IRRF in 2003, with DOD ultimately responsible for 75% of the funds. $9.2 billion was allocated to DOD for non-security-related activities. The DOD oversaw economic reconstruction programs in Iraq, focusing on large-scale infrastructure projects. The CPA contracted private firms to manage construction sectors, establishing a Program Management Office (PMO). In 2004, the PMO became the Project and Contracting Office (PCO) after the dissolution of the CPA. The Project and Contracting Office (PCO) was established as a temporary Army organization under Policy Directive (NSPD) 36. It continued to be responsible to both DOD and State Department, even after the State-run Iraq Reconstruction Management Office (IRMO) was created. In 2005, the PCO merged with the Army Corps of Engineers/Gulf Region Division (ACE-GRD), which became its successor in 2007. DOD initiated a program in 2006 to rehabilitate state-owned enterprises in Iraq without State or USAID involvement. The U.S. initiated a program in 2006 to rehabilitate state-owned enterprises in Iraq, despite State Department skepticism. $100 million was requested for this endeavor in FY2007, with Congress approving $50 million. Additional funding requests were made in FY2008 and FY2009. The reconstruction program, largely managed by DOD, was criticized for ineptness in its first year. The program development under the CPA in Iraq was marked by ineptness, with large Iraqi-owned financial resources going unaccounted for. Audits found that infrastructure programs were poorly monitored and constructed, leading to wasted funds. The lack of coordination between the Army and State Department may have contributed to these issues. The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) provided DOD-appropriated funds for reconstruction activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, especially in rural areas where civilian presence was limited. The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) aims to stabilize areas post-military operations by gaining local support through various activities like school construction and water supply rehabilitation. The program is flexible, allowing grants up to $500,000 to be approved by commanders. Roughly $3.6 billion in CERP funding has been allocated in Iraq as of fall 2008. The program was authorized in Iraq in June 2003 and has been credited with helping the military fulfill security missions while addressing immediate development needs. The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) in Iraq and Afghanistan was funded through appropriations acts, criticized for lack of development strategy, and used for infrastructure projects like water and sanitation. The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) is the main source of U.S. infrastructure assistance in areas such as water and sanitation, and road construction in Afghanistan and Iraq. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) are civil-military teams located in enclaves throughout these countries, created to accelerate reconstruction and stabilization efforts. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan and Iraq integrate civilian and military personnel to meet stability objectives in defined regions. Military provides protection for civilian officials to engage with local governments and NGOs. PRTs focus on counter-insurgency and training Afghan security forces in Afghanistan. The Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan have three main goals: stability/security, extending the reach of the central government, and reconstruction. There are 26 PRTs in Afghanistan, with 12 U.S.-run and 14 run by coalition partner countries, all part of NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). U.S. PRTs consist of 50 to 100 military personnel, including DOD civil affairs officers, representatives from civilian agencies, and Afghanistan's Interior Ministry. Many U.S. PRTs are located in conflicted areas on forward operating bases with combat troops. The initial guidance for U.S.-run Afghanistan PRTs was approved in June 2003. The U.S. Deputies Committee of the National Security Council approved the responsibilities for improving security, logistical support, and force protection for all PRT members in Afghanistan in June 2003. The Department of State was tasked with political oversight, coordination, and reporting, while USAID was designated as the lead agency for reconstruction. However, the military element in Afghanistan PRTs seemed to have a more prominent role in reconstruction efforts compared to PRTs in Iraq. An interagency assessment noted that PRTs in Afghanistan had a predominantly military culture, especially when co-located with combat units. In Iraq, there are currently 14 U.S.-led PRTs and 13 ePRTs, with members from various agencies including the military. PRTs focus on expanding assistance outreach and strengthening local government, while ePRTs work on stabilizing areas by utilizing government funding to create jobs and meet basic needs. The U.S. and Iraqi government fund PRTs to create jobs and meet basic needs, with DOD providing security and logistical support. PRTs in Iraq were authorized by Cable 4045 in October 2005, but the division of responsibilities between DOS and DOD was unclear. Coordination between the U.S. Embassy and military components was not well-defined according to SIGIR. The DOD agreed to provide protection to the PRTs in Iraq in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) in February 2007. The presence of a supportive brigade commander was crucial for PRT success, as seen in Mosul. However, in Anbar, a lack of support led to difficulties in obtaining resources and exclusion from meetings with government officials. Commanders sometimes expressed frustration over PRTs' failure to create employment through funding state-owned enterprises. The DOD's role in providing assistance to PRTs in Iraq and Afghanistan has been greater than intended due to civilian staffing shortfalls. Despite successes in stabilizing areas, some criticize PRTs for lacking a unified concept of operations and coordination issues. The DOD's significant role in PRT decision making, particularly in providing security and assistance through the CERP program, has led to coordination issues among agencies. In Afghanistan, PRTs being subordinated to combat units threatens their core focus on strengthening the government's capacity. In Iraq, reports suggest that CERP use undermines civilian efforts to support local government. The lack of clear objectives and performance measures for each PRT hinders coordinated efforts among agencies. The DOD plays a lead role in providing training assistance to Iraqi and Afghan security forces, with funding and authorities granted by Congress. Congress has also provided funding and authorities for international partners to contribute to coalition efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Department of Defense (DOD) leads training and equipping efforts for Iraqi and Afghan security forces, with funding and authorities granted by Congress. DOD provides resources directly to some partners and reimburses others for support. Foreign security assistance programs like Foreign Military Financing and International Military Education and Training are managed by the Department of State and implemented by DOD. The decision for DOD to take the lead was due to the size and urgency of the tasks, as well as the presence of capable personnel on-site. The legislation authorizing DOD to provide \"train and equip\" support for Iraq and Afghanistan is specific and limited, requiring concurrence from the Secretary of State. Coordination mechanisms are in place for State Department approval, with initial focus on the New Iraqi Army and Afghan National Army. Subsequent legislation expanded support to include military and security forces. The legislation expanded support to include military and security forces of Iraq and Afghanistan, with a focus on assistance, equipment, training, and funding. Funds for train and equip missions increased significantly over time, reaching $9.7 billion in 2007. Training efforts in Iraq were initially led by the Coalition Provisional Authority. The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), led by Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, was the legal executive authority in Iraq from May 2003 to June 2004. The military command in Iraq, Combined Joint Task Force-7 (CJTF-7), reported to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) and supported CPA. Iraq's pre-war security forces were not available after major combat, leading to challenges in providing security for the Iraqi people. The CPA dissolved all Iraqi military services, including the Army, in May 2003, hindering the option of unit recall for security or reconstruction. The New Iraqi Army was then created under CPA authority, with Iraqi police training also under CPA oversight. The CPA dissolved Iraqi military services in May 2003, creating the New Iraqi Army under its authority. The Iraqi Civil Defense Corps (ICDC) was launched in September 2003 as a security and emergency service agency for Iraq, utilizing CJTF-7 resources to fill the security vacuum. President Bush issued NSPD 36 on May 11, 2004, assigning CENTCOM the mission of organizing, training, and equipping all Iraqi security forces, including civilian police and military forces. This led to the creation of MNSTC-I under MNF-I to coordinate international efforts in training Iraqi security forces. The MNSTC-I under MNF-I was established to coordinate international efforts in training Iraqi security forces. NTM-I, with participation from NATO members, provides training and assistance to Iraqi forces. MNSTC-I also mentors and builds capacity in Iraqi Ministries of Defense and Interior. In Afghanistan, efforts to train and equip Afghan security forces have evolved since the regime removal in 2001. In 2002, the United States established the Office of Military Cooperation-Afghanistan (OMC-A) to train the Afghan army, while Germany led the police training effort. By 2003, the State Department's INL began training policemen with contractor support. In 2005, the Administration improved the training effort based on input from relevant agencies. In 2005, the U.S. shifted responsibility for police training in Afghanistan to the Department of Defense. The Office of Military Cooperation-Afghanistan became the Office of Security Cooperation-Afghanistan, taking charge of training the entire Afghan security sector, including the Afghan National Police. The Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan was then assigned directly to U.S. Central Command for coordination. The U.S. embassy in Kabul provided policy guidance to CSTC-A for coalition partner assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress has provided funding and authorities to enable international partners to contribute to coalition efforts, driven by military exigency for unique access, additional troop strength, and niche capabilities like language skills and explosive ordnance disposal. Since late 2003, coalition support legislation has required the \"concurrence of the Secretary of State,\" while \"lift and sustain\" legislation does not have this requirement. Initially, coalition support legislation only designated Pakistan and Jordan as recipients, but more recent legislation aims to involve as many international partners as possible to support coalition efforts. The coalition support legislation initially designated Pakistan and Jordan as recipients, but recent legislation includes \"other key cooperating nations.\" This legislation provides reimbursement for logistical and military support to U.S. military operations, with Congress appropriating over $1 billion annually. The \"lift and sustain\" legislation allows DOD to provide supplies, services, transportation, and logistical support to coalition forces in Iraq. This support has been crucial for major border operations in Pakistan and Jordan. The \"lift and sustain\" legislation has supported Poland and Georgia in deploying forces to Iraq, with Poland leading the Multi-National Division Center South and Georgia manning checkpoints between al Kut and the Iraq-Iran border. DOD's role in coalition partner assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan has been relatively uncontroversial and could set precedents for future security partnerships. The DOD's role in train and equip assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan has sparked debate within government agencies and the policy community. Future U.S. efforts to enhance partner states' security forces are expected to increase, but there is disagreement on resource allocation. Some argue that the Department of State, particularly INL, needs more personnel and funding to handle potential training missions. Increasing training capacity at the Department of State and DOD is crucial for future missions, with some advocating for dedicated training units within DOD. Secretary of Defense Gates emphasized the importance of mentoring indigenous forces, highlighting the need for a larger overall requirement in the future. Analysts believe both options are suitable for future U.S. train and equip assistance needs."
