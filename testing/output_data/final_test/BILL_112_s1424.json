    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Off-Reservation Land Acquisition Guidance Act\" and provides guidance on off-reservation land acquisition. The Off-Reservation Land Acquisition Guidance Act defines off-reservation land as noncontiguous to an Indian tribe's reservation, likely for Indian gaming, and beyond a reasonable commuting distance. Before taking such land into trust, the Secretary must evaluate benefits to the tribe and address concerns from State and local entities. The Secretary must evaluate the benefits to the Indian tribe of acquiring off-reservation land into trust, including impacts on unemployment rate, reservation life, and tribal membership. The Secretary evaluates on-reservation benefits of acquiring off-reservation land into trust, including job creation and tribal government's ability to regulate gaming facilities. State and local concerns are also assessed. The Secretary evaluates the transfer of jurisdiction to an Indian tribe over a parcel, considering impacts on local government operations, property taxes, intergovernmental agreements, land use requirements, and law enforcement jurisdiction. The Secretary evaluates the transfer of jurisdiction to an Indian tribe over a parcel, considering impacts on local government operations, property taxes, intergovernmental agreements, land use requirements, and law enforcement jurisdiction. The evaluation also includes assessing potential negative effects on development, local water resources, and incompatible land use with national parks, monuments, conservation areas, wildlife refuges, daycare centers, schools, churches, or residential developments. The Indian tribe requesting off-reservation land to be taken into trust must disclose plans, contracts, and agreements for land use, request a gaming eligibility opinion, and provide any other information required by the Secretary. The Secretary can only take off-reservation land into trust for an Indian tribe under certain conditions: the tribe must address concerns from assessments, provide required information, and ensure the land use is compatible with state and local regulations for planning, zoning, and public health and safety. The Secretary is prohibited from approving any pending applications for taking off-reservation land into trust until regulations are in place. All current applications will be subject to these regulations."
