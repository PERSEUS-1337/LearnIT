    "content": "The USTR often requests a \"probable economic effects\" study of a trade agreement, usually conducted by the USITC. An investigation into the economic impact of eliminating tariffs on certain NAFTA imports is ongoing. However, a comprehensive review of a possible U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA, specifically focused on agricultural markets, has not been conducted yet by the USDA or university researchers. The USDA and university researchers have not yet analyzed the potential effects of a U.S. NAFTA withdrawal on agricultural markets. Extensive data would be required for such an analysis, including production quantities, prices, costs, and modeling data. A recent study by ImpactECON suggested that a \"NAFTA reversal\" could lead to higher U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. A study by ImpactECON warned that a \"NAFTA reversal\" could result in higher U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, leading to declines in GDP, trade, investment, and employment for all NAFTA parties. The study also found that if Canada and Mexico reciprocated with higher tariffs, it could lead to further trade declines and the loss of 256,000 low-wage workers in the short term. Industries like meat, food, textiles, auto, and services would be most affected by a NAFTA reversal. The ImpactECON study warns of potential impacts on the food and agricultural sectors due to higher tariffs. Imposing MFN duties could lead to market adjustments, causing the U.S. pork sector to contract by 5% and stimulate production in Mexico. This contraction would result in job losses and affect specific counties dependent on farming and value-added production. Trade under NAFTA is crucial for U.S. food and agricultural producers, with Canada and Mexico being the largest trading partners. The value of agricultural trade has significantly increased over the past 25 years, resulting in a trade deficit of $6.4 billion for U.S. agricultural products in 2016. In 2016, the U.S. had a trade deficit for agricultural products, with exports to Canada valued at $20.2 billion and to Mexico at $17.8 billion. Leading exports included grains, animal products, fruits, vegetables, nuts, sweeteners, oilseeds, and beverages. Mexico is a significant market for U.S. beef, pork, poultry, dairy, wheat, and corn exports. For more information on U.S. agricultural trade under NAFTA, refer to CRS Report R44875 and CRS In Focus IF10682. Under NAFTA, tariffs and restrictions were eliminated on most agricultural products, except for some subject to TRQs and high out-of-quota tariff rates. Canada excludes dairy, poultry, and eggs, while the U.S. excludes dairy, sugar, cotton, tobacco, peanuts, and peanut butter. Canada can limit imports through TRQs, with out-of-quota tariffs as high as 245% for cheese and 298% for butter. Most agricultural products are traded duty-free under NAFTA. Under an FTA, preferential tariffs are charged to member countries and are lower than a country's MFN tariff rates. Trade data is presented by selected agricultural commodity groupings, grouped according to tariff chapters under the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS). The first 24 chapters of most tariff schedules worldwide cover agricultural and fisheries products. The first 24 chapters of most tariff schedules worldwide cover agricultural and fisheries products, excluding some commodities like cotton, essential oils, starches, hides, and skins. MFN tariffs for NAFTA countries are compiled by CRS from WTO's database, summarizing available country tariff information at the HS-2 and HS-4 levels. WTO's database includes MFN tariffs for products at the HS-2, HS-4, and HS-6 levels for most countries, documenting both ad valorem (AV) and non-AV tariffs. Tariffs expressed in terms of AV allow for comparison across countries and interpretation of potential economic effects. The WTO tariff database includes MFN tariffs for products at different levels, but it does not convert non-AV tariffs to an ad valorem equivalent. This exclusion may impact certain agricultural products under TRQ or seasonal tariffs. The WTO-reported average ad valorem (AV) tariffs for agricultural products may not fully represent MFN duties for products under TRQ or seasonal tariffs. The tariff data in this report cover only the WTO-reported average AV duties at the HS-4 level, excluding non-AV rates for some products. This incomplete picture may result in understating actual applied rates for certain agricultural imports. The report provides an initial glimpse of potential impacts in case of a U.S. NAFTA withdrawal by summarizing agricultural and fisheries tariffs for the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Additional analysis is needed to fully understand the market impacts of possibly higher MFN tariff rates, especially for products under TRQ or seasonal tariffs. Appendices provide detailed tariff information at the HS-2 and HS 4-level for each NAFTA country. Higher MFN tariff rates, particularly for products under TRQ or seasonal tariffs, may have significant impacts on the quantity of products traded among NAFTA countries. Conducting economic modeling to simulate these potential changes is essential. However, calculating AVE rates for each individual tariff line at the HS-6 level for all NAFTA partner countries is not feasible due to time and resource constraints. Additionally, complete tariff information is not readily available to calculate AVE tariffs for individual tariff lines at the HS-8 and HS-10 levels for each country. This analysis discusses possible tariff changes for U.S. agricultural imports and exports in the event of a U.S. NAFTA withdrawal. In the event of a possible U.S. NAFTA withdrawal, agricultural products could face higher MFN tariffs on imports and exports. Tariffs charged on U.S. imports and exports may revert to generally higher MFN tariffs, impacting trade with Canada and Mexico. Other trade effects like SPS measures, customs charges, permits, quotas, and import licenses are not examined. MFN tariffs on U.S. agricultural imports vary widely, with some products facing prohibitively high tariffs. Higher MFN tariffs on U.S. agricultural imports could raise prices for consumers and end users, impacting products like tobacco, oilseeds, and processed fruit. For example, tropical fruit imports could see a maximum tariff of 29.8%, while cereal flour imports could face a 12.8% tariff. This could result in increased costs for U.S. end users and food processors importing these products. Higher U.S. tariffs may lead to a reduction in trade for imported products, giving U.S. producers a competitive advantage. Some imported products, like melons and watermelons, face high tariffs, while others, like tomatoes and berries from Mexico, have low tariffs. A possible NAFTA withdrawal may not significantly impact imports from Canada and Mexico based on changes in tariff rates. If NAFTA is withdrawn, Canadian and Mexican agricultural imports could face high MFN tariffs on U.S. products, making them less price-competitive and reducing quantities sold. Maximum AV tariffs in Canada reach 27% for meat products and 95% for grains, while in Mexico they reach 75% for meat and 20% for grains. If NAFTA is withdrawn, Canadian and Mexican agricultural imports could face high MFN tariffs on U.S. products, making them less price-competitive. For example, Mexico's maximum MFN tariffs on corn imports can be as high as 20%, potentially increasing costs for buyers. This could give other global suppliers an opportunity to gain market share. Similarly, the maximum MFN tariff for pork meat imports to Mexico could raise tariffs to 20%, providing an advantage to other global suppliers. MFN tariffs on U.S. corn and pork meat imports would remain duty-free. If NAFTA is withdrawn, Canadian and Mexican agricultural imports could face high MFN tariffs on U.S. products, impacting U.S. market share. Figures illustrate the importance of Canada and Mexico to U.S. agricultural trade, with NAFTA countries accounting for a significant share of some U.S. exports. In 2016, Canada and Mexico accounted for 39% of total U.S. agricultural imports, with NAFTA countries supplying a larger share for some commodities like grains and vegetables. U.S. agricultural products made up 59% of Canadian imports and 72% of Mexican imports in the same year. In 2016, U.S. agricultural products accounted for 72% of Mexico's agricultural imports, with certain categories like grains, meat, sugar, and processed foods making up over 80% of the total value. This data highlights the reliance of these products on NAFTA trade, indicating potential cost increases and decreased competitiveness if trade preferences are removed. If the U.S. withdraws from NAFTA, higher tariffs and trade preferences could be removed, causing significant opposition from agricultural groups and Congress. The National Pork Producers Council and other associations warn of catastrophic financial consequences for American agriculture, disrupting trade with top partners like Mexico. The U.S. Grains Council emphasizes immediate sales impact, while the National Association of Wheat Growers also expresses concerns. The National Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG) and Cargill, Inc. express concerns about the potential impact of NAFTA withdrawal on sales to Mexico. Most fruit and vegetable growers oppose NAFTA withdrawal due to the benefits of exports to Mexico. The Administration decides to renegotiate and \"modernize\" NAFTA instead of withdrawing. U.S. agricultural groups oppose NAFTA withdrawal, citing harm to food and agriculture industries and the economy. Concerns include uncertainty in trade policy, potential disruption of export markets, and fear of NAFTA partners seeking alternative suppliers for products like corn, soybeans, dairy, pork, beef, and rice. Mexico is exploring alternative suppliers for rice, corn, and soybeans from countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Argentina, and Brazil. The U.S. pork industry fears catastrophic consequences of a NAFTA withdrawal. Mexico is considering alternative markets for products like avocados, amid efforts to diversify agricultural suppliers in response to the ongoing NAFTA renegotiation. Relations among NAFTA partners are strained, with investors expressing concerns about the near-term business impacts. Agricultural investors fear negative impacts of ending NAFTA, with 72% believing it would harm business. Concerns include risks not reflected in stock valuations and potential restrictions on cross-border commerce. The Trump Administration downplays these worries, but USDA is preparing a contingency plan for agricultural losses. Despite some officials hinting at withdrawal, most states still support NAFTA. Most states, industry groups, and Congress members with agricultural interests continue to support NAFTA. Key leaders in the House and Senate Agriculture Committees have opposed withdrawal and emphasized the importance of maintaining a preferential trade relationship with Canada and Mexico. Senator Debbie Stabenow also expressed support for NAFTA and urged industry leaders to convey their support to the Administration. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Ranking Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, supports NAFTA and urges industry leaders to convey their support to the Administration. Some agricultural groups believe Congress can intervene if President Trump withdraws the United States from NAFTA. Congress maintains oversight authority on industry and trade activities, monitoring ongoing NAFTA renegotiations.
