President Fernando de la Rua resigned amidst violent demonstrations, leading to a default on $132 billion in public debt. President Eduardo Duhalde stabilized the economy, followed by President N\u00e9stor Kirchner who further improved internal politics. N\u00e9stor Kirchner, as a provincial governor of Santa Cruz in Patagonia, enhanced political and economic stability. He implemented popular policy moves in human rights, institutional reform, and economic policy, restoring faith in democracy. In 2005, the government restructured over $100 billion in defaulted bond debt, offering a low recovery rate of 30% to bondholders. However, failure to repay arrears to creditors and maintain price caps on electricity and natural gas hindered Argentina's access to international capital markets. In 2005, legislative elections showed strong support for Kirchner's leftist wing of the Peronist Party. His wife, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, won the 2007 presidential elections with 45% of the vote, becoming the first female President of Argentina. The President's leftist faction gained more seats in Congress, securing a majority in both houses. In April 2008, former President Kirchner became head of the PJ, helping shore up support for his wife's presidency. President Fern\u00e1ndez faced challenges including an energy crisis and farmers strikes, leading to a decline in popularity to 20% in June 2008. Despite this, her popularity rose to 30% in October 2008. President Fern\u00e1ndez must now address the effects of the global financial crisis on Argentina's economy. Argentina's economy is facing challenges due to the global financial crisis, including $6.7 billion in defaulted debt to foreign governments and over $20 billion in defaulted bond debt to private creditors. The government's response to these economic issues will impact its popularity and the upcoming mid-term congressional elections in October 2009. Despite recent economic growth, the forecast for 2009 is a slowed growth rate of 2.2% due to weaker demand for exports. Argentina's poverty rates have decreased significantly since the global financial crisis, dropping from 45% in 2002 to 21% in 2006. However, income inequality remains a major issue, with many still struggling. The country's per capita income is $5,150, classified as an upper middle income developing country by the World Bank. There are concerns about government manipulation of inflation data, with official figures showing 8.5% inflation in 2007, while economists estimate it to be around 20%. In September 2008, Argentine government estimated inflation at 8.7%, while private economists forecasted around 20% for the year. President Fern\u00e1ndez defended the National Statistics Institute (INDEC) despite criticism for under-reporting inflation. Previous Kirchner government had contentious relations with the IMF, reaching a $12.5 billion credit line agreement in 2003. In 2003, Argentina reached a $12.5 billion credit line agreement with the IMF. In 2006, Argentina chose to repay its $9.5 billion debt to the IMF instead of following IMF policy directives. Critics argue it may have been fiscally imprudent. In 2008, Argentina announced it would repay its defaulted $6.7 billion debt to Paris Club countries in one lump sum. Argentina initially planned to repay its defaulted $6.7 billion debt to Paris Club countries in one lump sum using its foreign reserves, but the global financial crisis disrupted these plans. Instead of depleting its $47 billion in foreign reserves, the government considered paying the debt in installments until 2025. The creditor nations for the defaulted debt include the U.S., Germany, Japan, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Italy, and Switzerland. Argentina's arrears to the U.S. government were around $300 million in 2006. Repaying the debt would improve Argentina's access to international credit, but the country also faces over $20 billion in defaulted bond debt from investors. Argentina is dealing with over $20 billion in defaulted bond debt from investors, including those from Europe, the United States, and Japan. The government is exploring deals with major banks to pay off holders of the 2005 defaulted debt, but the status of these deals is unclear. President Fern\u00e1ndez initially believed the U.S. financial crisis would not affect the region. In September 2008, President Fern\u00e1ndez criticized the U.S. \"casino economy\" but later warned of the global financial crisis impacting Argentina's economy. The decline in export commodity prices like soybean products and corn will affect economic growth and government revenue. The manufacturing sector, particularly textiles and cars, will also face downturns due to decreased global demand. The Fern\u00e1ndez government proposed nationalizing 10 private pension funds worth $30 billion to protect savings during the global financial crisis. Critics suggest it's for short-term financing and to prevent a future default. The Argentine stock market dropped by almost 30% in response. The proposal needs approval from Congress by the end of November. President Fern\u00e1ndez's administration in Argentina faced power outages due to previous government policies. The government took measures to improve electricity capacity, including raising tariffs on residential areas. Congress would support nationalizing private pension funds if assets were guaranteed for retirees only. Argentina announced a tariff increase for electricity and natural gas distribution, exempting poorer households. Low rates had hindered investment in energy production. The country shifted from being a net exporter of natural gas to importing due to increased domestic demand. Tensions with Chile rose as gas exports decreased. Argentina also imported gas from Bolivia, but faced challenges in fulfilling contracts, leading to LNG imports in 2008. Argentina resorted to importing liquified natural gas to meet its gas needs after announcing a 30% cut in energy subsidies in 2008. Gas exploration companies planned to invest $1.5 billion in natural gas exploration to boost domestic production. Plans for a 1,500 kilometer gas pipeline from Bolivia to Argentina were discussed in 2008, but no work has begun yet. In early 2008, Argentina faced a crisis with a farmers' strike in response to a tax increase on soybean and sunflower seed exports. President Fern\u00e1ndez criticized the farmers for protesting while making profits, leading to food shortages and social tensions. The government offered concessions, but they were rejected, and a 30-day truce was declared. In late April 2008, Argentina's Economy Minister Martin Lousteau resigned due to the prolonged conflict with farmers and frustration with the government's handling of inflation. Farmers continued strikes in May and June against export tax increases until President Fern\u00e1ndez agreed to send the measure to Congress. The lower House approved the tax increase, but the Senate rejected it on July 17, 2008, causing a political defeat for President Fern\u00e1ndez and former President Kirchner. President Kirchner faced a political defeat when Vice President Julio Cobos broke a tie vote in Congress, rejecting a measure supported by the government. This demonstrated the strength of Argentina's farming sector and the independence of the Congress. The vote was seen as a rejection of the Kirchners' confrontational governing style. Argentina has made progress in human rights, with efforts to bring justice to past abuses during the Dirty War in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the 1970s and early 1980s, President Kirchner took action against human rights abuses during the Dirty War, purging military officials and supporting the overturning of amnesty laws. Several officials were sentenced to prison for their involvement in murders and human rights violations. President Fern\u00e1ndez's government continues to pursue human rights cases from the past, aiming to punish those responsible for the genocide. In August 2008, two former military generals were sentenced to life in prison for the disappearance of Senator Guillermo Vargas Aignasse in 1976. Concerns were raised about the deaths of former military officers linked to the abduction of babies during the Dirty War. In December 2007, an ex-naval officer died in prison from cyanide poisoning, and in February 2008, a retired army officer was found dead from a gunshot wound. In February 2008, a retired army officer was found dead from a gunshot wound, with concerns that the death may be linked to impeding human rights prosecutions. Human rights activists are also worried about a missing person case from 2006 involving a former political prisoner. In July 2008, the House approved a report requirement on human rights violations during Argentina's military dictatorship. The House approved H.R. 5959 in July 2008, but the Senate has not taken action on it. U.S.-Argentine relations have been strong since 1983, with Argentina designated as a major non-NATO ally in 1997. Argentina has not received much U.S. foreign assistance due to its well-developed economy. In 2005, Buenos Aires became the first port in South America to participate in the Container Security Initiative (CSI) operated by the Department of Homeland Security. Argentina also joined the Trade Transparency Unit Program in 2006 to combat money laundering. Despite close relations, there have been occasional tensions in the U.S.-Argentine relationship. Tensions in the U.S.-Argentina relationship arose during Argentina's crisis in 2001-2002. However, relations improved in 2003 when the U.S. supported Argentina in negotiations with the IMF. President Kirchner's alignment with Venezuelan President Ch\u00e1vez caused concern for U.S. policymakers, leading to friction during events like the 2005 Summit of the Americas. Some view Kirchner's relationship with Ch\u00e1vez as pragmatic rather than ideological. Observers note that Kirchner's alliance with President Ch\u00e1vez was seen as pragmatic, benefiting Argentina economically. Despite this, Argentina's cooperation with the United States on various issues remained intact. After Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez's election, there was hope for improved relations with the U.S. However, just days after her inauguration in 2007, tensions arose when U.S. prosecutors charged foreign nationals in a scandal involving funds for Fern\u00e1ndez's campaign, leading to her swift condemnation of the U.S. President Fern\u00e1ndez's strong response to the United States' smear campaign hindered any quick improvement in bilateral relations. Relations began to thaw in late January 2008 when U.S. Ambassador Earl Wayne met with Fern\u00e1ndez to address the violation of U.S. laws by suspected agents of the Venezuelan government. Despite initial tensions, visits by U.S. officials in April, July, and August 2008 aimed to repair relations. In July and August 2008, the United States visited Argentina to improve relations with President Fern\u00e1ndez. The image of the United States in Latin America has declined, with Argentina having the lowest favorable view in 2007. In December 2007, four foreign nationals were arrested in Florida in the suitcase scandal. Relations between the two countries began to thaw in late January 2008 after initial tensions. Five individuals were charged by U.S. federal prosecutors in Miami for acting as agents of the Venezuelan government without notification and attempting to conceal $800,000 seized in Argentina from a U.S.-Venezuelan businessman. Three defendants pled guilty, leaving Franklin Duran to face trial in September 2008. The businessman, Antonini, cooperated with the FBI as an informant, leading to taped conversations with the defendants. The defendants offered substantial inducements to Antonini, including money and false documents, to conceal the $800,000. High-level Venezuelan officials were allegedly involved, including from the Office of the Vice President and DISIP. Antonini was carrying the suitcase at the request of another passenger and was unaware of the money. The initial criminal complaint alleged the money was destined for a candidate in Argentina's presidential election. In the October 28, 2007 presidential election, money was intended for Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner's campaign. The case caught the Argentine government by surprise, leading President Fern\u00e1ndez to accuse the United States of manufacturing the scandal. State Department officials clarified that the case was handled by the Department of Justice and the FBI, not a foreign policy matter. Argentine officials stopped commenting on the case in late January 2008 to avoid further straining relations with the United States. Argentina requested the extradition of Antonini in August 2007 on fraud charges. In August 2007, Argentina requested the extradition of Antonini on fraud charges, later adding money laundering. Anibal Fern\u00e1ndez demanded extradition in January 2008, and the request was reiterated in September 2008. Franklin Duran was convicted in November 2008 for acting as an unregistered agent and conspiring to cover up money origins. Antonini and Carlos Kauffmann testified, with prosecutors alleging they tried to silence Antonini for the Venezuelan government. In his testimony, Kauffmann revealed paying millions to Venezuelan officials to secure contracts. Antonini mentioned $4.2 million intended for the Fern\u00e1ndez campaign on board the plane. The case raised concerns about bilateral relations, with Argentina criticizing FBI accusations and the U.S. emphasizing judicial independence. Argentina's Minister of Justice affirmed Duran's conviction in early November. The tri-border area (TBA) of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay has been a concern for the U.S. due to activities of Hezbollah and Hamas among the Muslim communities in the region. The area is known for arms and drug trafficking, contraband smuggling, money laundering, and pirated goods movement. The tri-border area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay has been a concern for the U.S. due to activities of Islamic extremist groups like Hezbollah. Allegations link Hezbollah to bombings in Argentina in 1992 and 1994. The United States has cooperated with the region through the \"3+1 regional cooperation mechanism\" to counter terrorism. Argentina hosted a session in 2006 focusing on early warning, information exchange, and denying refuge to terrorists. Argentina is reported to cooperate well with the United States on counterterrorism efforts. Argentina has improved its counterterrorism efforts by passing anti-terrorism legislation and cooperating with the United States. The country is urged to use its legal tools more aggressively to combat financial crimes. The U.S. Congress remains concerned about terrorist threats from the tri-border area. The resolution supported counterterrorism efforts in the tri-border area of South America, emphasized eliminating Hezbollah's financial network, and expressed concern over Iran's influence in Latin America. It recommended creating more mechanisms for joint operations and information sharing among Western Hemisphere countries. The investigation into the 1994 AMIA bombing in Argentina faced delays due to mishandling by the government, but a new investigation was initiated in 2005. In 2005, a new investigation was launched into the 1994 AMIA bombing in Argentina. In November 2006, arrest warrants were issued for nine individuals, including a Hezbollah militant and eight Iranian government officials. Interpol approved Red Notices for some of the suspects, but the process was delayed due to Iran's appeal. In February 2008, the Hezbollah militant was killed in a car bomb attack. The U.S. Congress has expressed ongoing concerns about the progress of the investigation. In July 2007, the House approved resolutions applauding Argentina for the AMIA investigation and calling for Interpol to issue red notices for Iranians involved in the bombing. In July 2008, another resolution condemned the bombing and urged action against activities supporting Hezbollah. Trade between the US and Argentina included machinery, electrical machinery, and organic chemical exports in 2007. Argentina was placed on the Special 301 Priority Watch list for intellectual property rights protection in 2004. Argentina remains on the 301 Priority Watch list for intellectual property rights protection due to concerns over copyright and patent protection. The United States urges Argentina to strengthen enforcement actions against counterfeit products, particularly in Buenos Aires. There are ongoing concerns about potential rule changes allowing imports of fresh bovine and sheep products from the Patagonia region. The United States restricts fresh meat imports from Argentina due to foot and mouth disease concerns. Bills introduced in Congress aimed to ban ruminant and swine products until Argentina was disease-free. The provision in Section 736 of a committee aimed to prohibit funds from being used for activities allowing imports from Argentina. U.S. foreign investment in Argentina was around $14.9 billion in 2007, mainly in financial services, agribusiness, energy, and petrochemicals. Legal uncertainties and regulatory changes have affected the attractiveness of investing in Argentina, with over 30 pending investment dispute cases totaling $13 billion filed against the country. Argentina is facing disputes with claims totaling $13 billion, including a $133 million compensation order to CMS Energy Corporation. American Task Force Argentina is urging the U.S. government to negotiate a settlement for bondholders affected by Argentina's 2001 debt default. Argentina's economic growth relies on entering international capital markets. Argentina is facing disputes with claims totaling $13 billion, including a $133 million compensation order to CMS Energy Corporation. American Task Force Argentina is urging the U.S. government to negotiate a settlement for bondholders affected by Argentina's 2001 debt default. The Argentine government needs to offer a new proposal to bondholders who did not participate in the 2005 debt restructuring to enter international capital markets. Two vulture companies were seeking a judgment in U.S. court to seize Argentine assets, but a Supreme Court ruling prevented this. H.R. 7205 (Jackson-Lee) introduced in Congress would take measures against foreign countries failing to satisfy U.S. court judgments over $1 million for more than six months, including barring access to U.S. capital markets. The bill H.Res. 435 aims to restrict access to U.S. capital markets for foreign states in default for more than two years, with Argentina being highlighted as a case study. It also supports counterterrorism efforts, emphasizes targeting Hezbollah's financial network in South America, expresses concerns about Iran's influence in Latin America, and recommends creating more joint counterterrorism mechanisms. The resolution H.Con.Res. 188 calls for increased joint counterterrorism operations and information sharing in Latin America, especially in response to Iran's growing involvement in the region. It also praises Argentina's efforts in the AMIA investigation. H.Con.Res. 385 condemns the AMIA bombing and urges action against activities supporting Hezbollah. H.R. 5959 is the FY2009 Intelligence Authorization Act. H.R. 5959 (Reyes) is the FY2009 Intelligence Authorization Act that was introduced on May 21, 2008, and passed by the House on July 16, 2008. The bill includes a provision for a report by the CIA Director within 270 days on the Argentine military's accession to power in 1976, human rights violations, Operation Condor, and the fate of Argentine people targeted. The report is to include declassified information. The Director of the CIA is required to submit an update of declassified information annually. H.R. 7205 aims to hold foreign states accountable for failing to satisfy U.S. court judgments over $1 million for more than six months by restricting access to U.S. capital markets. S. 3289 focuses on FY2009 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food, and Drug. S. 3289 (Kohl) FY2009 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act introduced and reported on July 21, 2008. Section 736 of the bill would prohibit funds for importing ruminant or swine products from Argentina until foot and mouth disease is eradicated. S. 3238 (Johnson) / H.R. 6522 (Herseth Sandlin) focus on Foot and Mouth Disease Prevention Act of 2008. The Foot and Mouth Disease Prevention Act of 2008, S. 3238 and H.R. 6522, aim to prohibit the importation of ruminant or swine products from Argentina until the country is free of foot and mouth disease without vaccination."
