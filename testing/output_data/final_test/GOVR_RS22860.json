    "content": "There are different types of exchange rate policies that a nation may adopt, such as a \"free float\" policy where the currency value fluctuates, allowing more autonomy in domestic monetary policy. On the other hand, a \"pegged\" exchange rate policy fixes the currency value relative to another currency or a bundle of currencies. A pegged exchange rate policy can be implemented through a currency board, where a monetary authority holds reserves to maintain a fixed exchange rate. Countries like Hong Kong and Singapore use this system to manage currency volatility in trade. Countries like Hong Kong and Singapore manage currency volatility by pegging their exchange rates, which eliminates exchange-rate risk but may lead to loss of autonomy in monetary policy and exposure to speculative attacks. Another common policy is a \"managed float,\" where a nation allows its currency to fluctuate until certain economic indicators reach critical levels, intervening if necessary. A \"crawling peg\" is a form of managed float where the currency gradually adjusts. China implemented a \"crawling peg\" policy in 2005, allowing its currency to gradually appreciate or depreciate against other currencies. This policy was maintained until 2008, resulting in a 21% appreciation of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar. Managed float policies can be based on factors like trade balance, inflation, and economic growth. Maintaining a fixed exchange rate, free capital movement, and independent monetary policy simultaneously is considered challenging in contemporary economic theory. According to the IMF, East Asian countries have various exchange rate policies. Japan allows its currency to float freely, while five nations float their currencies but intervene to maintain stability. Seven countries manage their exchange rates based on economic objectives. Brunei and Hong Kong operate a currency board system pegging their exchange rates. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, while the Brunei dollar is pegged to the Singaporean dollar. South Korea's exchange rate policy shifted during the 2008 financial crisis, with reports of interventions to stabilize the won. Some analysts believed that South Korea adopted a de facto pegged exchange rate policy during this time. The value of the won declined to nearly 1,500 won to the U.S. dollar in 2009, before gradually recovering to about 1,100 won to the U.S dollar over the next four years. Allegations of South Korea's intervention in forex markets reappeared in 2015 and 2016, with efforts to resist won appreciation in early 2015 and prevent depreciation in July and August. The Bank of Korea expressed concerns about excessive declines in the won's value and possible herd behavior in forex markets in February 2016. The Bank of Korea expressed concerns about possible \"herd behavior\" in forex markets, leading to speculation of intervention to support the won. Claims of South Korea managing exchange rates to prevent won appreciation were denied in early 2017. There were worries that South Korea might be labeled a currency manipulator by the Department of the Treasury in April 2017. China maintained a \"crawling peg\" policy for the renminbi before the global financial crisis. After the global financial crisis, China's renminbi was stable relative to the U.S. dollar, leading to debates on whether China had switched to a pegged exchange rate or if the stability was due to the currency basket used for the crawling peg. China's central bank announced reforms to enhance the RMB exchange rate flexibility, leading to a gradual strengthening of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. However, the renminbi has since weakened, with the exchange rate at 6.89 yuan to 1 U.S. dollar as of March 31, 2017. In contrast, Japan's yen has experienced significant fluctuations against the U.S. dollar over the past decade, ranging from 125.35 yen to 76.14 yen to the U.S. dollar. The Japanese yen has shown major fluctuations against the U.S. dollar over the past decade, with strong appreciations in late 2008 and early 2016, and major depreciations in the winter of 2012-2013, the autumn of 2014, and the end of 2016. Analysts attribute these shifts to market confidence in Japan's economy and the Bank of Japan's monetary policy. Some U.S. business leaders believe the decline in the yen's value in 2015 was due to Japanese government intervention in foreign exchange markets. The Abe government and the Bank of Japan deny actively lowering the yen's value against the U.S. dollar, stating their policies aim to stimulate growth. Japan last intervened in foreign exchange markets in 2011. Some East Asian monetary authorities monitor exchange rates to align with selected currencies in the region for export competitiveness. Competitive adjustments are speculated to be an issue in Southeast Asia, especially for countries with close economic ties to China. In 2007, scholar Taketoshi Ito noted that countries trading with China and competing in exports are cautious about their currencies appreciating against the Chinese RMB. Southeast Asian exchange rates showed a \"renminbi bloc\" emerging in 2007 and reemerging in 2011-2013. Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand's currencies followed China's RMB appreciation until the 2008 financial crisis, causing their currencies to weaken against the U.S. dollar. Since late 2010, Southeast Asian currencies have followed China's RMB movements against the U.S. dollar. However, recent trends show a divergence as the Southeast Asian currencies have weakened while the RMB continued to strengthen until August 2015. This shift suggests a potential weakening of the previously observed \"renminbi bloc\" in the region. China has emerged as the largest trading partner for many Southeast Asian nations, promoting the use of the renminbi for trade payments. The weakening of the \"renminbi bloc\" in 2008 may have been due to the global financial crisis, but the divergence of exchange rates in 2013 onwards is less clear. Some attribute this to slower economic growth in China and tightening US monetary policy, impacting Southeast Asian economies and their currencies. China's RMB continued to appreciate against the US dollar until August 2015. China's RMB appreciated against the US dollar until August 2015. The Department of the Treasury has been required to provide biannual reports to Congress on exchange rate policies of foreign countries since 1988. The reports analyze exchange rate policies and consider currency manipulation for unfair trade advantages. The Secretary of the Treasury must report annually to Congress on international economic policy, including exchange rate policy, with updates every six months. Reports have identified currency manipulation by South Korea, Taiwan, and China. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 requires reports on major trading partners every 180 days. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 mandates reports on major trading partners every 180 days to the appropriate committees. The latest report, released on April 14, 2017, found that no major trading partner met all three criteria for the reporting period. Six major trading partners were highlighted, including China, Germany, Japan, and South Korea. The report placed six major trading partners\u2014China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, and Taiwan\u2014on a \"Monitoring List\" for their currency practices. China has a history of foreign exchange intervention but has allowed the renminbi to appreciate in recent years. Japan also has a significant trade surplus. Japan has a significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States, with a goods surplus of $69 billion in 2016. Japan has not intervened in the foreign exchange market in five years. South Korea has a track record of asymmetric foreign exchange interventions, urging authorities to limit interventions to disorderly market conditions. Taiwan also has a history of asymmetric interventions, with the Treasury urging a shift to limiting interventions to exceptional circumstances and increasing transparency. Many East Asian governments prefer a \"managed float\" exchange rate policy over a \"free float\" policy due to past economic crises. There may be skepticism towards U.S. recommendations for a \"free float\" policy. It is uncertain if adopting \"free float\" policies in East Asia would reduce U.S. trade deficits with the region significantly. The Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act (H.R. 2039) aims to reduce U.S. trade deficits with East Asian countries by permitting countervailing duties on imports from nations with \"fundamentally undervalued\" currencies. The impact of foreign exchange rate policies on the U.S. economy is a topic of debate in the 115th Congress. The Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act (H.R. 2039) targets countries with \"fundamentally undervalued\" currencies through specific criteria, including government intervention in foreign exchange markets, undervaluation of the real effective exchange rate by at least 5%, persistent global current account surpluses, and excessive foreign asset reserves."
