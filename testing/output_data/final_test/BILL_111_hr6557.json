The amended Section 19 of title 3, United States Code, addresses vacancies in the offices of President and Vice President. The highest individual on the succession list who can fulfill the duties of President serves as acting President when both the President and Vice President are absent. If the acting President is unable to serve and there is no Vice President, an individual will continue to serve until the current Presidential term expires. The designated House and Senate leaders, Secretaries of various departments, and Ambassadors are included in the succession list for the presidency. Taking the oath of office does not require resignation from their current position. The succession list for the presidency includes officers eligible under the Constitution, not under impeachment, and appointed with Senate consent. They do not receive compensation while serving as acting President or Vice President. The designated House leader, chosen by the President, remains in effect until a new notification is submitted. The Speaker of the House is the default leader until the President makes a selection. The designated House leader, chosen by the President, remains in effect until a new notification is submitted. The Speaker pro tempore shall not be treated as holding the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives. Each notification submitted by the President under this subsection shall be made publicly available. The designated Senate leader is chosen from the Majority Leader of the Senate, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, or the Minority Leader of the Senate. The notification by the President remains in effect until a new one is submitted and is not affected by the expiration of any Presidential term. During any acting President's term, their compensation will be at the rate provided by law for the President. The Majority Leader of the Senate is deemed the designated Senate leader until the President submits a notification. Each notification from the President under this subsection must be made publicly available. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING VOTES BY ELECTORS AFTER DEATH OR INCAPACITY OF NOMINEES. During a Presidential election year, nominees should designate individuals for whom electors should give their votes in the event of nominee's death or incapacity before the electors' meeting. During a Presidential election year, if a nominee for Vice President is deceased or incapacitated, electors should give their votes to the nominee's designated replacement. In the event of the death or permanent incapacitation of both the Presidential and Vice Presidential nominees of the same political party, electors should vote for the replacements designated by the nominees. Political parties must establish procedures for electors to pledge their votes accordingly. Sense of Congress on the continuity of government and smooth transition of executive power. Congress finds that members of the Senate agree that the American people deserve a Government that is failsafe and foolproof, and terrorists should never disrupt Government operations. Continuity of governmental operations after a terrorist attack is crucial, and terrorists should not be able to change the political party in control. Outgoing and incoming Presidents should collaborate during a transition of power. The incoming President should work with the Senate for a smooth transition of power. Cabinet members are in the line of succession to the presidency. Previous transitions have involved cabinet members from the prior administration. The Constitution gives the appointment power. The Constitution vests the appointment power of executive branch officials in the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. An incoming President cannot exercise constitutional powers until noon on January 20th. Cooperation between incoming and outgoing Presidents is crucial for a smooth transition of Government. Congress has historically acted consistently in this regard. Congress has historically acted in a bipartisan manner to ensure a smooth transition of executive power between Presidents, as seen in the Presidential Transition Act of 1963. This act emphasizes the importance of continuity in executing laws and conducting government affairs. Congress has emphasized the importance of a smooth transition of executive power to avoid disruptions that could harm the safety and well-being of the United States and its people. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 and the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks recognized the need to improve transitions between administrations to minimize disruptions in national security policymaking. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks recommended improving the transition process for national security appointments by having the president-elect submit lists of candidates for security positions immediately after the election and nominations for the entire national security team by January 20. The Senate should then adopt special rules for confirming these appointments promptly. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks recommended improving the transition process for national security appointments by having the president-elect submit lists of candidates for security positions immediately after the election and nominations for the entire national security team by January 20. Congress believes that it is crucial for any new administration to establish a clear and stable line of succession to the presidency as quickly as possible for national security reasons. The Senate should consider conducting confirmation proceedings and votes on nominations selected by the President-elect for offices in the line of succession between January 3 and January 20 before the Inauguration. The President should agree to sign and deliver commissions for approved nominations on January 20 to ensure continuity of Government."
