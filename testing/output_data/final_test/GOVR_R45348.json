    "content": "The federal government established the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) in 1990 to coordinate the collection and management of geospatial data. This was further strengthened by Executive Order 12906 in 1994, which mandated the development of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) to promote the sharing and dissemination of geospatial data nationwide. The federal government's role in providing geospatial information has shifted towards coordinating and managing data from various sources. Challenges include avoiding duplicative data sets and coordinating with the private sector. Past Congresses have recognized these challenges and explored issues such as cost and duplication of effort. Bills introduced in previous Congresses aimed to address these issues. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 was enacted to improve coordination and sharing of geospatial data within the federal government. Previous bills introduced in Congress, such as S. 740 and S. 1253, aimed to address similar issues but were not enacted. Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Bruce Westerman introduced legislation in previous Congresses, but Congress did not act on them. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018, included in H.R. 302, was signed into law as P.L. 115-254 on October 5, 2018. This report provides a summary and analysis of the GDA, which codifies aspects of Circular A-16 and continues the Federal Geographic Data Committee. It aims to improve coordination and sharing of geospatial data within the federal government. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018, signed into law as P.L. 115-254 on October 5, 2018, supports the creation of a National Spatial Data Infrastructure. It includes congressional oversight components such as annual performance reporting from covered agencies to the FGDC. The law requires summaries and evaluations to be provided to the NGAC, with responses to comments from the NGAC and covered agencies. Additionally, the FGDC must submit a report to Congress every two years summarizing and evaluating agency performance. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018, under Subtitle F-Geospatial Data, Title VII of P.L. 115-254, includes provisions in Sections 751-759. Section 751 outlines the importance of open data for the GeoPlatform, the role of the private sector in acquiring geospatial data, and Congress's history of promoting data access. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018, in Section 752, defines terms related to geospatial data and covered agencies. A covered agency, as per the Act, is an executive department that collects, maintains, and uses geospatial data to fulfill its mission. This includes various organizations like state, local governments, and business partners. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 defines covered agencies as executive departments that use geospatial data. It includes NASA and the EPA but excludes the Department of Defense and the intelligence community. The Act expands on the definition of geospatial data as information tied to a location on Earth. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 defines geospatial data as information tied to a location on Earth, represented in vector datasets. It excludes certain activities like those of an Indian tribe not using federal funds or classified national security-related activities. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 excludes certain geospatial data activities, as determined by the Director of National Intelligence, and activities under specific sections of the National Security Act of 1947. It also defines data themes as NGDA data themes and codifies the FGDC as the primary entity for geospatial data policies and standards. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 codifies the duties and responsibilities of the FGDC as the lead entity for the development and management of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). It mandates the Secretary of the Interior and the Director of OMB to serve as chairperson and vice chairperson of the committee. Covered agencies must designate a representative to serve on the FGDC, and the Director of OMB is required to update guidance on membership within a year of enactment. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 requires the FGDC to provide online updates on the status of National Geospatial Data Assets (NGDAs) annually. The FGDC must assess agency progress towards specific responsibilities for NGDA data themes and general agency responsibilities, categorizing performance as meeting, making progress, or failing to meet expectations. Annual summaries and evaluations are to be shared with the National Geospatial Advisory Committee (NGAC). The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 mandates the FGDC to provide annual updates on National Geospatial Data Assets (NGDAs) to the National Geospatial Advisory Committee (NGAC). The FGDC must assess agency performance, share summaries and evaluations with the NGAC, respond to comments, and submit reports to Congress every two years. Additionally, the FGDC is required to establish an Office of the Secretariat with the Department of the Interior (DOI) as per Section 753 of the GDA. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 mandates the FGDC to establish an Office of the Secretariat with the DOI to provide support and technical assistance. The act also codifies the National Geospatial Advisory Committee (NGAC) under the authority of the DOI, which will continue to advise on geospatial programs and policy issues. The NGAC, established under the Geospatial Data Act of 2018, ensures representation of nonfederal interested parties in national geospatial activities. Meetings are held openly, and members are appointed by the FGDC chairperson to provide balanced viewpoints on the development of the NSDI. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 establishes the NGAC to represent nonfederal parties in national geospatial activities. Members include various sectors like tribal governments, academia, and the private sector. The NGAC members have term limits, except for the NGA representative. The Office of the Secretariat provides administrative support to the NGAC and FGDC. The NSDI aims to improve geospatial data utilization, supported by the GDA. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 defines the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) to promote geospatial data sharing across different sectors. The NSDI's purpose is to integrate data sources for a better understanding of the physical and cultural world. The Act establishes goals for NSDI, including reviewing data for privacy and security before disclosure. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 aims to ensure privacy and security of personal data, enhance accuracy of statistical information with geospatial data, provide free access to geospatial data, protect proprietary interests, and ensure interoperability of federal information systems. It also supports the establishment of a global spatial data infrastructure and requires the FGDC to prepare a strategic plan for the NSDI. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 mandates the FGDC to designate NGDA data themes, representing key topics like elevation and federal land ownership. Covered agencies are assigned as lead for each theme to coordinate data management and ensure adherence to standards for interoperability. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 mandates lead covered agencies to coordinate data management for designated NGDA data themes, ensuring adherence to standards for interoperability. Each lead agency has specific responsibilities for their data theme, including developing standards, implementing nationwide plans, establishing goals, collecting user feedback, and designating a point of contact for data dissemination. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 requires lead covered agencies to submit annual performance reports to the FGDC, detailing progress on data theme responsibilities. The FGDC evaluates these reports and establishes standards for NGDA data themes and metadata content, aligning with international standards where possible. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 mandates the FGDC to develop and update data standards for declassified intelligence community data. It requires consultation with data users and providers, use of national and international standards, and exclusion of sensitive information. The FGDC must operate an electronic service for geospatial data access. The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 mandates the development of the GeoPlatform, an electronic service for providing access to geospatial data and metadata to the public. The GeoPlatform must be accessible through the internet, include metadata for all geospatial data collected by covered agencies, and follow programming instructions and standards for automated data access. The Act prohibits storing proprietary information or data acquired under a federal government license without authorization. Additionally, the FGDC chairperson must designate an agency to manage the GeoPlatform.
