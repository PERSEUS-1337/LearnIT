    "content": "Congress has regularly extended temporary tax provisions known as \"tax extenders.\" Three individual income tax provisions expired at the end of 2017 and have been included in recent tax extender packages. These provisions include deductions for higher education expenses and mortgage insurance premiums. The provision allowing qualified canceled mortgage debt income associated with a primary residence to be excluded from income was first enacted in 2007 and has been extended in recent years as part of tax extender legislation, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The estimated cost to make expired provisions permanent is reported by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The provision allowing exclusion of canceled mortgage debt income from gross income for primary residences has been extended through the 10-year budget window. Canceled mortgage debt is common in short sales, where a homeowner sells their house for less than the mortgage amount, and the lender forgives the remaining debt. Lenders report canceled debt to the IRS using Form 1099-C. Forgiven debt is considered income and must be reported using Form 1099-C. Borrowers must include the forgiven amount in their gross income for the year of discharge. This is because forgiven debt increases purchasing power by reducing debt obligations, resulting in higher disposable income. Whether debt is reduced through direct payments or lender forgiveness, it is still taxable. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 temporarily excluded qualified canceled mortgage debt income associated with a primary residence from taxation. This exclusion was extended multiple times through 2014. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 excluded canceled mortgage debt income from taxation, extended through 2017 by subsequent acts like the PATH Act and BBA18. Extensions aim to reduce hardship for distressed households and support the housing market and economy. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 excluded canceled mortgage debt income from taxation, extended through 2017 by subsequent acts like the PATH Act and BBA18. The one-year extension in BBA18 would result in a 10-year revenue loss of $2.4 billion. Homeowners traditionally deduct interest paid on their mortgage and property taxes if they itemize deductions. Starting in 2007, homeowners could also deduct qualifying mortgage insurance premiums. Homeowners could treat qualifying mortgage insurance premiums as deductible mortgage interest if they itemized and met income thresholds. The deduction was extended multiple times through 2014 by various acts, including the PATH Act in 2015. The deduction for mortgage insurance premiums was extended through 2017 by the BBA18 (P.L. 115-123) to promote homeownership and aid in the housing market recovery post-Great Recession. Homeownership is believed to bring societal benefits like higher property values, lower crime rates, and improved civic participation. It also helps in income and wealth distribution, individual financial security, and better living conditions for a healthier population. The deduction for mortgage insurance premiums may not significantly impact homeownership rates due to high transaction costs associated with home purchases. While the deduction may allow buyers to borrow more, it is unclear if it is still needed to assist in the housing market recovery. The Case-Shiller U.S. National Composite Index shows home prices have increased since the Great Recession. Housing inventory is slightly below historical levels, indicating a stronger market. Economists argue that owner-occupied housing is already heavily subsidized, and extending the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums could lead to misallocation of resources. The JCT estimated a $1.1 billion revenue loss from the one-year extension in BBA18. The provision allows taxpayers to deduct up to $4,000 of qualified tuition and related expenses for postsecondary education from their gross income. The deduction is not restricted to itemizers and is reduced by grants, scholarships, and other educational assistance. Taxpayers can deduct up to $4,000 for education expenses based on income level. Income limits apply, with higher earners ineligible for the deduction. Critics suggest consolidating education tax benefits into a single credit. The American Opportunity Tax Credit and Lifetime Learning Credit are permanent tax credits for undergraduate education. The credits have different coverage periods, with the Lifetime Learning Credit not limited in years. These credits are more advantageous than the deduction for most taxpayers, as they phase out at lower income levels. The tax deduction for education expenses may not benefit all students, especially those with lower incomes who could qualify for more advantageous tax credits like the American Opportunity Tax Credit and Lifetime Learning Credit. The deduction's impact is limited by income thresholds and maximum deductible expenses, and confusion about education benefits may lead taxpayers to not choose the optimal benefit. The one-year extension of the deduction included in the PATH Act is estimated to result in a 10-year revenue loss according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. The one-year extension in the PATH Act is estimated to result in a 10-year revenue loss of $0.4 billion.
