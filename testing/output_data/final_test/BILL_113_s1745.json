    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Somalia Stabilization Act of 2013\". It includes findings related to Somalia. Since the collapse of the Siad Barre regime in 1991, Somalia has struggled to rebuild a government and assert control over warlords, militias, and extremist groups. The lack of functioning state structures has led to chronic humanitarian needs and enabled terrorist groups and illicit activities to thrive. In 2007, the Ethiopian military ousted the Islamic Courts Union, leading to the deployment of the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) to support the Transitional Federal Government in establishing order. AMISOM consists of troops from various African countries. In 2008, al-Shabaab was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the US. In 2010, they took control of southern and central Somalia, imposing strict Sharia law. They retaliated in Uganda, killing 74 people. AMISOM expanded its mandate to counter al-Shabaab in response to their dominance and brutality. In 2011 and 2012, al-Shabaab denied humanitarian access during severe food insecurity and famine in Somalia. In 2011, the Kenyan Defense Force joined AMISOM to help control urban areas in Somalia. In 2012, improved security allowed the Transitional Federal Government to complete a draft constitution and elect a new Federal parliament and President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. The new Somali government was recognized by the United States, Arab and European countries, the United Nations, and the African Union. On March 6, 2013, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 2093, creating a new exemption to the arms embargo for Somalia to develop its National Security Forces. The resolution focused on training, equipping, and capacity-building of Somali Security Forces, including infrastructure development for safe storage and distribution of military equipment. Resolution 2102 established UNSOM in Somalia to support peace-building and governance. The Government of Somalia faces challenges in finalizing the constitution and providing services, but President Mohamud aims to hold a referendum and election by 2016. The international community and Somali delegation endorsed a compact for Somali development, with donors pledging $2.4 billion over three years. Al Shabaab used terrorist tactics, attacking the Westgate mall in Nairobi, killing 67 people.
