    "content": "The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security is responsible for preventing terrorists from entering, securing borders, and enforcing immigration laws. The Department of Defense provides support to DHS and other law enforcement agencies for counterdrug and counterterrorism missions. Military support has increased since 9/11, enhancing border security efforts. Some states along the southern border are welcoming increased military involvement to address crime and illegal immigration. Governor Janet Napolitano of Arizona requested federal funding to deploy National Guard troops after exhausting state resources. However, concerns exist about the diplomatic implications and strain on military resources. Calls for a larger military role in border security are growing. President Bush announced up to 6,000 troops for border support in 2006. President Bush announced in 2006 that up to 6,000 National Guard troops would support Border Patrol on the southern border. The Guard's role includes operating surveillance systems, analyzing intelligence, and building infrastructure. They will not engage in law enforcement activities and will be under Governors' control. Initial deployments began in June 2006 under \"Operation Jump Start,\" with approximately 5661 guardsmen participating by November 2006. In the 109th Congress, legislation was proposed to authorize the use of military forces or the National Guard along the border, but the military does not have a direct mandate for border protection or immigration enforcement. However, they can provide support to law enforcement agencies in counterdrug and counterterrorism efforts, indirectly assisting with border security and immigration control. Military personnel for these operations are drawn from active, reserve forces, and the National Guard. The Posse Comitatus Act restricts military participation in civilian law enforcement activities, prohibiting the use of Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marines for executing domestic laws unless authorized by the Constitution or Congress. DOD Directive 5525.5 outlines policies prohibiting direct assistance in search, seizure, arrest, or similar activities to civilian law enforcement agencies. The Posse Comitatus Act restricts military involvement in civilian law enforcement, prohibiting activities such as interdiction, search, seizure, arrest, and the use of military personnel for law enforcement purposes. The National Guard is generally exempt from the PCA when not in federal service, but their regulations limit direct participation in arrests or searches. The PCA does not apply in cases authorized by the Constitution. The Constitution does not expressly authorize the President to use the military to execute the law, but there are exceptions for sudden emergencies and protection of federal property. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply when Congress has expressly authorized the military to execute the law through civilian law enforcement authority, specific legislation, or general rules for assistance in certain circumstances. The military indirectly supports border security and immigration control efforts. The military supports border security and immigration control efforts through legislation authorizing assistance to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. Congress has periodically expanded the military's role in providing support to law enforcement since the 1980s. DOD is authorized to share information, loan equipment, provide advice and training, and maintain equipment for federal law enforcement agencies under Chapter 18 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code. The military provides support to law enforcement agencies for border security, immigration control, and counterdrug operations. DOD personnel can operate equipment for aerial reconnaissance, detection of air and sea traffic, and communication within 25 miles of U.S. borders. LEAs must reimburse DOD for support unless it does not impact military preparedness. Congress has expanded the military's role in assisting law enforcement since the 1980s. Congress expanded the military's support role in assisting law enforcement agencies since the 1980s, with additional authorities provided for counterdrug purposes. Section 1004 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1991 authorized DOD to provide support in various areas to LEAs requesting counterdrug assistance, which has been regularly extended and is in force through FY2011. This includes maintaining, upgrading, and repairing military equipment, as well as transportation support. Section 1004 of the National Defense Authorization Act authorizes the military to provide various support to law enforcement agencies for counterdrug activities, including maintaining equipment, transportation, training, reconnaissance, and establishing communication networks. This support is subject to posse comitatus restrictions and can impact military readiness in the short-term. The National Guard can provide support that may impact military readiness in the short-term, under the discretion of the Secretary of Defense. They often assist in counterdrug and counterterrorism efforts, operating under Title 10 authority when deployed by the President. Normally, they are under the control of state Governors in state active duty. The National Guard can provide support for border security and other activities authorized by state law. They may receive federal funding for certain activities under Title 32 duty status. Deployment of Guardsmen is authorized under 32 U.S.C. \u00a7502(a) and \u00a7502(f). The Secretary of Defense may grant funding to states for drug interdiction programs under 32 U.S.C. \u00a7112. Arizona's plan includes border security measures related to human smuggling and illegal immigration. The approval of Arizona's plan allows the National Guard to participate in border activities. The Secretary of Defense has authorized the Arizona National Guard to engage in border security measures using Section 502(f) of Title 32, expanding their duties beyond their usual scope. This provision allows National Guard members to be ordered to perform additional duties with federal pay and benefits. States like Arizona argue that this provision should be applied liberally, as it was during Hurricane Katrina and Rita, to include activities related to border security efforts. In 2004, Congress passed a law allowing federal funding for National Guard personnel conducting border security operations under Title 32. Chapter 9 of Title 32 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to provide funding for National Guard forces for \"homeland defense activities\" to protect the US territory and population from threats. Deployment of National Guard troops for border security could fall under this authority. The State of Arizona requested federal funds for its National Guard under Chapter 9 for homeland defense-border security activities, but it is unclear if the illegal entry of aliens is a necessary threat for National Guard deployment."
