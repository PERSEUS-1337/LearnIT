    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 896 of the Civil Code is amended to limit liability in actions related to residential construction deficiencies. The standards apply to original construction for individual dwelling units, excluding condominium conversions. Water issues in residential construction are addressed in the amended Section 896 of the Civil Code. Doors, windows, patio doors, and deck doors must prevent water from passing through unintended areas and excessive condensation from causing damage to other components. Systems within these elements must also have moisture barriers to protect the structure. Roofs, roofing systems, chimney caps, and ventilation components must prevent water from entering the structure or passing beyond moisture barriers. Decks, balconies, exterior stairs, and their systems should not allow water to enter the adjacent structure or cause damage within the systems themselves. Foundation systems, slabs, hardscape, and drainage systems must prevent water or vapor from entering the structure to avoid damage to building components or limit flooring material options. Additionally, hardscape installations should not cause water or soil erosion that could damage the structure. Exterior walls and fixtures must be installed to prevent water infiltration and maintain moisture barriers within the system. This includes components such as framing, substrate, flashings, and wall assemblies. (11) Exterior walls must prevent excessive condensation from entering the structure and causing damage to other components. This includes framing, substrate, flashings, trim, and wall cavities. (12) Retaining and site walls should not allow unintended water to pass through moisture barriers, while (13) only allowing water to flow in designated areas. (14) Plumbing, sewer, and utility systems must not leak. (15) Plumbing, sewer, and utility lines should not corrode and impede system longevity. (16) Sewer systems must allow proper sewage flow. (17) Waterproofing systems for showers and baths should prevent water leaks into walls and flooring. (18) Ceramic tile systems should deflect water to prevent damage. (b) Foundations, load-bearing components, and slabs should be free of significant cracks or displacement. Foundations, load bearing components, and slabs must comply with government building codes for structural safety, chemical deterioration, earthquake, and wind load resistance. Soils and retaining walls should not cause damage to the structure. Soils and engineered retaining walls must not compromise the structural safety of a building. Soils should not render land unusable for its intended purpose. Structures must adhere to fire protection regulations, including the construction of fireplaces and chimneys to prevent fire hazards. Plumbing and sewer systems must be installed properly to avoid impairing the structure's use by inhabitants. Electrical systems should also operate correctly and not hinder the structure's use. No legal action can be taken for violations of these requirements more than four years after close of escrow. Exterior pathways, driveways, hardscape, sidewalks, and patios must not have significant cracks or displacements. Stucco, siding, and other exterior finishes should not have significant cracks or separations. Manufactured products like windows, doors, roofs, plumbing fixtures, and appliances must be installed properly to ensure their useful life. Legal action for violations must be taken within four years of close of escrow. Manufactured products must be installed properly to ensure their useful life. If no useful life representation is made, the period should be no less than one year. Damage to a manufactured product due to a violation of installation standards is a recoverable element of damages. This does not limit recovery for damage to other building components caused by the manufactured product during its useful life. Heating and air-conditioning requirements for buildings are specified in building permit applications submitted before or on January 1, 2008, as per California Code of Regulations Title 24. Attached structures must comply with noise transmission standards set by government building codes. Irrigation systems and drainage must not damage landscaping. Untreated wood posts should not be in contact with soil to prevent decay. Legal actions must be taken within specified time frames. (9) Steel fences must be installed to prevent corrosion, legal action within four years. (10) Paint and stains should not deteriorate building surfaces, legal action within five years. (11) Roofing materials must prevent falling debris. (12) Landscaping systems should survive for at least one year, legal action within two years. (13) Ceramic tile must be installed securely to prevent detachment. (14) Dryer ducts must be installed according to manufacturer requirements, with a time limit of two years from close of escrow for any related actions. (15) Structures must not pose public health hazards, determined by authorized health officials or agencies, with no limitation on recovery for damages caused by violations of other sections."
