    "content": "In the event of a biological attack or highly contagious disease, the U.S. health system may implement quarantine and isolation measures to prevent the spread of infection. Quarantine separates exposed individuals from the unexposed, while isolation separates infected individuals from the uninfected. The authority to order quarantine or isolation is broad, with primary jurisdiction typically held by state health departments and officials. The federal government has jurisdiction over interstate and foreign quarantine, and may assist with intrastate incidents if local efforts are inadequate. Legal issues arise regarding responsibility for preventing disease outbreaks and the extent of actions that can be taken. Federal quarantine and isolation authority is derived from the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act grants the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to enforce regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. The Secretary can apprehend, detain, or release individuals in relation to diseases listed in an executive order. Quarantine authority was transferred to the CDC in 2000 for both interstate and foreign measures. The CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine enforces federal regulations for apprehension, detention, examination, or conditional release of individuals entering a state from a foreign country. Airline pilots and ship captains must report ill passengers on board. Section 361 of the PHS Act allows for the apprehension and examination of individuals reasonably believed to be infected with a communicable disease moving between states. During qualifying stage, individuals moving between states may be detained if found infected. Authority to apprehend extends to those believed to be infected with specified diseases and a probable source of infection to armed forces. Regulations for quarantine and isolation can be found in Parts 70 and 71 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Executive Order 13295 identifies diseases for quarantine and isolation measures. Pilots and ship captains must report ill passengers. To prevent the spread of diseases, pilots on interstate and US-bound flights must report illnesses to CDC Quarantine Stations. There are 20 CDC stations at US entry points, with DHS assisting in enforcing quarantine rules. The CDC Director can take necessary measures to prevent disease spread between states if local efforts are insufficient. Health authorities have regulations in place to prevent the spread of diseases between states, requiring infected persons to obtain a permit before traveling. The Secretary can also restrict entry of individuals from foreign countries with communicable diseases posing a serious threat to public health. The Public Health Service Act authorizes measures to aid or enforce quarantine during public health emergencies. The PHS can care for and treat quarantined individuals, who may also receive treatment at public or private medical facilities. Federal-state cooperation is allowed to enforce quarantines, with the federal government able to assist states and localities in enforcing their regulations. The Secretary may request aid from CBP, the Coast Guard, and military officers in executing quarantines. The Public Health Service Act allows for the enforcement of quarantines during public health emergencies with the aid of CBP, the Coast Guard, and military officers. Violations of federal quarantine regulations can result in criminal sanctions, including fines and jail time. Federal agencies have developed a Do Not Board list to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. The Do Not Board (DNB) list is used by health officials to restrict individuals with communicable diseases from boarding commercial flights in the United States. State and local health officials contact the CDC to place a person on the list if they are likely contagious, unlikely to comply with health recommendations, and may attempt to board a flight. Airlines are then instructed not to issue a boarding pass to individuals on the DNB list. The Do Not Board (DNB) list is used to prevent individuals with communicable diseases from boarding commercial flights in the United States. Once a patient is deemed noncontagious, they are removed from the list within 24 hours. In September 2008, the CDC reported that 42 requests were made to add individuals with suspected or confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis to the DNB list. Of these requests, 33 were approved, with 28 placed by US public health departments and 14 while individuals were outside the country. Two individuals on the DNB list tried to evade air travel restrictions and were detained by border officials. The CDC found that judicious use of the public health DNB list can prevent the need for costly contact investigations when individuals with communicable diseases travel on commercial aircraft. While the federal government has authority to authorize quarantine and isolation, the primary authority for these measures lies at the state level. CDC defers to state and local health authorities for quarantine powers, but retains federal authority to quarantine when necessary. The CDC anticipates rare use of federal authority for quarantine, as states have varying quarantine laws. State and local quarantines are typically authorized through public health orders, with some states requiring a court order for detention. States define diseases subject to quarantine through statutes or grant authority to the state health department. Many states have different methods for determining the duration of quarantine or isolation periods, often based on outdated laws that do not reflect current scientific knowledge. State laws were historically focused on specific diseases like tuberculosis or typhoid fever, leading to inconsistent approaches for other diseases. Despite perceived problems, state legislatures have not been prompted to reevaluate quarantine laws due to a decline in infectious diseases. Many states are reevaluating their quarantine and isolation laws due to advances in public health and medicine. Recent security concerns have prompted states to reconsider their emergency response systems, including quarantine authority. Coordination between federal, state, and local authorities is crucial during public health emergencies. Federal authority over interstate and foreign travel is clear, but the use of state police powers to restrict interstate travel for disease prevention is less defined. During public health emergencies, coordination between government levels is crucial. Balancing individual rights with the state's power to protect public health is essential. Classic public health measures like quarantine and isolation are available when needed, especially with the rise of less treatable diseases. The issue of balancing individual rights with community needs remains a challenge. In public health emergencies, balancing individual rights with the state's power to protect public health is crucial. Courts have recognized the right to challenge quarantine or isolation through a writ of habeas corpus. The Supreme Court has addressed a state's authority to quarantine under police powers, upholding laws and their implementation as valid exercises of state power. The Supreme Court upheld a state statute allowing the exclusion of healthy persons from disease-infested areas as a valid exercise of police power. The Court rejected a shipping company's argument that the statute interfered with interstate commerce, stating that states can impose quarantines to prevent disease spread even if it affects commerce. Courts generally do not interfere with a state's exercise of police powers in public health matters. The Supreme Court upheld a state statute allowing the exclusion of healthy persons from disease-infested areas as a valid exercise of police power. Courts generally do not interfere with a state's exercise of police powers in public health matters, except where regulations are arbitrary, oppressive, and unreasonable. In Miller v. Campbell City, an evacuation order was issued due to leaking gases, leading to a quarantine of a subdivision. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the evacuation order as related to public health and safety, finding no evidence of bad faith or malicious intent. The court upheld the plaintiffs' quarantine with consideration for all involved, satisfying both substantive and procedural due process. Other cases also supported public health measures, such as medical isolation for lack of vaccination and refusal of habeas corpus for a typhoid carrier. The court upheld the quarantine of a woman who was a carrier of a disease, even though she was not actually sick. The court justified the quarantine to prevent the spread of disease germs to those who are not infected. A federal district court in New York dismissed a claim alleging violation of due process by a plaintiff diagnosed with tuberculosis and confined against his will. The court cited Justice Burger's concurrence in O'Connor v. Donaldson, stating that a state can confine individuals to protect society from significant antisocial acts or communicable disease. Some courts require procedural due process protections for individuals confined to prevent disease spread, such as notice, right to counsel, and cross-examination. In Wong Wai v. Williamson, the San Francisco Board of Health ordered Chinese residents to be inoculated against bubonic plague and restricted their movement, but the court struck down the regulations as unreasonable and unjust. In Jew Ho v. Williamson, the court invalidated quarantine requirements for Chinese residents, questioning the reported deaths from bubonic plague. The legal issues surrounding quarantine, isolation, and public health measures in the context of a domestic public health emergency are complex. The use of eminent domain power when government agencies requisition private facilities for quarantine purposes may raise legal questions. A new development is the potential use of self-imposed or home quarantines, with states needing to consider the authorities necessary to support a population asked to stay at home voluntarily. This may include offering legal immunity to businesses providing facilities for quarantine."
