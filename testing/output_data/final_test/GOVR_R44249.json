    "content": "The European Union (EU) is a political and economic partnership formed after World War II by six Western European countries to promote peace and economic recovery. It currently consists of 28 member states, including former communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The EU has characteristics of both a supranational entity and an intergovernmental organization, with sovereignty shared in certain areas and cooperation based on consensus in others. The EU member states cooperate based on consensus, harmonizing laws and adopting common policies. They share a customs union, a single market with the \"four freedoms,\" a common trade policy, and a common currency (the euro). The Schengen area allows free movement without passport checks. The EU also works on common foreign and security policies and internal security measures. The EU faces political and economic pressures, including populist parties and Brexit. Experts debate the EU's future, with concerns about its stability. Brexit, with the UK leaving the EU, is a significant challenge. Other issues include internal and external challenges. The EU is dealing with various challenges such as democratic backsliding, migration, Russia, and terrorism. Despite Brexit, the remaining 27 member states are committed to the EU and considering further reforms. Analysts debate between further integration or halting it, with some arguing for more EU for economic growth and security, while others are skeptical of ceding more authority to Brussels. The United States has historically supported European integration as a way to promote democracy, free markets, and security. Despite occasional tensions, the U.S. and EU share a strong political partnership and significant trade relationship. During the Obama Administration, U.S. officials were concerned about the challenges facing the EU, such as the Greek debt crisis, conflict in Ukraine, migration crisis, and threats from ISIS. Hearings in the 114th Congress addressed these issues and also discussed the EU's future development and its implications for the United States. Many in the EU are worried about the future of the U.S.-EU partnership. President Trump's questioning of the EU's value and hostility towards the bloc has raised concerns in the EU about the future of U.S.-EU relations. Divisions have emerged on various issues, posing a challenge for the EU in managing relations with the Trump Administration. Despite this, EU policymakers aim to preserve close ties and cooperate with the U.S. on common interests. In the 115th Congress, there has been ongoing interest in EU challenges and U.S.-EU relations. Congressional hearings have focused on Brexit, EU policy towards Russia, and European efforts on migration. House and Senate Members have reassured EU officials of continued U.S. support through visits and resolutions reaffirming the importance of the U.S.-EU partnership. After World War II, Western European leaders aimed for peace, stability, and economic growth, leading to the formation of the EU in 1951. In 1951, six European countries established the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) to create a single market for coal and steel, pooling sovereignty and production under a supranational authority. The goal was to prevent future conflicts by binding economies, controlling war materials, and promoting reconciliation, especially between France and Germany. The ECSC's success led to the signing of two new treaties in Rome in 1957. In 1957, the six ECSC countries signed the Treaties of Rome, establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). These treaties merged national markets into a single market for goods, people, capital, and services. In 1967, the ECSC, EEC, and EURATOM became the European Community (EC). New members joined in 1973, 1981, and 1986. The Single European Act in 1987 facilitated the creation of the single market, allowing free movement of goods, people, capital, and services. The Treaty on European Union (Maastricht Treaty) in 1993 established the European Union, aiming for economic integration and political cooperation. It created the eurozone with a common currency, central bank (ECB), and monetary policy. Member states maintain control over national spending and taxation. The treaty also outlined coordination on foreign policy and internal security. Since the mid-1990s, EU member states have worked on a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP). The Schengen Agreement of 1985 became EU law, eliminating border controls. Enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe was a priority, with eight formerly communist countries joining in 2004. Since the mid-1990s, EU member states have focused on Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP). The Schengen Agreement of 1985, now EU law, removed border controls. Central and Eastern European countries (Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia) joined the EU, enhancing political and economic influence. Despite overall support for the EU, tensions persist between those advocating for deeper integration and those prioritizing national sovereignty. Some countries have opted out of certain integration aspects like the eurozone and Schengen area. The EU's enlargement to the east has brought in members with recent memories of Soviet domination, influencing policy preferences. Southern EU countries bordering the Mediterranean may have interests in North Africa. Questions exist on EU \"deepening\" vs. \"widening.\" Efforts to reform institutions culminated in the Lisbon Treaty in 2009, aiming to enhance the EU's global role and increase democratic processes. The Lisbon Treaty in 2009 aimed to enhance the EU's global role and increase democratic accountability. Critics argue that EU decision-making processes are complex and lack transparency. The EU maintains an open door for European countries meeting membership criteria. Concerns exist about the implications of further EU expansion on institutional capacities, finances, and identity. The EU's future enlargement may face challenges due to economic factors and public enthusiasm. The 2008-2009 global recession and eurozone debt crisis have impacted EU economies. Some believe further integration in economic and financial fields could be unlikely, and forging a common foreign policy may become more difficult. There are concerns about the legitimacy and structure of the EU and its institutions as it reaches its geographical and public expansion limits. The recession significantly affected EU economies, leading to the eurozone debt crisis and concerns about the viability of the 19-member eurozone. Many EU countries struggled with weak economic growth and high unemployment, implementing unpopular austerity measures to reduce budget deficits. Financial assistance was provided to Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus to avoid default. The crisis also impacted Europe's banking system, resulting in the collapse of insolvent banks and a recapitalization plan for Spanish banks. Greece faced ongoing financial difficulties and disputes with EU creditors, raising the possibility of exiting the eurozone. The Greek government averted a potential Grexit by agreeing to eurozone demands for austerity and reforms. Tensions arose within the EU as France and Italy emphasized the importance of the eurozone's integrity, while Germany and others stressed adherence to fiscal rules. Disputes persisted over Greece's assistance program and the need for debt relief. The crisis raised doubts about the eurozone's stability but some argue it emerged stronger. The eurozone has strengthened since the debt crisis and near-Grexit experience in 2010. France and Germany are working together to improve economic governance, but challenges remain. Despite concerns about trade tensions, the EU's economic prospects have improved, with growth predicted to remain resilient at around 2% in 2018 and 2019. Some EU countries still face economic challenges, with high unemployment, especially among young people in Spain and Italy. Greece received debt relief in 2018 but its economy remains fragile. Experts are concerned about financial stability in Italy, the eurozone's third-largest economy, following the election of a new coalition government critical of the EU. The Italian government's rejection of austerity measures and higher public spending in their 2019 budget has caused tension with the European Commission over Italy's high debt load. Italy faces EU disciplinary action for breaching fiscal rules, potentially leading to financial sanctions and concerns about debt sustainability in the eurozone. Italy's rejection of austerity measures in its 2019 budget has led to increased borrowing costs and credit rating downgrades. Support for euroskeptic parties in the EU has grown due to concerns about national sovereignty, the eurozone crisis, and immigration. Voters are worried about the EU's democratic deficit and lack of control over decisions made in Brussels. Fears about immigration and globalization are fueling support for populist and euroskeptic parties in Europe. These parties vary in their political leanings and views on the EU, with some advocating for reforms while others call for its dissolution. Several EU countries, including Austria, Italy, and Sweden, have seen a rise in populist and euroskeptic sentiments. Several EU countries have prevalent populist and euroskeptic parties. Euroskeptic parties have made significant gains in national and local elections in countries like Italy, Poland, Hungary, Austria, and Finland. In Germany, the euroskeptic Alternative for Germany party entered parliament in 2017, challenging mainstream parties. The UK government held a 2016 referendum on EU membership due to pressure from euroskeptics. Some euroskeptic parties aim to influence EU policies, but polls show majority support for the EU. Anti-EU parties did not perform as well in key elections in 2017. The development of the EU has been historically driven by key countries like France and Germany. However, a strong EU \"engine\" has been lacking in recent years, with critics viewing German Chancellor Angela Merkel as hesitant and tactical. Some analysts argue that too much power is concentrated in Germany, while other European leaders are hindered by domestic politics and economic concerns. The 2017 election of French President Emmanuel Macron has brought new dynamics to the EU. Following the 2017 election of French President Emmanuel Macron, hopes were high for France to become a strong leader alongside Germany in the EU. However, Chancellor Merkel's diminishing authority and domestic challenges have hindered significant EU initiatives. Merkel announced her resignation as party leader in 2018 and will not seek reelection in 2021, raising concerns about the future direction of EU reforms. Some observers believe European leaders lack a clear strategic vision for the EU, leading to ad hoc responses and disagreements between Germany and France on key issues. Smaller EU members are hesitant to see a stronger Franco-German partnership without the UK's influence. Italy's euroskeptic government is unlikely to support EU reforms. The EU is facing significant divisions and lack of trust among member states due to crises over Greece and migration, threatening the core principle of solidarity. Narrow national agendas are prioritized over European-wide solutions, raising doubts about the commitment to European integration, especially among younger generations. The EU is grappling with unprecedented challenges, including the UK's euroskeptic stance and pressure on former Prime Minister David Cameron to reconsider the UK's relationship with the EU. This may have lasting implications for the EU's role as an international actor and its partnership with the US. In response to pressure from both within his own Conservative Party and outside of it, the Cameron government announced it would renegotiate the UK's membership conditions with the EU and hold a public referendum on the UK's continued membership. Cameron reached a deal with other EU governments in February 2016 to better guard British sovereignty and economic interests. The referendum on the UK's EU membership was set for June 23, 2016, resulting in a narrow 51.9% to 48.1% vote in favor of Brexit. Factors influencing this outcome included economic dissatisfaction, fears about globalization and immigration, and anti-elite sentiments. The \"leave\" campaign capitalized on arguments for UK's independence from EU regulations and free movement principle, leading to high immigration levels. Prime Minister Theresa May invoked Article 50 in March 2017, triggering a two-year withdrawal negotiation period. Contentious EU-UK negotiations are ongoing, with Brexit expected in March 2019. The EU-UK negotiations on Brexit, which began in March 2019, have been contentious. Despite an agreement in principle in December 2017, details on customs arrangements and trade relations have been difficult to flesh out. A key issue is devising a \"backstop\" for Northern Ireland to prevent a hard border with Ireland. The EU-UK negotiations on Brexit have been challenging, especially regarding the backstop for Northern Ireland. In November 2018, a draft withdrawal agreement was reached, including a 21-month transition period and a backstop arrangement to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU. The UK is in a customs union with the EU, with deeper regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland. UK officials believe the backstop won't be necessary, but concerns remain about securing approval in Parliament. Critics fear the agreement ties the UK too closely to the EU, leaving them in a \"half in, half out\" situation. The DUP opposes elements of the draft withdrawal agreement. The EU's tough stance in Brexit negotiations has raised fears of a \"no deal\" scenario and potential threats to the UK's constitutional integrity. Euroskeptic parties in various EU countries have been emboldened by Brexit, calling for similar referendums on EU membership. Concerns persist about the impact of Brexit on the EU's future unity. Brexit could undermine the EU if it leads to other countries seeking special membership conditions. The UK's difficulties in pursuing Brexit have increased support for the EU in other member states. The departure of a member state is unprecedented and will have political and economic repercussions for both the UK and the EU. Brexit could diminish the EU's international role by losing UK's foreign policy clout and defense capabilities. EU officials are concerned about losing British expertise in areas like sanctions and negotiations with countries like Russia and Iran. Brexit may also hinder EU enlargement, as the UK was a strong supporter of expansion. However, some believe Brexit could lead to a more unified EU, allowing for deeper integration and closer defense cooperation without UK opposition. The UK's role in the EU has been to limit certain initiatives that infringe on national sovereignty or NATO's role in European security. Concerns have arisen over democratic backsliding in Poland and Hungary, with criticism directed at laws and policies conflicting with EU values. In Poland, reforms by the ruling party have increased government control over the courts and media. Since 2010, Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his Fidesz party in Hungary have centralized power around the prime minister's office, targeting media and civil society groups. Both Poland and Hungary dismiss EU criticisms of democratic backsliding, defending their policies vigorously. PiS in Poland argues that judicial reforms were necessary to improve efficiency and remove Communist-era judges. In Hungary and Poland, government reforms aim to address corruption and improve efficiency. Despite EU concerns, public support for ruling parties remains steady. Both countries are facing Article 7 proceedings for alleged violations of EU fundamental rights, which could result in a loss of voting rights in the Council of Ministers. The EU triggered Article 7 against Poland and Hungary for alleged violations of fundamental rights. EU officials aim to encourage dialogue and revisions rather than sanctions. The likelihood of either country losing voting rights is low due to the need for unanimous agreement among member states. Concerns about the rule of law and corruption have also been raised in Romania and Malta. The European Commission is debating tying EU funds to member states' rule of law records, causing tensions with Poland and Hungary. Both countries resist what they see as EU interference in national sovereignty and are skeptical of further EU integration in certain policy areas. They believe they are unfairly targeted for their differing views on the EU's purpose and future shape. Some analysts believe that the EU's initiation of Article 7 proceedings against Hungary is seen as \"Brussels' revenge\" for its migration policies. Critics argue that Poland and Hungary's disregard for EU values threatens the union's character and trust among member states. The EU has been criticized for addressing rule-of-law concerns late, especially regarding Hungary. Europe has seen a significant influx of refugees and migrants in recent years, with over 1 million reaching Europe via the Mediterranean Sea in 2015, decreasing in subsequent years. In 2017, over 105,000 refugees and migrants arrived in Greece, Italy, and Spain. Many aim to reach northern EU countries like Germany and Sweden for better opportunities. EU initiatives in 2015 to manage the crisis failed, leading to a shift in focus towards discouraging the journey to save lives. EU leaders ended the \"wave-through approach\" in 2016, preventing asylum seekers from transiting through the Western Balkans. Since 2017, the EU has implemented agreements with Turkey and Libya to reduce migration flows to Greece and Italy. These measures have significantly decreased the number of migrants and refugees reaching Europe. However, they have faced criticism for potentially violating international law and refugee rights. Spain has seen a rise in migrant arrivals in the Western Mediterranean, with reports of smugglers exploring new transit routes in the Western Balkans. The EU continues to grapple with criticism over its lack of coherent migration and asylum policies. Despite reduced migrant and refugee numbers entering Europe, challenges persist in EU solidarity due to divisions over burden-sharing and asylum processing. Frontline states like Greece and Italy criticize lack of support, while other countries point to lax registration processes. This strains the EU's Dublin regulation on asylum processing. The EU's Dublin regulation on asylum processing faces challenges from Central European governments opposing refugee redistribution due to concerns over cultural and economic impacts. The Schengen Area's security is also strained by migration flows and terrorism threats. The migration flows into Europe have raised concerns about potential terrorist infiltration, leading to temporary border controls in Schengen countries. There are worries that these controls could become permanent due to ongoing secondary movements of asylum-seekers. Additionally, the influx of refugees has reignited debates on integrating minorities into European culture. The influx of migrants and refugees into EU countries has sparked concerns about integration, security risks, and economic implications. Some member states in Central and Eastern Europe have cited terrorism and security concerns as reasons for not accepting migrants. Societal tensions and xenophobia have also been on the rise, with an increase in violent incidents against migrants and refugees in countries like Germany, Sweden, and Italy. The economic impact of the migrant and refugee flows has been a topic of debate, with strains on welfare systems being a key issue. The surge in migrants and refugees in 2015-2016 strained welfare, education, and housing systems in many European countries. Concerns about job competition and wage reduction exist among the public. Leaders and analysts believe that migrants and refugees could benefit the economy in the long term by offsetting unfavorable demographic trends in the EU. Integration into the labor market in host countries is crucial for this potential economic benefit. The EU is working on developing a more comprehensive migration and asylum policy to manage legal and irregular migration, but progress has been slow due to domestic pressures for stricter policies. The EU faces domestic pressure for stricter migration policies, with a focus on revising the Dublin regulation. Proposed reforms aim to ease burdens on frontline states and curb secondary movements. Germany seeks bilateral agreements to prevent asylum-seekers from moving within the EU. Chancellor Merkel is working on deals with Spain, Greece, and Italy to address secondary movements. EU member states are divided on potential migration policies, making implementation of agreed policies difficult. In June 2018, EU leaders announced plans for \"controlled centers\" within the EU and exploring \"regional disembarkation platforms\" outside the EU for asylum-seekers. However, efforts to flesh out these plans have led to disagreements among member states. No EU country has offered to host a \"controlled center.\" EU member states are divided on migration policies, with disagreements on hosting \"controlled centers\" and establishing \"disembarkation platforms\" outside the EU. Some countries like Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya have ruled out hosting such facilities. The EU has reinforced border controls with the new European Border and Coast Guard, aiming to increase Frontex staff from 1,500 to 10,000. The EU is considering strengthening Frontex by increasing its staff from 1,500 to 10,000, but some member states are concerned about potential encroachment on national sovereignty. The EU has faced challenges in addressing security issues like the conflict in Ukraine, a more assertive Russia, and terrorism linked to ISIS, impacting its ability to form common foreign and security policies. The heightened terrorism threat also poses risks to the Schengen area of free movement. The EU has condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine, imposed sanctions on Russia, and tied lifting sanctions to the full implementation of the Minsk peace agreements. Crafting common EU policies on Russia has been challenging due to different national histories and economic relations with Russia among member states. The EU is committed to implementing the Minsk peace agreements for Ukraine and maintaining sanctions on Russia. Some EU countries question the effectiveness of the sanctions, citing concerns about hindering relations with Russia and harming European business interests. Financial costs have been incurred by certain industries in Germany, Finland, and the Baltic states. While some European officials consider restructuring the sanctions, others like the UK, Poland, and the Baltic states firmly oppose relaxing them and urge the US to uphold its sanctions. Additionally, the EU and its member states are worried about various Russian activities, including disinformation efforts and potential election interference. The EU condemned Russian activities such as disinformation efforts, election interference, actions in Syria, cyber threats, and human rights abuses. In response to the nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal, the EU approved a legal framework for sanctions on those involved in chemical weapons. While not targeting Russia specifically, the Skripal attack provided political motivation for these measures. Analysts expect Russian intelligence officers linked to the attack to be sanctioned. Some EU countries see Russia as a potential partner due to economic ties and the belief that cooperation is necessary for stability. Others view Russia as a threat, citing concerns over military exercises and airspace incursions. Some European leaders and EU officials advocate for an \"EU Magnitsky Act\" to impose sanctions on Russians complicit in human rights abuses and money-laundering activities. The UK and the Netherlands are also pushing for new EU sanctions against cyberattacks, particularly wary of Russia and President Putin's intentions. EU countries with Soviet domination histories oppose the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which would increase Russian gas delivery to Germany. Stream 2, increasing Russian gas delivery to Europe via the Baltic Sea, is opposed by some EU members due to concerns about undercutting Ukraine, increasing reliance on Russian gas, and not improving energy security. Supporters include Germany, Austria, and France, viewing it as a commercial project to boost gas supply. Brexit may benefit Russia by potentially leading to a more accommodating EU approach. Brexit could complicate EU's stance on Russia due to UK's diplomatic and military capabilities. Divisions within the EU may assist Putin's goal of challenging the Western-oriented order in Europe. European governments are concerned about the Islamic State's influence in Europe following recent terrorist attacks. The November 2015 Paris and March 2016 Brussels attacks were carried out by European citizens linked to the Islamic State. Concerns arose after the May 2017 UK concert bombing by a British citizen of Libyan descent, indicating potential Islamic State influence from Libya. The group's ability to attract European followers and inspire lone wolf attacks through social media is troubling for European authorities. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for car and truck attacks in several European countries, suggesting a direct connection with the group. The Islamic State has heightened calls for attacks in Europe amid territorial losses in Syria and Iraq. Analysts note concerns about the integration of Muslims in Europe and the potential for radicalization. EU leaders warn about terrorists using migration routes to enter Europe, citing examples of attackers posing as refugees. European governments have implemented various measures to combat Islamist terrorism and foreign fighters, including increased surveillance and travel restrictions. The EU is working to enhance counterterrorism capabilities by improving information-sharing among member states. Recent lone wolf attacks by asylum-seekers and refugees in Germany, Sweden, and Finland have raised concerns about radicalization among vulnerable individuals. The threat of terrorists using migration routes to enter Europe has prompted heightened security measures. The EU is working on improving counterterrorism capacities by enhancing information-sharing, strengthening border controls, bolstering counter-radicalization measures, and curbing terrorist financing. However, implementing common EU policies to combat terrorism has been challenging due to concerns about sovereignty, security, human rights, and civil liberties. Data privacy issues have also slowed progress on certain EU-wide policies. The EU's response to the crisis in Syria and Iraq has been hindered by differing views on the use of force among member states. After the Paris attacks in 2015, the EU invoked a mutual defense clause for France, but it was seen as a political gesture rather than the establishment of an EU security mission. The future of the EU is being questioned amidst internal and external challenges. The future of the EU is being questioned amidst external challenges. Debate exists on the level of EU integration needed, with some advocating for beneficial reforms while others fear a halt or reversal of integration. Possible scenarios include the EU continuing to function without significant changes, pursuing integration and common policies, and finding solutions to crises like migration and terrorism. The EU may become a two-speed entity, with core countries strongly integrated and periphery countries more free to choose policies. A multispeed variant could involve further integration in selected fields, while some members opt out. This configuration could formalize existing practices of varying membership on EU initiatives. A looser, more intergovernmental configuration of the EU may be likely if reform-minded euroskeptic parties come to power in more EU countries. This could result in a halt or reversal of further EU integration, with sovereignty on certain issues reclaimed by national capitals. On the other hand, a tighter, more integrated configuration could also emerge post-Brexit, leading to a more united EU focused on political and economic integration, but less likely to encourage further enlargement. After the Brexit referendum in June 2016, EU leaders acknowledged the need for a \"political reflection\" on the EU's future. The Bratislava Declaration in September 2016 emphasized the EU's importance despite one country leaving. However, some officials felt the proposed measures were not bold enough and lacked a strategic vision. The EU concluded its reflection process in March 2017 with the Rome Declaration renewing the commitment of the EU-27 leaders. In the 60th-anniversary Rome Declaration, EU leaders renewed their commitment to European integration, acknowledged challenges, and pledged to strengthen the EU through greater unity and solidarity. Some EU governments considered a multispeed EU, but a German-led effort to include it in the declaration failed due to concerns about division and undermining solidarity. Despite this, the EU seems to be moving towards a multispeed approach. The EU is pursuing greater integration in certain areas, with initiatives to bolster security and defense cooperation. This includes the creation of a European Defense Fund and a defense pact (PESCO) to enhance military capabilities and interoperability. French and German leaders are discussing measures to strengthen the eurozone's stability and economic governance, with a proposed road map for reforms announced in June 2018. Other eurozone members have expressed reservations about some aspects of the reforms. Many eurozone members have reservations about the German-French plan, especially regarding a potential common eurozone budget. Implementing significant EU reforms will be a lengthy process with continuous debate and negotiations. The United States has supported European integration since the 1950s to promote stability, security, and democratic allies in Europe. Since the Cold War, the US has viewed European integration as crucial for deterring the Soviet threat. Post-Cold War, the US and EU have cooperated on foreign policy, security, peacekeeping, law enforcement, counterterrorism, cybersecurity, and trade. The EU represents a significant portion of US trade. The EU accounts for a significant portion of US trade and foreign direct investment. Despite occasional disagreements, the US and EU partnership is seen as beneficial for both countries. Some US officials have expressed concerns about the EU's ability to be a strong partner due to internal challenges. Some worry that EU internal issues may hinder its ability to focus on key US priorities like Russian aggression, conflicts in Syria and Iraq, and terrorism. Brexit could alter US-EU dynamics, potentially impacting US interests. The US values the UK's role in the EU for its political and economic influence, alignment on foreign policy, and advocacy for US goals. Some believe the UK's absence from the EU could lead to divergence on managing Russia and NATO's centrality to European security. However, others argue that the US has strong ties with most EU countries and the partnership is broader than any one member state. European leaders value US support for European security and prosperity, with NATO and the US security guarantee seen as crucial for peace and stability in Europe. Many view U.S.-EU trade and investment ties as crucial for European economic well-being and global stability. President Trump's critical views of the EU have raised concerns about future U.S.-EU relations. European leaders value U.S. support for European security and prosperity. European Council President Donald Tusk expressed concerns about the Trump administration's potential impact on American foreign policy and EU cohesion. The EU is worried about protectionist U.S. trade policies, including tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. President Trump called the EU a \"foe\" in trade but acknowledged their competitiveness. Some analysts believe the Trump Administration may not prioritize the EU's stability. The Trump Administration may be indifferent to the collapse of the EU to negotiate better bilateral trade deals with individual member states. President Trump supports the UK's decision to leave the EU and a future U.S.-UK free trade agreement. The U.S.-EU economic cooperation accord on July 25, 2018, was seen as a positive step to de-escalate trade tensions. EU officials hope for an end to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum products and prevent new tariffs on autos. Some EU policymakers remain skeptical about the prospects for U.S.-EU discussions. Some EU policymakers and experts are skeptical about resolving trade differences with President Trump, especially regarding the inclusion of agricultural products in upcoming trade talks. U.S. officials are frustrated with slow progress on the EU side, and divisions have emerged on various international issues. EU officials are uneasy with the Trump Administration's \"America First\" foreign policy and its positions on relations with Russia, China, Iran, the Middle East, migration, and climate change. EU officials are concerned about the Trump Administration's ambivalence towards multilateral organizations and question the US's role in supporting the multilateral trading system. There are worries about US global disengagement and the EU's need to be a better partner. EU officials are worried about US global disengagement and believe the EU must be prepared to address challenges on its own. Efforts to reduce European dependence on the US include trade agreements with other countries and regions, as well as enhancing defense cooperation. Calls for a \"European army\" by French President Macron aim to boost European military capabilities amid uncertainty about the US role in the world. German Chancellor Merkel supports this idea, emphasizing it should complement, not compete with NATO. Despite tensions, the EU will seek to collaborate with the Trump Administration on common issues. The EU aims to work with the Trump Administration on common interests like countering terrorism and promoting cybersecurity, while preserving long-term political, security, and economic relations with the United States. European leaders, including Juncker and Mogherini, emphasize the importance of maintaining close U.S.-EU ties despite disagreements. US officials and analysts believe fears of deteriorating relations are exaggerated, citing recent statements of support from President Trump and his administration. President Trump and other Administration officials have shown support for the EU. After a meeting with European Commission President Juncker in July 2018, Trump tweeted about the strong relationship between the US and the EU. The new US Ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, highlighted the importance of candid discussions between the two entities, noting that they work best when cooperating on strategic and economic issues. Sondland pledged continued support for close US-EU cooperation."
