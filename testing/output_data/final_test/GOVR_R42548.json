Analysts suggest Mexico has seen modest economic growth with periods of crisis. The 2012 Mexican elections saw the PRI/PVEM candidate Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto leading in polls, with a focus on job creation and public security. Voters believed the PRI could restore order and economic growth, despite concerns about its reputation for corruption and undemocratic practices. In the 2012 Mexican elections, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of the PRI/PVEM maintained a lead over other candidates, with L\u00f3pez Obrador gaining support from the YoSoy132 student protest movement. Polls underestimated L\u00f3pez Obrador's popularity, influenced by social media activism. The PRI, PAN, and PRD are the major political parties in Mexico.

The PAN gradually gained support in local and state elections, eventually winning governorships in business-friendly northern states and conservative central western states. Vicente Fox's presidential victory in 2000 was a significant milestone for the party. However, disillusionment grew over corruption, impunity, and poverty during the 12 years of PAN rule. Organized crime-related violence, partly in response to tough anticrime policies, further eroded support for the PAN. Before the 2012 elections, the PAN governed several states and held a significant number of seats in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. The Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) is a center-left party founded in the late 1980s by dissident PRI members.

He served as the national party president and later as the second elected mayor of Mexico City. Despite being popular as mayor, he lost support in the 2006 presidential election due to disrespectful comments towards President Fox.

Despite initial concerns, the election day saw a high voter turnout with no significant violence. Domestic and international observers monitored the election process. The Organization of American States (OAS) and independent domestic observation groups monitored the Mexican election, noting irregularities but concluding they did not warrant an annulment.

However, opposition from PRI legislators with ties to labor unions and the PRD-led coalition could complicate these efforts.

He endorses energy reforms to increase private involvement in Pemex, similar to Petrobras in Brazil, with a focus on boosting trade ties with fast-growing economies. However, constitutional reforms require a two-thirds vote in congress, which may be challenging due to the PRI-led coalition's lack of a majority in either chamber. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto may face opposition to his reformist agenda similar to Calder\u00f3n's experience if he fails to secure a majority in congress. Calder\u00f3n has pledged to push for energy reforms before leaving office, which Pe\u00f1a Nieto supports. However, the PRD-led coalition and some PRI legislators could block these efforts. Pe\u00f1a Nieto may prioritize implementing reforms with broad support, such as making Pemex more independent and reducing its tax burden, before seeking greater private cooperation with the company."
