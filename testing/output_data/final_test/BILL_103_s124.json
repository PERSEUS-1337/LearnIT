    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Compassionate Pain Relief Act\". It includes findings related to pain relief. Congress finds that cancer is a progressive and often painful disease affecting many in the US, leading to intense pain that current medications cannot effectively treat. The use of diacetylmorphine for pain relief is not allowed in the US, despite clinical evidence of its effectiveness when administered properly. The use of parenteral diacetylmorphine for intractable pain due to terminal cancer is supported by evidence from other countries and will not increase drug abuse or pharmacy thefts. Its availability will enhance physicians' ability to treat such pain effectively. The Federal Government should establish a temporary program allowing the use of pharmaceutical dosage forms of parenteral diacetylmorphine for controlling intractable pain in terminal cancer patients. SEC. 3. PARENTERAL DIACETYLMORPHINE PROGRAM. An amendment to the Public Health Service Act allows for the use of parenteral diacetylmorphine for compassionate pain relief. The Secretary will issue regulations for a program allowing parenteral diacetylmorphine dispensing from pharmacies for terminal cancer pain relief. Individuals with histologic evidence of a high mortality cancer are eligible. Manufacturers must use adequate methods for producing the drug. The program allows parenteral diacetylmorphine dispensing from pharmacies for terminal cancer pain relief. Pharmacies must meet specific requirements to dispense the drug. An application for parenteral diacetylmorphine must be submitted in the prescribed form and manner, with assurances that the applicant will comply with storage and dispensing requirements. The drug can only be dispensed through the applicant upon the written prescription of a registered physician. Congress intends for the Secretary to primarily use hospital pharmacies to dispense parenteral diacetylmorphine under the program, but may use other pharmacies in cases of humanitarian need, significant demand, and adequate safeguards against diversion. Regulations under this section aim to prevent the illicit diversion of parenteral diacetylmorphine distributed in the program. Physicians must prescribe this medication for individuals with terminal cancer and intractable pain, following specific criteria. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and related drug abuse prevention acts do not apply to the importing, manufacturing, distribution, and dispensing of parenteral diacetylmorphine under a specific program. The Secretary is required to report on the implementation and activities of this program every three months. The Secretary must report on the implementation of the program every three months to the Committees on Energy and Commerce and Labor and Human Resources. The Secretary must report on the activities under the program to the Committees on Energy and Commerce and Labor and Human Resources. Additionally, a report on pain management research activities funded by the National Institutes of Health must be submitted within six months of the enactment of this part. The Federal Government supports training of health personnel in pain management and recommendations for improving it. The Comptroller General will submit a report on program activities after 56 months. The Secretary can terminate or modify the program at any time. The Secretary has the authority to modify or terminate the program established under subsection (a) if deemed necessary to prevent diversion of diacetylmorphine. The program will automatically terminate 60 months after its establishment."
