Hardline Kashmiri Muslim militant groups refused to participate in elections and threatened violence. The All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) also refused to participate, questioning the fairness of the process and demanding significant concessions from the Indian government. The Hurriyat considered participation only if elected officials didn't have to pledge allegiance to the Indian constitution. The Hurriyat seeks substantive talks with Indian and Pakistani governments for Kashmir's final status. The divided Hurriyat leadership faces threats from militant groups and lacks a unified command for negotiations. Domestic constraints and fear hinder the electoral process. Secretary of State Powell outlined the U.S. position during his 2002 visit to South Asia. During his July 2002 visit to South Asia, Secretary of State Powell emphasized the need for India and Pakistan to work towards peace in Kashmir through political dialogue. The United States aims to address security concerns in the region by combating terrorist groups with links to Kashmir. The 2002 elections in Kashmir were held in four stages amidst militant violence, resulting in at least 700 deaths. Voter turnout varied greatly across districts, with an average of just below 44%. The ruling National Conference party was ousted from power, with the Indian National Congress winning 20 seats. The Indian National Congress won 20 seats in the state assembly and formed a power-sharing arrangement with the People's Democratic Party (PDP), which won 16 seats. PDP leader Mufti Mohammed Sayeed will serve as Chief Minister for three years, with Congress members holding top ministerial positions. The coalition has agreed to a controversial \"common minimum program\" for governance in Jammu and Kashmir, including investigating deaths of prisoners and missing individuals. The CMP proposals in Jammu and Kashmir include addressing grievances, disbanding a counterinsurgency unit, releasing political prisoners, opening dialogue with militant groups, and scrapping a controversial anti-terrorism law. However, these proposals have faced criticism from Hindu nationalists and officials in New Delhi who fear they may encourage militancy. The Congress Party's national status also adds to the challenges facing the government, as it must avoid appearing \"soft on militancy.\" Additionally, a leading militant group has dismissed the proposals as \"cosmetic.\" The Hizbul Mujahideen leader criticized the proposals as inadequate. Pakistan-based militants threatened action against Sayeed and the PDP for coalition with the Indian government. Ordinary Kashmiris are pleased with some aspects of the new government. Release of political prisoners sparked debate. New Delhi leaders expressed concern over the prisoner release. Sayeed questioned BJP's political motives. In early December 2002, Sayeed expressed understanding between New Delhi and the state government on Kashmir issues. The PDP lacks political strength in certain regions, so Sayeed aims to appease all constituencies. Development aid from New Delhi to Jammu and Kashmir is crucial, with Sayeed promising equal treatment for all regions. The elections bolstered the Indian government's position on Kashmir, as the results were seen as credible by the people. The Hurriyat group seemed to have missed an opportunity. The Hurriyat missed a chance to prove itself as the genuine representative of the Kashmiri people, as the high voter turnout weakened Pakistan's stance on Kashmir. The US welcomed the successful elections in Jammu and Kashmir, urging India and Pakistan to resume dialogue on outstanding issues, including Kashmir. New Delhi insists on halting militant infiltration before starting talks. The core obstacle to diplomatic progress between India and Pakistan is the continuation of separatist violence in Kashmir. US envoy Robert Blackwill believes the problem is \"cross-border terrorism\" driven externally. Congressional hearings have discussed the political situation in Kashmir and cross-border infiltration. No major action is being taken on Kashmir currently, but US aid and military cooperation with India and Pakistan continue. Future issues for Congress include determining the role of U.S. assistance in securing the Line of Control between Indian and Pakistani-held Kashmir, potential levels of economic and security assistance, arms sales to both countries, and the possibility of increased U.S. diplomatic involvement in the Kashmir issue."
