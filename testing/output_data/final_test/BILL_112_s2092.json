    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Religious Freedom Protection Act of 2012\". Congress finds that religious freedom and liberty of conscience are fundamental rights, as stated in the Declaration of Independence and the First Amendment. The Department of Health and Human Services issued a mandate in 2011 requiring health plans to cover sterilization and contraceptives, including those for abortions. The mandate's exemption for religious employers is unprecedented and excludes many religious organizations. Despite objections, the Department has not broadened the exemption. The Department of Health and Human Services announced on January 20, 2012, that it would not broaden the exemption for religious institutions regarding the mandate on health plans covering sterilization and contraceptives. Instead, they granted an additional year for religious institutions to \"adapt\" their consciences to the mandate. The Public Health Service Act is being amended. The Public Health Service Act is being amended to include conscience protections that prevent individuals or entities from being required to offer, provide, or purchase health insurance coverage for contraceptive or sterilization services if they oppose it based on religious belief or moral conviction. The Public Health Service Act is being amended to include conscience protections that prevent individuals or entities from being required to offer, provide, or purchase health insurance coverage for contraceptive or sterilization services if they oppose it based on religious belief or moral conviction. This includes not mandating speech regarding such services or prohibiting health insurance coverage that excludes services opposed on the basis of religious belief or moral conviction. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, along with any related regulations, shall not penalize individuals or entities for religious or moral objections to providing health insurance coverage for contraceptives or sterilization services. This includes protections against government-mandated speech on such services. The subsection provides protection of individual rights and allows for a private cause of action in judicial proceedings. Federal courts have jurisdiction to address violations by granting legal or equitable relief, including injunctions, declarations, damages, costs, and attorney fees. Actions can be initiated by the Attorney General or any person/entity affected. The subsection allows for private cause of action in judicial proceedings, with federal courts having jurisdiction to address violations. The Office for Civil Rights receives complaints of discrimination based on this subsection, and interim relief can be granted by the court as necessary. The Office for Civil Rights receives and investigates complaints of discrimination based on the subsection, defining \"entity\" broadly to include various healthcare entities. The effective date of the amendment is retroactive to the enactment of Public Law 111-148."
