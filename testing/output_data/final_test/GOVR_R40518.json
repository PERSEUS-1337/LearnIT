    "content": "The Administration's 2010 and 2011 budget proposals include capping itemized deductions at 28% for high-income taxpayers. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on charitable contributions, but the change would not take effect until 2011. The analysis also considers other income tax changes and the estate tax. The proposal to cap itemized deductions at 28% for high-income taxpayers could impact charitable contributions. Most taxpayers do not deduct their contributions due to taking the standard deduction or not filing tax returns. The provision would only affect the top two marginal tax rates, impacting about 1.4% of returns. Converting deductions into credits has been previously discussed as a way to save taxes. The proposed credits and caps on itemized deductions aim to address the differing subsidies created by itemized deductions across income classes. The subsidy rates vary from 10% to 35% based on income levels. Historical data suggests a small response to tax changes, indicating limited impact on charitable giving. Calculations for the consequences of the proposed contribution deduction are based on the affected share of giving, price change magnitude, and historical tax changes. The study discusses the impact of the deduction cap on charitable giving, considering the price change magnitude, elasticity, and effects on different types of organizations. It also explores the role of the estate tax and policy trade-offs. The tax price for charitable contributions is (1-t), where t is the tax rate, showing how much a taxpayer saves and loses for each dollar contributed. The tax price of giving is affected by a cap on the rate at which deductions occur and the marginal statutory rate. The top tax rate has fluctuated significantly since 1913, starting at 7% and reaching as high as 92%. In 1982, the top tax rate was reduced from 70% to 50%, further reduced to 28% in 1986. Changes in tax rates occurred in 1990, 1991, and 2001. Table 1 compares past tax rate changes to the effects of the proposed itemized deduction cap. The effect of imposing a cap on the top tax rate is compared to past tax rate changes. The 1981 and 1986 legislation had larger percentage changes compared to the current proposal. Tax rate changes differ from caps on deductions due to an offsetting income effect. The 1986 Tax Reform Act maintained revenue yield and distribution across income classes despite deep tax cuts in the top rates. Rate changes in 1981 and 1986 also reduced marginal tax rates for a broad range of taxpayers. Contributions as a percentage of GDP remained stable after 1981, with a temporary peak in 1986 attributed to a rise in deductions. The 1986 peak in contributions is attributed to a timing shift due to tax cuts pre-announced for 1987 and 1988. Contributions returned to previous levels by 1989. Following the 1993 tax increase, contributions fell. Only 15.9% of charitable contributions would be affected by the itemized deduction cap, which impacts 1.4% of taxpayers. This suggests a minimal effect on charitable giving. According to the Tax Policy Center, 27.9% of individual charitable contributions on itemized returns fall within the two highest tax brackets. Some higher-income individuals may not be affected by the cap on charitable contributions due to the alternative minimum tax. There is already a limit on charitable contributions that is often exceeded by high-income donors. Charitable contribution deductions cannot exceed a certain percentage of income. The excess contributions from high-income donors are carried over to future years for deduction, but for very large donations, these deductions may never be fully utilized due to the time value of money. Wealthy donors who appear in estate tax data contribute about twice the amount of their deductions claimed over time. The relationship between contributions and deductions varies yearly, likely due to the significance of large one-time gifts. The percentage of giving over the limits for high-income donors was 27.6% in 1995 and 34% for the 1991-1995 panel. Adjustments were made based on the data to account for contributions not affected by tax changes. The overall excess of contributions over deductions for income classes of $200,000 and over was 18.7%. The highest income class is assumed to never deduct the excess, causing a loss of 5% of the value. The adjustment reduces the share of deductions affected in different income brackets. The estimate is adjusted for the share contributed by individuals who itemize. Contributions are also made by corporations, estates, and foundations. The price of charitable contributions for itemizers is (1-t), where t is the tax rate at which contributions are deducted. Tax prices for charitable contributions are affected by the individual's tax bracket and any matching-donation programs. The effects are calculated compared to different tax rate baselines and also consider proposed changes in capital gains tax rates. The value of donating appreciated property differs from cash donations as taxpayers can deduct the entire cost without paying capital gains tax. The price of charitable giving is affected by the capital gains tax rate and the share of value taxed as a gain. Elasticities are used to estimate the effect on aggregate contributions of changes in tax policy. The estimate of contributions to prices is based on elasticity, which can be price or income elasticities. Price elasticities greater than one indicate a price subsidy induces more giving than revenue loss, while less than one suggests other means like direct grants could increase charitable spending. Evidence on elasticities is drawn from tax data. The elasticity of contributions to prices is based on tax data, with most studies focusing on comparing individuals with different tax rates. Aggregate data on giving does not show a significant response to tax rate changes, whether general or directed at higher-income individuals. Individual giving as a share of output remained relatively stable over time, indicating a lack of evidence for significant changes in response to tax rate adjustments. Responses to tax changes and matching grants have been studied through laboratory field experiments. While there have been modest effects of matching grants on donations, the overall price elasticity was low at 0.3. One study found that announcing matching grants increased donations, but the size of the match did not matter much. Another study showed that a matching grant produced a smaller response compared to informing donors of a lead contribution already made. In a study on philanthropy and high-net-worth households, respondents showed relative inelasticity in charitable giving to changes in tax deductions. 52% would not reduce donations, 37% would somewhat decrease, and only 10% would dramatically decrease. Previous estimates suggested a more elastic response, but recent findings indicate otherwise. In a 1991 study, typical values for price elasticity were estimated at -1.27 and income elasticity at 0.78. Researchers faced challenges in separating income from price effects and dealing with timing of responses, especially in relation to tax rates. The tax legislation of the 1980s brought about significant tax cuts. The tax legislation of the 1980s included substantial tax cuts. In 1992, researchers at the Treasury Department presented a paper highlighting research shortcomings in predicting behavior. Using panels tracing the same taxpayers, they found errors in predicting charitable giving during the 1980s based on traditional approaches. For example, giving in the $1,000,000 and over income class fell by 12.6% instead of the predicted 36.8% in 1982. Contributions in the $200,000 to $1,000,000 class actually rose by 21% in 1982 despite predictions of a decrease. In 1982, contributions in the $200,000 to $1,000,000 income class rose by 33.2%, contradicting the predicted 21% fall. High-income groups saw a rise in giving in 1986, indicating a timing effect. Research shifted to panel studies to account for transitory price effects and high transitory price elasticities among sophisticated individuals. The panel studies show varying estimates of responsiveness to changes in tax rates on charitable giving. The central estimate suggests a slight decrease in giving in response to proposed changes. Concerns about the impact on charities during an economic downturn have been raised, but the proposed changes are not set to take effect until 2011. The deduction cap may not apply until 2011, leading to an increase in current giving as taxpayers anticipate higher costs in the future. Transitory price effects could result in higher giving if taxpayers donate now, especially if tax rates are expected to increase in 2011. The deduction cap may lead to an increase in current giving as taxpayers anticipate higher costs in the future. The price effect for taxpayers is 1.06 for the top rate taxpayer and 4.7% for the second-highest bracket. Contributions could fall by about 0.4% at a maximum elasticity of 0.5. There are income effects associated with the charitable giving deduction cap, but they are small since charitable contributions are typically less than 3% of a taxpayer's budget. The income elasticity for charitable contributions may vary, with estimates suggesting elasticities higher than price elasticities. Over time, aggregate individual contributions have remained relatively stable at around 1.5% of output. If income elasticity is less than one, a downward trend in contributions is expected, while an elasticity greater than one would result in an upward trend. For example, with income growing at 3% per year and an income elasticity of 0.5, contributions should have fallen from 1.61% in 1967 to 1.05% in 2007, but the actual ratio remained around 1.66%. The data presented for 1992 showed that charitable contributions as a percentage of income were relatively constant across different income classes, ranging from 4.4% for the lowest income class to 2.6% for the highest income class. This suggests a unitary elasticity of income, but other social factors may also play a role. Statistical studies show that income elasticities vary, with high-income individuals giving a small share to religious organizations. The Tax Policy Center estimates a 0.3% income gain for the top percentile, including the estate tax, while the entire population sees an average income gain of 3.5%. The overall income effect of tax changes would result in a 3.3% gain for the entire population, leading to a 2.46% increase in charitable giving. The top 1% is projected to experience a 5.3% decline in income due to changes in tax rates and deductions. Overall, the effect on charitable giving compared to current tax rates would be a reduction of less than 1%. The proposed tax changes are expected to result in a 1% increase in charitable giving compared to 2011 law. Different types of charities may be affected differently, with higher-income donors contributing more to health, education, art, and environmental organizations. The study analyzed the effects of proposed tax changes on charitable giving, showing that higher-income donors tend to contribute more to health, education, art, and environmental organizations. However, they give a small share of donations to charities benefiting the poor. The study estimated differential effects across different types of organizations based on data from high-net-worth philanthropy. High-income donors favor health, arts, education, and other organizations, leading to larger reductions in gifts for these recipients. Charitable bequests have been allowed since the enactment of the U.S. estate tax in 1916, making up 8% of all charitable giving. The estate tax deduction for charitable bequests reduces estate tax liability based on the dollar value of the bequest multiplied by the estate tax rate. The estate tax rate for charitable bequests has fluctuated over the years, impacting the value of deductions. Legislative proposals aim to revise these fluctuations. Unlike personal income tax, there is no cap on the deduction for charitable bequests, but distributional issues still exist. The estate tax deduction for charitable bequests is skewed towards higher wealth estates, with a historically high exemption and narrow base. The tax rate has decreased from 70% to 45% over the past quarter century. The impact of different estate tax regimes on charitable giving through bequests is examined, along with the effects of temporary changes and the estate tax on gifts during one's lifetime. The expected impact of a change in the estate tax on charities is also discussed. The estate tax has fluctuated considerably since 1916, with rates ranging from 10% to 77%. The tax price for charitable bequests is (1-t), where t is the tax rate deducted. The origin of the estate tax as a revenue source during times of crisis can be seen in spikes corresponding to World War I and World War II. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 marked a shift away from this original purpose. Since the Tax Reform Act of 1976, the top marginal estate tax rate has been consistently reduced, leading to a 139% increase in the tax price of charitable bequests. This has resulted in reduced incentives for charitable bequests in estate planning. Charitable bequests as a percentage of GDP show some evidence of shifting in response to tax changes, with estates possibly increasing charitable bequests prior to tax price increases brought about by reductions in the top marginal estate tax rate in 1981 and 2001. The estate tax rate changes have a less clear impact on bequests compared to personal income tax rate changes. Bequests as a percentage of GDP have remained relatively stable over time. To estimate the effect of estate tax changes on charitable giving, factors like affected bequest share, price change, price elasticity, and wealth elasticity are needed. Behavioral responses are expected from changes in estate tax rates or exemptions. The estate tax exemption may elicit behavioral responses, with estimates in this study focusing on changes in the estate tax rate. Approximately 53% to 85% of charitable bequests may be influenced by the estate tax, affecting 4% to 6.4% of total charitable contributions. The tax price of charitable bequests is determined by the estate tax rate, with the President's Budget Outline and FY2010 Senate Budget Resolution compared to current law. Elasticities measure the responsiveness of bequests to changes in the estate tax rate. The elasticity of charitable bequests is analyzed through tax or probate records, focusing on the second-to-die spouse. Historical data and high net worth household surveys provide evidence of the impact of estate taxes on charitable bequests, showing a relatively elastic behavioral response to changes in the estate tax rate. In a recent study on high net worth households' philanthropy, it was found that a repeal of the estate tax would not significantly reduce charitable donations. Despite an 82% increase in the tax price of charitable bequests, only a small percentage of respondents indicated they would decrease their donations. This suggests a relatively inelastic behavioral response to changes in the estate tax. More sophisticated empirical evidence is needed to further understand this phenomenon. Studies analyze estate tax responses using probate records or estate tax returns to determine tax price through rate schedules. Estate behavior cannot be tracked over time. Results show varying effects on charitable contributions based on different price elasticities. Repealing the estate tax may reduce contributions by over 7.2%, while reverting to 2001 law could increase donations by nearly 1.6%. Low elasticity estimates align better with historical trends. The low elasticity estimate in Figure 5 suggests a reduction of nearly 4% in total charitable contributions from a repeal of the estate tax, an increase of almost 1% from reverting to 2001 estate tax law, and a decrease of nearly 1% from adopting the provision in the Senate Budget Resolution. Uncertainty surrounding the timing of death and the temporary nature of the estate repeal could lead to changes in charitable bequests. Changes in the estate tax impact charitable giving through an effect on lifetime giving. Lifetime charitable giving is relatively inelastic to changes in the estate tax rate. A permanent repeal of the estate tax could decrease lifetime charitable contributions by 5.7%, while reverting to the 2001 estate tax law would increase contributions by 1.3%. Following the Senate Budget Resolution would decrease contributions by 1.3%. Changes in the estate tax also affect after-tax bequeathable wealth. The elasticity of charitable bequests with respect to wealth is estimated using multiple information types. Charitable bequests as a percentage of GDP suggest a wealth elasticity of near unity. Statistical studies vary widely in estimating the wealth elasticity for charitable bequests. Other social factors may also influence the observed wealth elasticity. Studies on the elasticity of charitable bequests with respect to wealth show varying estimates, with some suggesting that the price effect dominates over the wealth effect. Repealing the estate tax could reduce total charitable contributions by nearly 4%, while reverting to 2001 law may increase charitable giving by close to 1%. The provision in the Senate Budget Resolution would decrease charitable giving by nearly 1%, while evaluating alternatives at a lower price elasticity shows effects closer to 0. Higher-income donors contribute more to certain categories of charities, such as health and education, compared to religious or basic needs organizations. Charitable bequests to foundations receive a greater share, with education also rising in percentage terms. Charitable bequests to foundations may delay actual charitable spending changes, as foundations tend to retain assets for future spending. The timing and distribution of contributions to foundations are difficult to determine, but they are likely to be devoted to similar purposes as high-income individuals' lifetime giving. Charitable bequests to foundations may delay actual charitable spending changes, as foundations tend to retain assets for future spending. The initial share of bequests is one factor affecting policy changes on different types of charities, with varying elasticities for each charity. Bequests to arts and social welfare organizations are less responsive to tax price changes, while those to education, medical, and religious organizations are more responsive. Government subsidies for charitable contributions are justified due to the undersupply of public goods in a market economy. The argument for limiting itemized deductions, like those for charitable giving, is based on differential subsidies due to varying tax rates. If price elasticity is less than one, the government loses more revenue than charities gain in donations, leading to inefficiency. Alternative policy options include finding different revenue sources, like limiting deductions or raising revenue from higher-income taxpayers. One approach to address concerns about the deduction cap is to exclude charitable deductions from it. One option to address concerns about the deduction cap is to exclude charitable contributions from it. Charitable contributions make up a significant portion of itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers, with about a quarter of revenue projected from the cap coming from these donations. Another revenue-raising alternative is to impose a floor or ceiling on deductions, limiting the amount that can be taken based on a percentage of income or a set amount. Ceilings already exist for certain types of deductions, such as mortgage interest. A floor on charitable deductions could preserve incentive effects for contributions. Statistics show most contributions are made by taxpayers who donate at least 1% of income. Excluding charitable deductions from the overall cap on itemized deductions could cost about $7 billion annually. A 2% floor on charitable deductions could raise about $25 billion. Another option is to impose a floor under higher tax rates for charitable contributions. One option to raise revenue from higher-income taxpayers is to impose a general cap on itemized deductions, excluding charitable contributions. Alternatively, increasing top income rates or adding a surcharge could achieve the same goal. Other provisions to raise revenue from high-income individuals include increasing tax rates on dividends and capital gains, as well as returning to pre-2001 estate tax treatment. These measures could impact charitable giving but may be necessary to generate revenue. The proposed cap on itemized deductions may have minimal impact on charitable giving, with estimates showing a decrease of less than 1% or 2%. Incorporating income effects could even increase charitable giving. The retention of current estate tax rates could also affect charitable giving, potentially increasing it compared to the elimination of the tax scheduled for 2010. The effects of the cap on itemized deductions and changes in bequests may impact certain types of charities. Appendix A presents evidence on elasticities for charitable giving, with results from six studies analyzing the effects of price and income changes. Some studies critique others and provide sensitivity analysis. Results without statistical significance indicate a lack of clear causal effect. The studies on charitable giving and tax rates show no clear causal effect, with small values close to zero. Tax return data is restricted to certain researchers, limiting replication and sensitivity analysis. Three studies used taxpayer data with Treasury employees as authors. The studies on charitable giving and tax rates show no clear causal effect, with small values close to zero. Tax return data is restricted to certain researchers, limiting replication and sensitivity analysis. Three studies used taxpayer data with Treasury employees as authors. The studies listed report multiple results using different specifications, attempting to present the preferred results. Bakija and McClelland also estimated a standard pooled cross section estimate, showing typical results of past cross section studies. In cross section studies, price elasticity is -1.22 and income elasticity is 0.84. Transitory price effects are large while transitory income effects are small. Permanent price elasticity and income elasticity are expected to be lower and higher, respectively, than observed in cross section studies. Only two studies found these results, with one focusing on transitory effects using a 10-year panel. The study by Randolph on tax rates found that permanent price elasticity was small, transitory price elasticity was large, income elasticity was around one, and there were variations in price elasticity based on the share of giving. The study by Bakija (2000) replicates Randolph's results with public use data, finding a smaller transitory income elasticity and insignificant price elasticity. Bakija suggests using a different weight for the model and argues for an aggregate elasticity measure over the full sample. He also finds no evidence of a permanent price response in his replications. Barrett et al. focus on estimating transitory effects based on deviations in income over time, allowing for intertemporal shifting variation and rapid adjustment. Their study includes individual fixed effects to control for heterogeneity and finds a lower price elasticity but a small income elasticity. They do not include tax rate changes after 1986 in their panel, which is an important exogenous source of variation. The study by Barrett et al. focuses on estimating transitory effects using individual fixed effects to control for heterogeneity. They find a lower price elasticity and a small income elasticity. Auten et al. also use fixed effects and limited intertemporal substitutions, but they do not address changes in tax law, which could affect the results. In 1989, Bakija and McClelland reestimated their model using public data and found a lower elasticity. Bakija contrasts his model with Randolph's by using legislated tax rate changes to determine the transitory component of taxes. They focus on expected tax changes, introduce adjustment lags, and use a panel approach with fixed effects for tax data analysis. Their analysis includes attention to expectations of tax changes and shorter substitution periods. The price elasticity is determined through tax changes and different responses across taxpayers with varying tax rates. Estimates vary based on handling fixed time effects, especially for higher-income individuals. It is challenging to select a central elasticity due to imperfections in studies. Excluding high elasticities, the range of estimates is considered. The price elasticity is determined through tax changes and different responses across taxpayers with varying tax rates. Estimates vary based on handling fixed time effects, especially for higher-income individuals. A central elasticity of 0.5 is used, with income elasticities likely biased upwards. The estimation methodology involves measuring the ratio of charitable giving share for each type of charity to the total share. The study analyzed the impact of tax changes on charitable giving, using a central price elasticity of 0.5. The allocation of shares was based on taxpayers with $1 million or more, with 89% of the allocation coming from this group. The methodology assumed uniform price elasticities for different types of giving. Income effects were incorporated using data on the top 1% and overall income effects, adjusted for the estate tax. The study analyzed the effects of tax changes on charitable giving, using a price elasticity of 0.5. Allocation of shares was based on taxpayers with $1 million or more, with 89% coming from this group. Income effects were incorporated using data on the top 1% and overall income effects, adjusted for the estate tax. The comparison with current tax rules showed a 5.3% decrease in income for the top 1% and a 1.1% increase for the remaining 99%. Comparing to 2011 law, there was a 0.1% increase in income for the top 1% and a 4.4% increase for the remaining 99%. The weighted income effect was calculated based on the share of income in the high-income category and contributions from individuals. The studies on charitable bequests' price and wealth elasticities show diverse estimates, but generally, the price elasticity dominates. Charitable bequests are found to respond elastically to changes in the tax price, except for a study focusing on the exemption level."
