    "content": "The joint federal-state Unemployment Compensation (UC) program, established in 1935, provides benefits to eligible individuals who are involuntarily unemployed. State laws determine specific parameters, resulting in 53 different UC programs overseen by the U.S. Department of Labor. The main objectives are to offer income maintenance, stabilize the economy, and prevent skill loss during periods of high unemployment. The UC program aims to provide benefits to involuntarily unemployed individuals, with states having the option to disqualify those who lost their job due to illegal drug use. Recent congressional interest includes prohibiting individuals engaged in unlawful drug use from receiving UC benefits, with states given the option to require drug testing for applicants under specific circumstances. A new rule was finalized on October 4, 2019, listing occupations that regularly require drug testing. The new final rule, effective November 4, 2019, allows states to drug test UC applicants in specific occupations. This policy aligns with state interest in drug testing individuals receiving public assistance benefits and congressional focus on UC program integrity. The period from 2011 to 2015 saw Congress passing laws to decrease UC benefit overpayments and impose new restrictions on UC eligibility, including drug testing as a measure to ensure benefits are not given to individuals involved in illegal drug use. This report discusses issues related to UC benefits and drug testing, recent developments in expanding drug testing under state and federal laws, and policy considerations. The report discusses issues related to UC benefits and drug testing, including eligibility criteria and disqualifications for claimants. State UC programs determine monetary and nonmonetary eligibility for unemployment benefits based on an individual's earnings history and other related characteristics. Ineligible individuals are prohibited from receiving benefits until the basis for ineligibility no longer exists. UC eligibility is assessed weekly, and individuals may be disqualified from receiving benefits until they requalify by serving a disqualification period or finding new employment. Disqualified individuals may have their benefits reduced or wage credits cancelled. States may disqualify individuals from receiving unemployment benefits if they lost their jobs due to illegal drug use, which is considered misconduct connected with work. 20 states have specific laws addressing disqualifying circumstances related to alcohol and drug misuse, including failing a drug test. The Department of Labor requires states to base unemployment benefit entitlement solely on factors related to the individual's unemployment status, with exceptions for drug use. Recent federal legislative and regulatory developments have expanded states' authority to drug test UC applicants and beneficiaries. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 amended federal law to allow states to conduct two types of drug testing, including testing applicants discharged for unlawful drug use. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 amended federal law to allow states to drug test UC applicants for unlawful drug use and those in occupations that regularly conduct drug testing. The Department of Labor issued guidance on disqualifying UC applicants discharged for illegal drug use, allowing states to deny benefits in such cases. DOL implemented regulations for drug testing of UC applicants under P.L. 112-96 on August 1, 2016. The Department of Labor implemented regulations for drug testing of UC applicants under P.L. 112-96, limiting states' ability to test individuals only available for work in occupations that regularly conduct drug testing. The 2016 DOL rule on drug testing for UC applicants raised concerns among stakeholders, with some advocating for more flexibility for states in implementing drug testing. The DOL rule was criticized for being too narrow in its interpretation, leading to policymakers using the Congressional Review Act to overturn it. Policymakers used the Congressional Review Act to overturn a 2016 DOL rule on drug testing for UC applicants. Representative Kevin Brady introduced H.J.Res. 42 to nullify the rule, which was passed by both the House and Senate and signed into law by President Trump. The rule's removal from the Code of Federal Regulations limited states' ability to drug test UC claimants based on occupation. Members in the Congressional Record provided justifications for their support or opposition to the measure. Representative Kevin Brady supported the measure, arguing that the final regulation restricted states' discretion in implementing drug testing programs for UC claimants. Representative Richard E. Neal opposed the measure, stating there was no evidence that unemployed workers have higher rates of drug abuse. Senator Cruz also expressed support for the measure in the Congressional Record. Senator Cruz supported bill H.J.Res. 42, arguing that the Obama Department of Labor's narrow interpretation of the 2012 job creation act undermined congressional intent and restricted states' flexibility in implementing drug testing programs. He criticized the regulation for removing state discretion and ignoring bipartisan congressional concerns. On November 5, 2018, the DOL published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reissue the rule on drug testing. The DOL reissued a new final rule on drug testing for certain occupations on October 4, 2019, following the repeal of the 2016 regulation. The new rule must comply with the reissue requirements of the CRA, which prohibits reissuing a rule in substantially the same form. The DOL asserts that the new rule offers a more flexible approach than the previous one, allowing states to mandate drug testing for a wider range of occupations. The 2019 DOL reissued final rule on drug testing for certain occupations offers more flexibility than the 2016 Rule, allowing states to require drug testing for a larger group of UC applicants. It includes additional types of occupations identified by state laws and those with a factual basis for drug testing. The 2019 DOL reissued final rule on drug testing for certain occupations expands the types of occupations for which states can require drug testing for UC applicants. The list of occupations was developed in consultation with federal agencies with expertise in drug testing. The 2019 DOL reissued final rule on drug testing for certain occupations provides flexibility for states to impose drug testing on UC applicants based on their specific economies and practices, taking into account the diversity of state laws and employer practices. Stakeholders have presented arguments both for and against expanded UC drug testing. The discussion includes arguments for and against expanded UC drug testing, administrative issues, and alternative approaches considered by recent Congresses. This provides context for the proposed 2018 UC drug testing rule and potential legislation for drug testing UC applicants and beneficiaries. The discussion includes arguments for and against expanded UC drug testing, administrative issues, and alternative approaches considered by recent Congresses. Proponents argue that drug testing is necessary for program integrity and job readiness. The Office of Management and Budget has identified UC as a high-error program with significant improper payments, making expanded drug testing a potential program integrity measure. Expanded UC drug testing is seen as a program integrity measure to prevent benefits from going to individuals involved in illegal drug use, hindering their job prospects. Supporters argue that drug testing promotes job readiness by verifying claimants' ability and availability to work, aligning with federal eligibility requirements. Representative Kevin Brady has supported this view. Representative Kevin Brady argues that individuals who fail drug tests are not eligible for unemployment payments, as they are not fully able to work or available for new job opportunities. This aligns with the view that drug testing promotes job readiness and program integrity in preventing benefits from going to those involved in illegal drug use. Supporters of expanded unemployment compensation (UC) drug testing argue that drug testing is essential for job readiness and program integrity. They believe that individuals who fail drug tests should not be eligible for UC payments, as they may not be fully able to work or available for new job opportunities. Additionally, they advocate for states to have the option to drug test UC claimants to ensure eligibility and administration. Opponents of expanded unemployment compensation (UC) drug testing raise concerns about increased administrative costs, conflicts with program goals, and potential legal issues. Some organizations cite the added costs of drug testing, which could strain UC administrative funding without additional support. Some stakeholders are concerned about the financial burden on state UC programs for drug testing without extra funding. Michigan Employment Lawyers Association argues that states lack adequate funding to efficiently run their UI programs due to low administrative funding. They claim that states cannot afford additional administrative burdens, especially for drug testing, as they are already struggling with reduced federal funding. Opponents of expanded UC drug testing also argue that it is costly and does not serve program goals. Opponents of expanded UC drug testing argue that it may undermine the fundamental goals of the program, such as providing timely income replacement to those who lost their job through no fault of their own. They claim that drug testing does not address any policy problem and could create barriers for eligible individuals to receive UC benefits. Stakeholders express concerns about the lack of evidence showing higher rates of drug abuse among unemployed workers and the additional barrier drug testing would pose for UI applicants. Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Danny K. Davis also raised similar concerns in their comments on the 2018 proposed rule. Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Danny K. Davis criticized the 2019 final rule on UC drug testing, stating that UI recipiency is at a record low, many states have reduced UI benefits, and over half of states have insufficient UI trust fund balances. They argue that the Department of Labor should focus on protecting workers and addressing these challenges before the next recession, rather than proposing regulations that could limit access to benefits. Stakeholders have legal concerns about the rule, including potential violations of the Fourth Amendment and improper delegation of authority to states. Some argue that the rule delegates authority to states for drug testing occupations. Congress amended the Social Security Act in 2012 to allow testing for certain groups. DOL issued regulations for states to implement drug testing programs. Constitutional considerations may affect government-mandated drug testing programs. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable government searches and seizures, extending to state and local actions through the Fourteenth Amendment. Constitutional considerations may impact government-mandated drug testing programs. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable government searches and seizures, including government-administered drug tests. The constitutionality of a law requiring drug testing for UC eligibility depends on the reasonableness of the test under the circumstances, which typically requires individualized suspicion or a court-issued warrant based on probable cause. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable government searches and seizures, including government-administered drug tests. A warrant is not always essential for a search to be reasonable, especially for noncriminal, administrative searches where a reasonable suspicion standard is used instead of probable cause. This standard requires considering the \"totality of the circumstances\" to determine the reasonableness of the search. The Fourth Amendment requires a \"particularized and objective basis\" for a search beyond a mere hunch. Individualized suspicion is generally needed for a search to be reasonable, but exceptions exist for minor intrusions furthering an important government interest. Special needs can justify searches without individualized suspicion when the government's needs outweigh privacy concerns. The Court has recognized two categories of \"special needs\" substantial enough to justify suspicionless drug testing: in the employment context, where individuals perform activities involving matters of public safety, and the public school setting, involving children in the government's care. Courts determine the reasonableness of suspicionless drug tests by balancing the interests of the government and private individuals subject to the search. The Court has assessed the constitutionality of governmental drug testing programs in various contexts, including employment and public school settings. The reasonableness of suspicionless drug tests is determined by balancing the interests of the government and private individuals subject to the search. Lower court cases have successfully challenged state laws that required mandatory, suspicionless drug testing for receiving welfare benefits on Fourth Amendment grounds. The Court has assessed the constitutionality of governmental drug testing programs in various contexts, including employment and public school settings. In Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association, the Court upheld Federal Railroad Administration regulations for drug testing railroad workers involved in accidents, citing \"special needs\" for safety. The Court upheld suspicionless drug testing of U.S. Customs Service personnel seeking transfer or promotion to sensitive positions in National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab. Covered employees had diminished privacy expectations due to job duties, and testing procedures were minimally invasive. The Court upheld suspicionless drug testing for U.S. Customs Service personnel in sensitive positions, citing advanced notice, limited testing for specified drugs, privacy during sample collection, and accuracy. In contrast, the Court struck down a Georgia law requiring drug testing for certain elective office candidates due to lack of suspicion and historical drug abuse evidence. The Chandler Court emphasized that suspicionless drug testing for elective office candidates was not necessary due to the intense public scrutiny they already face. The law did not effectively detect or deter drug abuse, as candidates could easily comply by temporarily abstaining. Such testing must be linked to public safety concerns to override privacy interests. The Chandler Court ruled that suspicionless drug testing is unconstitutional without a special need grounded in public safety. The Marchwinski court affirmed this, stating that mandatory drug testing for TANF applicants lacked a valid public safety justification. The court granted a preliminary injunction in a case regarding suspicionless drug testing for TANF recipients, stating it lacked a valid public safety justification. The state agreed to halt the testing following the court's decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed that Florida's mandatory drug testing law for TANF beneficiaries was unconstitutional. The state failed to show a substantial need for suspicionless searches and the program was not effective in identifying or deterring drug use that could impact employability or public funds. The state did not appeal the decision. The Fourth Amendment's compliance with drug testing programs depends on the program's purpose and scope. Supreme Court precedent suggests that drug testing programs unrelated to law enforcement, only allowing testing based on reasonable suspicion, are more likely to comply. Governmental drug tests without suspicion must serve \"special needs\" that outweigh privacy interests. The Court has recognized two contexts justifying suspicionless drug tests: occupations involving public safety concerns and public schools. The Supreme Court suggests that suspicionless drug testing programs may be justified in occupations involving public safety concerns and public schools. Programs that maintain confidentiality, are not for law enforcement purposes, and minimally impact individuals are more likely to be considered reasonable. Conversely, programs that share results with law enforcement or significantly affect an individual's life may not be deemed reasonable. The constitutionality of a UC drug testing program will likely depend on how it is structured, with consideration for individualized suspicion and \"special needs\" analysis for different categories of UC applicants. The potential impact on an individual's life and the program's confidentiality are key factors in determining reasonableness. The constitutionality of a UC drug testing program depends on how it is structured, considering individualized suspicion and special needs analysis for different categories of UC applicants. Factors like the impact on an individual's life and program confidentiality are crucial in determining reasonableness. The reasons for an individual falling into the \"previously terminated\" category could affect a reasonable suspicion analysis, with evidence of termination related to drug use being more compelling. A termination based on drug test results may be influenced by the test's reliability, procedures followed, and time lapse between termination and test. A court might consider a longer time lapse less likely to uncover drug use. Special needs analysis could be relevant for mandatory drug testing of UC applicants. The strength of a special needs legal defense for suspicionless drug testing of UC applicants in \"regularly tested occupations\" depends on how states define this group. There are differences between applicants tested by UC administrators and employees tested by employers for safety-sensitive roles. It is unclear if these distinctions would be considered constitutionally significant by a reviewing court. This section analyzes factors related to state definitions of \"regularly tested occupations.\" The Supreme Court has cautioned against suspicionless searches in the absence of public safety concerns. States would likely need to define \"regularly tested occupations\" to include only those involving public safety. The DOL's 2019 regulation aligns with occupations upheld under special needs precedent. The regulations align with occupations upheld under special needs precedent, including those requiring carrying a firearm and subject to federal drug testing. States can also test for occupations where employers conduct drug testing as a standard requirement. This may not always align with Fourth Amendment precedent as it only applies to governmental actions. Private employers can conduct suspicionless drug tests without Fourth Amendment constraints, but state programs mandating drug tests for UC applicants in non-safety-sensitive occupations may violate Fourth Amendment rights. State programs mandating drug tests for UC applicants in non-safety-sensitive occupations could potentially raise Fourth Amendment concerns, even if limited to individuals in public safety roles. Unlike previous cases, UC beneficiaries are not actively employed in public safety positions, which could lead a reviewing court to view UC drug testing programs differently from TANF programs. A reviewing court may view a UC drug testing program as more similar to TANF programs than to those upheld in Skinner and Von Raab, as the underlying purpose is to promote work and conserve resources rather than public safety. Factors to consider include the prevalence of drug use among UC applicants, the effectiveness of the testing program, and procedural fairness. The drug testing program aims to detect and prevent illicit drug use, ensuring trained personnel conduct tests, protecting samples from contamination, maintaining accurate results, and safeguarding personal information. Sharing drug test results beyond the program may raise privacy concerns, especially if shared with law enforcement. Section 303( l )(1)(A)(ii) of the Social Security Act allows states to implement drug testing for UC applicants in specific occupations. The Department of Labor's 2019 regulations identify occupations for drug testing, including aviation and motor carrier roles. States can also determine occupations requiring drug testing based on state laws or employer practices. Some argue that state involvement in determining these occupations raises questions about DOL's role. Some argue that the Department of Labor is improperly delegating authority to states in determining occupations for drug testing, contrary to Congress's mandate. This subdelegation without clear guidance may violate statutory directives. In a case involving the Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit highlighted concerns about subdelegations to outside parties, stating that it can blur lines of accountability and increase the risk of pursuing inconsistent policy goals. While generally prohibited, outside party input is allowed in certain situations, such as when it is a condition for federal approval, providing factual information, or offering advice. In Fund for Animals v. Kempthorne, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's authority to issue an order allowing state agencies to kill certain migratory birds without a permit to prevent wildlife depredations. The plaintiffs, individuals and environmental organizations, challenged the order, arguing that only the FWS could authorize such killings. The Second Circuit upheld the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's depredation order, stating it was a \"grant of permission\" conditioned on state agency determination. The order incorporated local concerns and did not delegate authority. This decision could be compared to the role of states in identifying occupations for drug testing. The Department of Labor (DOL) may condition drug testing of unemployment compensation applicants on state identification of relevant occupations. Legal challenges to the regulations are possible, with opponents arguing against state delegation without explicit authorization from Congress, while proponents see it as allowing states to set conditions for drug testing under P.L. 112-96. States must establish drug testing programs for individuals applying for UC benefits under P.L. 112-96 and the newly reissued final DOL rule. Three states have already enacted laws for drug testing (Mississippi, Texas, and Wisconsin). States may also need to consider funding drug treatment services for UC claimants. DOL guidance allows states to contract with entities to conduct drug tests meeting federal standards. Funding for DOL-approved drug testing programs for UC applicants would come from state administrative grants, not from the claimants. Administrative costs for state UC programs are covered by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA). In FY2018, $6.3 billion was collected in federal FUTA taxes, while $37.1 billion was collected in State Unemployment Tax Acts (SUTA) taxes to finance UC benefits. Some opponents of expanded UC drug testing are concerned about the adequacy of FUTA revenue for this new administrative function. Three states have enacted laws for UC drug testing under P.L. 112-96. Three states have enacted laws for UC drug testing under P.L. 112-96, but implementation is pending final DOL rule. Wisconsin has a program addressing barriers of illicit drug use for claimants failing pre-employment drug tests. Claimants may attend drug treatment program and skills assessment if they fail without valid prescription. The Wisconsin UC program offers claimants who fail pre-employment drug tests the option to undergo drug treatment and complete a skills assessment to continue collecting benefits. Referrals and instructions are provided for assessment and treatment. A $500,000 budget funds a statewide substance abuse program within the UC program, as no specific funding streams exist for drug treatment services. Federal law limits the use of SUTA funds for such programs. The federal law limits the use of SUTA funds for drug treatment services within the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF). States can use funding from non-FUTA or non-SUTA sources for this purpose, such as additional taxes collected for administrative purposes like job training or technology improvements. In 2019, 30 states had additional taxes for administrative purposes, but none specifically for funding drug treatment services. Legislation has proposed various approaches to drug testing UC applicants and beneficiaries, including a new federal requirement for drug testing. This differs from allowing states to expand UC drug testing. For example, H.R. 2001 (112th Congress) aimed to create a new federal requirement for drug testing individuals. H.R. 2001 (112th Congress) and H.R. 1172 (113th Congress) proposed federal requirements to deem individuals ineligible for UC benefits due to employment-related drug or alcohol offenses. This would include those discharged for drug or alcohol use, possession of controlled substances at work, refusal of drug tests, or testing positive for illegal substances. States would need to amend their UC laws to comply with these proposals. The Accountability in Unemployment Act proposed federal requirements for drug testing UC claimants. Individuals testing positive would need to retake the test after 30 days and test negative to be eligible for benefits. A risk assessment tool was also suggested for screening UC applicants and beneficiaries for drug testing. The EQUIP Act proposed federal requirements for drug testing UC claimants based on a risk assessment tool to screen for substance abuse. Individuals deemed high risk would need to test negative for controlled substances within one week to qualify for benefits. The EQUIP Act proposed federal requirements for drug testing UC claimants based on a risk assessment tool to screen for substance abuse. Three states, Mississippi, Texas, and Wisconsin, have enacted laws allowing drug testing for UC eligibility. In Texas and Wisconsin, drug testing is required for individuals seeking unemployment benefits in occupations that regularly conduct pre-employment drug testing. Acceptable proof of a negative drug test can end the disqualification period early. Wisconsin state law mandates drug testing for certain occupations to determine eligibility for unemployment benefits."
