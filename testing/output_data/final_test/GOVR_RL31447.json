    "content": "The federal government acquired 1.8 billion acres of land through purchases, treaties, and agreements during the formation of the United States. Congress reserved increasing acreage for national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 changed the policy to retain remaining lands. The early national forests were managed for conservation, but the need to preserve some areas in a natural state was recognized, leading to the creation of the first wilderness area in the Gila National Forest. The Wilderness Act of 1964 was enacted in response to public concerns about the permanence of the Forest Service's wilderness designations. It described the attributes of wilderness, prohibited certain activities, and reserved the authority to designate areas as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Wilderness Act of 1964 reserved the authority to designate areas as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Act directed the review of wilderness potential in various public lands, with recommendations to be made to the President and Congress within specific timeframes. The Wilderness Act of 1964 directed the review of wilderness potential in public lands, leading to the expansion of the Wilderness System by the 90th Congress in 1968. Subsequent Congresses continued to designate more wilderness areas, with the largest designation of 56.4 million acres through the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act during the 96th Congress. The 98th Congress also enacted significant wilderness laws, designating 8.5 million acres in 21 states. The Wilderness System has grown since its creation, with over 100 laws designating new wilderness areas. The 114th Congress added three new wilderness areas, bringing the total to 765 areas covering 109.9 million acres. Federal land-management agencies are studying additional lands for potential inclusion in the Wilderness System. The Wilderness Act defines wilderness as an area of undisturbed federal land where man's influence is minimal, and natural conditions are preserved. Data on lands recommended for wilderness designation are lacking, but federal agencies are studying more areas for potential inclusion in the Wilderness System. The Wilderness Act defines wilderness as an area of undisturbed federal land with minimal human influence, preserved natural conditions, and opportunities for solitude or recreation. The criteria for designating wilderness areas are vague, with no specific guidelines, allowing for flexibility in size and features. Smaller areas can also be designated if they can be protected, with the smallest wilderness area being only 2 acres. The Wilderness Act defines wilderness as undisturbed federal land with minimal human influence, preserved natural conditions, and opportunities for solitude or recreation. Criteria for designating wilderness areas are vague, with differing perceptions of what constitutes wilderness. Some see it as an area with no human presence, while others consider camping in a national park as a wilderness experience. The Act also identifies the purposes of wilderness, aiming to create lands for the use and enjoyment of the American people while leaving them unimpaired for future use. The Wilderness Act aims to preserve federal land for the enjoyment of the American people while maintaining its wilderness character. There are differing views on what constitutes wilderness and how it should be managed, leading to exemptions and delayed restrictions for certain uses in wilderness areas. Congress has also allowed additional exemptions for specific activities in designated wilderness areas to accommodate conflicting demands. The Wilderness Act and subsequent wilderness laws designate wilderness areas within federal land units, with unique management guidance. Congress determines what constitutes wilderness, despite potential conflicts with the act's definition. Management provisions apply to designated areas, with restrictions on activities like hunting.

Congress determines what constitutes wilderness, despite potential conflicts with the act's definition. Management provisions apply to designated areas, with restrictions on activities like hunting. State jurisdiction over fish and wildlife is not affected by wilderness designations. Wilderness statutes often specify that state jurisdiction is preserved, while allowing other agencies to continue their specific authorities and activities. Different directions are provided regarding federal reserved water rights, with some statutes expressly reserving or denying claims to federal water rights. State law typically dictates regulation of water allocation and use in designated wilderness areas. The Wilderness Act allows for the acquisition of land within designated wilderness areas, known as inholdings, through donation or exchange for other federal land. Congress has also passed wilderness statutes that include intended or potential wilderness areas within or adjacent to designated wilderness areas, which will become wilderness once certain conditions are met. Buffer zones around wilderness areas are not addressed in the Wilderness Act, but subsequent wilderness bills have prohibited buffer zones that would restrict activities on federal lands surrounding wilderness areas.

Congress has also passed wilderness statutes that include intended or potential wilderness areas within or adjacent to designated wilderness areas, which will become wilderness once certain conditions are met. Wilderness Study, Review, and Release involve reviewing the wilderness potential of certain lands and presenting recommendations to the President and Congress. Release language provides direction on managing areas not designated as wilderness until the next review. The Wilderness Act allows for continued uses in designated wilderness areas, such as livestock grazing, if established prior to designation. Congress has provided guidance on continuing livestock grazing at historic levels in wilderness areas. The Wilderness Act extended mining and mineral leasing laws for wilderness areas in national forests until 1983. After 1984, specified national forest wilderness areas were withdrawn from all forms of mining laws, with some areas allowing continued mineral development and extraction. The Wilderness Act prohibits commercial activities, motorized uses, and structures in designated wilderness areas, with exceptions for administration and emergencies. The Wilderness Act prohibits most businesses and commercial resource development in designated wilderness areas, with exceptions for activities that serve recreational or wilderness purposes. Motorized or mechanized equipment is also prohibited, except in emergencies. Human infrastructure like roads, buildings, dams, and pipelines is not allowed in wilderness areas. Many wilderness statutes have provisions for addressing existing infrastructure and may restrict public access to certain areas. Many wilderness statutes allow nonconforming uses and conditions, such as motorized access for management needs, emergencies, and existing activities. Motorized access for water and other infrastructure is also permitted in some cases. Access for various activities in wilderness areas has been permitted by several statutes, including motorized access for state agencies, low-level military overflights, minerals activities, access to cemeteries, and tribal activities. Congress has directed land-management agencies to review wilderness potential and make recommendations for wilderness designation, with some lands designated as wilderness and others released from consideration. Some recommendations are still pending. The Wilderness Act directed the Secretary of Agriculture to review wilderness potential of areas identified by the Forest Service and make recommendations by 1974. The Forest Service expanded its review to include new areas under the Roadless Area Review and Evaluation (RARE) conducted under NEPA. The Forest Service conducted a review of national forest roadless areas in 1977 (RARE II) to comply with environmental laws. The final environmental impact statement recommended adding over 15 million acres to the Wilderness System, studying 11 million acres further, and allowing other uses on 36 million acres. In 1980, California successfully challenged Forest Service recommendations for non-wilderness uses in 44 areas, leading to a reevaluation of all RARE II recommendations by the Reagan Administration in 1983. This sparked intense debates during the 98th Congress, resulting in the enactment of statewide wilderness laws with release language for some lands. The completion of RARE II and subsequent enactment of bills designating national forest wilderness areas has not ended the debate. The Forest Service has other directives to consider the wilderness values of national forest lands. The Clinton Administration developed regulations to protect inventoried roadless areas, keeping them free from most development with the Roadless Rule. Despite legal challenges, the courts upheld the Clinton Administration's rule. The Clinton Administration's Roadless Rule prohibits road construction, reconstruction, and timber harvesting in most inventoried roadless areas within the National Forest System. Congress directed BLM to inventory roadless areas over 5,000 acres and recommend suitability for wilderness designation to the President by 1991. Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton submitted wilderness recommendations to Congress based on BLM's inventory. BLM must protect wilderness study areas until Congress releases them from that responsibility. This obligation is known as a non-impairment standard. The non-impairment obligation, also known as a non-impairment standard, applies to wilderness study areas (WSAs) and has been the subject of litigation challenging BLM's protection efforts. In Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the non-impairment obligation was not enforceable through court challenge, as it was considered a broad programmatic duty rather than a discrete agency obligation. The relevant FLPMA land use plans, which indicated that WSAs would be monitored, were seen as management goals that could be modified by agency priorities and funding availability, and were not enforceable under the Administrative Procedure Act. Despite this, BLM actions that could harm WSAs could still be enjoined through agency enforcement obligations. BLM's obligation under FLPMA Section 201 to identify resources on its lands, prioritize critical areas, and review lands for wilderness potential is unclear. Unlike the Forest Service, BLM is not required to revise its land management plans on a set schedule but must do so \"when appropriate.\" While NFMA includes wilderness in planning, FLPMA is silent on wilderness in its definitions and guidance for BLM planning. The BLM's policy on wilderness potential has been uncertain, with changes in administration affecting how areas with wilderness potential are managed. In 2003, a settlement led to guidance limiting wilderness study areas to those designated in the 1970s and 1980s, with no general legal authority for new designations. The BLM designated lands as WSAs for management under the non-impairment standard. In 2010, DOI secretary Ken Salazar issued Order No. 3310, known as the Wild Lands Policy, which addressed wilderness management. This order indirectly modified the 2003 wilderness guidance without overturning it, designating lands with wilderness characteristics as \"Wild Lands\" and directing BLM to consider these characteristics in land use plans and project decisions. Memorandum 2003-274 stated that the non-impairment standard did not apply except for existing Section 603 WSAs. Order No. 3310 required a decision on impairment in Section 201 wilderness areas, with avoidance of impairment otherwise. Secretary Salazar revoked the order in 2011, halting wild lands designation. Congress has since withheld funding despite the revocation. Wilderness acreage estimates in Table 2 are based on Congress-designated areas, with ongoing reviews for potential additions to the National Wilderness Preservation System. As of April 15, 2016, Congress has designated 109.9 million acres of federal land in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Wilderness areas have been designated in 44 states plus Puerto Rico, with Alaska having the majority of wilderness land. California also has a significant amount of wilderness areas. The National Wilderness Preservation System has 109.9 million acres of federal land designated as wilderness. California has 15.0 million acres of wilderness, while Washington has the largest percentage of federal land designated as wilderness at 38%. NPS manages 43.9 million acres, FS manages 36.6 million acres, FWS manages 20.7 million acres, and BLM manages 8.7 million acres of wilderness."
