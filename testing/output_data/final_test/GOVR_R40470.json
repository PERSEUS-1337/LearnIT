    "content": "According to CRS data, out of 2,927 nominees to Article III circuit and district court judgeships between 1945 and 2014, only 287 nominees (approximately 10%) failed Senate confirmation. In cases where nominees lacked key Senate support, the Judiciary Committee often declined to consider the nomination. The Judiciary Committee may choose not to act on nominations, leading to them being returned or withdrawn by the President. Around 90% of unconfirmed nominees from 1945 to 2013 did not receive a committee vote. The procedural route for circuit or district court nominations involves referral to the Judiciary Committee, which may hold a hearing and then decide to report the nomination favorably, unfavorably, or take no action. The Judiciary Committee may vote to report a nomination favorably, unfavorably, or take no action. If a majority agrees to report, the nomination moves to the full Senate. In case of a tie vote, the nomination fails to be reported. If the Senate rejects the nomination, it is listed on the Executive Calendar for consideration. The Senate Judiciary Committee can vote favorably, unfavorably, or take no action on a nomination. If the Senate rejects a nomination, it is returned to the President with a resolution of disapproval. From the 76th Congress to the 113th Congress, 19 U.S. circuit court or district court nominations received other than a favorable vote, with most being voted unfavorably by the Judiciary Committee. The White nomination to the District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee but rejected by the full Senate. Table 1 summarizes the final committee and floor dispositions of 19 nominations, showing the outcomes of report favorably, report without recommendation, report unfavorably, and fail to report. Table 2 lists the nominations to the circuit courts of appeals and district courts separately. The nominations to the circuit courts of appeals and district courts are presented in separate sections, arranged chronologically. The table provides details on Judiciary Committee votes, including vote breakdowns and final Senate dispositions. All seven circuit court nominations received a committee vote other than to report favorably. During 1939-2013, no circuit court nominations were rejected by the full Senate. Out of 12 district court nominations, four were never reported by the Judiciary Committee, one was returned, and three were withdrawn by the President. Two district court nominations were reported favorably, with one confirmed after an initial failed vote. During 1939-2013, no circuit court nominations were rejected by the full Senate. Out of 12 district court nominations, four were never reported by the Judiciary Committee, one was returned, and three were withdrawn by the President. Five district court nominations were reported unfavorably and rejected by the Senate. One district court nomination was reported without recommendation and confirmed. From 1939 through 1951, one circuit and six district court nominees received votes from the Senate Judiciary Committee other than to report favorably. During 1939-2013, the Senate rejected seven judicial nominations due to opposition from home state Senators invoking \"senatorial courtesy.\" This included the rejection of Floyd H. Roberts as a U.S. district court judge for the Western District of Virginia in 1939 and James V. Allred's Fifth Circuit Court nomination in 1943. Additionally, four district court nominations faced opposition in 1950 and 1951. During 1950 and 1951, four district court nominations faced opposition from home state Senators invoking senatorial courtesy. The Senators objected to the nominees chosen by the Truman Administration without consulting them, leading to all four nominations being rejected by voice vote in the Senate. Since 1952, the Senate Judiciary Committee rarely voted against reporting circuit or district court nominations. In 1976, William B. Poff's nomination to the U.S. District Court was tabled due to senatorial courtesy. Since 1978, some nominees received votes other than favorable reports, with a few confirmed without recommendation or by voice vote. Since 1978, several circuit and district court nominations faced challenges in the Senate Judiciary Committee. One nominee received a recess appointment, another was confirmed in a later Congress, and one district court nomination was rejected on the Senate floor. Senators' objections were largely based on perceived ideological orientation. Since 1978, judicial nominations have faced challenges in the Senate Judiciary Committee based on perceived ideological orientation. For example, Daniel Manion was criticized for lacking expected qualifications, while Priscilla R. Owen's nomination was objected to for her ideological orientation. The nominee was characterized as a judicial 'activist' with strong anti-abortion and pro-business views, but was defended by Republicans as fair-minded and highly rated by the American Bar Association. Despite facing opposition, she was ultimately confirmed by the Senate in 2005. Another nominee, J. Leon Holmes, faced objections based on ideological grounds, including past comments on abortion and women's rights. J. Leon Holmes faced objections based on past comments about abortion and women's rights, but his nomination was ultimately confirmed by the Senate in 2004. During periods of divided government, some district court nominations faced unfavorable votes in the Judiciary Committee or full Senate. However, all nominations confirmed between 1976 to 2013 occurred during unified government, where the same party controlled the presidency and Senate."
