Congress promotes the installation of carbon monoxide alarms in residential homes nationwide to prevent poisoning and promote public safety. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

The grant funds can be used for the enforcement of laws on carbon monoxide alarms, training materials, instructors, and public education on the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning. Administrative costs are limited to 10% of the grant amount. Authorization of Appropriations for the Commission is set at $2,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2015 through 2019, with a limit of 10% for administrative expenses.
