Chapter 5.9 of the Penal Code establishes the California High Technology Crimes Task Force to address identity theft, Internet crimes, and credit card fraud. The task force will analyze existing statutes, collect data on these crimes, and explore collaborative models for prevention and prosecution. The California High Technology Crimes Task Force aims to prevent and prosecute identity theft, Internet crimes, and credit card fraud. It evaluates progress, increases public awareness, consults with organizations, and identifies funding opportunities. Members include representatives from the California District Attorneys Association and the California State Sheriffs\u2019 Association. The California High Technology Crimes Task Force includes representatives from various industries and law enforcement agencies. They are tasked with conducting a study to prevent and prosecute identity theft, Internet crimes, and credit card fraud, with a report due to the Legislature by December 31, 2017. Section 7470 of the Government Code is amended to restrict officers, employees, or agents of state or local agencies from accessing a customer's financial records from a financial institution without specific authorization, except in certain circumstances outlined in the law. Financial records can be disclosed in response to an administrative subpoena, search warrant, or judicial subpoena without requiring a financial institution to verify compliance with the requirements. The financial institution must keep records of all examinations or disclosures of customer financial records for five years, including details of the person examining the records and the authorization for the disclosure. Customers can request to review these records within five days and receive a copy upon payment of the reasonable cost. Financial institutions can disclose relevant financial records to law enforcement if they believe they are a victim of a crime, following contact initiated by the agency."
