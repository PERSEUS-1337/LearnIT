The Secretary will investigate complaints within 90 days to determine merit and notify the complainant and alleged violator of findings. If a violation is found, a preliminary order for relief will be issued. The alleged violator or complainant can file objections within 30 days and request a hearing.

The legal burdens of proof under section 1221 of title 5 will apply. The Secretary must issue a final order within 120 days of the recommended decision. Proceedings can be terminated based on a settlement agreement. If a violation is found, the Secretary may order corrective actions and reinstatement with compensation. Upon issuance of a final order, the Secretary may assess costs and expenses against the person, including attorney's fees and expert witness fees. In conducting an investigation or adjudication, the provisions of section 8(b) of this act shall apply. Any person affected by a final order may obtain review. A final order issued by the Secretary can be reviewed by the United States court of appeals within 60 days. The review process follows the provisions of chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The order is not subject to judicial review in criminal or civil proceedings, and the court may not stay the Secretary's order unless ordered to do so. Whenever a person fails to comply with a final order or order of reinstatement, the Secretary or the affected party can file a civil action in the district court to enforce the order. The court has jurisdiction to grant additional relief for noncompliance. The Act will become effective ninety days after its enactment."
