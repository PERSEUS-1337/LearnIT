    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys Act\". The \"Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys Act\" highlights the disparities faced by Black men and boys in education, criminal justice, health, employment, fatherhood, mentorship, and violence. A Commission will study these issues, prioritize solutions, and address civil rights violations affecting this population. Black babies are three times more likely to be born in poverty and fall behind White counterparts in cognitive development. By fourth grade, Black students are expected to be three years behind White male students. Only 12 percent of Black eighth-grade male students are proficient in math, compared to 44 percent of White students. Over 50 percent of Black male students in urban schools will drop out, leading to high rates of joblessness. The high rates of joblessness and incarceration among Black male students exacerbate cycles of poverty, leading to health inequalities such as diabetes, obesity, and HIV/AIDS. Black men face unequal profiling by police and harsh sentences in the judicial system, with six times more likely to be incarcerated than White counterparts. Out of 2.3 million people incarcerated nationwide, 1 million are Black males. Black males face disparities in incarceration rates and unemployment compared to White males. They receive longer Federal sentences and experience higher unemployment rates. Additionally, Black fathers are more likely to live apart from their children, while young boys with male mentors have better academic and financial outcomes.
