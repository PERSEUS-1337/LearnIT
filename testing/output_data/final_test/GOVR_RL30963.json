The calculation requires considering various scenarios, such as the tax implications if the spouses were not married, had never married, or divorced. These issues are particularly significant for couples with children, as having children can impact tax liability. Additionally, decisions regarding custody in divorce can also affect taxes. Factors like career paths, savings behavior, and income allocation further complicate the assessment of marriage penalties and bonuses. The decision on how to measure the marriage penalty does not change the effects of the proposals, but rather the original and remaining magnitude. Calculating the marriage penalty for couples without considering children is less uncertain. Despite the focus on marriage penalties, it may be surprising that for the middle class, marriage can impact tax liability. For the middle class, marriage penalties are small or nonexistent, especially for those with well-defined penalties. Data from the IRS shows that for joint returns with tax liability at the 15% rate, the penalty is no larger than $225. Taxpayers who itemize and have deductions equal to or larger than the standard deduction for two singles do not face a penalty. The \"middle class\" includes those with marginal tax rates of 15% and 28%, covering the majority of taxable returns. The broad range of taxpayers covered in the analysis represents the middle three quarters of the distribution of joint returns. Examples based on 2001 income levels assume all income is taxable, with a constant rule for itemizing deductions. Assumptions may overstate the marriage penalty as a fraction of economic income, especially at the top and bottom of the distribution. The middle class often has higher income than reported due to untaxed fringe benefits and preferentially taxed income. Marriage penalties are highest at higher income levels, with peaks and valleys shown in Table 1 for joint returns in the 15% bracket. The marriage penalty reached the exempt level for singles at $14,900 in 2001. The second earner credit and lower rates in the Administration proposal would reduce the penalty. H.R. 6 and optional filing would eliminate the penalty. Table 2 shows the maximum marriage penalties for returns in the 28% bracket, peaking at about 1.6% of income. 60% of joint returns with tax liability fell in the 15% bracket in 1997. The marriage penalty in 1997 varied based on income levels and tax brackets. The penalty could be reduced or even turned into a bonus under certain circumstances. H.R. 6 aimed to eliminate the penalty, while the Administration proposal also worked towards reducing it. Table 2 illustrates the maximum marriage penalties for couples in the 28% bracket. The Administration proposal virtually eliminates the small marriage penalty that currently exists, especially for couples in the 15% and 28% tax brackets. The penalty is reduced significantly with lower tax rates and second earner deductions, potentially resulting in a net benefit for couples. Optional filing and more evenly divided incomes could further minimize the penalty. The Administration proposal and H.R. 6 aim to eliminate or reduce marriage penalties, with H.R. 6 being more precise. The focus is on middle-class marriage penalties, with differences in their impact on marriage bonuses. The Administration proposal and H.R. 6 aim to reduce marriage penalties, with H.R. 6 being more precise. Bonuses for joint returns are larger than penalties, reflecting higher deductions and exemptions for married couples. The new 10% rate bracket for joint returns widens, potentially avoiding marriage penalties. H.R. 6 increases marriage bonuses at lower and moderate income levels by raising the standard deduction. Comparing H.R. 6 with the Administration proposal, combining H.R. 3 and H.R. 6 could lead to higher bonuses. Table 4 illustrates one-earner bonuses for returns in the 28% bracket. The Administration proposal offers smaller bonuses compared to current law or H.R. 6 due to the lower 25% rate offsetting the effect of the 10% bracket. H.R. 6 expands bonuses by doubling the 15% rate bracket for married couples. The tax system still impacts lower-income individuals through the earned income credit, leading to marriage penalties for couples with equal earnings. The proposed tax changes impact lower-income individuals through the earned income credit, resulting in marriage penalties for couples with equal earnings. Couples with children may experience marriage bonuses with the EIC. The proposals do not include significant changes to the earned income tax credit, with H.R. 6 offering a percentage increase for joint returns compared to single and head of household. The proposed tax changes aim to address marriage penalties and bonuses for couples with equal earnings through adjustments to the earned income credit. Increasing the phase-out threshold by $3,000 would slightly raise bonuses and reduce penalties. However, implementing optional filing could lead to high-income couples becoming eligible for the EIC, especially with larger credits for families with children. The phase out of the Earned Income Credit (EIC) ends at slightly over $28,000 for one child and $32,000 for two children, potentially making relatively wealthy families eligible. Increasing the EIC's phase out points could extend eligibility to families with $60,000 or more. Higher income couples, representing the top 12-13% of the income distribution, face challenges with the marriage penalty, especially with capital gains income. In higher income categories, capital gains can make up a significant portion of income, ranging from 20% to 60%. For individuals in the upper income distribution, half had a top marginal tax rate due to capital gains in 1997. Adjusted gross income varies from $141,000 to $368,000 in different tax brackets, with non-wage and unearned income becoming more important at the very high end. In higher income categories, capital gains can make up a significant portion of income, ranging from 20% to 60%. An equal distribution of income between spouses becomes less likely at the upper end of the distribution. Despite uncertainties, penalties in higher income categories are not very large and will decline. For the 31% bracket, penalties start at about 0.9% of income, peak at 1.3%, and then fall to 1.2%. The administration proposal aims to reduce penalties for higher income categories by combining former brackets into a single 25% bracket. The penalties would decrease from 1.3% to 0.3%, mainly due to changes in itemized deduction phase out rather than rate brackets. However, a proposal by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus would restore some penalties by subjecting the former 31% bracket to a 28% rate. H.R. 6 would result in slightly larger penalties compared to the Administration proposal, starting at 0.1% and peaking at 0.7% before declining to 0.6%. H.R. 6 would result in penalties starting at 0.1% and peaking at 0.7% before declining to 0.6%. Penalties would be similar to the Administration proposal if H.R. 6 were combined with H.R. 3. Bonuses would also be affected, with penalties remaining for higher income levels but only affecting 3% of taxpayers. Couples with children face challenges in modeling marriage penalties and bonuses due to the impact of children on tax liabilities. Children justify a head of household rate schedule with wider brackets, resulting in a larger penalty and smaller bonus compared to joint returns. Children can impact tax liability by increasing personal exemptions and eligibility for child credits. Earned income credits also play a role, especially with children. The allocation of children between spouses can have significant tax consequences. Different models for allocating children's tax consequences exist, such as the Tax Minimization Model, which aims to minimize tax liability by splitting children between spouses to maximize benefits like head-of-household status. The Tax Minimization Model aims to minimize tax liability by splitting children between spouses to maximize benefits like head-of-household status. Two approaches are discussed: the basic approach leading to penalties and bonuses, and the Resource Pooling Tax Minimization Model which assumes divorced individuals continue to share the same household. The Divorce Model allocates children to the lesser-earning spouse, typically the mother, resulting in a $28.9 billion net bonus for all couples. This model ignores head of household status and emphasizes the importance of child allocation for measuring bonuses and penalties in cases of disparate incomes. The view in H.R. 6 and other congressional proposals is to match single return, not head of household return, leading to disparities in incomes and penalties. The argument is made for child credits as well. The counterfactual for most couples is that they would not have had children if not married, resulting in similar marriage penalties and bonuses. It is difficult to assess these bonuses and make general observations, as there is no clear model to choose from. The marriage penalty is a concern for lower income individuals due to fairness and incentives. Married couples are generally taxed more lightly than singles, especially those with children. The reason for concern about the penalty is unclear, but it is important to consider the trade-off between fairness and incentives. The marriage penalty is a concern for lower income individuals due to fairness and incentives. Married couples are generally taxed more lightly than singles, especially those with children. The comparison of married couples with cohabitating couples shows that the numbers of the latter group are very small. Only about 8.5 million unmarried individuals were living with unmarried partners of the opposite sex. This raises questions about the fairness argument, especially since some married couples receive a bonus from being married. The marriage penalty is a concern for lower income individuals due to fairness and incentives. CBO found that 37% of married couples have penalties and 60% have bonuses. Lowering tax rates for joint returns could worsen the existing favorable treatment of married couples. Concerns about the marriage penalty include incentivizing cohabitation over marriage. However, the number of cohabitating couples is small, and most likely not influenced by tax consequences. Most middle-income individuals are not likely to be influenced by tax consequences to divorce, especially if they have children. Cohabitating couples are typically younger and less likely to have children compared to married couples. A larger fraction of families with children may not have regular income tax liability, filing as heads of households or singles. In 1997, about 35% of heads of households did not pay taxes. In 1997, 35% of head of household returns had no tax liability before credits, while only 12% of joint returns and 21% of single returns had no tax liability. Data on child poverty shows that cohabitating couples had a poverty rate of 26.9%, compared to 5.8% for married couples. Another 19% of children would be classified as poor by considering only one partner's income, with the average combined income being only 1.75 times the poverty line. The poverty line for families receiving public assistance may not incur regular income tax liability. Couples without children and lower-income couples with children are important groups. The Administration's proposal aims to reduce tax concerns for families with children through a lower tax rate and increased child credit. Currently, a family with one child has no tax liability until income reaches $19,633, while a family with two children has no tax liability until income reaches $25,866. With the proposed changes, these amounts will rise to $27,684 and $38,456. The larger child credit will increase to $27,684 and $38,456, close to the poverty level. A marriage penalty or bonus will only affect a small number of families in the 15% bracket. The penalty for a $30,000 couple would be reduced to $220 by the Administration's proposal. These penalties decrease as incomes rise and become subsidies for itemizers. These taxpayers, along with those with no liability, make up the bottom two-thirds of joint returns. The analysis of legislative proposals on the marriage penalty shows that for middle-class couples, the penalty will be essentially eliminated by rate reductions and exemptions. Higher-income individuals are not comparable to cohabitating couples with children. The proposal will also reduce marriage penalties in higher brackets more than H.R. 6 alone. The congressional marriage penalty proposal, H.R. 6, would increase existing marriage bonuses, while the administration's proposal would reduce them. When combined with rate cuts and credits from H.R. 3, marriage bonuses would increase compared to the Administration's proposal. However, there will be less reduction in bonuses at higher income levels due to top rates not being cut as much."
