    "content": "The Act titled \"International Monetary Stability Act of 2001\" is established. It includes findings and a statement of policy. Congress finds that monetary stability is crucial for long-term economic growth and living standards. Many emerging market countries lack monetary stability, leading to economic and financial problems like currency crises, inflation, and high interest rates. There is increasing global interest in official dollarization, where a country adopts the US dollar as legal tender to import monetary stability. Official dollarization can bring monetary stability, lower inflation and interest rates, and boost long-term economic growth in emerging markets. It can also increase trade and investment flows, benefiting the United States. However, countries lose seigniorage profits, which is a barrier to official dollarization. Encouraging official dollarization could be mutually beneficial for the United States. The United States aims to encourage official dollarization by sharing extra seigniorage earnings with dollarized countries. It is the policy that the Federal Reserve System is not obligated to act as a lender of last resort or consider economic conditions of dollarized countries. Financial institution supervision in dollarized countries remains their responsibility. Countries are free to dollarize unilaterally without qualification by the Secretary of the Treasury. Countries are free to dollarize unilaterally without qualification. SEC. 3 states qualification.
