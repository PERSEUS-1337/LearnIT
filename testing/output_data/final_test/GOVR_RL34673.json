    "content": "As of June 2009, the General Schedule (GS) covered around 59.8% of federal employees, with 15 pay grades and 10 steps in each grade. The Department of Defense (DOD) operates the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) to link pay increases to performance. DOD, the largest federal department, employed over 717,000 civilian employees in June 2009, with 29.4% eligible for NSPS. The National Security Personnel System (NSPS) covered 29.4% of DOD's 717,000 employees as of June 2009. Legislation was passed in 2009 to terminate NSPS by 2012 due to complaints of inconsistencies and litigation. Employees are now being returned to their previous pay system. The National Security Personnel System (NSPS) was created in response to concerns about the GS system's ability to meet national security needs. It originated from a proposal by the George W. Bush Administration in 2003 and was implemented through the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004. The system aimed to create a more flexible and mission-driven human resources management system for the Department of Defense. The National Security Personnel System (NSPS) was created in response to concerns about the GS system's ability to meet national security needs. It aimed to provide DOD with more flexible personnel policies than those governed by Title 5 of the U.S. Code. Senator Susan Collins introduced a bill, S. 1166, to grant DOD additional pay flexibilities for NSPS. The National Security Personnel System Act aimed to provide DOD with more flexible personnel policies. Senators Voinovich and Carper asked Comptroller General Walker about DOD's workforce motivation and control. Walker highlighted the lack of institutional infrastructure in DOD organizations, cautioning that granting additional human capital authorities without proper implementation could be detrimental. The National Security Personnel System Act aimed to provide DOD with more flexible personnel policies. Another bill, H.R. 1588, set definitions and guidelines for a new DOD personnel system. The Senate passed the bill, and President George W. Bush signed it into law as P.L. 108-136, authorizing the director of OPM to establish a human resources management system for the Department of Defense. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (P.L. 110-181) required the NSPS system to provide annual bonuses and supplements closer in value to those given to GS employees, ensuring fair compensation for DOD civilian employees under the new system. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 mandated that all DOD employees receive a pay supplement to address labor cost increases. Proposed rules were published in May 2008 to clarify NSPS regulations. A review in July 2009 recommended a reconstruction of NSPS due to systemic issues. The implementation timetable for NSPS changed multiple times, with initial plans to transition employees by October 2004. The NSPS reform effort, announced by Mr. England in 2004, phased in implementation over several years. Employees were grouped into spirals for implementation, with Spiral 1.1 starting in April 2006 and completing in March 2007. Spiral 2 began after that. Spirals 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 were completed in March 2007, followed by Spiral 2 in April 2008, adding 180,000 DOD employees to NSPS. The final spiral in March 2009 included 14,000 more employees, totaling 211,000. Some employees felt excluded from planning processes during NSPS development. Some Members raised concerns about the lack of access to agencies' pay-for-performance plans for employees and unions. Senators urged for transparency and public scrutiny of the NSPS proposals, criticizing DOD's refusal to share details with union officials. Senator Kennedy and Senator Lieberman criticized the Department of Defense for not consulting with employee representatives and refusing to share details of the new personnel system, which they believed violated the intent of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Department of Defense and OPM proposed new rules for the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) in 2005, citing the need to modernize the outdated GS personnel system to meet the demands of the 21st-century national security environment. Senator Kennedy and Senator Lieberman criticized the lack of consultation with employee representatives and transparency in the process. The current human resources management system in the Department of Defense is rigid and outdated, hindering the support of the DoD's mission. Pay and personnel movement are tied to obsolete job definitions, hiring processes are cumbersome, and there is no differentiation between high and low performers. A more flexible and mission-driven approach is needed to transform the civilian workforce and enhance the effectiveness of the Total Force. The Department of Defense is facing challenges that require a civilian workforce transformation. Civilians are being asked to take on new responsibilities, be more innovative, agile, and accountable. It is crucial for DoD to support the civilian workforce with modern systems, such as a human resources management system and a labor relations system. The enabling legislation gives DoD the authority to meet this transformation challenge. Employees transitioning to NSPS are mainly white-collar, non-bargaining DOD personnel, with pay bands that offer greater flexibility than the traditional GS pay system. The NSPS pay bands provide greater flexibility for managers to hire and retain qualified employees at higher pay rates. Unlike the GS scale, pay bands do not have automatic advancement steps based on job performance. NSPS includes four career groups: Standard, Scientific and Engineering, Investigative and Protective Services, and Medical. These career groups encompass various occupations within the Department of Defense. NSPS has four pay schedules: Professional/Analytical; Technician/Support; Supervisor/Manager; and Student, with two to four pay bands in each. Career groups determine salary caps and starting salaries, with some groups having higher caps. Most pay schedules have three pay bands: Expert; Journey; and Entry/Development. Within 30 days of the start of a new performance-evaluation period, each employee receives a performance plan outlining criteria and goals aligned with the DoD mission. Performance elements include knowledge of procedures, specific goals, contributions, and conduct. Employees are required to meet with their supervisor at least once during the performance-appraisal period for an interim evaluation, which acknowledges achievements and suggests areas for improvement. Supervisors are responsible for informing employees of important performance criteria and job objective measures. Regular review of performance expectations and involving employees in setting job objectives is encouraged. Continued dialogue between supervisors and employees is also encouraged. Supervisors are encouraged to engage in continued dialogue with employees throughout the performance appraisal period. Employees have 24-hour online access to their performance plan through the Performance Appraisal Application (PAA) 2.0 on the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) website. A conversion calculator is available for employees transitioning from GS to NSPS. Employees are encouraged to provide a self-assessment at the end of the appraisal period to inform the rater of their performance. Supervisors evaluate employees using performance criteria. Supervisors evaluate employees using performance criteria and translate the narrative into a five-point numeric scale. Contributing factors such as technical proficiency, critical thinking, cooperation, communication, customer focus, resource management, and leadership can impact the numeric rating of each competency. Leadership should be considered when evaluating any supervisory element. When evaluating employees, supervisors use a five-point numeric scale based on performance criteria. Factors like technical proficiency, critical thinking, cooperation, communication, customer focus, resource management, and leadership influence the numeric rating. Ratings must be rounded to the nearest whole number, with a minimum score of three required for performance-based pay increases. Corrective action is necessary if an employee is performing below expectations. NSPS corrective action may include various measures like remedial training, reassignment, warnings, and salary reduction for unsatisfactory performance. Employees can request a reconsideration of their performance rating within 10 days by submitting a written request to the pay pool manager. The manager must respond within 15 days. The pay pool manager must provide a written explanation of their determination within 15 days of receiving a request for reconsideration of a performance rating. If the employee is still unsatisfied, they can request a final review with the Performance Review Authority (PRA) within five days of the pay pool manager's decision. The PRA oversees all pay pools and ensures consistency in evaluations. Bargaining employees also have the option to file a grievance. In a 2008 article, a DOD executive director mentioned that supervisors and managers would need to dedicate 40 to 60 hours per employee per year for performance evaluations. Brenda S. Farrell from GAO testified about concerns regarding the time-consuming process in the DOD's performance-based pay pool, which includes various funding sources for cash awards. Group pay pools are divided by organization structure and job roles. In NSPS, employees are assigned performance pay shares based on their numerical performance rating. The pay pool panel, consisting of DOD administrators and senior staff, awards employees with ratings of 3, 4, or 5 with varying numbers of performance shares. Employees with ratings of 1 or 2 receive no performance shares. In NSPS, employees may receive five or six performance shares based on their performance rating. The pay pool manager distributes the performance shares to ensure legal and fair allocation. Employees at the maximum pay level may receive their bonus as a lump sum at the beginning of the following year, which does not count towards basic pay or affect retirement benefits. NSPS pay includes a local market supplement (LMS) added to base salary for employees in specific areas or occupations. LMS functions like locality pay, attracting expertise and providing extra pay for hazardous work. To be eligible for LMS increase, employees need 90 days of employment and a performance rating of 2 or higher. LMS is usually equal to annual locality pay increases. DOD employees may receive discretionary performance payouts like Extraordinary Pay Increases (EPI) and Organization Achievement Recognitions (OAR) based on annual performance evaluations. EPI is for those with a rating of 5, while OAR is for those with a rating of 3 or higher. OARs reward team achievements towards department goals. A lawsuit was filed by a coalition of unions representing DOD employees on November 7, 2005. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) filed a lawsuit challenging the DOD's NSPS regulations, which were initially enjoined by a federal district court but later upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The court ruled in favor of the DOD, stating that the National Defense Authorization Act granted the department authority to limit collective bargaining rights. The coalition of unions requested a full court review of the appellate court decision upholding DOD regulations. The U.S. Supreme Court denied AFGE's appeal to stop NSPS implementation. Congressional hearings highlighted DOD employees' mistrust of NSPS and concerns over its full implementation. Members questioned NSPS effectiveness and adaptability to challenges during a House Committee hearing. The Department of Defense (DOD) stated that the NSPS system was effective and showing a powerful return on investment. Early results include increased training focused on performance management, improved communication between supervisors and employees, flexibility, and rewarding exceptional performance. Positive changes in behaviors and organizational culture were also noted. However, John Gage, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, criticized NSPS as \"unfair to employees\" and called for its repeal due to violations of workers' rights. The NSPS system was criticized as \"unfair to employees\" and called for its repeal due to violations of workers' rights. The effects on collective bargaining rights were discussed at a House Committee hearing. Employee support and congressional oversight were seen as necessary for NSPS to succeed. At a congressional hearing, Gage criticized the NSPS system for being subjective, inconsistent, and biased. He highlighted how lower-rated employees could receive higher pay bonuses than higher-rated ones. The system allowed managers to decide on salary increases versus one-time bonuses, impacting employees' standard of living during and after retirement. During a Senate Committee hearing, then-Comptroller General David M. Walker testified that NSPS could be a model for other agencies transitioning to performance-based pay systems. He emphasized the importance of having the necessary institutional infrastructure in place before implementing major human capital reform efforts like NSPS, including human capital planning, system development capabilities, and a credible performance management system. NSPS is a significant change in performance management, linking employee performance to department goals. However, there are difficulties with the system, including the need for improvement in performance plans and assessments. Employees have expressed concerns over the fairness of the pay pool process. Employees have concerns about the fairness of the pay pool process under NSPS, with skepticism about their chances to excel in the workforce. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 modified NSPS to ensure that employees who received a satisfactory rating would receive at least 60% of the pay increase given to GS employees. The law also required NSPS to link performance management to the agency's strategic plan and provide adequate training for supervisors, managers, and employees. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 modified NSPS to ensure fair pay pool process and performance management linked to the agency's strategic plan. It also mandated adequate training for supervisors, managers, and employees. The Department of Defense proposed new rules for NSPS, including removing references to a new labor-management system and allowing pay increases for employees rated \"unacceptable\" after performance improvement. The Department of Defense proposed new rules for NSPS, including performance improvement before full appraisal cycle, receiving over 500 comments. A hearing in 2009 discussed NSPS future, with DOD testifying to successes and failures, highlighting improved communication and alignment with organizational goals. Employees and supervisors are facing challenges with stricter performance measures. Employees and supervisors are questioning the fairness of performance ratings in the evaluation process, with concerns over supervisor skills and pay pool panels' involvement. Darryl Perkinson from the Federal Managers Association testified that NSPS may not effectively reward quality performance. FMA managers and supervisors believe a switch to pay-for-performance is necessary to compete with the private sector and encourage high performance. The NSPS system aims to reward high performance rather than longevity, but employees have concerns about unfair evaluations and inadequate training. Both the House and Senate have included language to eliminate NSPS in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. The defense authorization act's conference report included provisions to eliminate NSPS by 2012 and return DOD employees to the GS pay scale. The bill also established a Civilian Workforce Incentive Fund for additional pay incentives. The National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2010 included language to terminate NSPS, which was signed into law on October 28, 2009. Assessments of NSPS highlighted the need for measuring DOD's ability to retain key employees and hire quality workers. Members of the Virginia congressional delegation criticized DOD's handling of NSPS in a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Robert Gates received a letter criticizing the Department of Defense's decision to give NSPS employees only half of the pay increase given to GS employees, causing concerns about employee retention and recruitment. The average raise for NSPS employees in 2008 was 7.6%, higher than the 3.5% raise for GS employees. AFGE President John Gage expressed his disapproval of the situation. AFGE President John Gage expressed concerns about the high percentage pay increases for NSPS employees, suggesting that they may decrease in the future due to cost implications. NSPS Program Executive Officer Mary Lacy defended the pay system, stating that it does not cost more to run as some employees receive no pay increases while others receive significant raises. Unions criticized NSPS for lack of transparency, with Greg Junemann calling for the release of data supporting the 7.6% payout for civilian DOD employees. In August 2008, the Federal Times analyzed pay outcomes for NSPS employees based on performance evaluations. The Federal Times analyzed pay outcomes for civilian DOD employees in the NSPS system, finding that most employees received pay increases tied to performance. However, many of these increases were one-time bonuses rather than permanent salary raises. Without including the local market supplement, valued performers received minimal pay raises. White employees tended to receive higher performance ratings, salary increases, and bonuses compared to other employees. Employees of different races received varying performance ratings, salary increases, and bonuses. The Government Accountability Office reported that the Department of Defense had implemented safeguards to ensure fairness in the NSPS system, but improvements could still be made. Some of the safeguards include aligning employee objectives with agency goals and providing ongoing performance feedback. The Department of Defense could enhance NSPS by having third-party analysis on pay determinations and publishing department-wide rating results for transparency. Recommendations include providing more guidance to pay pool administrators and supervisors on rating employees appropriately and addressing negative employee perceptions of NSPS. DOD disagreed with some of GAO's findings but acknowledged concerns and efforts to address them. The Department of Defense disagreed with GAO's recommendation for third-party analysis of pay pool decisions in NSPS, stating it was fair and equitable. DOD also disagreed with GAO's concerns about rating scores not making meaningful distinctions among employees' performances. GAO agreed to publish agency-wide rating results and address concerns raised by then-presidential candidate Barack Obama about NSPS. President Obama signed a bill eliminating NSPS, a controversial pay system criticized for forced distribution ratings and lack of merit consideration in promotions. Employees rated \"2\" or above were eligible for a pay increase, while those rated \"3\" or higher could receive a performance-based raise. GAO testified about concerns with NSPS, including the suppression of wages and lack of meaningful performance distinctions. The DOD has implemented internal safeguards for the NSPS performance management system, but there are areas that could be improved. Suggestions include involving employees in system design, linking objectives to agency goals, providing ongoing feedback, and ensuring equitable pay for performance. Other recommendations include allocating resources for system administration, implementing predecisional safeguards, ensuring transparency, and making meaningful distinctions in employee performance. The Defense Business Board recommended a reconstruction of the National Security Personnel System, emphasizing collaboration with employees through unions and a commitment to strategic management. OPM Director John Berry has also raised concerns about the multitude of performance-based pay structures in the federal government. Director John Berry has expressed the need for a government-wide performance-based pay system, aiming to create a more effective workforce. The elimination of NSPS will impact over 200,000 federal employees in DOD, while potential changes to Title 5 of the U.S. Code could affect more than 2 million federal employees. Congress has mandated the removal of NSPS but has not eliminated all performance-based pay systems, leaving room for the possibility of keeping the GS system or creating a new one in the future. The DOD's experience with NSPS shows the benefit of higher starting salaries to attract college graduates. NSPS allows for pay banding flexibility, offering a wider range of pay options. However, DOD has not provided data on the recruitment of employees under NSPS. The DOD has not provided data on how NSPS pay flexibilities were used to recruit employees. Congress may require DOD to collect this data before NSPS is phased out to determine if the flexibilities aided in recruitment and retention of effective employees. This information could be useful if Congress decides to authorize a new performance-based pay system in the future. The DOD was required by P.L. 108-136 to create a pay system linking pay to employee performance. The performance appraisal system could measure and compare employee performance ratings, helping to recruit and retain effective government employees. Comparing performance ratings between employees recruited with pay flexibilities and those already in the system may show if NSPS attracted and retained more effective employees. The NSPS pay system aimed to attract and retain effective government employees by linking pay to performance. Data could be collected to assess if NSPS encouraged low-rated employees to leave. However, NSPS did not provide supervisors with additional firing flexibilities. Employees rated \"2\" did not receive performance-based pay increases, while those rated \"1\" received no pay adjustments. The NSPS pay system aimed to retain employees by linking pay to performance. Congress may require DOD to track employees with low ratings to see if the policy of denying pay increases prompts resignations. NSPS covers one-third of planned personnel. $158 million was spent on implementation from 2005-2008, with an estimated $143 million from 2009-2011. NSPS does not receive additional congressional appropriations. The NSPS pay system aimed to link pay to performance and retain employees. Additional costs for NSPS mainly include running the NSPS resources office and creating performance appraisal software. The total cost of running multiple pay systems within DOD has not been calculated. Congress may consider requiring DOD to calculate and compare the costs of different pay systems to determine efficiency. The NSPS pay system for federal employees consists of 211,000 employees divided into 1,600 pay pools. Pay pool managers have the authority to increase funding by adding performance bonuses, motivating employees to perform better. Individual managers influencing the pay pool size may lead to employee perceptions about payouts. Employees may perceive the payout process as unfair if pay pool managers have the authority to influence the size of the funding pot. This can be especially problematic if employees are in a pay pool with managers who do not increase the pot. Additionally, defining pay pool goals can be challenging when employees have disparate job assignments. If Congress implements a performance-based pay system in the future, they may remove the ability of pay pool managers to adjust the funding pot. NSPS policies do not require pay pool managers or panel members to remove employees' names from performance appraisals when determining annual payouts, which may lead to concerns of favoritism. Congress may consider removing employee names from appraisals in a future performance-based pay system to address these concerns. Certain organizations within DOD may have outlier units with high or low performance levels, leading to separate pay pools. Performance-based pay increases for high-performing employees in outlier groups may be lower than those in average units. The size of the pay pool remains the same if all employees achieve high ratings, potentially resulting in smaller individual shares for some employees. In a performance-based pay system, employees in outlier units may be in a different pay pool from their colleagues. The funding pot for the pay pool remains constant regardless of performance levels. This can result in employees in low-performing pay pools receiving higher payouts than those in higher-performing pools with similar ratings. Congress may need to consider different payout processes for future performance-based pay systems. In a performance-based pay system, funding can be added or subtracted from pay pools based on performance ratings. High-performing divisions may receive additional funding, while low-performing divisions may have funding removed. This could lead to confusion and frustration among employees regarding payout consistency. The provision in the NSPS policy may lead to employees perceiving payout results as inconsistent and arbitrary, based more on supervisors' ratings approaches than individual performance strengths. Employees may not see a clear link between their performance and pay increase, as payouts can vary despite consistent performance. Dissatisfied employees can request a reconsideration of their rating within 10 days by submitting a written request to the pay pool manager. Employees can challenge their rating by requesting a reconsideration from the pay pool manager. If unsatisfied, they can seek a final review from the Performance Review Authority within five days. Bargaining employees can also file a grievance. Congress may consider other options for reconsideration in future pay systems. Some agencies have created ombudsman offices for employees with pay system concerns. An ombudsman office can be a resource for employees with pay system concerns. Design decisions include determining powers, jurisdiction, and location within a department. Reporting to higher officials can impact the office's influence. Other considerations include selecting the ombudsman, their role as a neutral fact-finder or advocate, and the office's budget. Employees under NSPS work with supervisors to set goals at the start of the performance-appraisal year. Congress may consider implementing additional performance-appraisal consultations for new hires during their probationary period to help them determine achievable work goals. DOD has requested flexibilities from Title 5 of the U.S. Code to make the workforce more agile. DOD has not provided Congress with data showing progress towards goals of workforce flexibilities. Congress may request aggregate data on NSPS recruitment, pay increases, and promotions. NSPS administrators could aggregate data on employee-supervisor interactions to assess goal achievement. NSPS has not aggregated data on employee performance appraisals to determine the method of interaction. Congress could enact legislation to create more recruitment, retention, and relocation flexibilities for federal departments. This could include allocating more funding for existing incentives or creating new ones to reward effective employee performance. Congress could consider various options to attract and retain federal employees, such as offering additional vacation days, creating programs to help pay back school loans, making child care more accessible, and providing benefits for domestic partners in same-sex relationships. These initiatives aim to enhance recruitment and retention efforts within government agencies. Congress may need to consider additional incentives for federal agencies facing challenges in hiring and retaining staff. This could involve changes to existing statutes and appropriations. The creation of NSPS by Congress for DOD pay flexibilities serves as a model, with both positive and negative experiences, for potential future incentive programs. Unions have historically been opposed to pay-for-performance systems like NSPS. NSPS serves as a model for a potential transition to a performance-based pay system for federal workforce, showcasing both successful and unsuccessful experiences. It demonstrates how elements of such a system can work or not work in large federal agencies."
