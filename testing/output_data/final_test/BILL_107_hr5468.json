    "content": "The Act titled \"Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Land Exchange Act of 2002\" is cited for reference. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians has proposed a land exchange with the National Park Service to acquire the Yellow Face tract, benefiting the American public by adding 218 acres of land adjacent to the Blue Ridge Parkway. The National Park Service acquisition of the Yellow Face tract would preserve important views for Blue Ridge Parkway visitors, habitat for endangered species, valuable wetland seeps, and prevent residential development. The land exchange would also allow the Eastern Band to reclaim the Ravensford tract, part of their ancestral homeland. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians needs to replace the current Cherokee Elementary School, which is overcrowded and in poor condition. They plan to build a new three-school campus to preserve Cherokee traditions and culture while providing a modern education. This project aims to benefit the public by fostering a well-educated Indian nation. The land exchange will reunify tribal lands, reestablishing territorial integrity. The Ravensford tract has no threatened or endangered species, while the Yellow Face tract has listed species and a higher value. Previous land exchanges have been approved when benefits are clear. The purposes of the Act include acquiring the Yellow Face tract to preserve views, wetlands, and species, transferring the Ravensford tract to benefit the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and promoting cooperation between the Eastern Band and the National Park Service in ancestral homelands. The Act aims to acquire the Yellow Face tract for conservation purposes and transfer the Ravensford tract to benefit the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The Secretary of the Interior will exchange the Ravensford tract in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park for the Yellow Face tract near the Waterrock Knob Visitor Center on the Blue Ridge Parkway. The United States will hold the Ravensford tract in trust for the benefit of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians as part of the Cherokee Indian Reservation. The Eastern Band will deed lands to the United States to facilitate the exchange. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians will deed parcels 88 and 89 of the Hornbuckle Tract in North Carolina to the United States, which will be managed as part of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Additionally, the Ravensford Tract within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, consisting of 144 acres, will be held in trust for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The Secretary of the Interior will file legal descriptions of areas within the Hornbuckle Tract and Great Smoky Mountains National Park with relevant committees. The descriptions will be available for public inspection and may be corrected for errors. SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. Government-to-Government Agreements: The Director of the National Park Service and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians will collaborate on reviewing construction plans and developing protocols for the Ravensford tract. Cooperative agreements may be established for training, management, and preservation of natural and cultural resources. Construction standards will be mutually agreed upon to align with the purposes of the Act and the Eastern Band's educational needs. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians will develop educational facilities and infrastructure while minimizing adverse impacts on resources. Tribal members will have first preference for employment in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. SEC. 5. GAMING PROHIBITION. This Act does not allow gaming on lands acquired by the Secretary of the Interior in trust for an Indian tribe after October 17, 1988."
