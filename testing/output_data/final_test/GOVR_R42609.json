    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers various benefits to veterans and their families, including disability compensation, education benefits, medical treatment, and home loan guaranty. Applicants can apply at their local VA office, and if unsatisfied with the decision, they have the right to appeal. This report provides an overview of the VA appeal process. The report discusses the appeal process within the Department of Veterans Affairs, including judicial review from the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and the Supreme Court of the United States. To apply for VA benefits, applicants must file a claim at a local VA office, VA medical facility, or online at the VA's eBenefits website. Veterans Service Organizations (VSO) can assist with the application process. After submitting a benefits application to the VA, the VA will review and send a determination to the claimant. If unsatisfied, the claimant can appeal the decision, with the right to appeal any decision on benefits. The BVA allows appeals on various benefit decisions, including service-connected disability benefits, education assistance, and burial benefits. Claimants can appeal partial or complete denials. A claimant can appeal a partial or complete denial of a claim, as well as the amount awarded by the RO. Appeals can also be made for determinations related to eligibility for hospitalization, outpatient treatment, and access to medical devices. However, certain medical determinations made by medical providers cannot be appealed. The Board does not have jurisdiction over appeals regarding a physician's decision on specific drugs or treatments. The traditional review process involves the local VA office reviewing the claim folder and sending it to the Board of Veterans' Appeals for a de novo review. Alternatively, a Decision Review Officer can conduct a de novo review at the local VA office. If unsatisfied with the DRO's decision, the claimant can still pursue the traditional review process and have the appeal heard by the BVA. During the appeal process for veterans' claims, a Decision Review Officer (DRO) at each VA Regional Office conducts a de novo review of the appealed issue with no deference to the initial decision. The DRO can only revise the decision if there is a clear and unmistakable error, and the claimant must request DRO review for this process to occur. The Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) in Washington, DC, makes final determinations on appeals within the VA. Board members, appointed by the Secretary of the VA, review appeals and consist of experienced attorneys in veterans law. Claimants can opt for DRO review before BVA review, and if the DRO's decision is unfavorable, the claimant can still have the BVA review the claim. The Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) in Washington, DC, handles appeals within the VA with a significant workload. Claimants can appeal BVA decisions to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC), an Article I court with exclusive jurisdiction over BVA appeals. The CAVC received 4,506 appeals in FY2015. If dissatisfied with the CAVC decision, claimants can appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has limited scope in reviewing veterans' appeals, being able to set aside regulations that are arbitrary, capricious, unconstitutional, or procedurally deficient. It is the last appeal of right for claimants appealing BVA decisions, with the option to petition the Supreme Court for certiorari if unsatisfied. The VA allows claimants to have representation in the appeal process, but it is not mandatory. Veterans Service Organizations (VSO) offer free representation to the majority of claimants, with approximately 85% being represented by VSO representatives in 2000. In 2000, around 85% of claimants were represented by a VSO or hired an attorney/agent for appeal. Fees for representation must be reasonable and filed with the VA. Veterans fill out VA Form 21-22 for VSO representation or VA Form 21-22a for attorney/agent representation. VA has legal obligations to assist claimants in obtaining evidence and filing proper benefit claims. The VA is required to consider every legal theory that could support a claim for benefits and weigh evidence in favor of the claimant. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a75107(b), the Secretary must give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant when there is an approximate balance of evidence. The VA must provide notice of its decision to the claimant. The VA must provide notice of its decision and an explanation of the procedure for obtaining review. To appeal a decision, a claimant must submit a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to notify the VA. The NOD can be filed on a standardized form provided by the VA or a traditional NOD if no form is provided. Claimants should specify whether they are appealing the entire decision or only part of it. Additionally, a claimant may request a DRO review at this stage of the appeal process. When appealing a decision, a claimant can make a request for a DRO review instead of going straight to the BVA. The NOD must be sent to the local VA office within one year of the initial determination. If the claimant chooses DRO review, the DRO will reexamine the claim file from scratch, providing no deference to the initial decision. The DRO will conduct a de novo review of the claim, without giving deference to the VA's initial decision. They can overturn the decision without new evidence or clear error. The DRO may hold informal conferences or formal hearings with the claimant. A new decision will be sent to the claimant with a summary of evidence, relevant laws, and reasons for the decision. The reviewer will either allow or deny the claim, with a win for the claimant if allowed. After a de novo review by the DRO, a decision will be made to allow or deny the claim. If allowed, the appeal process ends. If denied, the claimant receives a notice along with a Statement of the Case (SOC) summarizing the evidence and regulations used. The claimant must fill out a VA Form 9 to continue the appeal within 60 days of receiving the SOC. The claimant has 60 days from when the SOC was mailed to submit the VA Form 9 to the local VA office for the appeal process. A deadline extension can be requested with a valid reason. The form allows the claimant to request a hearing, point out mistakes in the SOC, and provide reasons for disagreeing with the VA's decision. New evidence can be added with the submission of the VA Form 9, leading to the preparation of a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) by the VA office. After submitting the VA Form 9, the claimant's appeal process is fulfilled. The case is then certified to the BVA, which assigns a docket number and hears cases in the order received. A claimant can request to advance on the docket with a strong reason, such as imminent foreclosure or terminal illness. The claimant can request to advance on the docket with a strong reason, such as imminent foreclosure, bankruptcy, or terminal illness. Evidence of the situation should be provided to the BVA when filing a motion. VA Form 9 indicates if a hearing with a BVA member is desired, which can be in-person at the local RO, in Washington, DC, or via teleconference. Teleconference hearings are the quickest to arrange and are informal and nonadversarial. The claimant can present relevant evidence at a BVA hearing, with time limits set by the Board member. The hearing can be documented in a transcript for review. Additional evidence can be submitted before or during the hearing, including new medical evidence or statements. It is important to submit any material evidence as soon as it is received, especially if the claimant's file is still at the local VA office. The claimant should submit any additional evidence to the local VA office. The office will provide a Supplemental Statement of the Case and forward the claim file to the BVA. The claimant must submit evidence or a hearing request within 90 days of the BVA receiving the file. If evidence is submitted after 90 days, a motion must be filed with good cause for the delay. The claimant can present additional evidence during the hearing, even if it's after the 90-day deadline. After the hearing, a Board member and a staff attorney review the claim file, evaluate evidence, forms, arguments, and transcripts. The staff attorney assists the Board member and may make recommendations. The Board member then makes a decision on the appeal, but the length of time for a decision is uncertain. The BVA will notify the claimant of its decision. The BVA will notify the claimant of its decision by mailing a notice to the claimant's address as listed in the claim file. The notice will state the decision and explain the legal basis for reaching that conclusion. The BVA will reach one of three decisions: approve the claim, remand the claim for additional information, or deny the claim. If the claim is remanded, the local VA office will perform the necessary work and make another decision on the claim. If the VA office still believes the claim cannot be approved, it will be sent back to the BVA for a quicker review. The BVA may deny the claim, in which case the claimant can appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) or file additional motions with the BVA. The claimant may file a \"motion to reconsider\" with the BVA if an obvious error of fact or law is made in the decision. This motion can be filed at any time and must be sent directly to the BVA. If allowed, the claimant can request an additional hearing before the Board by showing that the error affected the decision. New and material evidence is required to reopen a case. The claimant can submit \"new and material\" evidence to reopen a case, but it must relate to the original case and not have been previously included in the claims folder. If the BVA made a crucial error, the appellant can file a motion for \"clear and unmistakable error\" (CUE), but the error must have changed the BVA's decision. The process of filing a motion for \"clear and unmistakable error\" (CUE) can be complex, as illustrated by the difficulty in establishing such an error. If a CUE motion is denied, the appellant cannot request another review on the same issue. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from the Board of Veterans Appeals, and the appellant must submit a notice of appeal within 120 days of the BVA's decision. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA). The appellant must submit a notice of appeal within 120 days of the BVA's decision. The CAVC reviews the record and written arguments, with the possibility of oral arguments. It cannot review de novo a BVA determination of fact. The decision can be made by one judge, a panel of three judges, or the entire court. If the CAVC rules in favor of the appellant, the case may be remanded to the BVA for implementation. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) has jurisdiction over appeals from the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA). The appellant must file a notice of appeal within 120 days. The deadline was once seen as procedural but is now considered non-jurisdictional. In 2001, David Henderson filed a claim with the VA for compensation, which was denied by the VA Regional Office. The CAVC dismissed Henderson's appeal for in-home care due to a missed filing deadline, which was deemed non-jurisdictional by the Supreme Court. The Court determined that the 120-day deadline for filing appeals is not jurisdictional but an important procedural rule. The case was remanded to determine if any exceptions apply. The CAVC in Bove v. Shinseki provided context on when appeals can still be heard after missing the deadline. The doctrine of equitable tolling has specific parameters, only applying in certain circumstances like mental illness, reliance on incorrect information, or misfiling. The CAVC clarified that filing at the wrong location could impact the appeal process. The CAVC clarified that equitable tolling may be appropriate if the notice of appeal is filed at the wrong location, even though the deadline is not jurisdictional. Mental illness can be a reason for equitable tolling, but the appellant must show they were unable to function or make decisions due to their mental illness. The Federal Circuit overruled a previous decision by the CAVC regarding its authority to address untimely filings and equitable tolling. The Federal Circuit overruled the CAVC's authority to grant relief on a non-jurisdictional timeliness defense when the Secretary has waived the defense. The CAVC's decision was deemed wrong due to statutory limits, misreading of Supreme Court precedent, and misconstrued policy considerations. The 120-day period for filing an appeal is subject to equitable tolling, as established in the Bove case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from CAVC decisions. The Federal Circuit's review is limited to certain criteria, and it can modify, reverse, or remand decisions. Appeals from the Federal Circuit can be made to the Supreme Court of the United States. Appeals from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit can be made to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court may choose to hear the case and its decision is final."
