    "content": "The \"Commonsense Ozone Regulation Act\" excludes covered extreme ozone nonattainment areas from control under the 1-hour national standard for ozone, applying retroactively from the effective date of classification under the 8-hour standard. Future ozone standards for these areas are also postponed. The \"Commonsense Ozone Regulation Act\" postpones future ozone standards for covered extreme ozone nonattainment areas. The Administrator can classify the area based on a rule setting the ozone standard below 0.08 parts per million. Until a feasibility report is submitted to Congress, the current ozone standard from January 1, 2011, will continue to apply. Additionally, local advisory committees are established. The \"Commonsense Ozone Regulation Act\" postpones future ozone standards for covered extreme ozone nonattainment areas. A local advisory committee must be established to study compliance feasibility with the current ozone standard. Members of the committee include representatives from the local air agency, energy industry, and agriculture. Each local advisory committee under this subsection shall conduct a study on the feasibility of compliance in the applicable covered extreme ozone nonattainment area with a rule described in subsection (a)(1), taking into account the topography of the area. The local advisory committee must conduct a study on compliance feasibility in the extreme ozone nonattainment area, considering topography, weather, pollution sources, pass-through traffic impact, exceptional events, needed technologies, and natural ozone levels. The study should also address the potential adverse employment impacts and costs of compliance with the rule. The local advisory committee must submit a report on the study results, findings, and recommendations regarding compliance feasibility with the rule in the extreme ozone nonattainment area to the governing board of the local air agency. The governing board will then forward the report to Congress and the Administrator without any changes. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include the Administrator as the head of the EPA, the meaning of \"control\" in relation to the Clean Air Act, the definition of a \"covered extreme ozone nonattainment area,\" and the term \"exceptional event\" as defined in the Clean Air Act.
