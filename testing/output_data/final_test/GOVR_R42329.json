    "content": "During his presidency, President Obama made 32 recess appointments, all to full-time positions. President Clinton made 139 recess appointments, with 95 to full-time positions and 44 to part-time positions. President Bush made 171 recess appointments, 99 full-time and 72 part-time. The top leadership positions in the federal government are typically full-time, appointed through the advice and consent process. Obama's recess appointments included Deputy Attorney General and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative. Part-time positions can also have significant policy-making authority. The Constitution allows the President to make recess appointments during Senate recesses. There is debate over the meaning of \"the Recess of the Senate\" and the distinction between recesses within sessions and between sessions. Congress convenes annually with a sine die adjournment, meaning they adjourn without setting a date for the next meeting. In current practice, a \"recess of the Senate\" can refer to the period between annual sessions or within a session when the Senate does not meet. Intersession recesses were common in early Congress, while intrasession recess appointments were rare before the 1940s. Controversy has arisen over the legitimacy of intrasession recess appointments, with varying legal opinions and academic literature questioning their validity. Recent legal opinions have supported the President's use of recess appointment authority during both intersession and intrasession recesses. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the President can make recess appointments during a recess of 10 days or longer. Controversy arose over the legitimacy of intrasession recess appointments, with questions raised about what constitutes a \"recess\" for exercising this power. The controversy surrounding recess appointments stems from the President's ability to unilaterally fill positions for extended periods. Intrasession recess appointments allow for longer durations compared to intersession appointments. The appointment's duration includes the current session, the following intersession recess, and the subsequent session. This contrasts with intersession recess appointments, which only cover the current recess and the following session. During a session, the President can make a recess appointment to fill a position until near the end of the following session, adding up to a year to the appointment duration. A comparison of recess appointments during the 108th Congress shows the difference in appointment duration based on timing. For example, President George W. Bush appointed Charles W. Pickering during the first session's recess, which expired after less than 11 months. In contrast, William H. Pryor's appointment during the first recess of the second session would have lasted approximately 22 months. During the 109th Congress, President Obama made 6 intersession recess appointments and 26 intrasession recess appointments. Recess appointments have been made to positions in all three branches of government, with the least common being advice and consent positions in the legislative branch. Most recess appointments have been to executive branch positions, but appointments to federal judgeships have been controversial in recent years. President Clinton and President Bush made recess appointments to fill Article III judgeships, with President Clinton appointing Roger L. Gregory and President Bush appointing Charles W. Pickering and William H. Pryor. President Obama also made recess appointments, including one to the legislative branch. The President has made recess appointments to various branches of government, including the legislative branch and executive branch positions. Typically, a recess appointment is preceded by a nomination to the Senate, but this is not always required. Sometimes a different nominee is going through the confirmation process while the recess appointment is made. In some cases, a provision of law may prevent a recess appointee from being paid unless a nomination is submitted after the appointment. Critics argue that making recess appointments before Senate consideration is disrespectful. President Obama's 32 recess appointments were preceded by related nominations, with an average elapsed time of 216 days. In 20 instances, a related nomination was submitted before the recess appointment. In 20 out of 32 cases, Senate confirmed nominees who were previously recess appointed by Obama. 9 nominations were withdrawn by the President, and 3 were returned under Senate rules. Table 3 lists Obama's recess appointments, showing appointee names, positions, and announcement dates. Bold entries indicate intrasession recess appointments. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the President can only make recess appointments during a Senate recess of 10 days or longer. The Senate determines its own recess length, allowing for the possibility of recess appointments. The U.S. Supreme Court validated congressional scheduling to prevent recess appointments by the President. Senate practices in the 112th Congress, including lack of adjournment consent, impacted recess appointments. The Constitution does not specify the length of Senate recess required for recess appointments. Recesses have become shorter over the last century. The length of Senate recesses has become shorter over time, leading to questions about when the President can make recess appointments. The Department of Justice has offered differing views on this issue, with no settled understanding prior to a 2014 U.S. Supreme Court opinion. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty suggested a possible link between the meaning of \"the Recess of the Senate\" and \"adjourn for more than three days\" for recess appointments. Daugherty argued that the President could make a recess appointment during a 29-day intrasession recess, citing constitutional limitations on Senate adjournments. The Department of Justice's 1993 brief in Mackie v. Clinton also supported this argument, stating that a recess of three days or less would raise a closer question regarding recess appointments. The Constitution allows Congress to adjourn for more than three days without House consent. The length of recess is arbitrary and typically requires a concurrent resolution. This resolution specifies the adjournment and reconvening dates for each chamber. The Senate implemented practices during the 110th Congress to prevent recess appointments by holding pro forma sessions. These sessions were short meetings to avoid a recess of more than three days and required no business to be conducted. During the 110th Congress, the Senate held pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments. These sessions were convened during holidays and breaks to avoid recesses longer than three days. President Bush made no recess appointments between the pro forma sessions in November 2007 and the end of his presidency. The Senate did not continue this practice in the 111th Congress. During the 111th Congress, the Senate used pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments due to disagreements between leaders. President Obama did not make any recess appointments during this period. The Senate's procedures during the 110th and 111th Congresses supplemented adjournment practices, with pro forma sessions and concurrent resolutions of adjournment being adopted. During the 112th Congress, the Senate established pro forma sessions by unanimous consent. A new practice emerged where 20 Senators urged the Speaker of the House to refuse resolutions allowing the Senate to recess for more than three days due to concerns over recess appointments by President Obama. During the 112th Congress, Senators aimed to prevent recess appointments by President Obama by avoiding official recesses and using pro forma sessions to maintain control over appointments. During the 112th Congress, Senators aimed to prevent recess appointments by President Obama by avoiding official recesses and using pro forma sessions to maintain control over appointments. The White House announced President Obama's intent to make four recess appointments during a three-day recess between pro forma sessions of the Senate on January 3 and January 6, 2012. The Senate schedule for the period of December 20, 2011, through January 23, 2012, included pro forma sessions with intervening three- and four-day recesses. The second session of the Senate of the 112th Congress began on January 3, 2012. President Obama's recess appointments were made on January 4, 2012, during the first adjournment of the session. The constitutionality of these appointments was challenged, leading to a Supreme Court ruling that the Senate is in session when it says it is, as long as it can conduct business according to its rules. The Supreme Court ruled that the President can only make recess appointments during a recess of 10 days or longer, not during a 3-day recess. The Senate or the House can prevent a recess of 10 days or longer, which is required for recess appointments. The House can block a Senate adjournment of 10 days or more to prevent the President from making recess appointments."
