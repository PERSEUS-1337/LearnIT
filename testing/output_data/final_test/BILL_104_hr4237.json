The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include new procedures for terminating or reducing retiree health benefits. A plan sponsor must petition a court for an authorized representative for retirees before proposing any benefit cuts. The sponsor must provide relevant information to the representative and meet to discuss modifications in good faith. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include new procedures for terminating or reducing retiree health benefits. A plan sponsor must petition a court for an authorized representative for retirees before proposing any benefit cuts. The authorized representative is defined as the designated representative for persons receiving retiree benefits covered by a collective bargaining agreement or not covered by such agreement. Labor organizations are typically the authorized representative for retirees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, unless they choose not to serve or the court decides otherwise. The court can appoint an authorized representative for retired employees if the plan seeks to reduce or terminate retiree benefits, especially when the labor organization does not serve as the representative or the court deems different representation necessary. The court may appoint an authorized representative for retired employees if the plan seeks to reduce or terminate retiree benefits, with the option for the court to order the plan sponsor to pay reasonable expenses to the representative. If an action is brought to challenge the termination or reduction of retiree health benefits, the court will order the plan sponsor to maintain the benefits at the current level. A hearing will be scheduled within fourteen days of the filing, where all interested parties can participate. No security or undertaking is required from participants or beneficiaries for this relief. The court may extend the time for a hearing on retiree health benefits if necessary, and may enter protective orders for the evaluation of plan sponsor proposals. If a benefit plan's termination or reduction leads to legal action by participants or beneficiaries, the court will consider extrinsic evidence to determine the plan's intent. If employee welfare benefit plan documents are unclear about retiree health benefits termination or reduction after retirement or disability, the court will interpret based on extrinsic evidence. If retiree benefits are terminated or reduced after retirement or disability, the plan must prove that the participant was informed at least 90 days prior, that lifetime benefits were not promised, and that the possibility of termination was clearly disclosed. The court must approve a substantial reduction or termination of retiree health benefits only if the collective bargaining agreement explicitly allows it or if the plan sponsor has made a proposal that meets certain requirements and the employees' representative has refused it without good cause. The court can approve reducing or ending retiree health benefits if the collective bargaining agreement permits it or if the plan sponsor proposes it and the employees' representative rejects it without good cause. Retiree health benefits refer to health coverage for retired or disabled employees and their spouses or dependents. Sec. 516 outlines procedures for terminating or significantly reducing retiree health benefits, effective August 1, 1996."
