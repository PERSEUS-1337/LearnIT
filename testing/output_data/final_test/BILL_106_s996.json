    "content": "The Act titled \"Students Learning in Safe Schools Act of 1999\" establishes a Matching Grant Program for School Safety Equipment under Part Y of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. This program authorizes grants for school safety equipment. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance can grant funds to purchase school safety equipment for elementary and secondary schools. Grants are distributed directly to the grantee and must be used for school safety equipment. Preferential consideration may be given to jurisdictions with the greatest need for such equipment. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance can grant funds for school safety equipment to jurisdictions with the greatest need based on lack of access, high violent crime rates, or no previous block grant. In each fiscal year, States and local governments receiving grants under this section must be allocated at least 0.50 percent of the total amount appropriated, with certain territories receiving 0.25 percent. No entity can receive more than 5 percent of the total amount appropriated, and States with their grantees cannot exceed 20 percent. Matching funds for program costs are required. In each fiscal year, States and local governments must be allocated at least 0.50 percent of the total amount appropriated, with certain territories receiving 0.25 percent. No entity can receive more than 5 percent of the total amount appropriated, and States with their grantees cannot exceed 20 percent. Matching funds for program costs are required. The portion of the costs of a program provided by a grant may not exceed 50 percent, and funds appropriated by Congress for law enforcement functions on Indian lands may be used to provide the non-Federal share of a matching requirement.

APPLICATIONS.\" To request a grant under this subpart, the chief executive of a State, local government, Indian tribe, or educational agency must submit an application to the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance with required information. Regulations must be implemented within 90 days to specify application details and requirements. The regulations for grant applications under this subpart must be available on the Department of Justice website, closely linked to information about the program. A unit of local government receiving funding under the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program is ineligible for a grant under this subpart if they submit an application in the same fiscal year. The unit of local government must certify to the Director if they did not use or do not plan to use block grant funds for purchasing school safety equipment. \"SEC. 2513. DEFINITIONS.\" In this subpart, the term 'Indian tribe' is defined as in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. 'School safety equipment' includes metal detectors, video cameras, and other devices for enhancing safety. 'State' refers to the 50 states, DC, Puerto Rico, and other territories.

The Congress encourages the purchase of American-made products with financial assistance. The Senate suggests balancing school security with a conducive learning environment for recipients of assistance. The Institute will develop new weapons detection technologies and safety systems for school settings under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968."
