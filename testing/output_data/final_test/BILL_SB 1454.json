    "title": "SB 1454",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 9.6 is added to the Business and Professions Code, defining terms related to Pharmacy Benefits Management. Improper reimbursement is when a pharmacy benefit manager wrongly requests reimbursement for a drug already authorized. Pharmacist and pharmacy are defined as per Chapter 9, and a pharmacy benefit manager is an entity managing pharmacy benefits. The curr_chunk defines a pharmacy benefit manager as an entity that manages prescription drug benefits, including drug procurement, claims processing, and payment administration. Properly adjudicated means the pharmacist or pharmacy was authorized by the manager to dispense a drug and entitled to payment. A pharmacy benefit manager is prohibited from requiring reimbursement from a pharmacist or pharmacy for a drug dispensed to a patient, except in cases of fraud. Contracts cannot conflict with this prohibition. The pharmacy benefit manager must refund any improper reimbursements received from a pharmacist or pharmacy between January 1, 2012, and January 1, 2017, as per Section 4452. Additionally, Section 4001 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to establish the California State Board of Pharmacy within the Department of Consumer Affairs. The Governor appoints seven pharmacists and four public members to the board. Senate Committee on Rules and Speaker of the Assembly each appoint a public member who is not a licensee of any board under this division. The board overseeing pharmacists' appointments must include at least five actively practicing pharmacists, with representation from various pharmacy settings such as acute care hospitals, independent community pharmacies, chain community pharmacies, and long-term health care facilities. Additionally, a pharmacist from a labor union representing pharmacists must be included in the board. Members of the board overseeing pharmacists' appointments serve four-year terms with a limit of two consecutive terms. Vacancies are filled for the unexpired term. Board members receive per diem and expenses. The section is effective until January 1, 2017, subject to review by the Legislature's policy committees."
