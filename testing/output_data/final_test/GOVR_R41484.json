    "content": "The report provides background and analysis on U.S. rule of law and justice sector assistance programs in Afghanistan. It defines rule of law, discusses the scope of the problem including corruption, and outlines Afghan justice sector institutions. The report also covers U.S., Afghan, and multilateral policy approaches, U.S. funding, and current assistance programs. Issues for Congress include oversight on policy implementation and effectiveness. After decades of conflict and government misrule in Afghanistan, the U.S. and international community began rebuilding the Afghan government's capacity, including rule of law institutions, post-Taliban. Challenges in expanding and strengthening the justice sector persist, impacting U.S. assistance programs and policy oversight. The justice sector in Afghanistan faces challenges such as lack of trained human capital, traditional affiliation patterns, and security issues. The goal of U.S. and multilateral efforts is to support the development of a stable and legitimate Afghan government. The State Department's Inspector General's Office emphasizes the link between governance issues in Afghanistan and U.S. national security, citing the impact on the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and the opium trade. The challenges in Afghanistan's justice sector include deficiencies in national laws, police forces, and judicial systems, as well as high levels of corruption. Without a rule of law (ROL) system, the country cannot progress, hindering efforts to build a stable and legitimate government. Official corruption is pervasive in governance, particularly in law enforcement and the judiciary, impacting all sectors of Afghan society. The legitimacy of Afghan national law is challenged by alternate power structures, including tribal and militia leaders, the Taliban, and major faction or ethnic leaders. Concerns have been raised about Afghans turning to the Taliban justice system due to the absence of effective rule of law. Efforts to address rule of law shortcomings in Afghanistan have become a focus of the Obama Administration's strategy. U.S. policy documents provide a framework for U.S. participation in rule of law operations in Afghanistan. The 2009 Integrated Civilian-Military Campaign Plan and the 2010 Afghanistan and Pakistan Regional Stabilization Strategy prioritize strengthening Afghan rule of law (ROL) and access to justice. The U.S. government has draft strategies addressing ROL and anti-corruption efforts in Afghanistan. The UN Secretary-General defines ROL as governance based on adherence to legal principles and accountability. The concept of Rule of Law (ROL) is defined as governance based on legal principles, accountability, and adherence to international human rights law. It is essential for democracy, economic growth, protection of rights, and requires effective institutions and citizen confidence in its fairness and effectiveness. Absence of government corruption is crucial for establishing effective ROL. Significant government corruption is seen as necessary for establishing effective Rule of Law (ROL) as it upholds the supremacy of law. The justice sector, which includes formal and informal mechanisms, is responsible for implementing ROL. This sector encompasses the legal apparatus of a country, including criminal, civil, and commercial justice sectors, as well as elements from the executive and legislative branches and other public and private institutions. Rule of Law (ROL) is crucial for various institutions like law enforcement agencies, prisons, regulatory bodies, prosecutors' offices, and NGOs. It plays a significant role in counterinsurgency operations and post-conflict situations by establishing legitimate governing authority. Civilian planning efforts also prioritize ROL as a key component for justice and reconciliation. In post-conflict situations, justice and reconciliation are essential components for reconstruction efforts. Transitional justice, which includes processes to address past abuses and promote accountability, justice, and reconciliation, is often a necessary step towards establishing permanent democratic Rule of Law (ROL). This involves capacity building in the criminal justice system, police, judiciary, legal reforms, corrections, and human rights. Transitional justice involves individual prosecutions, reparations, truth-seeking, institutional reform, and rebuilding justice sector institutions in post-conflict situations. Spoilers and opposition forces, including powerful leaders and political figures, may resist efforts that could reduce their political influence and financial interests. This opposition can come from formal groups like political parties and NGOs, as well as informal or illicit groups like insurgents and militias. In Afghanistan, Rule of Law (ROL) programs focus on building the capacity of formal justice institutions. Police and counternarcotics efforts also have ROL components but are often separate from other ROL programs. Support to the Afghan National Police is mainly categorized under security sector assistance. Since the early 2000s, ROL programs in Afghanistan have evolved to include more emphasis on dispute resolution. Corruption in Afghanistan undermines the establishment of Rule of Law (ROL), democratic governance, and economic development. It can lead to inequality and political interference in the justice sector, compromising judicial processes. Corruption in Afghanistan, particularly in the justice sector, undermines impartiality and integrity, fostering a culture of impunity. Widespread corruption erodes public and donor confidence in establishing Rule of Law (ROL) in the country. Studies show that corruption is a significant and growing problem, with Afghanistan being ranked as one of the most corrupt countries in the world. President Karzai is accused of tolerating officials involved in narcotics trade and illicit activities, supporting them for political backing. Cronyism and favoritism were evident when he ousted management of Kabul Bank due to excessive loans to major shareholders, including his brother and the brother of the First Vice President. High-level nepotism and governmental corruption are prevalent in Afghanistan. High-level nepotism and governmental corruption in Afghanistan involve officials demanding bribes for faster processing of official documents, selling provided vehicles and equipment, siphoning off customs revenues, and placing \"no show\" persons on payrolls to pocket their salaries. SIGAR has criticized Afghanistan's Control and Audit Office for being ineffective. The Control and Audit Office in Afghanistan lacks independence to effectively monitor government funds, leading to widespread corruption issues. A survey shows that lower-level corruption greatly impacts the population's perception of the government. Corruption is a top problem in Afghanistan, with bribery affecting half of the population and amounting to $2.5 billion in 2009 alone. The average value of a single administrative bribe in Afghanistan in 2009 was between $156 and $160, with an average of 3.4 to 5 bribes paid per year. Afghan institutions in the justice sector include formal governing institutions and informal dispute resolution mechanisms. Early efforts focused on developing a new Constitution to establish a central government, legislature, and judiciary. Afghanistan's legal infrastructure includes judges, prosecutors, courthouses, prisons, and faculties of law. Limited reach of the formal justice system contributes to ongoing challenges. The formal justice system in Afghanistan, including anti-corruption bodies, has faced controversy and policy discussions. Many Afghans still rely on traditional, local dispute resolution methods due to limited access and distrust in the formal system. The effectiveness of these informal justice systems varies across the country. Under the Afghan Constitution, the central government in Afghanistan has major law enforcement institutions, including the Supreme Court, Courts of Appeals, and primary courts. The Supreme Court, with nine members appointed by the President, ensures that laws align with the Constitution and funds the entire judicial branch. The Supreme Court in Afghanistan, headed by Chief Justice Abdul Salam Azimi, oversees the judicial branch and recommends judge appointments. Azimi, a U.S.-educated reformer, became Chief Justice in 2006. The Attorney General, an independent office, investigates and prosecutes crimes according to the Constitution. The Attorney General's Office (AGO) in Afghanistan, led by Mohammad Ishaq Aloko, prosecutes cases of official corruption. International donors are funding the construction of AGO provincial headquarters in all 34 provinces. Aloko, a Pashtun from Qandahar, was appointed in 2008 after his predecessor was fired for political reasons. A controversy arose in 2010 when Deputy Attorney General Fazel Ahmad Faqriyar was ordered to step down by President Karzai. Deputy Attorney General Fazel Ahmad Faqriyar was fired for refusing to block corruption investigations of high-level officials, including four ministers. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) is responsible for judicial affairs and administering Afghanistan's prison system. Justice Minister Habibullah Ghaleb, a Tajik, was appointed in January 2010. Ghaleb, a Tajik, has held various positions in the Afghan government, including as deputy Attorney General. He was part of Afghanistan's delegation to the 2007 Rome Conference on justice sector rebuilding. The Ministry of Interior oversees domestic security and the Afghan National Police, trained by the US. Corruption within the police forces has eroded trust in the ANP. Some Afghans remember the Ministry's role in suppressing opposition to the Soviet occupation. The current Interior Minister, Bismillah Khan, took office in July 2010 after his predecessor was dismissed over disagreements with President Karzai. Khan, a Tajik, was appointed to restore ethnic balance in the security apparatus. Major anti-corruption and oversight entities in Afghanistan are also discussed. In 2010, concerns over Afghan corruption have led to increased scrutiny of anti-corruption agencies. President Karzai has been accused of hindering investigations into his allies. The establishment of the High Office of Oversight for Anti-Corruption was initiated in 2008. The High Office of Oversight (HOO) was established in 2008 to combat Afghan corruption. President Karzai upgraded its authority in 2009 and granted it direct power to investigate corruption cases in 2010. The U.S. government provided $1 million in assistance to the HOO in FY2009, and an audit by SIGAR in December 2009 highlighted deficiencies in its capacity and independence. The Counter Narcotics Tribunal (CNT) and Anti-Corruption Tribunal (ACT) were established by decree in 2005 under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The CNT prosecutes drug traffickers with 65 Afghan prosecutors and investigators, while the ACT, with 11 judges, tries cases referred by the Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) achieving a 90% conviction rate. The Major Crimes Task Force (MCTF) was established in 2008 to investigate public corruption, organized crime, and kidnapping. It is Afghan-led but funded and mentored by various international agencies including the FBI, DEA, and EU Police Mission. The MCTF headquarters was inaugurated in February 2010. The MCTF, established in 2008 to investigate public corruption, is Afghan-led and funded by international agencies like the FBI, DEA, and EU Police Mission. It has 169 investigators working on 36 cases. The Sensitive Investigative Unit (SIU), led by Afghan police officers trained by the DEA, arrested a Karzai aide for soliciting a bribe in August 2010. Karzai intervened to release the aide but established a commission to oversee the MCTF and SIU. Karzai is protecting his aides and pledged to allow the MCTF and SIU to work without interference. Afghans often use local informal justice mechanisms like shuras or jirgas for disputes. The majority of cases are resolved in the informal justice system, with fewer cases going to state courts. The use of local informal justice mechanisms like shuras or jirgas for disputes in Afghanistan has increased, with fewer cases being taken to state courts due to lack of trust in the formal justice system and logistical difficulties. Non-governmental dispute resolution bodies are seen as more responsive and timely. Traditional practices of dispute resolution, including Pashtun customs like \"nanawati\" and \"shamana,\" are prevalent in the informal sector. These mechanisms are discussed at http://www.khyber.org/articles/2004/JirgaRestorativeJustice.shtml. The informal justice system in Afghanistan is criticized for being male-dominated, with some shuras taking place in Taliban-controlled areas. Efforts to strengthen the rule of law and justice sector in Afghanistan are guided by various strategic frameworks outlined in Afghan documents. These documents outline key objectives, implementation steps, and provide a framework for international donor support. Efforts to strengthen the rule of law in Afghanistan began in 2001 after the Bonn Conference, establishing an interim legal framework and judicial system. Italy led donor support for judicial administration and corrections under the Bonn Agreement. Progress in strengthening the justice sector in Afghanistan post-2001 Bonn Agreement was slow due to issues with the Judicial Reform Commission's collaboration with other justice sector entities and lack of donor support, especially in the corrections sector. Disconnects in donor coordination hindered progress, leading to the perception that the justice sector lagged behind other sectors. Between 2004 and 2006, governance milestones were achieved in Afghanistan, including the signing of the new Afghan Constitution, national elections, and the establishment of a formal Afghan government. These events set the foundation for future support in the Afghan justice sector. The Conference on Afghanistan in 2006 led to the Afghanistan Compact and interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy (iANDS), focusing on governance, rule of law, and human rights. The U.S. government became the largest contributor to justice sector programs, but serious gaps in the Afghan justice system were identified, including a lack of qualified personnel and infrastructure. The Afghan justice system faced challenges with a lack of qualified judges, security issues, and low public confidence. Observers noted problems with judicial education, recruitment, and retention. There were concerns about selective application of justice, lengthy pretrial detentions, and lack of legal defense representation. The United Nations Security Council mission to Afghanistan in December 2006 emphasized the need for prioritizing justice sector support, urging the government to establish rule of law and good governance by replacing corrupt officials and strengthening justice sector institutions. The government was encouraged to enjoy international support and resources for more effective strategic planning, funding, and coordination of rule of law programs. The 2007 Ministerial-Level International Conference on ROL in Afghanistan saw unprecedented pledges of $360 million over five years for justice sector reform. Donors were called upon to increase assistance for the development of Afghanistan's human capital, focusing on civil service reform. The Afghan government released the final Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) in 2008, along with details for justice sector development in the National Justice Sector Strategy (NJSS) and National Justice Program. The ANDS outlined ROL objectives for justice sector development by 2010, including legal framework completion, infrastructure rehabilitation, institution establishment in all provinces, oversight procedure review, and professionalism strengthening. The NJSS and NJP further detailed goals and steps for implementation using donor funds. The international community's relationship with the Afghan government shifted into a new \"transition\" phase after the 2010 London Conference on Afghanistan. In this phase, international actors will continue to support Afghan security and development, but the responsibility will rest with the Afghan government. The Afghan government outlined its security and development goals, including governance and rule of law objectives, in the ANDS Prioritization and Implementation Plan. This phase in justice sector support is marked by increased concern about the extent of assistance. The focus on justice sector support in Afghanistan is driven by concerns about corruption and the informal justice sector. Efforts aim to increase the legitimacy of Afghan governance and institutions, particularly under the Obama Administration. Assistance programs historically target building the capacity of courts and justice agencies. Efforts in Afghanistan focus on developing the justice system's infrastructure, providing training and capacity building. Assistance to law enforcement and counternarcotics sectors has been separate from rule of law (ROL) programs. Recent initiatives aim to improve Afghan access to justice at local levels and bridge formal and informal justice sectors. ROL programs have evolved since 2004 to include a greater emphasis on the informal justice sector, aligning with counterinsurgency strategies. The development of the traditional justice system in Afghanistan is central to the counterinsurgency strategy but controversial for its lack of adherence to human rights standards. International donors find it challenging to influence this system due to its practice in areas outside government control. The State Department's 2010 Regional Stabilization Strategy includes enhancing Afghan rule of law as a key initiative, with objectives such as strengthening traditional justice and capacity building for the formal justice sector. Justice sector reform is a policy priority in U.S. counternarcotics efforts. The U.S. Counternarcotics Strategy for Afghanistan prioritizes justice sector reform, including strategies for Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption. The Rule of Law Strategy focuses on tackling impunity, improving access to justice, supporting corrections reform, and allowing traditional justice systems to re-emerge in cleared areas. The 2010 Afghanistan and Pakistan Regional Stabilization Strategy under the Obama Administration emphasized Rule of Law (ROL) and justice sector support programs. The August 2009 Integrated Civilian-Military Campaign Plan provided guidance on executing the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. The 2010 Afghanistan and Pakistan Regional Stabilization Strategy under the Obama Administration focused on improving access to justice, governance transparency, and countering insurgency, narcotics, corruption, and criminality in Afghanistan. President Obama's strategic review highlighted the importance of counterinsurgency efforts and strengthening the legitimacy of the Afghan government through increased civilian assistance at national, provincial, and local levels. The 2009 strategy in Afghanistan aimed to strengthen the justice sector, combat corruption, and improve service delivery through a combined military and civilian effort. U.S. government agencies involved in this effort include the State Department, Department of Justice, and U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. government agencies involved in Rule of Law (ROL) activities in Afghanistan include USAID, DOD, Department of the Treasury, and DHS. Coordination among these entities has been challenging, highlighting the difficulties policymakers faced in ROL coordination in Afghanistan. The challenges faced in coordinating Rule of Law (ROL) activities in Afghanistan post-2004 were highlighted by the State Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG). The lack of coordination among various international partners and U.S. government agencies led to concerns about wasteful duplication and contradictory legal reform efforts. Efforts to address ROL coordination issues began in 2005 with the establishment of a ROL coordinator position in Kabul. In 2005, a ROL coordinator position was established in Kabul, followed by the appointment of a Special ROL Counselor in early 2006. The ROL coordinator became the main source of information and guidance on ROL matters for the U.S. government in Afghanistan, leading international donor meetings and coordinating with Afghan government officials. The coordinator also chaired a weekly meeting at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to plan and coordinate ROL activities. Under the Obama Administration, the ROL Working Group was renamed to coordinate U.S. government ROL activities. Changes included creating the CDDEA position in 2009 to oversee non-military assistance in Afghanistan, which later split into the CDROLLE position in 2010 specifically for justice sector issues. Ambassador Hans Klemm currently holds the CDROLLE position. The CDROLLE position, held by Ambassador Hans Klemm, is the lead U.S. government representative for rule of law policy in Afghanistan. It is the first time a permanent Ambassador-rank official at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul focuses on rule of law issues. Representatives from various U.S. agencies are under the CDROLLE directorate. Additionally, the military established the Combined Joint Interagency Task Force 435 (CJIATF-435) at Camp Phoenix. CJIATF-435, established in January 2010, focuses on transitioning control of U.S. military detention operations in Afghanistan to the Afghan government. It also expands to develop Afghan investigative, prosecutorial, and judicial capabilities. ROL Field Force (ROLFF) and ROL Interagency Planning and Implementation Team (IPIT) are new entities under CJIATF-435, aimed at providing field capabilities and security in non-permissive areas to build Afghan criminal justice capacity. The CJIATF-435 aims to improve coordination for civilian and military ROL programs in Afghanistan. Challenges include staff turnover, conflicting priorities, and differing capabilities among entities involved. Changes in coordination mechanisms and agency participation may occur under new entities like CDROLLE and CJIATF-435. The U.S. is expanding Rule of Law (ROL) efforts beyond Kabul to provincial and district levels in Afghanistan due to oversaturation of ROL advisors in Kabul and lack of civilian presence elsewhere. This shift is in response to the limited knowledge of the Afghan justice sector outside Kabul and the security challenges at provincial and district levels. The U.S. military has been the main contact for Afghan officials on Rule of Law (ROL) issues outside Kabul due to a lack of civilian presence. Efforts to address this include an increase in civilian ROL advisors and funding, with advisors now located at Regional Training Centers in various Afghan cities. The U.S. military has established a ROL field force in various Afghan cities to support civilian and military ROL projects. Mechanisms are in place to spread and expand ROL programming beyond Kabul, funded by the U.S. government, Afghan government, or the United Nations. U.S. assistance to Afghanistan's justice sector includes training, mentoring, equipping, and infrastructure building, funded through civilian and military appropriations and implemented by various agencies and organizations. The U.S. government, NGOs, and private contractors have increased civilian expenditures on Rule of Law (ROL) support in Afghanistan from $7 million in FY2002 to $411 million in FY2010, totaling $904 million from FY2002 to FY2010. In 2008, the State Department estimated that Afghanistan's justice sector would need over $600 million in additional assistance over the next five years. U.S. ROL funding for programs in Afghanistan, including civilian and military components, is challenging to identify and quantify. Funding for Rule of Law (ROL) programs in Afghanistan is distributed among various U.S. government agencies, making it difficult to track specific costs. ROL funding is often combined with other programs like police training and corrections facilities, leading to confusion and difficulty in identifying duplicate or conflicting programs. Afghans are overwhelmed by the variety of programs implemented by different entities, with funding figures not always matching up. Identifying ROL funding sources and potential program overlaps remains a challenge. Funding for Rule of Law (ROL) programs in Afghanistan is complex due to multiple U.S. government agencies involved. Non-Defense Department foreign assistance for ROL activities is mainly funded by the Economic Support Fund (ESF) and International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE). DOD ROL efforts receive funding from the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) and the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF). Estimates of total U.S. government spending on ROL assistance have limitations due to differing criteria and incomplete data. Estimates of Rule of Law (ROL) programming in Afghanistan vary across agencies due to different funding sources and tracking methodologies. U.S. assistance to the Afghan justice sector has increased since FY2002, with the U.S. becoming the largest foreign donor in this sector. The scope of U.S. expenditure in ROL programs remains unclear. In FY2002, the U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated $7 million for ROL programming. U.S. assistance totaled $160 million from FY2002 to FY2007, with a significant increase in the following years. International donors also pledged financial contributions at the 2007 Rome Conference, exceeding prior commitments. It is uncertain if these contributions will meet the Afghan need for ROL assistance. The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated $7 million for ROL programming in FY2002, with assistance totaling $160 million from FY2002 to FY2007. International donors pledged financial contributions at the 2007 Rome Conference, but it is uncertain if these will meet the Afghan need for ROL assistance. The scope of U.S. ROL programs in Afghanistan is broad and includes major justice sector programs, selected other justice sector programs, and cross-cutting ROL programs funded by the State Department, USAID, and DOD. These programs are crucial for the success of the justice sector in Afghanistan. The major U.S.-funded justice sector programs in Afghanistan include the Judicial Sector Support Program (JSSP), the Corrections System Support Program (CSSP), the ROL Stabilization (RLS) Program, and the Senior Federal Prosecutors Program. These programs are managed and funded by the State Department's INL Bureau and USAID. The RLS program, which started in mid-2010, has two sub-program elements focusing on the formal and informal justice sectors. DOD also funds various ROL projects, although they are not centralized under a specific program. The State Department's INL Bureau funds U.S. government justice sector support in Afghanistan through programs like the Justice Sector Support Program (JSSP). JSSP focuses on building the capacity of Afghanistan's criminal justice system through training and mentoring of justice sector personnel. This includes support for prosecution and defense services, the Attorney General's Office, and the Ministry of Justice. Other areas of support include access to justice, gender justice, anti-corruption, legislative drafting, legal education, and public legal services. JSSP funds U.S. justice sector advisors and Afghan legal consultants with experience in the criminal justice system. The Justice Sector Support Program (JSSP) in Afghanistan trains and mentors justice professionals, including judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and police. Over 2,000 professionals have been trained since 2005 in various provinces. JSSP advisor teams are located in Kabul, Herat, Balkh, Kunduz, Nangarhar, and Paktiya, with plans to expand to Kandahar and Bamyan. The program supports the Attorney General's Office (AGO) through training, mentoring, and advising on issues like anti-corruption and gender justice. JSSP provides support to the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) on various issues such as anti-corruption enforcement, police-prosecutor coordination, gender issues, administrative and legal reform. They develop a curriculum for training Afghan prosecutors, focusing on gender justice and anti-corruption. Other projects include mentoring defense attorneys, capacity building for legal defense organizations, and holding provincial justice conferences to promote access to justice. Advisors outside Kabul focus on police-prosecutor training. The Corrections System Support Program (CSSP) provides civilian-led corrections assistance in Afghanistan, addressing issues such as poorly trained staff, inadequate pay, and crumbling buildings in the Afghan corrections system. CSSP was established in 2006 as a standalone program to address the growing prisoner population in Afghanistan. CSSP aims to improve the Afghan corrections system by training staff, improving facilities, and implementing a prisoner tracking system to prevent prolonged detention. CSSP supports the Afghan corrections system by constructing new facilities, renovating existing ones, and providing training and equipment. This includes projects like the renovation of Pol-i-Charkhi Prison and funding for the Counternarcotics Justice Center in Kabul. Other assistance projects focus on pay and rank reform for corrections officers, addressing the needs of vulnerable prisoner populations, and developing vocational industries for prisoners. CSSP is establishing a new mobile team with approximately 60 corrections advisors to assess prisons in collaboration with CJIATF-435. Over 3,800 Afghan corrections staff have received training in basic, advanced, and specialized courses, including emergency response team training and programs for female inmates. Training is conducted at centers in Kabul and Regional Training Centers, with completion of basic training required for participation in pay reform programs. The ROL Stabilization (RLS) program is USAID's follow-on to the Afghanistan ROL Project (ARoLP), focusing on the formal and informal justice sectors. It aims to improve the capacity of the formal court system and raise citizens' awareness of their legal rights. The RLS program, a follow-on to ARoLP, focuses on improving the formal court system in Afghanistan. It includes implementing the Afghanistan Case Assignment System (ACAS) to track and assign cases to judges, strengthening the Supreme Court's capacity to monitor judges, and expanding training and vetting efforts for corruption cases. Planned support includes judicial administrative reform, infrastructure assistance, and training at various levels. The RLS program in Afghanistan aims to improve the formal court system by providing assistance and training at different levels. It includes support for legal study tours, curriculum development, and immediate access to justice through shuras in specific districts. Planned activities involve linking informal and formal justice sectors, facilitating case referrals, and mapping the operation of justice sector facilities. The DOJ program in Afghanistan, funded by the State Department's INL Bureau, sends prosecutors to provide legal mentoring and training to combat corruption, drug trafficking, and serious crimes. They focus on training the Afghan Criminal Justice Task Force (CJTF) and the Afghan Major Crimes Task Force (MCTF) to address narcotics cases, corruption, kidnapping, and organized crime. Additionally, DOJ supports the Attorney General Office's anti-corruption unit (ACU) and provides various training programs. The DOJ program in Afghanistan, funded by the State Department's INL Bureau, sends prosecutors to provide legal mentoring and training to combat corruption, drug trafficking, and serious crimes. They support the Attorney General Office's anti-corruption unit (ACU) and provide training initiatives for provincial judges, prosecutors, and investigators at Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) and Regional Training Center (RTC) locations outside of Kabul. DOJ attorneys have assisted Afghan officials with drafting key legal documents, including counternarcotics, military courts, counterterrorism, and extradition laws. The Senior Federal Prosecutors Program also provides criminal law advice to the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan and Afghan government leadership. As of October 2010, there are eight DOJ attorneys based in Kabul participating in the program. The DOJ program in Afghanistan, funded by the State Department's INL Bureau, sends prosecutors to provide legal mentoring and training to combat corruption, drug trafficking, and serious crimes. The program aims to expand from seven to 21 U.S. federal prosecutors by the end of 2011. The FBI also provides criminal investigatory training and mentoring initiatives to Afghan entities. The U.S. military supports the justice sector in Afghanistan through various initiatives at provincial and district levels, including Key Leader Engagement meetings with justice sector officials. The U.S. military supports the development of justice sector infrastructure in Afghanistan through various initiatives, including training and security measures for judges and courts. Funds from the Commander's Emergency Response Program are used to improve provincial and district level judicial systems by building or rehabilitating prisons, detention facilities, and courthouses. Training efforts, such as the Continuing Legal Education program, are provided to local justice sector officials by the U.S. military's CJTF-101 and Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The U.S. military supports justice sector infrastructure in Afghanistan through various initiatives, including training and security measures for judges and courts. The Defense Department is involved in police-justice sector integration and supports training and mentoring for Afghan corrections through CJIATF-435. CJIATF-435, a follow-on to JTF-435, supports the Afghan government in various Rule of Law (ROL) activities, including developing investigative, prosecutorial, and judicial capabilities. Other agencies also provide ROL assistance programs funded by the State Department. The FBI supports the Major Crimes Task Force (MCTF) in Afghanistan to investigate public corruption and organized crime. The DEA funds the Afghan Sensitive Investigations Unit (SIU) for drug-related and corruption cases. The U.S. Marshals Service provides judicial security for the Counternarcotics Judicial Center (CNJC) in Kabul. USAID plans to support the High Office of Oversight (HOO) from FY2011 to FY2013. USAID plans to provide the High Office of Oversight (HOO) $30 million between FY2011 and FY2013 to build capacity at central and provincial levels. By the end of the first quarter of 2010, USAID will have provided $1.4 million in start-up assistance to the HOO, covering salaries for senior staff and information technology systems. Plans also include support for HOO to decentralize alongside the establishment of regional Anti Corruption Tribunals. Additionally, the University of Washington and the International Association of Women Judges offer legal education support to Afghan law professors. The International Association of Women Judges (IAWJ) supports Afghan women in the legal profession with funding from the State Department's INL Bureau. The U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) has conducted studies on the informal justice sector in Afghanistan, funded by the same bureau. Multilateral Trust Funds address salary reform for justice sector personnel, with additional crosscutting efforts to strengthen rule of law goals. Crosscutting efforts impact ROL goals in Afghanistan, including programs to strengthen governance, anti-corruption, women's issues, counternarcotics, and Afghan security forces. Corruption undermines international ROL efforts, with the US combating corruption and supporting the justice sector. The US government is involved in various anti-corruption efforts with positive outcomes for ROL in Afghanistan. NATO established an anti-corruption task force in 2010 to address defense contractor fund allegations. A task force has been established to prevent defense contractor funds from being siphoned off by corrupt entities in Afghanistan. The US is focusing on tracking corruption-related finances and has issued anti-corruption directives for officials in the country. USAID's Economic Growth and Governance Initiative aims to streamline business procedures and improve regulation in various sectors to combat corruption. The USAID's Trade Access and Facilitation in Afghanistan project aims to simplify customs clearance processes to reduce trading time and opportunities for corruption. Afghanistan's civil service capacity is weak, hindering efforts to strengthen the rule of law and justice sector. The lack of educated human capital limits the implementation of programs and delivery of public services. The USAID administers the Afghanistan Civil Service Support program to train civil servants in public administration. Over 15,000 training sessions are planned to improve civil service development at national and sub-national levels in various functions. Analysts note that government capacity is stronger in Kabul than at provincial and district levels. To address this, USAID also administers the Local Governance and Community Development program. The USAID administers programs like the Local Governance and Community Development program to build governance capacity at provincial and district levels in Afghanistan. Concerns about vulnerabilities in the financial regulatory system have raised worries about money laundering through Afghan financial channels. The Department of the Treasury provides technical assistance in this regard. The Department of the Treasury provides technical assistance to Afghanistan's central bank's Financial Intelligence Unit to oversee the financial sector and combat financial crimes. USAID administers the Land Reform in Afghanistan project to address land and property disputes and reduce corruption in land transactions. USAID supports various programs to assist the Afghan National Assembly in improving institutional checks and balances through the legislative branch. This includes the Afghanistan Parliamentary Assistance Program (APAP) which helps the Budget Committee understand and oversee the budgeting process. Another program assists the National Economic Commission in adopting modern economic legislation and conducting cost-benefit analysis. Additionally, the State Department provides support for women's issues through programs like Increasing Women's Rights and Access to Justice in Afghanistan. The State Department funds programs in Afghanistan to train law enforcement officials on gender-sensitive interpretations of penal code sections affecting women, investigate and prosecute human trafficking cases, and improve victim identification and referral mechanisms. This is part of the U.S. government's counternarcotics strategy in Afghanistan. The State Department, DOJ, DEA, and DOD have programs to enhance the Afghan judicial system for counternarcotics, training prosecutors, and building infrastructure for arresting drug traffickers. DEA supports specialized counternarcotics units within the Afghan police with State Department and DOD funding. The Afghan National Police work with various US agencies on counternarcotics investigations and receive support from the DOD. The ANP is trained, equipped, and mentored through different programs to improve security and rule of law in Afghanistan. The current Administration policy focuses on enhancing Afghan governance. The current Administration policy emphasizes improving Afghan governance to stabilize the country. Weak Afghan government performance and lack of transparency are raising concerns about the effectiveness of U.S. strategy. Congress is actively involved in overseeing U.S. policy in Afghanistan, including funding for rule of law programs. Recent corruption allegations in Afghanistan have implications for congressional funding. Recent Afghan corruption allegations have raised concerns about U.S. assistance to Afghanistan, particularly in FY2011, with allegations of corrupt officials pocketing aid funds. Congress is worried about waste, fraud, and diversion of aid funds, and the future of U.S. support to Afghan rule of law programs is under scrutiny. In June 2010, Representative Nita Lowey announced a hold on U.S. aid to Afghanistan due to concerns about corruption. Congressional hearings in July 2010 addressed the issue, acknowledging corruption as a major obstacle to reconstruction efforts. Representative Dave Obey also expressed concerns about corruption in 2009. The House Appropriations Committee raised concerns about corruption in Afghanistan and the need for measurable benchmarks for anti-corruption efforts. There is a policy debate on the importance of fighting corruption compared to other U.S. strategic priorities in Afghanistan. Questions include the extent of U.S. involvement in combating corruption, the priority of anti-corruption efforts, and how investigations should be conducted and resolved. The Obama Administration's policy on Afghanistan addresses these issues. The Obama Administration emphasizes the need to combat corruption within the Afghan government, stating that a \"blank check\" will no longer be provided if corruption persists. Anti-corruption efforts are seen as crucial in improving Afghan perceptions of government legitimacy and transparency, as well as plugging serious corruption-related leaks. Recent Afghan investigations by U.S.-supported agencies show potential improvements in combating corruption. However, high-profile cases targeting Karzai supporters have strained U.S.-Karzai relations and may undermine anti-corruption progress. Some suggest avoiding investigations of high-level Afghan officials to maintain diplomatic relations, despite risking perceptions of corruption among Afghans. Some argue that combating corruption in Afghanistan requires a long-term U.S. commitment, as high-level corrupt officials may be seen as exempt from Afghan law. The effectiveness of U.S. assistance programs to support the rule of law in Afghanistan is questioned, with reports from various agencies highlighting challenges in absorbing and utilizing such assistance. Reports on the status of U.S. rule of law efforts in Afghanistan show progress but also highlight limitations in strengthening the Afghan justice sector. Challenges include low literacy rates hindering recruitment of personnel and retention issues due to better job opportunities with donor countries and NGOs. The 2010 State Department OIG report highlighted tensions between U.S. goals for rule of law in Afghanistan and the Afghan government's capacity. Concerns included the lack of approved strategies, coordination between the U.S. Embassy and Provincial Reconstruction Teams, and reporting on rule of law activities. The State Department's OIG report noted challenges in Afghan anti-corruption institutions and oversight bodies, hindering effective rule of law development. U.S. efforts to support Afghan ROL include focus on informal justice sectors and improving access to justice at local levels, facing unique challenges due to program scale and gaps in justice sector capacity. The absence of security and entrenched corruption in Afghanistan hinders the effectiveness of U.S. projects in improving the justice system. There are concerns about funding U.S. programs supporting the informal justice sector and the level of international involvement in ensuring equitable justice. Some view supporting the traditional justice sector as a way to build ties with local leaders for the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy. The debate over U.S. support for the informal justice sector in Afghanistan continues, with differing opinions on its impact on building a democratic Afghanistan. Some argue that supporting traditional justice could hinder long-term objectives, while others believe it is vital for the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy. International officials question the scope of reforming these mechanisms within the stabilization mission. Lawmakers are concerned about the strategic focus on improving Afghan access to justice and funding for the informal justice sector. The debate over U.S. support for the informal justice sector in Afghanistan continues, with differing opinions on its impact on building a democratic Afghanistan. Some argue that supporting traditional justice could hinder long-term objectives, while others believe it is vital for the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy. U.S. efforts to support rule of law (ROL) and anti-corruption in Afghanistan have evolved since 2001, with a focus on strengthening and expanding Afghan justice institutions. The debate continues on the effectiveness of U.S. support for rule of law (ROL) efforts in Afghanistan, with concerns raised about the long-term effectiveness of current initiatives. Observers question whether the increased U.S. commitment and resources will lead to the development of a stable Afghan government. The State Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) highlighted the professionalism of U.S. efforts but raised doubts about their impact. The effectiveness of U.S. support for rule of law efforts in Afghanistan is being questioned, with concerns about long-term success and sustainability. Reports highlight little enduring progress despite significant investment, and doubts remain about the development of a functional formal justice system. The 112th Congress may address these issues in the context of the Obama Administration's strategy review. The 112th Congress may address long-term issues in Afghanistan within the context of the Obama Administration's strategy review in mid-2011, along with potential decision points on appropriations and budget requests."
