    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 11165.1 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to require health care practitioners to submit an application to access online information on a patient's controlled substance history. The Department of Justice will release the electronic history of controlled substances dispensed to a patient under the practitioner's care based on data from the CURES Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. A pharmacist must submit an application to access a patient's controlled substance history online before January 1, 2016, or upon licensure. The Department of Justice will provide access to the electronic history of controlled substances dispensed to the patient under the pharmacist's care from the CURES PDMP. An individual designated by a board, bureau, or program within the Department of Consumer Affairs may submit an application to access a licensee's controlled substance history online for investigating alleged substance abuse. The Department of Justice will release the electronic history of controlled substances dispensed to the licensee based on data from the CURES PDMP. The application must show probable cause of a violation of controlled substances laws. A designated individual does not need to apply to access CURES PDMP information. Reasons for denial or suspension include falsifying applications, lack of controls for patient activity reports, revoked DEA registration, or arrest for drug-related offenses. Any authorized subscriber accessing CURES database must notify the Department of Justice of any account changes within 30 days. Health care practitioners or pharmacists can comply with this requirement by being approved to access the database through the process outlined in the Business and Professions Code. The Department of Justice guidelines govern requests for controlled substance history. To prevent misuse, practitioners may receive dispensing history from CURES. This information is considered medical data under the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. Information on a patient's controlled substance history, including prescriptions for specific controlled substances, can be accessed by authorized subscribers through CURES."
