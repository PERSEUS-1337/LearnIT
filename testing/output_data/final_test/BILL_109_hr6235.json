The Congress established the Office of Women's Health within the FDA, which now reports within the Office of Science and Health Coordination. The FDA requested manufacturers of silicone breast implants to provide data on implant rupture rates in a draft guidance issued in January 2004. A 2000 study by FDA researchers found that 69% of women with silicone breast implants had ruptures, and 21% experienced gel migration. Manufacturers have not followed FDA guidance on reporting rupture rates. In a study published in the American Journal of Surgical Pathology in April 2005, 90% of women with silicone implants had silicone droplets in their lymph nodes, with 95% showing abnormal cells. This was compared to only 33% of women who had breast cancer surgery without implants. In 2003, the U.S. government settled with breast implant manufacturers for reimbursement of medical expenses. The FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations is looking into a manufacturer for submitting inaccurate data on ruptures and failing to ensure compliance with FDA restrictions. Barr Laboratories submitted applications for approval of the contraceptive drug Plan B. The FDA rejected Barr Laboratories' initial application for Plan B due to concerns about increased promiscuity among women under 16. Barr then submitted a new application for over-the-counter sales to women 16 and older, but the FDA expressed regulatory concerns about age-based sales. The FDA rejected Barr Laboratories' initial application for Plan B due to concerns about increased promiscuity among women under 16. In 2004, it was revealed that the FDA Commissioner had decided against approving Plan B before FDA staff could complete their analysis. Another FDA official was told that Plan B needed to be rejected to appease the administration's constituents. The FDA Commissioner recommended that the appropriate age range for over-the-counter Plan B is 18 and older. The FDA Commissioner recommended an age restriction of 18 and older for over-the-counter Plan B, despite lacking scientific data to support this decision. A former FDA Commissioner delayed approving Plan B for over-the-counter sales to figure out how to restrict sales to young teens. A study found that young women can use Plan B effectively and safely without healthcare provider intervention. The Governmental Accountability Office criticized the decision to deny OTC status to Plan B as unusual. The decision to restrict over-the-counter access to Plan B to only those over a certain age was made at a higher level within the FDA, overruling recommendations by professional staff and prior to completing the regular review process. The FDA established the Office of Women's Health. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to establish the Office of Women's Health within the FDA, headed by a director reporting directly to the Commissioner, with duties related to women's health activities. The Office of Women's Health within the FDA is responsible for assessing agency activity, setting goals, and overseeing activities related to prevention, research, education, service delivery, and policy development. SEC. 4. SCIENCE ON BREAST IMPLANTS. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include a new section on breast implants. In the context of breast implants, the Secretary must ensure safety for the lifetime of the device before approval. Requirements for clinical care, removal, and replacement must be defined, along with coverage by government health care systems. Life of the implant and follow-up care details must be clearly outlined in all materials. The Secretary must report to Congress within 30 days of approving a breast implant application, summarizing safety and effectiveness findings. Membership on advisory committees must adhere to conflict of interest rules, with notices posted before adding new members. The Secretary must post a notice on the Administration's website when adding a new committee member, including their background. The individual cannot participate in meetings until 30 days after the notice. Additionally, a study on platinum ionization in silicone breast implants will be conducted to assess potential risks. A panel of independent scientists, including experts from the CDC and NIH, will design and conduct a study on breast implants. The definition of a breast implant is a device intended for breast augmentation or reconstruction with a filler material other than sterile saline. Scientific workshop on emergency contraception use by women under age 18. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will convene a scientific workshop to review data on emergency contraception use by females under 18. Participants will include representatives from various medical organizations and agencies. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will convene a scientific workshop to review data on emergency contraception use by females under 18. Participants will include representatives from medical organizations, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, scientific and clinical researchers, and the appropriate review divisions of the Food and Drug Administration."
