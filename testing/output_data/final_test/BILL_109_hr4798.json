    "content": "The \"California Perchlorate Contamination Remediation Act\" aims to provide grants for remediation of perchlorate contamination in water sources, fund research for remediation technologies, and urge the establishment of a national drinking water standard for perchlorate. The Act defines key terms such as Administrator, California water authority, Fund, and State. It establishes the California Perchlorate Cleanup Fund and provides grants for perchlorate remediation. The California Perchlorate Cleanup Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States, consisting of appropriated amounts and interest earned. The Secretary of the Treasury can transfer necessary amounts for grants under subsections (b) and (c) upon request by the Administrator. Administrative expenses are limited to 0.4 percent of the Fund. The California Perchlorate Cleanup Fund allows up to 0.4 percent for administrative expenses. The Secretary of the Treasury can invest the remaining amount in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The California Perchlorate Cleanup Fund allows the Secretary of the Treasury to invest in US obligations. The Fund can purchase outstanding obligations or sell them at market price. Interest and proceeds from obligations go back into the Fund. Cleanup grants are provided to California water authorities for contaminated water sources, with a maximum total amount of $50,000,000. The California Perchlorate Cleanup Fund provides grants to water authorities for contaminated sources, with a federal share not exceeding 50%. Eligibility excludes authorities responsible for contamination, with priority given to activities in specific regions like Santa Clara Valley and Santa Ana River watershed. The Administrator will provide grants up to $8,000,000 for research and development of perchlorate remediation technologies to qualified non-Federal entities. Each grant will not exceed $1,000,000. The Act does not impact existing Federal or State agency programs. Congress recommends establishing a national drinking water standard for perchlorate promptly. $58,000,000 is authorized for Act implementation."
