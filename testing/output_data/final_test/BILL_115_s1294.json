    "content": "The Act titled \"Native American Education Opportunity Act\" establishes the Native American Education Opportunity Program under the Education Amendments of 1978. This program includes Bureau funding of tribal-based education savings account programs. The Act authorizes the disbursement of funds to Tribes for education savings account programs for ESA eligible students starting from the 2018-2019 school year. Tribes can award grants to these students who have applied for participation on or after January 1, 2018. \"A Tribe can partner with a nonprofit entity to manage education savings accounts. Funds can be used for private school expenses, educational materials, tutoring, and services.\" The Secretary of the Interior can disburse funds to Tribes for education savings accounts, which can be used for various educational expenses such as tutoring, special needs services, online learning programs, technology, examination fees, and transportation. The amount disbursed is based on the grant provided by the Tribe to the education savings account of the eligible student. The Secretary of the Interior can disburse funds to Tribes for education savings accounts, which can be used for various educational expenses. Tribes must allocate funds to ESA eligible students and limit administration costs to 15%. Up to 50% of a student's grant can rollover in the account. ESA eligible students can roll over more than 50% of their grant amount for the following school year. The Secretary includes all ESA eligible students in calculations for total eligible Indian students. Grants awarded to ESA eligible students are considered assistance to the student, not the school. An ESA eligible student is defined as an elementary or secondary school student who attended a Bureau-funded school in the previous semester or a child eligible to attend a Bureau-funded school for kindergarten or any elementary school grade in the upcoming semester. An ESA eligible student must not be attending a Bureau-funded school, receiving an education savings account from another Tribe, or attending a public elementary or secondary school while participating in a Tribe's education savings account program. The student must also meet the eligibility requirements of the Tribe's program. An ESA eligible student who is an enrolled member of a Tribe and applies for the education savings account program will meet requirements until graduation or age 21. The program allows a parent to control an account to purchase goods and services for the student's education. The curr_chunk discusses definitions of terms related to an education savings account program for ESA eligible students, including the definition of a parent and a Tribe. It also mentions a conforming amendment to a section of the Education Amendments of 1978 and a GAO study to review the implementation of amendments made by the Act. The Act requires a review of amendments impacting education savings account programs, with a report to be submitted to specific committees and published."
