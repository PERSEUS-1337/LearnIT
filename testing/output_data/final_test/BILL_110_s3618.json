    "content": "The Act titled \"Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2008\" focuses on advanced heavy-duty hybrid vehicle technology research, development, demonstration, and commercial application programs. The curr_chunk defines terms related to heavy-duty hybrid vehicles, including \"advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicle,\" \"greenhouse gas,\" and \"plug-in hybrid vehicle.\" The Secretary of Energy will establish a program for research, development, and demonstration of advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles. Grants will be provided to eligible applicants for projects advancing technology in this area. Application requirements will be set by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish selection criteria for awarding grants under the program, giving priority to applicants who can fill research gaps and achieve technological advances beyond current state. The Secretary will establish selection criteria for awarding grants under the program, prioritizing applicants who can achieve the greatest reduction in fuel consumption and emissions. Applicants may partner with other entities, and the application deadline is 90 days after the publication request. The Secretary will select grant recipients based on technical merits within 90 days of the application deadline. The program will award a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 7 grants, with at least half focused on plug-in hybrid vehicle technology. The program will award grants to promote plug-in hybrid vehicle technology, with a maximum of $3,000,000 per recipient per year for a 3-year project. Recipients must complete 2 phases, including research and demonstration of advanced hybrid technology. Upon completion of phase 1, the recipient must submit a report to the Secretary detailing the performance of each vehicle in testing procedures, components like the battery and charging system, projected costs, and emission levels, including greenhouse gases. The Secretary may terminate the grant program if the recipient cannot complete phase 2 successfully. Phase 1 starts upon receiving the grant and lasts for 1 year. Standard testing procedures for vehicle performance will be developed by the Secretary. Phase 2 of the grant program involves demonstrating advanced manufacturing processes by producing or retrofitting 50 advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles. A report analyzing technological challenges in vehicle development and mass production must be submitted to the Secretary within 60 days of completing phase 2. Phase 2 of the grant program involves mass producing 50 advanced heavy duty hybrid vehicles. Research will be conducted on alternative power train designs for these vehicles, comparing costs and benefits. The Secretary will compare the performance (including emissions, fuel savings, miles driven, idle time, horsepower requirements, and other relevant factors) of hybrid power train designs with nonhybrid designs. A report to Congress will be submitted within 60 days of receiving grant reports, detailing grant recipients, funded projects, and applicant information. The Secretary will analyze data from grant recipients, including vehicles produced, fuel efficiency, and research results. Coordination with other programs and cost sharing are required. Additionally, an Electrical Grid Research Pilot Program will be conducted through National Laboratories and Technology Centers. The Department of Energy will establish a pilot program to research the effects of widespread plug-in hybrid vehicles on the electric power grid. $16,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2011, with limitations on how the funds can be used. SEC. 3. EXPANDING RESEARCH IN HYBRID TECHNOLOGY FOR LARGE VEHICLES. Amends the United States Energy Storage Competitiveness Act of 2007 to include vehicles over 16,000 pounds in research for hybrid technology."
