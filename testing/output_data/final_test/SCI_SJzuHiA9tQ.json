The difficulty arises from the generator distribution evolution and neural networks' forgetting tendency. To address this, continual learning techniques can be used to enhance the discriminator's ability to recognize previous generator samples, making GAN training a more realistic benchmark. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are effective for modeling complex distributions, with the generator mapping a latent space to data distribution. GANs involve a discriminator and generator competing, yielding impressive results in image synthesis and language modeling tasks. The methods proposed require minimal model changes, add little computation, and improve overall performance. Synthesized images from GAN models are sharper and more realistic than other models, but GAN training can be finicky due to mode collapse. Mode collapse occurs when the generator maps the latent space to a limited subset of the real data space, leading to a never-ending game between the generator and discriminator. The generator in GAN models can revisit collapsed modes over time due to catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. The discriminator's ability to recognize these modes may diminish as it learns new tasks, leading to oscillation phenomena. In GANs, the distribution of the generator class evolves adversarially over time, causing the discriminator to learn tasks sequentially. Without measures to prevent catastrophic forgetting, the discriminator's ability to recognize fake samples from previous iterations diminishes, allowing a collapsed generator to revisit old modes indefinitely. Training the GAN discriminator as a continual learning problem is crucial to prevent catastrophic forgetting and ensure the generator learns the true distribution. This reframing of the GAN problem allows for leveraging relevant methods to match the dynamics of training the min-max objective, such as elastic weight consolidation and intelligent synapses. By preserving the discriminator's ability to identify previous generator samples, memory prevents revisiting past distributions, improving GAN performance without extra networks. Experiments show discriminator continual learning leads to better generations by matching data distributions through a neural network generator. The generator synthesizes data drawn from a distribution without explicitly assuming its form. A binary classifier is trained to distinguish between synthesized and real samples, incentivizing the generator to produce samples that resemble real data. This min-max objective aims to make the synthesized distribution approach the real data distribution. The generator produces samples to fool the discriminator, updating parameters alternately to maximize the GAN loss. Over time, the generator may revert to generating samples the discriminator previously recognized, due to neural network forgetting. The discriminator in GAN training may forget how to recognize certain samples, causing unstable oscillations. To address this, training the discriminator with the temporal component of the generated samples can help mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Methods like elastic weight consolidation (EWC) and intelligent synapses (IS) can improve GAN learning by reducing forgetting, potentially leading to better training outcomes with minimal computational cost. Elastic weight consolidation (EWC) is a method that prevents a model from deviating too far from important parameters for a previous task while learning a new task. It involves approximating the posterior for each task as a Gaussian distribution and adding EWC terms to the loss for each previous task. EWC and IS BID39 are methods that protect important parameters for previous tasks while learning new ones. EWC adds terms to the loss for each previous task, while IS BID39 assigns importance measures to parameters based on their impact on reducing loss during training. In GANs, the discriminator is trained on a dataset, but the generator's evolution changes the distribution over time, violating the i.i.d. assumption. This leads to the introduction of an importance measure \u03c9 1,i for Task 1 parameters, similar to EWC's Fisher information matrix terms. The evolution of the generator in GANs changes the distribution over time, violating the i.i.d. assumption. Different instances of the generator should be seen as separate tasks in continual learning. Applying continual learning methods to the discriminator is challenging due to the lack of a clear definition of tasks in GANs and the uncertainty of task duration. Continual learning methods face challenges in GANs due to the lack of clear task definitions and uncertain task durations. Extending computational memory for multiple tasks becomes impractical for larger models, especially when the number of tasks increases. Without a forgetting mechanism, early iterations of the discriminator may be non-optimal, leading to poor initialization. The unconstrained addition of regularization terms can disincentivize further changes in model parameters. To address challenges in GANs with continual learning, changes are proposed such as determining the number of tasks based on a rate \u03b1 instead of arbitrary divisions. An online memory approach is suggested to avoid storing extra parameters. Models with EWC and IS augmentations are named EWC-GAN and IS-GAN. The classifier loss for the (k + 1) th task is defined with quadratic forms. The inclusion of (\u22061,i) 2 is omitted to prevent loss explosion and collapse as tasks increase. Hyperparameter c is changed to control forgetting in EWC-GAN and IS-GAN models. A discount factor \u03b3 is added to limit memory of past discriminator versions, with \u03b1 and \u03b3 determining memory depth and \u03bb controlling memory importance. Terms S k and P k can be updated online every \u03b1 steps to apply EWC or IS loss without storing extra parameters. The proposed framework introduces methods to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in GANs by using a single variable for running averages, augmenting the discriminator with continual learning loss, and applying historical averaging. These techniques make the method space efficient and applicable to a wide range of GAN setups. Previous work has explored continual learning in GANs through methods like historical averaging and simulated+unsupervised training. The proposed method aims to address catastrophic forgetting in GANs by incorporating continual learning techniques, such as using a historical buffer of samples and distilling a network's knowledge over time into a single network. Other approaches have explored using multiple generators or discriminators, as well as applying Bayesian methods to GANs. The Unrolled GAN method considered multiple discriminators \"unrolled\" through time, similar to the proposed method utilizing historical instances of discriminators for continual learning. EWC-GAN and IS-GAN preserve important parameters for prior discriminator performance, making them easier to implement and train. GAN convergence, although not the focus here, helps avoid mode collapse with works on the topic. EWC and IS regularization in GAN can be seen as achieving convergence by slowing the discriminator per parameter. The text discusses catastrophic forgetting in a GAN discriminator, showing it concretely by training a DCGAN on the MNIST dataset and creating a \"fake MNIST\" dataset. Despite a dropoff with EWC, forgetting is less severe, and the training setup mirrors typical GAN processes. The training setup for GAN in this study mirrors continual learning literature, proposing GAN as a new benchmark for more realistic settings. While EWC helps, there is room for improvement with new continual learning methods. GAN as a benchmark offers advantages beyond difficulty, especially in scenarios where data distribution evolves slowly and updating models without forgetting previous performance is crucial. In scenarios where data distribution evolves slowly, updating models without forgetting previous performance is crucial. GAN synthesized samples offer an opportunity to generate evolving datasets for experiments, ensuring sustained effectiveness in tasks like autonomous vehicles encountering unseen obstacles and airport screening systems dealing with evolving threats. In scenarios where data distribution evolves slowly, updating models without forgetting previous performance is crucial. One could use a conditional GAN to generate an evolving multi-class classification dataset. Results on a toy dataset of eight Gaussians are shown, with evaluation using Inception Score and symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence. The performance of EWC-GAN and IS-GAN models were evaluated on a Nvidia Titan X GPU, with results compared to vanilla GAN and GAN with spectral normalization. Different hyperparameter settings were tested, and a combination of spectral normalization and continual learning methods was also explored. Augmenting GAN models with EWC and IS consistently improves generator performance, surpassing 2 weight regularization and discounted historical averaging. EWC-GAN and IS-GAN outperform SN-GAN and prioritize protecting important parameters over all parameters equally. Updating the EWC loss requires forward propagating a new minibatch through the discriminator and updating S and P, but results in better ICP and FID. Combining EWC with SN-GAN and IS-GAN leads to improved results, with EWC-GAN showing similar performance to IS-GAN but with less computational expense. EWC-GAN implementation is easy to add to any GAN model, making it a preferred choice for experiments on image datasets like CelebA and CIFAR-10. Comparisons are made with other GAN variants like DCGAN and WGAN-GP. In experiments on image datasets like CelebA and CIFAR-10, combining EWC with GAN models such as SN-GAN and IS-GAN leads to improved results. EWC-GAN shows similar performance to IS-GAN but with less computational expense. Comparisons are made with other GAN variants like DCGAN and WGAN-GP. Performance is quantified using the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) for both datasets, with improvements seen in FID and ICP when EWC is added to the discriminator. Text generation on the MS COCO Captions dataset is evaluated using BLEU score, with higher scores indicating better fluency. Our study compares the performance of EWC and IS techniques on textGAN for text generation. Results show that our variants of textGAN outperform the baseline MLE and other state-of-the-art methods like SeqGAN, RankGAN, GSGAN, and LeakGAN in terms of BLEU scores. EWC/IS + textGAN also demonstrate significant improvements, especially on BLEU-2 and 3. While our variants slightly lag behind LeakGAN on BLEU-4 and 5, their self BLEU scores indicate effectiveness in addressing the forgetting issue in GAN training for text generation. Our study proposes augmenting GAN training with a continual learning regularization term for the discriminator to address the forgetting issue. This approach improves performance on various metrics such as ICP, FID, and BLEU for datasets like CelebA and CIFAR-10. Our study demonstrates the potential benefits of integrating GAN and continual learning, showing improvements in ICP, FID, and BLEU scores for datasets like CelebA and CIFAR-10. By training a DCGAN on MNIST and generating fake datasets, we propose using these datasets as individual tasks for continual learning. In experiments focusing on real versus fake tasks to demonstrate catastrophic forgetting in a GAN discriminator, a conditional DCGAN was trained with labels for each generated image. Different GAN models showed varying behaviors in converging to the true distribution, with EWC-GAN consistently diffusing to all modes and finding the true distribution sooner with lower \u03b1. The proposed EWC-GAN models perform similarly to other GAN models. Generator samples are shown at intervals for GAN, SN-GAN, and EWC-GAN. Samples are drawn from true distributions and compared for CIFAR 10, CelebA, and MS COCO Captions.
