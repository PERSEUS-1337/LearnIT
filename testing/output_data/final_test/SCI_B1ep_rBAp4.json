Machine learning research has focused on using time series signals, but adding clinical notes enhances model performance for tasks like mortality prediction and length of stay forecasting. Modeling time-series data and doctor notes together is challenging but achieves significant improvements in benchmark tasks. The advancement of medical technology allows for monitoring patients in the ICU using various instruments that measure vital signals. Clinical notes made by doctors provide expert knowledge about the patient's health. This data, along with machine learning advancements, opens up new possibilities for healthcare research. Predicting patient conditions during their ICU stay can help optimize resource usage effectively. In this work, a multi-modal deep neural network is proposed to improve prediction on ICU management tasks by incorporating clinical notes along with time-series data. The model shows significant improvements in AUC-PR scores for in-hospital mortality prediction and decompensation, as well as kappa score for length of stay forecasting. In this study, a multi-modal deep neural network is introduced to enhance ICU management predictions by integrating clinical notes with time-series data. The model demonstrates notable enhancements in AUC-PR scores for in-hospital mortality prediction (+7.8%) and decompensation (+6.1%), as well as kappa score for length of stay forecasting (+3.4%). The problems defined include in-hospital mortality prediction, decompensation detection, and length of stay prediction in ICU settings. The text discusses the use of deep learning techniques for ICU management predictions, focusing on in-hospital mortality prediction, decompensation detection, and length of stay forecasting. The text mentions the discretization of remaining ICU stay time into 10 buckets and the use of RNN for modeling temporal dependencies in instrument time series signals. Additionally, it highlights the adaptation of deep learning techniques for NLP in clinical notes, including the use of convolutional neural networks for predicting ICD-10 codes from clinical texts. In health care research, multimodal learning has been successful in incorporating additional information like diagnosis, medications, and lab events to improve model performance. The study describes the models used, starting with notations, baseline architecture, and proposing a multimodal network for ICU clinical prediction tasks. Time series observations are measured at each time step along with doctor's notes for a patient's length of ICU stay. The study focuses on ICU clinical prediction tasks using time series data and doctor's notes. It includes in-hospital mortality prediction, decompensation prediction, and length of stay forecasting. The baseline model is similar to models by Harutyunyan et al. (2017). The baseline model, similar to Harutyunyan et al. (2017), uses LSTM BID6 network for three tasks: in-hospital mortality, decompensation, and LOS prediction. Predictions are made using hidden states with specific probabilities and weights. In-hospital mortality is predicted at 48 hours, while decompensation and LOS are predicted after the first four hours of ICU stay. Training is done using cross entropy loss. In our multimodal model, we aim to enhance predictions by incorporating both time series data and doctor notes. A convolutional feature extractor is used to extract textual features from the notes, which are then combined with LSTM output for further processing to predict mortality at 48 hours. The multimodal model combines time series data and doctor notes to predict mortality at 48 hours. LSTM and convolutional operations are used to process the notes and align text events with continuous time series signals. Word2vec embeddings are initialized from pre-trained models for better performance. The multimodal model combines time series data and doctor notes to predict mortality at 48 hours using 1D convolution operations and LSTM. The extracted text feature map is computed as a weighted sum of feature vectors with an exponential decay function to prioritize recent notes. The CNN output is concatenated with the LSTM output for prediction tasks. Regularization techniques like dropout and weight decay are applied, and Adam Optimizer is used for training. 15% of the data is used as a validation set. The study utilized a multimodal model for predicting mortality at 48 hours by combining time series data and doctor notes. Different hidden units and filters were used for various prediction tasks, with specific decay factors and evaluation metrics employed. The study compared a multimodal network with baseline LSTM models for three tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, decompensation, and length of stay (LOS). The multimodal network outperformed the LSTM models, showing improvements of around 7.8%, 6%, and 3.5% for the respective tasks. Despite dropping patients with no data, performance remained consistent with the benchmark study. In a study comparing multimodal network with LSTM models for mortality prediction, decompensation, and length of stay, the multimodal network outperformed LSTM models by 7.8%, 6%, and 3.5% respectively. Despite excluding patients with no data, performance remained consistent with the benchmark study. Clinical notes, when combined with time-series data, significantly improve prediction performance, highlighting the importance of early identification of patient conditions in acute care and ICU management. Text-only models performed poorly compared to time-series baseline, indicating that text can enhance predictive power on top of time-series data. Future work aims to enhance predictive models using advanced techniques for clinical notes. Advanced models for clinical notes are expected to improve prediction performance by summarizing expert knowledge about a patient's condition."
