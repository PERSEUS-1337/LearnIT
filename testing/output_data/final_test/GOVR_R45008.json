    "content": "Ukraine, a successor to the Soviet Union, has a complex history with ties to the Kievan Rus. It gained independence in 1991 and has experienced shifts in democracy. Ukraine's government is seen as a \"hybrid\" regime with both democratic and nondemocratic elements. Ukraine's democratic credentials improved after the ouster of President Yanukovych in 2014, leading to the Revolution of Dignity. The new government faced Russian interventions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, resulting in a protracted conflict with pro-Russian separatists. Ukraine's post-Euromaidan government took shape after the ouster of President Yanukovych in 2014. The new government, led by President Petro Poroshenko, aimed to move closer to the West, fight corruption, and address the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Parliamentary elections were held in October 2014 to elect members to the Verkhovna Rada. In October 2014, Ukraine held elections for its 450-seat parliament, with the Petro Poroshenko Bloc and the People's Front emerging as the main victors. They formed a pro-Western reform coalition with other parties, giving the government a clear majority. However, by early 2016, disagreements led to the departure of three parties from the coalition, leaving the Poroshenko Bloc and the People's Front with a slim majority. In April 2016, Yatsenyuk was replaced as prime minister by Volodymyr Groysman, an ally of Poroshenko. Other parties in parliament include the Opposition Bloc and far-right nationalist groups. The Poroshenko/Groysman government has made progress in reforms, but some believe it has been too slow. The IMF has called on the government to continue reforms. The IMF urged Ukraine to accelerate reforms, citing mixed progress with achievements in energy and finance but limited advancements in privatization, land, and pension reforms, and corruption. International donors and civil society push for necessary changes. In October 2017, the government took steps like establishing an anticorruption court and passing pension and healthcare legislation, but concerns remain about the effectiveness of these reforms. The influence of \"oligarchs\" in Ukraine poses a challenge to reform efforts, particularly in energy, metals, and mining sectors. The need for judicial and economic reforms is crucial for Ukraine's political and economic stability. Low support for political leaders is evident among Ukrainian respondents. Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt emphasized the importance of building confidence in the rule of law. In a June-July 2017 poll, low levels of support were shown for Ukraine's political leaders, with only 15%-17% approval of the government. The upcoming elections in 2019 will involve eight parties with varying levels of support. Ukraine's independence has been challenging for Russians to accept, with many viewing Ukraine as a historical province of Russia. Ethnic Russians make up 15%-20% of the population, mainly in the south and east regions with strong ties to Russia. The industrial sector in Ukraine had close economic ties to Russia, leading to disputes over Ukraine's ties to NATO and the EU. Ex-president Yanukovych's move towards Russia in 2013 sparked the Euromaidan protests and his removal from power. Conflict with Russia escalated after Yanukovych fled to Russia in 2014, leading to Moscow's covert deployment of forces to Crimea. In 2014, Moscow deployed forces to Crimea after an illegal referendum, incorporating the region into the Russian Federation. Russian officials cited a Western-backed coup in Kyiv as justification, fearing threats to Russian population, Black Sea Fleet, and potential NATO membership for Ukraine. Russia has increased military presence with up to 30,000 troops in Crimea, leading to documented human rights violations by the OHCHR. Crimean Tatars, opposed to Russia's occupation, are targeted. A bridge linking Crimea to Russia is under construction, limiting access to Ukrainian ports. Ukraine seeks to uphold maritime rights through international arbitration. International community does not recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea. United Nations General Assembly voted to affirm Ukraine's territorial integrity and condemn the temporary occupation of Crimea. Moscow engineered separatist movements in eastern Ukraine, creating the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Militants established the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, expanding control over Ukrainian territory. Moscow's involvement aimed to protect pro-Russian populations, complicate Ukraine's development, and increase Russian leverage in negotiations. 77 countries abstained from a resolution condemning the temporary occupation of Crimea and reaffirming nonrecognition of its annexation. Efforts to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine involve the Minsk agreements, with estimates of around 4,200 Russian troops in the region. The Russian government denies involvement but has unofficially deployed troops and supplied separatists with weapons. The Minsk Protocol and Minsk-2 agreements aimed to bring a cease-fire and political resolution to the conflict between Russia, Ukraine, and separatists in eastern Ukraine. Despite commitments, little progress has been made in implementing the provisions, leading to continued fighting and casualties. The conflict has resulted in over 10,225 fatalities and 1.6 million internally displaced persons as of mid-2017. Until recently, the Ukrainian government allowed trade with separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, particularly in coal for power plants. Energy companies in these regions, owned by Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov, recognized Ukrainian authority and paid taxes. However, after an unofficial blockade in January 2017, separatist officials took control of the companies. In response, the Ukrainian government suspended cargo traffic in March 2017 until control is returned. Ukraine, once part of the Soviet Union, has seen uneven economic growth since independence. Since independence, Ukraine has experienced uneven economic growth, with significant declines in the 1990s and during the 2008-2009 global recession. The economy stagnated in 2012-2013 and declined further in 2014 due to conflict. However, recent years have shown signs of stabilization, aided by international assistance like a $17.5 billion IMF loan package. Key reforms have included reducing the fiscal deficit, increasing gas prices, reforming the banking system, and lowering inflation. Ukraine's GDP grew in recent years. Ukraine's economy has shown signs of stabilization with GDP growth of 2.3% in 2016. The IMF and World Bank project further growth in 2017 and 2018. Ukraine raised $3 billion in sovereign bonds in September 2017, but continued economic growth depends on critical reforms to combat corruption, privatize state-owned enterprises, and allow land sales. The percentage of Ukrainians living in moderate poverty rose from 15% in 2014 to 22% in 2015, with an unemployment rate of around 10% in 2016. Ukraine's overall merchandise trade has declined since 2013. Ukraine's merchandise trade declined significantly from 2013 to 2016 due to restrictions imposed by Russia. Exports to Russia decreased by 35% in 2014, 51% in 2015, and 26% in 2016. Despite this, Russia remained Ukraine's top trading partner in 2016, followed by China and Germany. Over 40% of Ukraine's trade was with EU members. Ukraine's top merchandise export destinations were Russia, Egypt, and Poland, while its main import sources were Russia, China, and Germany. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ukraine began to recover in 2015-2016, with total FDI in 2016 amounting to $4.4 billion. Growth in FDI was mainly in the banking sector, with Russia being the main source of FDI in 2016. Ukraine's energy sector is crucial for economic reforms, but has historically operated with low domestic energy prices and subsidies. After conflict in 2014, Ukraine reformed its energy sector by raising tariffs for households while reducing dependence on Russian gas imports. In 2013, 92% of gas imports came from Russia, but by 2016, Ukraine halted Russian gas imports entirely. Ukraine reduced its dependence on Russian gas imports by importing gas from Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary. Energy reforms in Ukraine slowed in 2017, leading to resignations from Naftogaz's supervisory board. Further reforms are needed for a new loan agreement with the EBRD in 2018. Russia has been working to bypass Ukraine in gas exports to Europe since the opening of the Nord Stream pipeline in 2011. Currently, Russia is seeking to construct Nord Stream 2, a parallel pipeline to reduce gas transit through Ukraine, potentially eliminating it entirely. This move could lead to a loss of revenue for Ukraine and increase its vulnerability to Russia. The United States has long supported Ukraine's pro-Western orientation and reform efforts. The United States has provided significant financial and technical assistance to Ukraine since 2014, supporting its territorial integrity and implementation of the Minsk agreements. President Trump and President Poroshenko have met twice to discuss resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine and promoting economic growth. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called on Russia to de-escalate violence and withdraw separatist armed forces to fulfill the Minsk agreements. In July 2017, Secretary Tillerson appointed Kurt Volker as U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations. He emphasized that Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia will continue until Moscow reverses its actions. The United States is Ukraine's 10th largest trading partner, with $1.7 billion in total merchandise trade in 2016. President Trump and President Poroshenko agreed on the sale of U.S. coal to Ukraine to replace coal from separatist territories. The United States has been a significant contributor of foreign assistance to Ukraine, with nonmilitary, nonhumanitarian aid increasing from around $80 million in FY2014 to $575 million in FY2016. The Trump Administration's FY2018 request for Ukraine was $201 million in nonmilitary, nonhumanitarian assistance. The House Appropriations Committee recommended allocating $313 million in such aid. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $313 million in assistance for Ukraine, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $323 million. The United States has provided over $135 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine since 2014 and over $600 million in military assistance since the conflict began in 2014. The United States has provided military assistance to Ukraine through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, with Congress appropriating $250 million in FY2016 and an additional $150 million in FY2017. The Trump Administration requested another $150 million for FY2018. In September 2016, a framework document was signed to enhance Ukraine's defense capacity and cooperation with the United States. Two annual military exercises are also hosted by the United States and Ukraine. The United States supports Ukraine through military exercises like RAPID TRIDENT and SEA BREEZE. Congress has backed the provision of defensive lethal weapons, but lethal aid has not been provided yet. Arguments for and against lethal assistance have been made, with the U.S. actively reviewing the question. Additionally, the U.S. has assisted Ukraine in cybersecurity. In 2016, U.S. interagency teams visited Ukraine to address cyberattacks on power companies. The Department of State planned to allocate $2.7 million for energy resiliency and cybersecurity in Ukraine. A Bilateral Cybersecurity Dialogue was held in Kyiv in 2017. The U.S. Congress has supported Ukraine since 2014, passing resolutions to back democratic aspirations and condemn Russia's annexation. Many Members have condemned Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, pushing for sanctions against Russia. Congress passed the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014, providing aid for reform, security assistance, asset recovery, and sanctions. Increased funds were also authorized for programming in Ukraine, Moldova, and neighboring countries. The Ukraine Freedom Support Act (P.L. 113-272) authorized increased funds for programming in Ukraine, Moldova, and neighboring regions by U.S. government-funded broadcasters. It aimed to assist Ukraine in restoring sovereignty, deter Russian destabilization, and expand broadcasting in post-Soviet states. In 2015, Congress passed resolutions condemning Russia's actions in Crimea and Ukraine, expressing support for increased aid to Ukraine. Security assistance for Ukraine has been supported since the conflict began, with much of it provided through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act authorized $350 million for Ukraine, but only $150 million was ultimately appropriated. Congress appropriated $150 million in FY2017 for defense institutional reforms. In FY2018, the House supported another $150 million, with Senate action pending. The Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 was passed, codifying sanctions on Russia and authorizing $30 million for energy security in Ukraine. The United States policy is to never recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia. President Trump signed sanctions against Russia but criticized the legislation. Current appropriations restrict funds for policies recognizing Russian sovereignty over Crimea. Sanctions have been imposed on nearly 600 entities since 2014. Since 2014, the United States has imposed sanctions on nearly 600 individuals and entities in response to Russia's actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. President Obama declared Russia's activities in Ukraine as a threat to peace and security, leading to the imposition of economic sanctions. The US, along with the EU, vowed to increase costs on Russia until it respects Ukraine's sovereignty. Executive orders issued in 2014 form the basis for designating individuals and entities subject to Ukraine-related sanctions. The Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 codified executive orders into law, designating individuals and entities subject to Ukraine-related sanctions for actions such as annexing Crimea and using illicit armed force. Those designated face asset blocking and entry denial into the US, with US persons prohibited from engaging in transactions. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) investigates and designates entities and persons for prohibited transactions with U.S. persons. Sectoral sanctions restrict transactions related to investment and financing for designated state-controlled companies in Russia's financial sector, energy, and defense sectors, as well as projects involving deepwater, Arctic offshore, or shale oil in Russia. P.L. 115-44 directs further restrictions on financing in Russia's financial and energy sectors and extends prohibitions to worldwide projects involving designated entities. The Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 imposes sanctions on foreign persons investing in deepwater, Arctic offshore, or shale oil projects in Russia, as well as on financial institutions funding such projects. Sanctions also target Russian arms exporter Rosoboronexport and entities transferring weapons to Ukraine. The Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-95) requires sanctions on government officials responsible for violence during the Euromaidan protests, persons undermining Ukraine's sovereignty, and Russian officials involved in corruption in Ukraine. EU sanctions are similar but require unanimous agreement among member states for renewal. The EU sanctions on Russia require unanimous agreement among member states for renewal. Other countries like Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway, and Switzerland have also imposed Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia. The Association Agreement (AA) between the EU and Ukraine includes a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), exposing Ukrainian firms to EU competition and providing access to EU markets. The AA was signed in June 2014 and ratified by the European Parliament and Ukrainian parliament in September 2014, with the DCFTA implementation postponed until 2016 due to a rejection in the Netherlands. The Dutch parliament approved the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement in July 2017, after negotiations to clarify terms. The EU granted Ukrainian citizens visa-free travel in June 2017 and has provided significant economic assistance since 2014, including loans and grants totaling billions of euros. NATO and Ukraine have a strong partnership, with Ukraine joining NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1994. NATO and Ukraine have a strong partnership, with Ukraine joining NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1994. In 2010, Ukraine adopted a \"non-bloc\" status but still invited NATO to launch a Defense Education Enhancement Programme in 2012. After the conflict in 2014, Ukraine's parliament voted to make cooperation with NATO a foreign policy priority in June 2017. Although Ukraine is not expected to become a NATO member soon, NATO pledged additional training and technical support at the July 2016 summit in Warsaw. At the July 2016 NATO summit in Warsaw, NATO pledged additional training and technical support for the Ukrainian military through the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP). The CAP focuses on enhancing Ukraine's resilience against various threats, including hybrid threats, with areas of focus such as advisory support, defense reform, education, countering improvised explosive devices, and explosive ordnance disposal. NATO also established six Trust Funds to support Ukraine, but faces limitations due to differences among allies on providing more substantive military support like intelligence capabilities or weapons systems. Ukraine continues to face challenges post-Euromaidan protests and conflict with Russia. Questions for Congress include encouraging reforms, democratic competition in 2019 elections, U.S. engagement in conflict negotiations, defensive weapons impact, and future assistance needs. Key questions for Ukraine's future include the duration of economic assistance from the US and other donors, sustaining economic recovery, and maximizing benefits from the EU free trade agreement."
