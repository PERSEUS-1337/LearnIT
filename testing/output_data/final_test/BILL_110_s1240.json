    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Compassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies Act of 2007\". It includes findings related to the act. The Congress finds that emergency contraception could help rape survivors avoid unintended pregnancies, as 50% of rape-related pregnancies end in abortion. Many hospitals do not routinely provide emergency contraception to sexual assault victims, increasing the risk of pregnancy to 4.7% in unprotected survivors. Emergency contraception is safe and effective in preventing unintended pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of sex. Medical research shows that administering emergency contraception sooner increases the likelihood of preventing pregnancy. The American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support wider availability of emergency contraceptive pills for women of all ages. The American College of Emergency Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend offering emergency contraception to female patients after a sexual assault. Emergency contraception should be offered to female patients after sexual assault as standard care to prevent unintended pregnancy. Victims of sexual assault are at increased risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases, some of which may result in high morbidity and mortality if treatment is delayed. It is crucial for hospitals to provide emergency contraception as a treatment option for these women. HIV and hepatitis B infections in the United States have led to high morbidity and mortality rates. Over 1,000,000 individuals are infected with HIV, and 60,000 with hepatitis B annually. Treatment has not been able to cure these infections, with 1 in 4 hepatitis B infected individuals at risk of dying from liver failure. Prompt treatment can prevent some sexually transmitted diseases, including the use of post-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs. Post-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs can effectively prevent HIV infection, while prompt treatment can eliminate hepatitis B infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend immediate post-exposure treatment for victims of sexual assault to prevent life-threatening infections. Hospitals providing emergency medical treatment should assess and treat sexually transmitted infections to minimize harm to victims of sexual assault. \"Survivors of sexual assault can receive emergency contraceptives from hospitals without charge.\" Federal funds may only be provided to hospitals under certain conditions when dealing with victims of sexual assault, including providing accurate information about emergency contraception. Emergency contraception, approved by the FDA for women 18 and over, is a safe and effective way to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse. It is more effective the sooner it is taken and does not cause abortion or interrupt an established pregnancy. Hospitals must promptly offer and provide emergency contraception to women upon request. The information provided must be clear, concise, and easily understood, with provisions for language accessibility. Services cannot be denied based on financial inability. Emergency contraception is FDA-approved for postcoital use. Hospitals must offer emergency contraception promptly upon request. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. \"Sexual assault\" is defined as a non-consensual sexual act. This section becomes effective after a 180-day period from the date of enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will publish criteria in the Federal Register for carrying out this section upon the expiration of the 180-day period from the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. PREVENTION OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE. In this section, key definitions include \"hospital,\" \"licensed medical professional,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"sexual assault,\" which is defined as a sexual act as per the United States Code. Federal funds cannot be provided to a hospital under certain acts unless the hospital provides risk assessment, counseling, and treatment to survivors of sexual assault. An individual is considered a survivor of sexual assault if they arrive at the hospital and state that they are. A hospital must provide risk assessment, counseling, and treatment to survivors of sexual assault. This includes assessing the individual's risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections and must be conducted by a licensed medical professional based on available information regarding the assault. A hospital must provide risk assessment and counseling to survivors of sexual assault based on available information, medical examination findings, and established standards of risk assessment. Counseling should include advice on sexually transmitted infections. A hospital must provide prophylactic treatment for infections to survivors of sexual assault upon request, regardless of their ability to pay. The information provided should be clear and concise. The services described in paragraphs (1) through (3) shall not be denied due to inability to pay. Nothing in this section requires hospitals to provide prophylactic treatment for sexual assault victims if risk assessment advises against it. The section prohibits hospitals from seeking reimbursement for services provided to sexual assault victims if health insurance covers it. It also requires victims to undergo diagnostic testing for infectious diseases. The section takes effect 180 days after the enactment of the Act, with the Secretary publishing criteria for implementation 30 days prior to the expiration of the period."
