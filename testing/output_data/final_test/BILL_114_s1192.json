    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Breast Cancer Patient Education Act of 2015\" and includes findings related to breast cancer education. Congress finds that breast cancer disproportionately affects African-American and Hispanic women, with rural women facing barriers to mammography screening. Individuals undergoing breast cancer surgery should consider breast reconstructive surgery either immediately or at a later date. Immediate reconstruction combines cancer surgery with reconstructive surgery and is cost-effective, while delayed reconstruction may be better for women needing radiation. Some women may opt for breast prostheses instead of surgical reconstruction. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 ensures insurance coverage for these options. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 mandates coverage for breast reconstruction after mastectomy, including prostheses and complications. Studies show many women are not informed of their reconstructive options, and race can impact the likelihood of reconstruction. Studies have shown that while Caucasian women have higher odds of reconstruction after mastectomy, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian women have significantly lower rates. Language barriers may contribute to lower reconstruction rates among Hispanic patients. Minority women are less likely to undergo reconstruction even when controlling for demographic and clinical factors. Minority women have lower rates of reconstruction after mastectomy compared to Caucasians, with barriers such as lower health literacy, financial issues, and limited access to plastic surgeons. There is a significant unmet need for information on reconstruction options and coverage among racial and ethnic minority groups. In 1998, a study by Warren H. Tseng, M.D., at the University of California Davis found that rural breast cancer patients are less likely to undergo breast reconstruction after mastectomy compared to urban patients. SEC. 399NN-1 of the Public Health Service Act amends Part V of title III to include breast reconstruction education. The Secretary will implement an education campaign to inform breast cancer patients, especially those from minority groups, about breast reconstruction options and coverage. Patients will be informed about the possibility of reconstruction at the time of surgery or later, availability of prostheses, and their right to choose a provider. Federal law mandates coverage of these options by health plans. The patient has the right to choose a provider for breast reconstructive care, either at the time of surgery or later. Additional information may be disseminated as determined appropriate by the Secretary. The information disseminated under paragraphs (1) and (2) must be posted on relevant Federal agencies' websites. The campaign should not limit healthcare providers available to patients. The Secretary must consult with medical societies and patient advocates on breast cancer, reconstructive surgery, and minority groups, especially African-American and Hispanic populations. The Breast Cancer Patient Education Act of 2015 requires the Secretary to submit a report every 2 years on activities aimed at improving the health of racial and ethnic minority groups, including Hispanics."
