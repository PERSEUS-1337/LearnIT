    "content": "The report provides background information on the Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carrier program, including potential oversight issues for Congress. The Navy's FY2019 budget requests $2.3 billion for the CVN-78 program, which could impact Navy capabilities and funding. The FY2020 budget initially proposed not funding the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul for the aircraft carrier CVN-75 (Harry S. Truman) but later reversed this decision. The Administration now supports funding the CVN-75 RCOH and keeping CVN-75 in service past FY2024. The Navy's current aircraft carrier force consists of 11 nuclear-powered ships, including 10 Nimitz-class ships and one Gerald R. Ford class ship. 10 U.S.C. 8062(b) requires the Navy to maintain a force of not less than 11 operational aircraft carriers. The Navy is required to maintain a minimum of 11 operational aircraft carriers, as stated in 10 U.S.C. 8062(b. However, there was a previous requirement for 12 carriers, which was changed to 11 carriers. Additionally, the Navy aims to achieve a fleet of 355 ships, including 12 aircraft carriers. The Navy's goal is to increase the carrier force from 11 to 12 ships by 2030 through procurement on 3-year centers. Extending the service lives of existing carriers could expedite this timeline. Alternatively, procuring carriers on 3.5-year centers would achieve a 12-carrier force by 2034, while a 4-year center procurement plan would delay this goal to around 2063. The Navy's plan to increase the carrier force to 12 ships by 2030 through procurement on 3-year centers may be delayed to around 2063 if carriers are procured on 4-year centers after FY2028. The projected size of the carrier force in the Navy's FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan has been adjusted due to budget proposals, with a one-ship increase for the period FY2022-FY2047. The Navy's adjusted force-level projection includes 11 ships in FY2020-FY2021, 12 ships in FY2022-FY2024, and varying numbers in subsequent years. Incremental funding has been used for procuring certain Navy ships, such as aircraft carriers. The Navy has the authority to use incremental funding for CVNs 78, 79, and 80 over a four to six-year period. This authority was granted through legislative amendments in the FY2012 and FY2013 National Defense Authorization Acts. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act authorized incremental funding for CVN-80 and CVN-81 construction by Huntington Ingalls Industries/Newport News Shipbuilding. The aircraft carrier construction industrial base includes 2,000 supplier firms in 46 states. The Ford-class design is the successor to the Nimitz-class carrier design. The Ford-class design is an improved version of the Nimitz-class carrier, with features that allow for more aircraft sorties per day, increased electrical power, and reduced manpower requirements. The Navy plans to procure at least four Ford-class carriers, with CVN-78 already named Gerald R. Ford. The estimated procurement cost for CVN-78 is $13.1 billion. The CVN-79, named John F. Kennedy, was funded in FY2008-FY2011 and received additional funding in FY2014-FY2016 and FY2018. It was delivered to the Navy in May 2017 and commissioned in July 2017. The Navy is currently working on completing construction and testing of the ship's weapons elevators. The estimated procurement cost for CVN-79 is $11.3 billion in FY2020. The CVN-79, named John F. Kennedy, was funded in FY2008-FY2011 and received additional funding in FY2014-FY2016 and FY2018. It was delivered to the Navy in May 2017 and commissioned in July 2017. The ship is being built with an improved shipyard fabrication and assembly process to reduce construction costs. CVN-80 (Enterprise) and CVN-81 are being procured under a two-ship block buy contract authorized by the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. The Navy announced a two-ship block buy contract in January 2019, which is expected to reduce the cost of CVN-80 by $246.6 million and CVN-81 by $2,637.3 million, totaling a reduction of nearly $3 billion. Using higher estimated baseline costs, the reduction could be $3.9 billion. The Navy's two-ship block buy contract announced in January 2019 is expected to save about $3 billion in total costs for CVN-80 and CVN-81. The Navy's FY2019 budget submission already accounted for $1 billion in potential savings, with an additional $3 billion in savings from the two-CVN buy. This suggests that the Navy may have anticipated receiving authority from Congress for a combined purchase for the two aircraft carriers. CVN-80, named Enterprise in 2012, was procured in FY2018 with a procurement cost of $12.3 billion. The Navy plans to fully fund the ship by FY2025. The FY2020 budget requests $1.062 billion for procurement. CVN-81, not yet named, was originally scheduled for FY2023 but is now included in the FY2020 budget for procurement. Delivery to the Navy is scheduled for March 2028. The Navy's FY2020 budget estimates the procurement cost of a ship at $12.5 billion, with funding planned from FY2019 to FY2026+. Congress has set procurement cost caps for CVN-78 class aircraft carriers. The procurement cost caps for CVN-78 class aircraft carriers have been set by Congress. The cost cap for the CVN-78 program was amended in various legislative acts to provide revised caps for each follow-on ship, with adjustments for inflation and other factors. The cost cap for the CVN-78 program was amended to provide a revised cap of $11,398.0 million for each follow-on ship, with adjustments for inflation and other factors. Additionally, the cost cap for CVN-80 and subsequent ships was set at $12,568.0 million. If necessary, the Secretary of the Navy may increase the cost cap by up to $100 million for CVN-79 to maintain operational capability. The cost cap for the CVN-78 program was amended to provide a revised cap of $11,398.0 million for each follow-on ship, with adjustments for inflation and other factors. The cap for CVN-79 was kept at $11,398.0 million, plus adjustments for inflation and other factors. The provision also amended the basis for adjusting the caps for inflation and excluded certain costs from being counted against the caps. In a letter to the congressional defense committees, the Secretary of the Navy increased the cost cap for CVN-78 by $20 million to $12,907.0 million due to an urgent and unforeseen requirement identified during the shipboard test program. The Secretary of the Navy increased the cost cap for CVN-78 by $120 million to $13,027 million under specific subsections. Changes in estimated procurement costs for CVNs 78, 79, 80, and 81 since FY2008 were shown in a table. The Navy's FY2020 budget proposal did not include funding for mid-life nuclear refueling. The Navy's FY2020 budget proposal did not include funding for the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul for CVN-75 (Harry S. Truman), but the Administration later announced support for funding the overhaul and keeping the ship in service past FY2024. One issue for Congress is the decision to show CVN-81 as a ship to be procured in FY2020 instead of FY2019. CVN-81 was procured in FY2019 under the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act. Funding for the procurement was authorized in the FY2019 program year, with a quantity of \"1\" allocated in the Navy's shipbuilding account. The FY2019 DOD appropriations act authorizes procurement funding for CVN-81, not AP funding for the CVN-78 program. The funds may be used to modify or enter into a new contract for the procurement of a Ford-class aircraft carrier designated CVN\u201381. The FY2019 DOD appropriations act authorizes procurement funding for CVN-81, a Ford-class aircraft carrier, not AP funding for the CVN-78 program. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission shows $618 million in FY2019 funding for CVN-81 as full funding for a procured ship, affecting the comparison of ships procured in FY2019 and FY2020. The DOD's decision on how to categorize CVN-81 in the budget submissions for FY2019 and FY2020 impacts the total number of ships procured each year. Showing CVN-81 as a FY2019 ship would result in 14 ships procured in FY2019 and 11 requested for FY2020, while categorizing it as a FY2020 ship changes the totals to 13 and 12 ships, respectively. This decision also affects the aircraft carrier procurement profile in the Navy's FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan. The DOD's decision to show CVN-81 as a ship to be procured in FY2020 instead of FY2019 raises questions about compliance with congressional intent and challenges Congress's power to authorize and fund Navy ship construction. The DOD's decision to show CVN-81 as a ship to be procured in FY2020 instead of FY2019 raises questions about compliance with congressional intent and challenges Congress's power to authorize and fund Navy ship construction. Concerns also arise regarding the executability of FY2019 procurement funds for CVN-81 in the Navy's FY2020 budget. The Navy's ability to proceed with CVN-81 in FY2020 may be impacted by a continuing resolution (CR) without a special legislative provision. This could affect the two-ship contract for CVN-80 and CVN-81, as well as the shipbuilding plan and aircraft carrier procurement profile. The Navy's decision to include CVN-81 in its FY2020 budget submission raises questions about the authorization process and potential confusion with CVN-82. Rescinding the FY2019 authorization for CVN-81 could have implications for the procurement plan. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission includes CVN-81 and raises questions about the authorization process and potential confusion with CVN-82. Rescinding the FY2019 authorization for CVN-81 could impact the implementation of Section 121 of P.L. 115-232 and the two-carrier contract award. The accelerated delivery date for CVN-81 has been moved up to February 2032, while the procurement year for CVN-82 remains unchanged at FY2028. The delivery date for CVN-81 has been accelerated to February 2032, while the procurement year for CVN-82 remains unchanged at FY2028. This could result in an increased interval between the construction of the two carriers, potentially leading to higher procurement costs for CVN-82. Congress may need to consider the impact of these changes on the procurement cost of CVN-82 and how accelerating its procurement year could affect costs in real terms. The Navy's FY2020 procurement funding requests for the CVN-78 program are under consideration by Congress, including the acceleration of procurement years and achieving the 12-ship force-level goal for aircraft carriers by the 2060s. Shifting carrier procurement to 3- or 3.5-year centers could help achieve this goal sooner. Shifting carrier procurement to 3- or 3.5-year centers could achieve a 12-carrier fleet by the 2030s, increasing Navy funding requirements. Cost growth in the CVN-78 program has been a continuing oversight issue for Congress. The estimated procurement costs of CVN-78, CVN-79, and CVN-80 have all increased since the FY2008 budget submission. Cost growth on CVN-78 required the Navy to program $1,394.9 million in cost-to-complete procurement funding for the ship in FY2014-FY2016 and FY2018. However, cost growth on CVN-78, CVN-79, and CVN-80 more or less stopped in FY2013 and FY2014. The estimated costs of CVN-78, CVN-79, and CVN-80 have all increased since the FY2008 budget submission. The FY2013 budget for the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) has declined by about 11% since FY2008. Section 128 of the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act imposes a limitation on funds for CVN-79 until certain certifications are provided by the Secretary of the Navy. The Secretary of the Navy must submit a report to Congress within 90 days evaluating cost issues for CVN-79 and CVN-80. The report should include options to reduce costs, freeze the design, transition equipment, and optimize the construction pace. The Secretary of the Navy must submit a report to Congress within 90 days evaluating cost issues for CVN-79 and CVN-80, including options to reduce costs, freeze the design, transition equipment, and optimize construction pace. Section 126 of the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act imposes limitations on funds for the procurement of U.S.S. Enterprise (CVN-80), with only 25% of funds authorized for fiscal year 2017 being allowed to be obligated or expended until a report is submitted to the congressional defense committees. The Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations must submit a report to Congress by December 1, 2016, detailing actions to achieve cost goals for CVN-79 and CVN-80. Annual reports on progress towards cost targets for the ships must be submitted with the President's budget for fiscal years through 2021. The report for CVN-79 and CVN-80 procurement must include progress towards cost goals, reduction of unnecessary costs, cost savings estimates, spending plan, risks, and incentives for achieving savings. The report for CVN-79 and CVN-80 procurement must include progress towards cost goals, reduction of unnecessary costs, cost savings estimates, spending plan, risks, and incentives for achieving savings. Incentives or rewards provided to prime contractors for meeting procurement end costs are described in Section 121(b) of the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act. The report must include progress towards cost goals, reduction of unnecessary costs, cost savings estimates, spending plan, risks, and incentives for achieving savings. It also mentions the revised test and evaluation master plan for full ship shock trials on Ford-class aircraft carriers, certification of operational risk analysis for U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford, and sources of risk of cost growth on CVN-78 including new systems like EMALS, AAG, and DBR. Congress has been monitoring these risks for years. In July 2016, the DOD Inspector General criticized the Navy's management of the AAG development. In January 2017, the Navy decided to proceed with installing EMALs and AAG on the first three Ford-class carriers despite limitations on AAG program funds. Navy officials aim to control CVN-79 costs by using a less expensive radar and a strategic build plan with improvements over CVN-78. The Navy aims to control costs for CVN-79 by implementing build-strategy improvements over CVN-78, such as outfitting ship modules before stacking, \"learning inside the ship\" production, and more economical ordering of parts. Congressional oversight concerns include completion of construction and cost management efforts. The $13 billion Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier was delivered without functioning weapons elevators, adding to long-standing reliability issues with other core systems. The Advanced Weapons Elevators on the $13 billion Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier were delayed in installation due to safety issues, including \"uncommanded movements.\" Navy Secretary Richard Spencer called the elevators the carrier's \"Achilles heel.\" Despite progress on other systems, the elevators remain a concern. The Navy aims to have the carrier fully combat-capable by July, including fixing the elevator issues. The Navy requested an increase in the Ford's cost cap by $120 million to address elevator problems. The Navy requested an increase in the Ford's cost cap by $120 million in May to address safety issues with the Advanced Weapons Elevators on the Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier. Despite delays in installation, all elevators are now installed, but completion has been hindered by technical challenges. Testing has started on two of the elevators, with six in varying levels of construction and testing. All 11 elevators should have been completed and delivered with the ship delivery. The contractor has corrected all issues with the elevators, including uncommanded movements. Federal Equipment Co. has been developing the \"Elevator of Tomorrow\" with key technologies demonstrated for years. Shipboard integration involves other technology insertions not controlled by the company. Senator Tim Kaine raised concerns about the challenges with the advanced weapons elevators on the CVN during a Senate hearing. Assistant Secretary of the Navy James F. Geurts mentioned that progress has been made on producing and testing the elevators, with the first two nearing completion. Progress has been made on producing and testing the elevators for CVN-78, with about 94 percent completion. An independent review team is focusing on long-term sustainability and reliability to ensure support for the elevators. The goal is to complete testing and certification for all 11 elevators within the 12-month period. Progress has been made on producing and testing the elevators for CVN-78, with about 94 percent completion. The Navy plans to complete installation and testing of the 11 elevators before the Ford completes its post-delivery shakedown phase in July. Six elevators will be certified for use by then, with the remaining five to be completed after July. Accelerated certification work is being done to meet the schedule. The completion of the elevators for aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) has been delayed due to technical issues, but progress is being made to resolve them. The Navy accepted delivery of the carrier without functioning weapons elevators, and the Navy Secretary has committed to having them operational by the end of the summer. The carrier is currently undergoing post-shakedown availability at Newport News Shipbuilding. The Navy Secretary has committed to having the elevators on aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford operational by the time the carrier returns to sea. Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer told President Donald Trump that the elevators would be ready or else the president can use his \"you're fired\" line on him. Spencer expressed confidence in getting the elevators working and taking accountability for the ongoing challenges. The elevator issue on aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford has been a long-standing problem, overshadowed by other technical issues like the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System and Advanced Arresting Gear. In 2016, Senator John McCain criticized the Ford-class program for delays and technical difficulties, highlighting issues with the advanced arresting gear and weapons elevators. Senator John McCain criticized the USS Gerald R. Ford program in 2016 for delays and technical issues, including problems with the advanced arresting gear and weapons elevators. Despite a 60-day review, the carrier was delivered in June 2017 without functioning elevators. Technical challenges with the elevators and AAG contributed to the delayed delivery and commissioning of the ship. The USS Gerald R. Ford faced delays and technical issues, including problems with advanced weapons elevators. The ship accepted its first advanced weapons elevator on Dec. 21, 2018, marking a milestone for the Ford-class aircraft carriers. Work still remains on the remaining 10 elevators, with completion scheduled before the end of Ford's post-shakedown availability in July. The USS Gerald R. Ford accepted its second advanced weapons elevator, AWE Upper Stage #3, on February 14, following testing and certification. Some remaining certification documentation for five elevators will be completed after the ship's post-shakedown availability in July. This allows Ford Sailors to become familiar with the new equipment and gain expertise during the PSA. Thompson, a subject matter expert, explained that the acceptance of the new elevator systems on the USS Gerald R. Ford allows Sailors to gain hands-on experience and streamline the learning process. By applying lessons learned from the first elevator to the second, they can progress faster in testing, certification, and maintenance processes. The merging of test programs between NNS and Naval Surface Warfare accelerated the elevator's acceptance. The merging of test programs between NNS and the Naval Surface Warfare Center accelerated the elevator's acceptance by removing redundant steps and moving certification up by 10 days. The team is working on identifying other areas where redundancy can be eliminated to improve acceptance timelines. Congressional oversight concerns regarding the CVN-78 program issues raised in a December 2018 report from DOD's Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, highlighted delays in ship development and initial trials pushing testing phases to FY21 and FY22. The report noted that the aggressive test schedule for CVN 78 has caused delays in ship delivery and development, adding approximately 2 years to the timeline. The reliability of critical systems like EMALS, AAG, DBR, and AWEs on CVN 78 may delay its first deployment to FY22. Testing has shown poor reliability for AAG and EMALS, while DBR and AWEs have uncertain reliability. EMALS has successfully launched aircraft in 747 shipboard tests, but issues persist. The EMALS system on CVN 78 has experienced 10 critical failures in the first 747 shipboard launches, falling short of the required Mean Cycles Between Critical Failures. The crew faces challenges in isolating EMALS components for maintenance during flight operations due to shared Energy Storage Groups. AAG testing included 763 shipboard landings, demonstrating its capability for aircraft recovery. The AAG system experienced 10 operational mission failures during the first 763 shipboard landings, falling below reliability expectations. Concerns are raised due to the design limitations that hinder maintenance during flight operations. The ship self-defense system showed good performance in launching simulated missiles during sea-based testing. The ship's self-defense system demonstrated good performance in launching simulated RAMs and ESSMs, but integration issues with CEC network and Link 16 hinder performance estimation. Concerns remain about unresolved integration problems between SSDS and SEWIP Block 2. CVN 78's combat system testing on the SDTS faces risks due to schedule constraints and lack of funding. DBR performance was affected by extraneous false and close-in dual tracks during SBDTs. Integration of DBR electronic protection capabilities is ongoing. The integration of DBR electronic protection capabilities on CVN 78 remains incomplete and unfunded, adversely affecting its performance and placing the ship at high risk in combat. The Navy analysis highlighted the need for improvement to support carrier air traffic control center certification. CVN 78 is unlikely to achieve its sortie generation rate requirement due to unrealistic assumptions and historical analysis showing the requirement is well above past levels. DOT&E plans to assess CVN 78 performance during IOT&E. The poor reliability of key systems on CVN 78 could cause delays during flight operations, affecting sortie generation. Manning capacity on the ship is expected to be exceeded by approximately 100 personnel, leaving no room for extra personnel during inspections or routine turnovers. Planned ship manning requires filling all billets, which differs from the Navy's standard practice on other ships. The Navy's standard practice on other ships may not support 100 percent manning on CVN 78. Workload estimates for new technologies are not well understood, and there are significant electromagnetic interference and radiation hazard problems. Operational limitations are expected to persist, and capability assessments are needed for informed decision-making. The vulnerability of critical systems to underwater threats is unknown, and shock testing is planned for EMALS, AAG, and other systems. The Navy plans to conduct shock testing on EMALS, AAG, and AWE components in CY19, but testing on DBR components lags behind. The Vulnerability Assessment Report assesses the ship's survivability to air-delivered threats and identifies equipment that could lead to mission capability loss. Recommendations include providing a schedule, funding, and execution strategy for assessing SGR. The Navy plans to conduct shock testing on EMALS, AAG, and AWE components in CY19, but testing on DBR components lags behind. Recommendations include providing a schedule, funding, and execution strategy for assessing SGR. Additionally, the Navy should continue characterizing the electromagnetic environment onboard CVN 78, develop operating procedures for system effectiveness, and implement DBR electronic protection for ship survivability against modern threats. Congress should address oversight issues raised by the GAO regarding the CVN-78 program. The Navy accepted delivery of the lead ship, CVN 78, in May 2017 despite challenges with immature technologies and reliability issues. 10 of the Ford Class's 12 critical technologies are mature, but the advanced arresting gear and one missile system are not yet mature. Only 2 of the 11 elevators on the ship can bring munitions to the flight deck, with plans to correct the system by October 2019. Land-based testing for the elevators is also planned. The Navy plans to create a land-based site to test elevators for CVN 78, which could incur additional costs. Shipboard testing is ongoing for critical systems like EMALS, AAG, and DBR, but reliability concerns persist. Recent testing revealed challenges with DBR operation and radiation hazards, potentially limiting flight operations. These technology challenges may require redesign or replacement for future carriers. The Navy is facing challenges with critical technologies on CVN 78, which could impact future ships like CVN 79, 80, and 81. CVN 79 will feature the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) instead of DBR, requiring design and development efforts. EASR, derived from the AMDR program, may still need modifications to function on the carrier. The Navy plans to procure two EASR units for CVNs 79 and 80, with installation during CVN 79's second delivery phase. CVNs 80 and 81 will follow the design of CVN 79. CVNs 80 and 81 will repeat the design of CVN 79. CVN 78's procurement costs increased by 23 percent over its initial cost cap, and the Navy may still require more funding to complete the ship. The cost cap for CVN 78 was increased by $120 million in May 2018, but additional work and cost changes may lead to further cost increases. Costs for CVN 79 are also expected to rise due to optimistic cost and labor targets, putting the ship at risk of exceeding its $11.4 billion cost cap. Congress raised the cost cap for CVN 80 and later ships to $12.6 billion. The cost cap for CVN 80 and later ships was raised to $12.6 billion by Congress. The Navy plans to buy two carriers at the same time to save over $2 billion, but it is uncertain if the Navy can meet this cost cap due to the need for further reductions in subsystem costs, construction change orders, and labor hours. The Navy projects a 25 percent reduction in labor hours compared to CVN 78 for cost savings. The program office does not separately track or report information on software development for integrating subsystems. The program office provided technical comments on the assessment, stating that CVN 78 entered a maintenance period in July 2018. As of February 2019, two advanced weapons elevators are operational, and developmental system reliability is improving. Shipbuilder cost performance for CVN 79 construction is stable but slightly below targets, with ongoing work to address material shortfalls. The Navy plans to deliver the ship on schedule and within budget to maintain an 11-carrier fleet. The Navy awarded the CVN 80/81 procurement contract in January 2019, expecting to save $4 billion by maintaining an 11-carrier fleet within the cost cap. Congress is considering whether the Navy should shift from large-deck, nuclear-powered carriers to smaller aircraft carriers, which has been studied periodically over the years. Advocates of smaller carriers argue they are less expensive to procure and could benefit from competition between shipyards. Advocates of smaller carriers argue they are less expensive to procure and could benefit from competition between shipyards. However, supporters of large-deck, nuclear-powered carriers believe smaller carriers are less cost-effective and less survivable in times of war. The Navy initiated a study on the survivability of smaller carriers compared to large-deck, nuclear-powered carriers. Senator McCain and Navy officials discussed exploring additional options to the traditional aircraft carrier during a Senate hearing on Navy shipbuilding programs. The Navy is conducting a study on alternatives to traditional aircraft carriers to control costs and improve power projection capabilities. Senator McCain raised concerns about competition in Navy shipbuilding programs, prompting Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Sean J. Stackley, to discuss the need for competition and the exploration of different carrier options. The Navy is exploring alternatives to traditional aircraft carriers to enhance power projection capabilities and control costs. Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Sean J. Stackley, acknowledged the lack of competition in shipbuilding programs due to the prohibitive capital investment required for constructing nuclear aircraft carriers. The Navy is conducting a study to determine the composition of future large deck aviation ships, including carriers. The Navy is conducting a study to determine the composition of future large deck aviation ships, including carriers, in order to improve war fighting capabilities and reduce costs. The study aims to match capabilities to projected threats and promote competition in naval ship construction. The results will inform future shipbuilding budget submissions and efforts beyond current plans. The Navy is conducting a study on future large deck aviation ships to enhance warfighting capabilities and cost-effectiveness. $100 million for the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) cannot be used until the Secretary of the Navy submits required certifications and reports to Congress. Additionally, a report on potential requirements for future aircraft carriers to replace or supplement the CVN-78 class must be submitted by April 1, 2016. The Navy is studying future large deck aviation ships to enhance capabilities and cost-effectiveness. The report includes requirements for alternative aircraft carrier designs, propulsion options, tonnage options, unmanned systems integration, cost assessment, acquisition strategy, shipbuilding considerations, and funding/timing considerations for the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels. The report analyzed the feasibility of adopting four aircraft carrier concept variants as follow-ons to the Ford-class carrier. Options include two large-deck carriers with fixed-wing aircraft capabilities and two smaller carriers for STVOL aircraft. The report analyzed four aircraft carrier concept variants as follow-ons to the Ford-class carrier: CVN 8X with two life-of-the-ship reactors, CVN LX with reduced capabilities compared to Ford class, CV LX supporting only STOVL operations, and incorporating larger ship's beam excursion. The Navy examined a 20,000-ton variant resembling escort carriers in the LHA 8-class flight 1 studies. The carrier variants showed capability shortfalls in some instances. The CVN 8X offers similar warfighting capability to the Ford-class carrier. The CVN LX concept variant offers integrated air wing capabilities near current levels but with less organic mission endurance. The CV LX concept variant, a version of the LHA 6 platform, could be a low-risk, cost-saving alternative for the Navy to reduce carrier expenses. It may have reduced survivability and redundancy compared to the Ford-class carrier, impacting operation concepts and potential cost savings. The key to cost reduction lies in engineering redundancy, speed, and air wing fuel capacity, which could affect mobility and theater closure. The CV LX concept variant, a potential low-cost alternative for carrier expenses, may not be viable for the long term without reassigned capabilities. It could reduce the number of Ford-class carriers but would require more platforms for certain missions. The smallest concept variants, the CV EX 20,000-ton sea-based platforms, lack significant capacity and an integrated air wing, necessitating reliance on other legacy platforms. The CV LX concept variant, a potential low-cost alternative for carrier expenses, may not be viable for the long term without reassigned capabilities. It could reduce the number of Ford-class carriers but would require more platforms for certain missions. The CV EX 20,000-ton sea-based platforms lack significant capacity and an integrated air wing, relying on other legacy platforms for key capabilities like AEW. This concept variant is not a replacement for current aircraft carrier capability and would require extensive analysis for feasibility. The analysis suggests that the CVN LX concept could offer considerable cost savings and is a viable alternative to explore further. It would have lower construction costs, reduced maintenance costs due to a reliance on hybrid drive, and incorporate lessons learned from the Ford class. However, transitioning to a life-of-the-ship reactor like in submarine programs may not be cost-effective due to developmental costs and reduced service life. The CV LX concept variant, on the other hand, may not be a long-term solution without reassigned capabilities and would require more platforms for certain missions. The CV LX variant may reduce construction costs with a larger force structure but would require extensive analysis for displaced missions. The CV EX variant is not practical without revising Navy operations. The CV EX variant, like the CV LX, has limitations in mutual support and logistics sustainment. Potential options for replacing Nimitz-class carriers with lower procurement costs may require changes in operations to maintain comparable aircraft capability. The Navy's force structure will likely include Nimitz- and Ford-class carriers until at least the mid-2050s, reducing the risks of introducing a new carrier in the mid-2030s. The Navy's force structure will likely include Nimitz- and Ford-class carriers until at least the mid-2050s, reducing the risks of introducing a new carrier in the mid-2030s. If a new carrier variant is selected, it will define the carrier force and constitute the supported capability available to the Navy. Capability shortfalls can be mitigated with changes in operational concepts or by adding additional platforms, but this may introduce additional costs. There is room to make trade-offs in aircraft sortie rate capacity between the Ford-class carrier and a lower-cost platform. The importance of considering threats to carrier operations and their survivability compared to land-based tactical air operations is highlighted. The question of shifting to smaller aircraft carriers was addressed in studies required by the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act. Under Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly mentioned the Navy's ability to build two new carriers. Under Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly discussed plans to build two new Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers more affordably in the future, as Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer believes $13 billion carriers are not sustainable. The decision to build the next two carriers has been confirmed, with further cost-saving measures to be considered for future ship procurements. Under Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly discussed plans to build two new Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers more affordably in the future. Modly mentioned the need to start thinking about the next carrier and potential cost-saving measures. Congressional action on the FY2020 procurement funding request for the CVN-78 program is summarized in Table 3. The Navy's FY2020 budget proposed not funding the mid-life nuclear refueling overhaul for CVN-75 (Harry S. Truman) and retiring the ship by FY2024. However, the Administration withdrew this proposal and now supports funding the RCOH for CVN-75 to keep it in service past FY2024. The Navy's decision to not fund the CVN-75 RCOH means the overhaul will be delayed to FY2025. This shift in schedule also delays the funding stream by a year. Performing the RCOH is crucial for the carrier to operate for the second half of its 50-year service life. Failure to do so would result in the ship being decommissioned prematurely. The Navy's decision to not fund the CVN-75 RCOH would result in the ship being decommissioned prematurely, reducing the carrier force by one ship. The carrier force would decline to 10 ships in FY2025 and remain at that level for the next 30 years, with temporary declines to 9 ships in some years. The Navy's decision to not fund the CVN-75 RCOH would lead to the premature decommissioning of the ship, reducing the carrier force by one. This would result in the carrier force not meeting the required number of operational aircraft carriers and carrier air wings as mandated by 10 U.S.C. 8062(b) and 10 U.S.C. 8062(e) respectively. The estimated total cost of the CVN-75 RCOH in the FY2019 budget submission was about $5.6 billion, excluding the cost of the two nuclear fuel cores. The Navy procured nuclear fuel cores for the CVN-75 RCOH in FY2008 and FY2011 for a total cost of $538 million, increasing the estimated RCOH cost to $6.1 billion. Fuel cores for future RCOHs for CVN-76 and CVN-77 have also been procured in subsequent years. If CVN-75 does not receive a Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH), two fuel cores procured since FY2008 would become surplus. These cores would be stored for potential emergency use on other Nimitz-class ships. If CVN-75 is decommissioned instead of receiving an RCOH, the savings from not funding the RCOH would be offset by the estimated $1.5 billion cost to deactivate and dismantle the ship. Initial costs for deactivation and dismantling would occur in FY2023 and FY2024. The estimated net savings from not funding the RCOH for CVN-75 would have been about $4.1 billion, with additional annual savings of about $1 billion per year for 20 to 25 years. DOD officials planned to redirect these savings to Navy investments for future capabilities. RCOHs are primarily done by Huntington Ingalls Industries/Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, VA. The Navy's recent RCOHs at HII/NNS have been scheduled back-to-back, with carriers needing to depart dry docks promptly for the next carrier's RCOH. The proposal in the Navy's FY2020 budget to skip CVN-75's RCOH and decommission the ship raised oversight concerns for Congress regarding carrier and air wing mandates. The Navy's budget proposal to skip CVN-75's RCOH and decommission the ship has raised concerns for Congress about carrier and air wing mandates. Congress has directed the Navy to maintain a force of 11 carriers and 9 carrier air wings, regardless of budget constraints, to uphold its constitutional power of the purse. Failure to comply with these provisions could set a precedent for the executive branch to disregard similar mandates in the future. The Navy's budget proposal to skip CVN-75's RCOH and decommission the ship has raised concerns for Congress about carrier and air wing mandates. Congress has directed the Navy to maintain a force of 11 carriers and 9 carrier air wings, regardless of budget constraints, to uphold its constitutional power of the purse. Failure to comply with these provisions could set a precedent for the executive branch to disregard similar mandates in the future. The implications of treating statutory provisions as optional matters and redirecting savings from deactivating CVN-75 and a carrier air wing around FY2024 are being questioned. The Navy's budget proposal to skip CVN-75's RCOH and decommission the ship has raised concerns for Congress about carrier and air wing mandates. Congress has directed the Navy to maintain a force of 11 carriers and 9 carrier air wings, regardless of budget constraints. The implications of redirecting savings from deactivating CVN-75 and a carrier air wing around FY2024 are being questioned. The Navy's 2016 Force Structure Assessment led to a requirement for a fleet of 355 ships, including 12 aircraft carriers. OSD did not object to the 12-carrier requirement. The analytical basis for reducing the carrier force from 11 to 10 is being examined. The Navy is conducting a new Force Structure Assessment (FSA) to potentially change the 355-ship figure and carrier force size. Questions arise about the impact of not funding CVN-75's RCOH on the FSA outcome and the analysts' impartiality. Concerns also exist about emergency replacement cores and the Navy's readiness to proceed with the RCOH based on the FSA results. The likelihood of needing emergency replacement fuel cores for the Nimitz-class program is being assessed, along with the potential return on investment for procuring these cores. The Acting Secretary of Defense is considering not funding the CVN-75 RCOH and deactivating a carrier air wing. The proposal to not fund the CVN-75 RCOH and deactivate a carrier air wing is a significant departure from previous DOD planning. Questions arise about the appropriateness of such a change being proposed by an acting Secretary of Defense. The impact on the industrial base and cost implications are also raised, particularly regarding HII/NNS and other parts of the aircraft carrier industry. This proposal mirrors a previous budget submission that did not fund the RCOH for the aircraft carrier CVN-73. The proposal to not fund CVN-73's RCOH was rejected by Congress, and the RCOH is currently underway. Additional background information on the two-ship block buy contract for CVN-80 and CVN-81 is presented, with discussions dating back to April 2012. The Navy released a request for proposal (RFP) to Huntington Ingalls Industries/Newport News on March 19, 2018. The Navy released a request for proposal (RFP) to Huntington Ingalls Industries/Newport News Shipbuilding (HII/NNS) in 2018 for a two-ship buy of CVN-80 and CVN-81 to achieve cost savings and enhance lethality and affordability. Assistant Secretary of the Navy, James F. Geurts, emphasized the acquisition strategy aligns with the National Defense Strategy. The Navy is pursuing a two-ship contract with HII-NNS to achieve significant cost savings. This contracting strategy has been successful in the past for aircraft carriers. The Navy plans to award the construction contract in early FY 2019 pending Congressional approval. The Navy awarded a two-ship contract for CVN-80 and CVN-81 to HII/NNS after receiving required certifications from the Department of Defense. This contract, considered a block buy contract, aims to achieve cost savings and follows a successful strategy used in previous aircraft carrier procurements. The Navy awarded a two-ship contract for CVN-80 and CVN-81 to HII/NNS as a block buy contract to achieve cost savings. Previous procurements for CVN-72, CVN-73, CVN-74, and CVN-75 were fully funded within a single fiscal year, while the two-ship block buy for CVN-80 and CVN-81 is expected to save $3.1 billion according to DOD's Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. The Navy awarded a two-ship contract for CVN-80 and CVN-81 to HII/NNS as a block buy contract to achieve cost savings of $3.1 billion. The primary differences in cost estimates are in Government Furnished Equipment and production change orders. HII/NNS expects to save up to $1.6 billion in contractor-furnished equipment. The two-ship contract for CVN-80 and CVN-81 with HII/NNS aims to achieve cost savings through production efficiency initiatives. These initiatives include using unit families in construction, reducing superlifts, and facility investments. A two-ship buy allows for more schedule overlap, reducing engineering labor hours and achieving a 55 percent reduction in construction support engineering. The agreement with the shipbuilder for CVN 81 results in a 55 percent reduction in construction support engineering hours and over 18 percent reduction in production support and planning hours compared to single ship procurements. The two-ship procurement strategy enables serial production opportunities, promotes learning, reduces setup times, and allows for efficient use of production facilities. Integrated Digital Shipbuilding (iDS) plays a key role in achieving these production efficiencies, with a total investment of $631 million from the Navy and the shipbuilder. The shipbuilder's $631 million investment in iDS will reduce production effort for FORD Class carriers. The two-ship buy accelerates benefits, leading to a reduction in touch labor and services. The agreement allows for a 7% reduction in production man-hours and more efficient material procurement, resulting in a 6% reduction in material costs. Improved material management and flexibility will prevent costly issues. The two-ship buy provides economic stability to workers across 46 States within the industrial base, reducing change order requirements and budget allocations by over 25 percent. It also allows for negotiation of economic order quantity savings with GFE providers. The Navy's decision to buy aircraft carriers CVN-80 and 81 together will provide economic stability to workers at Newport News Shipbuilding, supporting 23,000 to 25,000 workers for the next decade. Buying the carriers closer together will prevent workforce disruptions and save costs. If the two-carrier buy goes through, it would avoid labor disruptions, ensure stability in the workforce, and contribute to an expected $1.6 billion in savings at Newport News Shipbuilding. This is due to workforce efficiency, reduced engineering workload, and overall cost savings from buying two carriers at once. The potential two-carrier buy would result in significant savings at Newport News Shipbuilding, including workforce efficiency, reduced engineering workload, and overall cost savings. Discussions have focused on using a block buy contract to procure two carriers over six years, with no statutory limit on the contract duration. The LCS block buy contracts were amended to cover LCSs procured in a seventh year, allowing for the possibility of using a block buy contract to procure three aircraft carriers over seven or eight years. This could result in a greater cost reduction than a two-ship block buy contract, but may limit congressional flexibility in changing aircraft carrier procurement plans in response to strategic shifts. The Navy may adjust aircraft carrier procurement plans in response to changing circumstances. The October 2018 CBO report states that the total cost of the CVN-78 program is $13.0 billion, equal to the cost cap set in law. The Navy is making efforts to manage costs within the program's cost caps. The total cost of the CVN-78 program is estimated to be $15.5 billion in 2018 dollars, 23 percent more than the initial estimate in 2008. The cost does not include $5 billion in research and development expenses for the entire class. Construction of the lead ship is complete, but there are ongoing issues with the power systems and advanced arresting gear. The next carrier after CVN-78 will be the CVN-79, the John F. Kennedy, with funding starting in 2007. The CVN-79, John F. Kennedy, is funded since 2007, authorized for construction in 2013, with planned completion in 2024 and deployment in 2026. Estimated cost is $11.3 billion. Changes made to construction process to reduce costs, but final cost may exceed estimate. CBO estimates the cost of the CVN-79 at $11.7 billion in nominal dollars, slightly higher than the Navy's estimate. The Navy also expects the CVN-80 to cost $12.6 billion, but CBO projects it to be $13.0 billion. Both ships have a chance of exceeding their current cost estimates. The Navy's estimate for the cost of 7 carriers in the 2019 shipbuilding plan is $12.4 billion per ship, while CBO's estimate is $12.8 billion per ship. The gap between the estimates has narrowed since the 2017 plan, with the Navy's estimate increasing by $500 million per ship and CBO's estimate dropping by $200 million per ship. CBO's estimate fell mainly due to projecting less growth in real costs of the shipbuilding industry. Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. is struggling to cut labor expenses to stay within an $11.39 billion cost cap mandated by Congress for the USS John F. Kennedy. The USS John F. Kennedy, a new class of warships, is currently 47 percent complete. The contractor is not meeting the goal of reducing labor hours by 18 percent compared to the USS Gerald Ford. The Navy aims to reduce labor hours from 49 million for the Ford to 40 million for the Kennedy. Huntington Ingalls's performance is stable at 16 percent less, with key production milestones on track. The Pentagon's naval warfare division is overseeing the project. The Pentagon's naval warfare division, led by Ellen Lord, is concerned about Huntington Ingalls' ability to achieve the required 18% reduction in labor hours for the USS John F. Kennedy. Despite challenges, the Navy's program manager believes the shipbuilder can still meet the target. Huntington Ingalls has implemented build strategy changes and learned lessons from previous projects, resulting in a 16% reduction in production costs compared to the USS Gerald Ford. Shelby Oakley from the GAO expressed doubts about the Navy's ability to regain efficiency in shipbuilding contracts. Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. is seeking compensation from General Electric for flawed workmanship on the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier. The carrier had to return to port in January due to propulsion system issues. Huntington Ingalls, the shipbuilder, is seeking compensation from General Electric for propulsion system issues on the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier. The carrier experienced a second failure with a main thrust bearing, following a previous issue in April 2017. GE is working closely with Huntington's Newport News Shipyard unit and the U.S. Navy to resolve the issue. The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier is currently in a shakedown period to test systems and work out bugs before its initial combat duty in 2022. An assessment by the Navy's carrier program office revealed that machining errors by GE workers in Lynn, Massachusetts, were the root cause of a main thrust bearing failure. The Navy is assessing the costs of repairing the thrust bearings and plans to recover costs from General Electric. The Navy identified propulsion problems with the USS Gerald R. Ford due to faulty components from General Electric. The cost of the carrier exceeded the budget by $120 million, requiring repairs and an extended post-delivery phase. Future ships in the class will address any identified deficiencies. The USS Gerald R. Ford is facing issues with its \"Advanced Weapons Elevators\" which need to be fixed to ensure the safety of the ship and personnel. The cost for the carrier will stand at $13.027 billion after the adjustments are made. The Navy will need to inform Congress about breaching the spending limit and how funds will be shifted to cover the difference. The propulsion failure and elevator problems are separate from reliability issues with the aircraft launch and recovery systems on the ship. The USS Gerald R. Ford is facing issues with its troubled aircraft launch and recovery systems. The ship completed 747 shipboard aircraft launches and recoveries, exceeding the goal of about 400. None of the 11 weapons elevators are operational, with at least two being used for testing. The future USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) is about 43 percent complete, with launch planned for the fourth quarter of 2019 and delivery set for 2022. The future USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) is 43 percent complete, with a launch planned for the fourth quarter of 2019 and delivery set for 2022. The company has achieved about 75 percent of the ship erected and is on track for an 18 percent man-hour budget reduction. Undocking of CVN-79 in the fourth quarter of 2019 will occur three months earlier than originally planned. The Navy's cost reduction target for the future USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) is challenging due to delayed availability of certain materials. Huntington Ingalls spokeswoman acknowledges the challenge but mentions positive results from new cost-saving initiatives. Navy Secretary Richard Spencer will continue monitoring the CVN-79's progress. Richard Spencer will continue to monitor the construction of the CVN-79, emphasizing the need for CEO involvement due to the complexity of the project. The Navy is working with contractors to reduce technical risks and late material impacts, with a focus on efficiency gains and labor hour reductions. The Navy has hired third-party experts to assist in identifying manufacturing opportunities for improvement. The office director overseeing shipbuilding assessments stated that the $11.4 billion cost cap for CVN-78 was unlikely to be met due to potential labor-hour inefficiencies. The ship, over 30% complete, may not achieve further efficiency gains to reduce labor hours. In a June 2017 Navy testimony, it was mentioned that efforts are being made to keep the cost within the $12.887 billion target. The $12.887 billion budget for CVN-78 may be exceeded due to potential labor-hour inefficiencies. A $20 million procurement funding request is pending for repairs needed. The Navy is evaluating if additional funding is necessary to avoid breaching the Nunn-McCurdy Act. Congress has not been adequately informed of the situation. The Navy is trying to avoid incurring additional costs to stay within the budget for CVN-78. Congress has not been properly notified about the potential need for additional funding to prevent breaching the Nunn-McCurdy Act. The June 2017 GAO report highlights that the cost estimate for the second Ford-Class aircraft carrier, CVN 79, is unreliable and fails to incorporate lessons from the first ship, CVN 78. Cost growth for CVN 78 was due to challenges in technology development, design, and construction, along with an overly optimistic budget estimate. The Navy's estimate for CVN 79 does not show that the program can meet its $11.4 billion cost cap. The Navy developed an optimistic cost estimate for CVN 79, assuming a significant reduction in labor hours compared to CVN 78. However, independent cost reviews suggest that the estimate may not adequately consider program risks, potentially leading to insufficient budget for ship construction. Current reporting mechanisms provide limited insight into overall Ford Class program and individual ship costs. The Navy's Ford class ship program lacks transparency in individual ship costs, with no independent cost estimates conducted for ships prior to 2015. The program received over $15 billion in funding without detailed cost breakdowns. Congress has limited oversight due to the lack of transparency. The Navy aims to deliver the lead ship within the $12.887 billion cost cap, but cost reductions and improved performance are needed. Since 2011, efforts to reduce costs and improve performance on the first-of-class aircraft carrier have been successful. Changes in construction approach and affordability review on CVN 79 have led to cost reductions. The Navy has emphasized stability in requirements, design, schedule, and budget, with the cost cap for follow ships in the CVN 78 class reduced to $11,398 million. Ongoing process improvements are being made to further reduce costs. The Navy has emphasized stability in requirements, design, schedule, and budget to drive further improvement to CVN 79 cost. The FY 2017 President's Budget requests funding for an efficient build strategy for the ship. A two-phased strategy will be used to deliver CVN 79 within the cost cap, with select ship systems and compartments scheduled for completion in the second phase of production. Construction planning for Enterprise (CVN 80) began in January 2016, with construction scheduled to begin in 2018. The FY 2017 President's Budget request re-phases CVN 80 funding for more efficient production. The FY 2017 President's Budget request re-phases CVN 80 funding to support a more efficient production profile, leveraging class lessons learned for cost reduction. Efforts are made to accelerate production work to earlier phases of construction. The October 2015 Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing reviewed cost growth and issues in the CVN-78 program. OSD ASD Testimony highlighted the Navy's proposed CVN(X) Acquisition Strategy as an evolutionary development of capabilities planned for the CVN. The Navy's evolutionary strategy for the CVN program involved technology improvements on the USS GEORGE H. W. BUSH, but Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld directed a re-examination to reduce costs and increase delivery speed. This led to the proposal of a new flight deck and increased capabilities. The Navy's evolutionary approach for the CVN program included a new flight deck, allowance for future technologies, and a reduction in manpower. A Program Decision Memorandum approved by Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz codified these changes, renaming the ship CVN-21. By April 2004, the Navy had evaluated technologies for three ships, consolidated them into one for the lead ship, acknowledging challenges but deeming them achievable. Acting USD AT&L Michael Wynne directed the Navy to use a hybrid cost estimation approach. The Navy transitioned to a hybrid cost estimation approach for the CVN program in 2004, following a comprehensive assessment that identified consolidation in the Industrial Base, excessive oversight, and the importance of requirements stability in containing costs. This led to the development of a revised Operational Requirements Document for the FORD Class, with CVN 78 as the lead ship. The construction of CVN 78, the lead ship of the FORD Class, was delayed until 2008 due to budget constraints, but delivery schedule remained constant, increasing risks and costs. The Navy addressed technical and schedule risks, concurrency challenges, and acquisition reform efforts were supported by Congress through the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) in 2009. WSARA strengthened the 'Nunn-McCurdy' process, requiring DOD to report to Congress when cost growth breaches a critical threshold. The Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) had a significant impact on the CVN 78 program, leading to cost and schedule growth by 2008 and 2009. USD AT&L John Young required the Navy to provide a list of descoping efforts and have an off-ramp back to steam catapults if the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launching System (EMALS) posed problems. An independent review of CVN 78 technologies was directed by a Defense Support Team (DST), following a Program Assessment Review (PAR) that recommended converting EMALS and Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) production contracts to firm, fixed price contracts to control cost growth. The Dual Band Radar (DBR) cost and risk growth was a result of the DDG 1000 program Nunn-McCurdy critical unit cost breach in 2010. Development costs originally planned for the DDG 1000 program had to be supported by the CVN 78 program due to cost reduction measures. Design issues with the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) have had the most negative impact on CVN 78 construction compared to other advanced technologies. Despite delays in critical component delivery, it is expected that the AAG system will still meet its required capabilities. The CVN 78 program has faced delays in critical component delivery, impacting the construction. Despite concerns about reliability growth, improvements cannot be made until a fully functional system is installed and operating. The introduction of the \"Better Buying Power\" initiative has helped stabilize cost growth, but there is still work to be done. The program is currently in the testing phase before deployment, with concerns about the timing of the Full Ship Shock Trial. The Department decided to conduct the Full Ship Shock Trial (FSST) on CVN 78 before deployment, balancing operational and technical risks. Concerns remain about the EMALS and AAG systems, requiring completion of land-based testing for certification. USD AT&L is working with the Navy to tailor the program and ensure oversight. Land-based testing is planned before final at-sea operational testing for these systems. The cost control for CVN 79 involved applying lessons learned from CVN 78 construction and implementing a more efficient plan with competition. A strong relationship with the Navy was established to improve processes and policies, including revitalizing the acquisition workforce. Under Secretary Kendall authorized the Navy to proceed with the design and construction of CVN 79 and advanced procurement for CVN 80. OSD and the Navy are committed to delivering CVN 79 within the cost cap. The Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) states that the Navy plans to deliver CVN 78 early in 2016 and start initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E) in late 2017. The program faces challenges with the reliability and performance of key systems like the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) and Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS). The Navy is working towards a successful IOT&E and deployment of the CVN 78 carrier, facing challenges with the maturity of key systems like AAG and EMALS. Resolving uncertainties in reliability and performance is crucial for combat operations. Design features aim to enhance aircraft launch and recovery capabilities. The Navy is working on improving the launch and recovery capabilities of the CVN 78 carrier with key systems like EMALS and AAG. However, there are concerns about the reliability of EMALS, with data indicating it may not meet Navy's requirements. Data on the reliability of DBR and AWE systems, as well as the re-designed AAG, are currently unavailable. The reliability of the re-designed AAG is uncertain, and performance problems with these systems are ongoing. If the current schedule for testing and deployment remains unchanged, CVN 78's ability to conduct flight operations could be compromised. There is a significant risk that CVN 78 will not meet its self-defense requirements due to known issues with current combat systems. While the design includes improvements, they may not address all shortcomings identified in testing on similar ships. The limitations in timelines, sensor coverage, and system track management pose a significant risk to CVN 78's ability to defend against anti-ship cruise missiles. The decision to conduct the Full Ship Shock Trial (FSST) on CVN 78 was reversed in 2015, with potential implications for future carriers in the Ford-class. The Navy has concerns about manning and berthing on CVN 78, which was designed to have reduced manning to cut costs. Similar problems have been seen on other recent ship classes. There are significant risks to the successful completion of CVN 78's testing and deployment due to performance issues and unreliable key systems. If not corrected, these problems could affect the ship's ability to conduct flight operations and defend itself in combat. The test schedule for CVN 78 leaves little time to fix issues before testing begins. The Navy is concerned about manning and berthing on CVN 78, designed for reduced manning to save costs. There are risks to testing and deployment due to performance issues and unreliable systems. The test schedule leaves little time to fix problems before testing begins, increasing the likelihood of issues during IOT&E. Conducting the FSST on CVN 78 as soon as feasible is crucial for combat operations and future carrier construction. Navy testimony highlights the approved three-ship acquisition approach starting with CVN 77 and the next two carriers. The Navy approved a three-ship acquisition approach starting with CVN 77, followed by CVNX1 (CVN 78) and CVNX2 (CVN 79). CVN 77 focused on integrating new technologies into combat systems, while CVNX1 featured new HM&E architecture and advanced systems like EMALS catapults. The design focus for the evolutionary CVNX2 (future CVN 79) was to incorporate new technologies like the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) and Advanced Weapons Elevators (AWE) for reduced manning and improved maintainability. In 2002, DOD changed the program acquisition strategy to transition to a new aircraft carrier class in a single step. The program acquisition strategy shifted to a single ship leap with CVN 77 reverting to a modified NIMITZ Class design. CVN 78 construction was delayed to 2007 with a major redesign to incorporate new technologies, leading to the creation of the FORD Class with CVN 78 as the lead ship. The construction of CVN 78 was delayed to 2008 due to budget constraints, compressing and overlapping technology development, ship design, and construction phases. This led to concurrency issues and changes in program planning, posing cost and schedule risks for the lead ship. The construction of CVN 78 was delayed to 2008 due to budget constraints, overlapping technology development, ship design, and construction phases. The incorporation of 23 developmental systems in the FORD Class compounded challenges, leading to delays and cost growth in program execution. Shipbuilder actions resolved some first-of-class issues but at an unstable cost. The construction of CVN 78 faced delays and cost growth due to first-of-class issues, leading to a revised launch date in November 2013. Despite the delay, the ship launched at 70 percent completion, enabling efficient outfitting and on-time completion of key milestones. The Navy expects a delay of six to eight weeks in the sea trial schedule for CVN 78 due to first-time energization and grooming of new systems taking longer than planned. The shipboard test program for AAG equipment has also faced delays, but all equipment will be installed on CVN 78 at delivery. The Navy is managing schedule delays within the cost cap and expects no delays in operational testing and deployability. The Navy implemented actions to improve oversight of CVN 78 program, including converting design contract to completion contract and reducing construction fee. Shipbuilder performance has been on-target since contract change. The Navy made changes to the CVN 78 construction contract to reduce fees and improve oversight. Contract design changes are limited to safety and mission-critical needs. A review in 2008-2009 led to a fixed-price contract for EMALS and AAG systems. In 2011, carrier specifications were revised to reduce unnecessary costs. Material cost overruns have been addressed through improved ordering processes. The Navy and shipbuilder have implemented strategies to improve material ordering and delivery, including optimal procurement practices, assigning personnel to key vendors, transferring excess material from CVN 78 to CVN 79, and conducting Flag-level summits for cost reduction and on-time delivery. The Navy and shipbuilder have implemented strategies to improve material ordering and delivery for the CVN 78 build plan. This includes a focus on completion of structural work and critical path tasks to ensure on-time delivery of equipment. To meet cost improvement targets, the completion level at launch was increased from 60 percent to 70 percent. Collaborative build process reviews and specific launch metrics by system were established to drive system completion. Staffing for waterfront engineering and material expediters was increased to support meeting launch metrics, leading to delays but higher pre-outfitting levels for CVN new construction. The Navy and shipbuilder have implemented strategies to improve material ordering and delivery for CVN 78 build plan, focusing on completion of critical path tasks. Pre-outfitting levels for CVN new construction were increased to stabilize costs and improve test program performance. A detailed integrated master schedule provides visibility and cost control across shipbuilding disciplines. Important management changes were made, including assigning a new Program Executive Officer with carrier operations experience. A separate Program Office, PMS 379, was established for CVN 79 and CVN 80, allowing PMS 378 to focus on cost control and schedule. The Navy and shipbuilder have implemented strategies to improve material ordering and delivery for CVN 78 build plan, focusing on critical path tasks. Management changes were made, including assigning a new Program Executive Officer for CVN 78. The shipbuilder assigned new leadership roles to strengthen performance. Bi-weekly launch readiness reviews focus on cost performance and critical path issues. Quarterly reviews ensure efforts to improve cost performance are being made. Actions taken are successfully controlling cost growth. The Navy and shipbuilder's efforts to control cost growth for CVN 78 have been successful, with no changes in the Government's estimate at completion over the past four years. A rigorous process has been established to analyze contract change requests, only approving changes allowed within specific categories. The historical average for contractual changes is approximately 10 percent of construction cost for the lead ship of a new class, but CVN 78 has maintained a lower change order rate. The Navy has successfully controlled cost growth for CVN 78, maintaining a change order budget of less than four percent. Certain areas of the ship not required for delivery have been identified and removed from the shipbuilder's contract, with deferred work to be completed within the budgeted end cost. The cost cap for CVN 79 was adjusted in 2013 to address inflation and design improvements. The Navy and the shipbuilder made significant changes to deliver CVN 79 at the lowest possible cost by conducting an affordability review and incorporating design improvements. Cost savings initiatives were outlined in a report to Congress in May 2013, with stability in requirements, design, schedule, and budget being essential for controlling and improving CVN 79 cost. Requirements for CVN 79 were finalized before construction began, with the technical baseline and budget agreed upon by the Chief of Naval Operations and ASN(RD&A). The budget for CVN 79 was agreed upon by the Chief of Naval Operations and ASN(RD&A) to ensure design stability and production effectiveness. At the time of construction contract award, CVN 79 had 100% of the design product model complete and 80% of initial drawings released. The construction benefited from matured technologies from CVN 78, with lessons learned from systems like EMALS and AAG. The shipbuilder had a completed FORD Class design, enabling better procurement management for CVN 79 materials. The shipbuilder has implemented extensive improvements in material procurement for CVN 79 to drive cost reductions and production labor improvements. A new material procurement and management strategy consisting of eight initiatives has been developed. Comprehensive reviews and consultations with other Navy shipbuilders have been conducted to enhance construction efficiency for CVN 79. The shipbuilder has made significant changes in the construction process of aircraft carriers, including installing more parts in shop and on the final assembly platen for CVN 79 compared to CVN 78. These changes aim to increase efficiency and affordability in construction. Lessons learned from CVN 78 construction have led to design changes for more cost-effective building of aircraft carriers. The shipbuilder has implemented changes in the construction process of aircraft carriers to increase efficiency and affordability. A two-phase delivery plan is being implemented for CVN 79 to streamline construction and reduce costs. Lessons learned from previous constructions are being leveraged for CVN 80 to achieve cost and risk reduction for future FORD Class ships. The CVN 80 strategy aims to improve on previous efforts by frontloading work in early construction phases for cost efficiency. Challenges with the first-of-class FORD carrier are being addressed, with the class expected to offer valuable warfighting capability at a lower total ownership cost than NIMITZ Class CVNs. The Navy is taking steps to control costs and increase affordability in carrier acquisition. The GAO testimony highlights unrealistic business cases in the construction of the Ford-class aircraft carrier. In 2007, GAO found that CVN 78 costs were underestimated and critical technologies were immature, leading to cost growth, testing delays, and reduced capability. The ship is now over $2 billion over budget, with unreliable key systems affecting promised aircraft launch and recovery rates. Construction schedule has held fast, but land-based tests of key technologies have been deferred. The ship must complete its final construction phase concurrently with key test events, leaving no margin for the unexpected. The Navy awarded a construction contract for CVN 79 with a $11.5 billion cost cap, but it is likely to encounter problems and incur additional costs. The strategy to achieve the cost cap relies on optimistic assumptions of construction efficiencies and cost savings, which may lead to higher costs than estimated. The acquisition history of the carrier illustrates challenges in shipbuilding and weapon system acquisition despite Department of Defense and Congress reforms. Competition for funding leads to overpromising performance at unrealistic costs and schedules, undermining best acquisition practices and oversight tools. The Navy's budget process incentivizes funding programs before sufficient knowledge is available, leading to a culture of undue optimism. A press report from July 2015 reveals plans to invest $25 million per year starting in 2017 to lower the cost of building new Ford-class aircraft carriers. Rear Adm. Michael Manazir highlights the focus on affordability and cost-cutting technologies in ship design. The Navy is focused on cost-cutting technologies in ship design, with plans to reduce costs for the USS Kennedy and stay within the budget cap. A $25 million initiative aims to find innovative shipbuilding techniques to lower costs, with a goal of removing $500 million from the cost of the USS Enterprise, CVN 80. The Navy aims to reduce costs for the USS Kennedy and CVN 80 by implementing cost-cutting technologies in ship design. A $25 million initiative is focused on finding innovative shipbuilding techniques to lower costs, with the goal of removing $500 million from the cost of CVN 80. Moore emphasized the importance of building Ford-class carriers for historical Nimitz class levels in terms of man-hours, while investing in new approaches and processes for ship construction. The Navy is investing in new welding machines and techniques to improve efficiency in shipbuilding. Other cost-saving efforts include using new coatings, installing electrical cabling more efficiently, and implementing complex assemblies. Shipbuilders are also adopting strategies like having work crews stay on the same task for several weeks to increase efficiency. Additionally, construction work on the USS Ford is being done in workshops to save costs. The Newport News Shipbuilding is implementing cost-saving measures to reduce man hours and improve efficiency in carrier construction. Investments in new welding machines and techniques, as well as lessons learned from the first ship, are contributing to a projected 18 percent reduction in man hours for the second Ford-class aircraft carrier. The Navy's second aircraft carrier in a new class is expected to exceed a cost cap by $235 million, according to the Pentagon's cost-assessment office. The second aircraft carrier in the new Ford class will exceed a congressionally mandated cost cap by $235 million, down from a previous estimate of $370 million. The Navy believes it can still deliver the ship within the limit, with updated labor rates contributing to a more accurate cost estimate. Rear Admiral Tom Moore stated that the program would save a billion dollars by reducing man hours needed to construct the ship by 18 percent. The construction of the new aircraft carrier in the Ford class will reduce man hours by 18 percent, saving about $500 million. The contract also reduces government risk by moving to a fixed price environment. The target fee is the lowest ever for a CVN new construction, aiming for a 50/50 cost share. In February 2015, Navy officials testified about the commitment to deliver CVN 78 within the $12.887 billion cost cap. Efforts to reduce costs and improve performance have led to stable progress since 2011. The contract for the new aircraft carrier aims for a 50/50 cost share, with the lowest target fee ever for a CVN. Efforts to reduce and stabilize aircraft carrier construction costs have been successful since 2011. Changes in build strategy and resolution of first-of-class impacts on CVN 79 have led to significantly reduced man-hours for completed work. Ongoing process improvements continue to be identified, with the Navy extending the CVN 79 construction preparation contract into 2015 for continued planning, construction, and material procurement. The Navy extended the CVN 79 construction preparation contract into 2015 to capture lessons learned and incorporate construction process improvements. The DD&C contract is expected to be awarded in the third quarter of FY 2015 as a fixed price-type contract. The delivery of CVN 79 will use a two-phased strategy to complete ship systems and compartments more efficiently. This approach aims to reduce costs and allows for the latest procurement and installation of shipboard electronic systems. The FY 2014 NDAA adjusted the cost cap for CVN 79 and follow ships to $11,498 million to incorporate lead ship lessons learned and design changes. The Navy has maintained Ford class requirements and imposed strict controls to ensure CVN 79 is delivered below the cost cap. The FY 2016 President's Budget request aligns funding for the most efficient build strategy, with CVN 80 beginning long lead time material procurement in FY 2016. The FY 2016 request for CVN 80 aims to reduce overall ship cost by re-phasing the project closer to an optimal profile. The Navy plans to incorporate cost reduction initiatives and lessons learned from previous ships. In a May 2013 testimony, the Navy addressed cost growth issues on CVN-78 and implemented corrective actions. The Navy has implemented corrective actions to address cost growth issues on CVN 78 and plans to reduce overall ship cost for CVN 80 by incorporating cost reduction initiatives and lessons learned. Significant changes on CVN 79 will reduce the cost to build the ship, with a focus on complete design, firm requirements, and improved production efficiencies. The new class of aircraft carrier offers tremendous capability and cost advantages compared to the NIMITZ-class it will replace. The Navy has taken corrective actions to address cost growth issues on the lead ship, CVN-78, impacting cost performance. Efforts are being made to control costs and improve performance on lead and follow ship contracts, with a focus on improving performance for CVN 79 and following ships of the class. Sean Stackley testified that the cost growth on CVN-78 is unacceptable and efforts are being made to recover costs and improve performance. The cost growth on the lead ship, CVN-78, is unacceptable due to design issues and vendor base challenges. Efforts are being made to control costs and improve performance for future carriers like CVN-79. Efforts are being made to control costs and improve performance for future carriers like CVN-79 by completing the design, optimizing material procurement, and rewriting the build plan to increase efficiency in construction. Labor rates and investments are also being addressed to achieve these efficiencies. During a hearing, Stackley discussed the risks involved in building the first ship of a new class, such as the CVN-78, which had significant changes compared to the Nimitz. These changes were made for increased capability, survivability, and cost reduction, leading to a decision to take on the associated risks. The construction process involves overlapping development of new systems, design incorporation, and actual construction, increasing risk with any changes in the new ship class. The risks involved in building the first ship of a new class, like the CVN-78, drive cost growth. However, subsequent ships benefit from a stable design, vendor base, and workforce, leading to cost reductions. Carriers have a unique procurement schedule, spreading out learning over a longer period. The Navy's plan for building CVN-79 includes significant cost reductions based on lessons learned from CVN 78. Changes in construction approach and design will help reduce costs for building the ship. CVN 79 construction will begin with a focus on stable requirements, new technologies from CVN 78, and an optimal build plan to optimize cost and schedule performance. The Navy and shipbuilder are implementing cost reduction initiatives to lower construction costs. The Navy is implementing cost reduction initiatives in its government furnished systems to reduce material costs, man-hours, and overall costs for CVN 79. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus outlined these actions in a letter to Senator McCain in March 2012. The Navy's nuclear aircraft carrier program is of utmost importance for national security. The CVN 78, a redesign of the NIMITZ Class, incorporates new technologies and design changes including a new reactor plant, propulsion system, electromagnetic aircraft launching system, advanced arresting gear, and integrated warfare system. The CVN 78, a redesign of the NIMITZ Class, incorporates new technologies and design changes. Major developments directed in 2002 were integrated into CVN 78 in a single step, leading to cost impacts. A review was conducted to improve cost for carrier design, material procurement, planning, build, and test. The Navy's share of the shipbuilder's construction overrun was $690 million. The findings of the review and steps to drive affordability into the remaining CVN 78 construction effort are outlined in a white paper. The 'fact of life' portion of the overrun is included in the Fiscal Year 2013 President's Budget request. The review highlighted challenges in applying traditional carrier build planning to a new design, low-rate sole-source procurement, and economic factors impacting CVN 78 procurement. The approach for ensuring affordability for CVN 79 focuses on addressing these issues and applying lessons learned from CVN 78. The Navy and the shipbuilder have implemented actions to improve cost performance and reduce government exposure in the procurement of CVN 78, focusing on design, material procurement, and production. The program must execute with zero additional cost growth and improve production performance. The Navy has implemented contract design changes for CVN 78 to incentivize cost performance improvement and reduce government exposure to cost growth. The shipbuilder's performance has been on target or better since the contract was changed, with construction fees retracted based on performance. Changes to the contract are strictly controlled and limited to safety or mission-degrading deficiencies. The Navy also converted the EMALS and AAG production contract to a fixed price contract to cap cost growth and impose penalties for late delivery. The Navy is reviewing carrier specifications with the shipbuilder to reduce unnecessary costs and improve cost performance. Material cost overruns have been the biggest impact on costs, stemming from lead ship complexity and inadequate accountability for material procurement. It is crucial to enhance material delivery to the shipyard and correct material procurement deficiencies for future carriers. The Navy and shipbuilder have taken actions to address these issues. The Navy and shipbuilder are collaborating to optimize material procurement strategies for CVN 79. This includes employing supply chain management experts, reviewing material requirements, expediting component qualifications, transferring excess material from CVN 78 to reduce costs, and conducting government furnished equipment summits for cost reduction opportunities and on-time delivery. The Navy and shipbuilder are working together to optimize material procurement strategies for CVN 79, focusing on cost reduction opportunities and ensuring on-time delivery of equipment. The key finding for CVN 78's remaining cost is the need to increase completion at launch to at least 65% to avoid costly system completion activities later in production. To achieve this, a collaborative build process review was conducted with other shipyards to benchmark performance and drive focus on system completion. The shipbuilder has established specific launch metrics by system and increased staffing for waterfront engineering and material expediters. They have linked all processes within an integrated master schedule for better visibility and control of cost and schedule performance. Unit Readiness Reviews are being conducted for CVN 78 erection units to ensure proper outfitting levels. The shipbuilder has made important management changes, including assigning new Vice Presidents and general shop foremen to strengthen CVN 78 performance. The Navy has appointed a new Program-Executive Officer with carrier operations experience for bi-weekly launch readiness reviews. The Assistant Secretary of the Navy conducts monthly reviews to ensure program progress and performance. The Navy is conducting a line-by-line review of all 'cost to-go' on CVN 78 to improve cost performance. CVN 79 Advance Procurement started in 2007, with plans to leverage added time for affordability improvements. The Navy plans to leverage added time for affordability improvements for CVN 79 by introducing a fundamental change to the carrier procurement approach and build plan, incorporating lessons learned from CVN 78. The key documents for procurement are the design and build plan, with strict rules in place for changes on the follow ship. The Navy is requesting procurement authority for CVN 79 with the Design Product Model complete and construction drawings 95 percent complete. The shipbuilder has completed 95 percent of the bill of material for CVN 79, with first article testing and certification nearly finished for new equipment. The Navy is overseeing material procurement to align with cost estimates, eliminate non-recurring costs, and ensure competitive fixed pricing and optimal build plan support. The shipbuilder has completed 95 percent of the bill of material for CVN 79, with first article testing and certification nearly finished for new equipment. The vendor base capacity and schedule for receipt support the optimal build plan being developed for production. The high level of design maturity and material certification provides a stable technical baseline for material procurement cost and schedule performance. Changes are being reviewed and implemented to improve production labor performance, including maximizing planned work in the shops, revising the sequence of structural unit construction, incorporating design changes for producibility, and increasing the size of erection units. The shipbuilder is working on detailed plans for facility improvements to increase productivity, including increasing outfitting levels for assembled units, ship completion levels, and lift capacity. The Navy may consider incentives for capital improvements such as adding covered work areas, ramps, and service towers. Aggressive targets have been set for CVN 79 to drive necessary improvements for affordability. The Navy has set aggressive targets for CVN 79 to improve carrier construction, including increasing completion levels, pulling more cables, and enhancing front-end shop work. They aim to have all structural unit hot work complete before blast and paint, increase work package throughput, ensure material availability, and resolve engineering problems quickly. Additionally, efforts are being made to reduce the cost of government furnished equipment by $500 million. The Naval Sea Systems Command is focused on reducing GFE costs by $500 million for CVN 79. Efforts are ongoing to identify specification changes that can lower costs without compromising safety. The optimal build plan for CVN 79 will be incorporated into the construction baseline, which will be procured using a fixed price incentive contract. Additionally, a Navy report to Congress on the construction plan for CVN-79 is included in the appendix. A shock trial, also known as a full ship shock trial (FSST), tests the combat survivability of a new class of ships by setting off controlled underwater charges near the ship and measuring its response to the shock. The test verifies the ship's ability to withstand enemy weapon shocks and identifies any necessary design changes for survivability standards. Shock trials are typically done on the lead ship in a new class, but there have been cases where subsequent ships in the class undergo the trial. The Navy has debated whether to conduct the shock trial for the CVN-78 class on the lead ship or the second ship in the class. Performing the trial on the lead ship could delay its deployment and strain the carrier force, while delaying it to the second ship is deemed acceptable due to the hull design similarities with the Nimitz class. The CVN-78 class shock trial debate revolves around the risks of delaying it to the second ship due to the unique design differences and the limitations of computer modeling in predicting how the new aircraft carrier will respond to shocks. OSD argues that the risk of delaying the trial outweighs the desire to avoid a delay in the lead ship's deployment. The OSD has argued that the risk of delaying the shock trial for the CVN-78 class outweighs the desire to avoid a delay in the lead ship's deployment. The Navy was directed in 2015 to plan for the shock trial, but has also sought to revisit the issue with OSD. Legislative activity regarding the shock trial is evident in recent provisions, including Section 121(b) of the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act. The Pentagon's No. 2 civilian has supported the Navy's decision to conduct the shock-testing soon on the new $12.9 billion aircraft carrier to assess its ability to withstand attacks. Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan agreed to proceed with shock-testing on the new aircraft carrier, USS Gerald Ford, as originally planned, despite initial requests for a delay. The Navy's decision to conduct the test on the lead ship was supported by the Pentagon's No. 2 civilian, in order to assess its ability to withstand attacks and maintain the 11-carrier fleet."
