    "content": "A key element in U.S. policy toward Africa is the potential benefit from increased trade and commercial ties between the United States and Africa. Interest in increasing bilateral commerce began after the end of the apartheid era in South Africa in the early 1990s. Congress approved the end of anti-apartheid restrictions in 1993, leading to measures to help sub-Saharan African countries and increase U.S. trade and investment in the region. Legislation was introduced to improve U.S.-Africa trade relations, including the development of a comprehensive trade and development policy for African countries. In 2000, Congress approved the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) to offer trade preferences and economic benefits to sub-Saharan African countries meeting specific criteria. AGOA has been amended multiple times to increase market access and extend benefits beyond the original deadline. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) was amended in 2006 to extend provisions on textile and apparel imports until 2012, including the \"third-country fabric provision.\" This provision allows apparel imports from designated SSA countries made with third-country yarns and fabrics. The report analyzes African economic trends, U.S. trade with SSA, and discusses AGOA provisions and changes since its enactment. It also highlights issues for Congress to consider. Between 1960 and 1973, African countries experienced strong economic growth post-independence. However, growth declined sharply between 1973 and 1980, leading to persistent stagnation until the early 1990s. Average per-capita GDP in Sub-Saharan Africa hit a low in the mid-1990s and had not recovered to 1970s levels by 2005. High economic growth volatility has been a common feature in the region, dampening investments and obscuring periods of good performance. This volatility has been attributed to factors like conflict and poor policies. The economic growth in African countries declined sharply between 1973 and 1980, leading to persistent stagnation until the early 1990s. Factors such as conflict, poor governance, and fluctuating world commodity prices have caused high economic growth volatility in the region. Reducing volatility is considered as important as promoting growth, with various reasons cited for Africa's economic malaise including poor governance, political instability, and dependence on single commodity exports. The past decade has seen improvements in governance and economic growth in Africa, despite ongoing challenges like political instability, poor economic performance, and poverty. The International Monetary Fund projects a 5.3% real GDP growth for the SSA region in 2012 and 2013, with significant disparities among countries. Oil-exporting countries are expected to have higher growth rates. Oil-exporting countries in SSA are projected to have strong GDP growth of 6.7% in 2012 and 6.0% in 2013. Non-energy-producing countries like Ethiopia and Kenya are expected to grow by 5.9% in 2012 and 6.1% in 2013. Middle-income countries like South Africa are forecasted to grow by 3.4% in 2012 and 3.8% in 2013. Fragile countries in SSA, including the Democratic Republic of Congo and Liberia, are expected to see improved growth due to factors like better governance and rising aid flows. In 2011, U.S. foreign direct investment in Sub-Saharan Africa totaled $3.1 billion, with major destinations including South Africa, Angola, Ghana, and Liberia. Total world FDI to SSA was about $35 billion in 2011, with top destinations being Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana. Despite improved economic performance, African countries still face challenges such as volatile weather conditions, commodity price fluctuations, and poor infrastructure. Many sub-Saharan African countries face challenges such as poor infrastructure, political instability, high poverty rates, and limited regional trade integration. Their economies heavily rely on primary product exports like oil, precious metals, and ores, making them vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations. This hinders foreign investment and limits their ability to attract large firms. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is a significant challenge for many sub-Saharan African countries, particularly in Southern Africa. In 2010, an estimated 22.9 million people were living with HIV/AIDS in the region, accounting for 68% of all cases worldwide. Nine countries in Southern Africa have the highest HIV prevalence rates, with Swaziland having the highest rate at 25.9% and South Africa having the largest HIV-positive population at 5.6 million. Approximately 1.9 million people in SSA contracted HIV in 2010, and 1.2 million people died from AIDS. The HIV/AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa diverts resources from productive investments to care for the sick, eroding human capital. The region also faces high disease burdens from malaria, tuberculosis, and water-borne infections. SSA countries carry a significant debt burden, with total government debt averaging 33.1% of GDP in 2011. Declines in external debt are attributed to debt relief initiatives like the HIPC. The SSA region has shown solid macroeconomic performance, with strong economic activity from 2010 to 2012. Total U.S. trade with SSA countries grew significantly in 2010 and 2011, after a decrease in trade during the global financial crisis. The United States imported $74 billion from SSA countries in 2011, accounting for about 3.4% of total U.S. global trade. In 2011, the United States imported $74 billion from SSA countries, accounting for 3.4% of total U.S. global imports. Total trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa grew 51% from 2009 to 2011, reaching $94.3 billion. The majority of U.S. trade with SSA is concentrated in a few countries, with Nigeria, Angola, and South Africa being the main trading partners. In 2011, the United States imported $74 billion from sub-Saharan Africa, with Nigeria, Angola, and South Africa being the main trading partners. Natural resources dominated U.S. imports from the region, with mineral fuels and oils accounting for $58.97 billion. Nigeria was the top source of U.S. oil imports, supplying 56% of petroleum imports from SSA. Angola, Chad, and Congo also contributed to U.S. petroleum imports. South Africa led in precious stones and metals imports, followed by Botswana and Angola. In 2011, the United States imported $74 billion from sub-Saharan Africa, with Nigeria, Angola, and South Africa as main trading partners. Natural resources dominated imports, with mineral fuels and oils accounting for $58.97 billion. Botswana, Angola, and Namibia were also significant diamond producers, with imports totaling about $275 million, $169 million, and $100 million respectively. Additionally, there were marked increases in imports of textiles, apparel, vehicle parts, transportation equipment, and agricultural products from SSA countries. The USITC report highlighted the competitive potential of certain textile and apparel inputs, particularly cotton products due to the region's large cotton production. In 2011, the United States imported $74 billion from sub-Saharan Africa, with mineral fuels and oils dominating imports. U.S. exports to the region included machinery, transportation equipment, cereals, mineral fuels, aircraft, and electrical machinery. U.S. foreign direct investment in Africa is mainly in mining and extractive industries, totaling around $33 billion. In 2011, U.S. FDI in Africa was largely focused on mining and extractive industries, totaling $33 billion out of $57 billion. South Africa received 67% of U.S. FDI in African manufacturing. Inflows of FDI into the U.S. from sub-Saharan Africa were $2.1 billion, while outflows to SSA were $3.4 billion in 2011. The top countries with U.S. FDI stock in SSA were Mauritius, South Africa, and Angola. Top recipients of one-year flows in 2011 were South Africa, Angola, and Ghana. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) was approved by Congress in 2000 to assist sub-Saharan African economies and improve economic relations with the United States. AGOA allows duty-free treatment for certain articles from designated beneficiary countries that meet specific criteria. AGOA requires countries to uphold U.S. national security interests, human rights, and not support terrorism. The President annually monitors and reports on countries' progress for AGOA eligibility. Proclamation 8741 reinstated AGOA eligibility for Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, and Niger as \"lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.\" 40 SSA countries are now AGOA beneficiaries, with trade-related benefits available. AGOA-eligible countries receive preferential duty-free treatment under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) until September 30, 2015, as extended by the AGOA Acceleration Act of 2004. They are exempt from certain caps on duty-free imports and may also receive duty-free treatment for specific categories of products. AGOA-eligible countries receive preferential duty-free treatment under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) until September 30, 2015, as extended by the AGOA Acceleration Act of 2004. The President may grant duty-free treatment for certain products not deemed import-sensitive in the context of imports from AGOA beneficiaries. AGOA allows duty-free and quota-free treatment for eligible textile and apparel articles in qualifying SSA countries through 2015, with specific benefits for limited categories of textiles and apparel. AGOA-eligible countries receive preferential duty-free treatment under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) until September 30, 2015, as extended by the AGOA Acceleration Act of 2004. Certain textile and apparel products are eligible for duty-free and quota-free treatment, including handloomed, handmade, or folklore articles, textiles produced in LDC SSA beneficiary countries, and specific sweaters made of cashmere and merino wool. Beneficiary countries must implement a visa tracking system to prevent illegal transshipment and collaborate with U.S. Customs to monitor exports and prevent illegal trade. AGOA requires monitoring of U.S. imports for textile and apparel surges, with possible duty-free treatment withdrawal. Non-textile products must meet origin requirements for duty-free entry, including direct import from beneficiary countries and 35% value from beneficiary developing countries. The AGOA legislation has been amended multiple times since its initial passage, including adjustments to textile and apparel provisions. Congress passed legislation such as the Trade Act of 2002, the AGOA Acceleration Act of 2004, and the Africa Investment Incentive Act of 2006. The most recent amendment in 2012 extended the third-country fabric provision. The Trade Act of 2002 made significant changes to AGOA, including doubling the cap on imports of apparel assembled in an AGOA country from fabric made in an AGOA country to 7% in FY2008. It also allowed Namibia and Botswana to qualify for benefits, extended benefits to knit-to-shape articles and hybrid cutting garments, and corrected to include merino wool sweaters knit in AGOA beneficiary countries. The Trade Act of 2002 amended AGOA by increasing the cap on apparel imports and expanding benefits to Namibia and Botswana. It also included provisions for textile transshipment enforcement and allocated funds for AGOA enforcement in South Africa. Congress further amended AGOA in 2004, extending benefits until 2015 and the special rule for LDCs until 2007. The AGOA Acceleration Act of September 2007 decreased the cap on U.S. apparel imports, aiming to promote fabric production in Africa. It clarified rules for apparel origin, allowing articles with fabric from the U.S. and AGOA countries, as well as ethnic printed fabric for duty-free treatment. The AGOA Acceleration Act of 2004 expanded duty-free treatment for apparel articles, including those with ethnic printed fabric and fabrics recognized in NAFTA as in short supply. It also increased the allowable content of non-U.S. fibers in AGOA eligible apparel imports and directed the President to provide agricultural technical assistance to AGOA beneficiary countries. The AGOA Acceleration Act of 2004 expanded duty-free treatment for apparel articles, increased allowable non-U.S. fibers in eligible imports, and provided agricultural technical assistance to beneficiary countries. Other directives included encouraging investment in agriculture, infrastructure projects, fostering relationships between customs and transportation authorities, promoting ecotourism, and conducting studies on potential growth sectors and barriers in beneficiary countries. In December 2004, the AGOA Acceleration Act was amended by the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2004, allowing Mauritius to qualify for special trade benefits. The Africa Investment Incentive Act of 2006 extended textile and apparel benefits under AGOA until 2015, along with the special rule for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) until 2012, increasing the cap on eligible imports. The AGOA contains a provision for duty-free treatment of apparel assembled in lesser-developed SSA countries, with a recent extension through September 2015. South Sudan was added to the list of eligible countries, with approval required by the Administration. Lesser-developed countries are defined as those with a per capita gross national product of less than $1,500 per year. The AGOA Acceleration Act of 2004 raised the quantitative limit on third-country fabric provision to a maximum of 3.5% of all U.S. apparel imports. The amount imported under this provision is annually announced by CITA, with a limit of 867,929,963 square meters equivalent for a 12-month period. Imports exceeding this limit are subject to applicable tariffs. Imports exceeding the quota allowance are subject to tariffs. Currently, only 23% of the allowable third-country fabric provision quota is being used. Several SSA countries have exported a significant amount of apparel under this provision. H.R. 656 directs the President to establish a Special Representative for United States-Africa Trade, Development, and Diaspora Affairs within the U.S. Department of State. H.R. 656 directs the President to establish a Special Representative for United States-Africa Trade, Development, and Diaspora Affairs within the U.S. Department of State. The representative's role includes promoting U.S.-African trade, facilitating learning exchanges, and consulting with African governments and the private sector on economic development. Companion bills in the House and Senate aim to increase U.S. exports to Africa through government-to-government relationships and private sector ties. Hearings on this legislation were held in April 2012. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations voted on an amended version of S. 2215 in September 2012. According to the USTR, over 93% of U.S. imports from AGOA-eligible countries entered duty-free in 2010. In 2011, U.S. imports under AGOA and GSP totaled $53.8 billion, with oil and mineral fuels accounting for 93% of imports. The largest portion of U.S. exports to Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are to AGOA-eligible countries, with top destinations being South Africa, Nigeria, Angola, and Ghana. Section 122 of AGOA directs the President to provide technical assistance and trade capacity building in beneficiary countries to liberalize trade, harmonize laws with WTO membership, engage in financial restructuring, and promote exports. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) directs the President to provide technical assistance and trade capacity building in beneficiary countries to liberalize trade, harmonize laws with WTO membership, engage in financial restructuring, and promote exports. In FY2010, the United States reported obligating approximately $588 million in trade capacity building assistance to AGOA countries, with funds allocated for physical infrastructure development and trade-related agriculture projects. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) requires the establishment of a United States-sub-Saharan Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum to discuss expanding trade and investment relations. The President is directed to host the first Forum meeting with AGOA-eligible countries to encourage joint ventures between small and large businesses. Additionally, the President is required to promote annual meetings by non-governmental organizations and the private sector, and to instruct U.S. delegates to review HIV/AIDS in each sub-Saharan African country and its economic impact. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) established a forum to promote trade and investment relations between the United States and sub-Saharan African countries. President Bush announced initiatives at the first Forum meeting in 2001, including a $200 million support facility for U.S. firms and the establishment of a regional office in Johannesburg to attract new investment. The AGOA forums have been held annually since 2001, alternating between the United States and an SSA partner country. The 10th AGOA forum was in Zambia in 2011, focusing on trade competitiveness and regional integration. The 11th AGOA Forum in 2012 in Washington, DC, emphasized enhancing Africa's infrastructure for trade, including physical and institutional improvements. The U.S.-Africa Business Conference 2012 in Cincinnati, OH, followed the AGOA Forum, focusing on infrastructure and human capital investments in Africa. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton emphasized the need for renewing the AGOA third country fabric provision and highlighted opportunities for U.S. businesses in Africa. The conference aimed to showcase U.S. business expertise and promote trade and investment. The U.S. business expertise is being showcased to potential African clients, focusing on infrastructure development in energy, transportation, and water and sanitation. AGOA's mandate for trade-related technical assistance is primarily implemented by USAID through the African Global Competitiveness Initiative (AGCI). USAID funds various technical assistance programs in Africa to improve trade within the region and with the United States. USAID supports regional trade efforts through missions and Trade Hubs in Ghana, Senegal, Kenya, and Botswana. They work on improving trade policy, infrastructure, and enterprise development programs. AGOA promotes private sector linkages between U.S. and SSA businesses, with USAID funding the SAIBL program to assist South African companies. SAIBL, funded by USAID, supports black-owned South African companies with business plans, ISO certification, trade delegations, and export financing. It also helps U.S. firms find opportunities in South Africa and secure financing. AGOA created this position to facilitate trade between the U.S. and SSA businesses. The AUSTRA position was created to be the primary contact in the executive branch for trade between the U.S. and sub-Saharan Africa. It advises the U.S. Trade Representative on trade and investment issues related to Africa, determines which countries are eligible for AGOA benefits, sponsors WTO training for SSA trade negotiators, and supports the Trade Advisory Committee on Africa. AGOA also directs OPIC to increase funds for projects in SSA countries to promote economic growth. The U.S. development finance agency, OPIC, supports economic growth in developing countries by providing services like political risk insurance and project financing for U.S. businesses. Since 1974, OPIC has invested nearly $6.3 billion in African projects. The Ex-Im Bank facilitates U.S. exports to developing countries when commercial financing is not available to support U.S. employment. The Ex-Im Bank provides various programs like direct loans, loan guarantees, working capital guarantees, and export credit insurance to support U.S. exports to developing countries. In FY2011, nearly $1.4 billion was authorized to support U.S. exports to Sub-Saharan African countries. The legislation also encouraged the Bank to expand its financial commitments to African countries. In FY2011, Ex-Im Bank authorized nearly $1.4 billion to support U.S. exports to Sub-Saharan African countries, with 80% of transactions supporting small businesses. The U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service provides export promotion services to small and medium-sized U.S. businesses, operating 108 \"U.S. Export Assistance Centers\" with about 500 staff in 2011. The U.S. Commercial Service operates 108 \"U.S. Export Assistance Centers\" in the United States and 115 offices in over 70 countries with about 900 overseas staff. In countries where they do not have a presence, they work with the State Department to fulfill their functions. Congress mandated an increase in staff presence in sub-Saharan Africa to better serve U.S. businesses. According to the U.S. Commercial Service Annual Report for 2011, there are currently eight CS staff in Africa located in Accra, Ghana; Nairobi, Kenya; and Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa. The International Trade Administration (ITA) is tasked with identifying U.S. export prospects, addressing trade barriers, and increasing market access in Africa through its Market Access and Compliance Unit (MAC). The Trade and Development Agency (TDA) also plays a role in promoting economic development and U.S. commercial interests. The Trade and Development Agency (TDA) promotes economic development and U.S. commercial interests in developing and middle-income countries by linking U.S. businesses to export opportunities through funding projects overseas in sectors like transportation, energy, and telecommunications. TDA provides grants to overseas project sponsors who select U.S. companies to conduct TDA-funded activities, aiming to open markets for increased exports of U.S.-manufactured goods and services. Since 1981, TDA has provided over $90 million for projects in SSA, resulting in over $1 billion in U.S. exports. The Trade and Development Agency (TDA) has funded projects in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) resulting in over $1 billion in U.S. exports. In FY2010, TDA allocated $9.3 million for 39 projects in SSA, accounting for 19% of its total program expenditures. The United States also participates in multilateral institutions like the World Bank and regional development banks, providing trade capacity building assistance through initiatives like the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) for least developed countries. The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) is a collaborative effort involving six international institutions to address trade challenges and opportunities in Least Developed Countries (LDCs). It is funded by a Multi-Donor Trust Fund, with total contributions reaching $165.1 million as of April 2012. The United States has contributed $600,000 to the fund and provided technical assistance and Trade Capacity Building (TCB) support to SSA countries on various WTO-related issues. The United States has provided technical support for SSA countries like Ethiopia and Togo to accede to the WTO. AGOA legislation encouraged exploration of new agreements for trade and investment, focusing on FTA negotiations with potential partners like South Africa, SACU, SADC, COMESA, and East African countries. The United States has supported SSA countries in joining the WTO and exploring new trade agreements. While regional economic integration efforts are ongoing in Africa, negotiations for an FTA with SACU member countries were initiated in 2003 but postponed in 2006 due to various challenges. The United States and SACU signed a Trade, Investment, and Development Cooperation Agreement (TIDCA) in 2008 to enhance previous FTA negotiations. The agreement aims to address customs, trade facilitation, technical barriers, and trade relations. The decision to negotiate with SACU reflects economic integration among member states dating back to 1910. The United States and SACU signed a Trade, Investment, and Development Cooperation Agreement in 2008 to enhance economic integration. The agreement includes free movement of goods, a common external tariff, and a common revenue pool. South Africa remains the dominant economy in the region. U.S. merchandise exports to SACU totaled $7.0 billion in 2011, while imports from SACU totaled $10.7 billion. The United States has negotiated Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) with key Sub-Saharan African countries and regional organizations to strengthen trade and economic relations. TIFAs commit signatories to expand trade, encourage private sector investment, and resolve disputes through consultation. Councils on Trade and Investment are established to address trade issues and remove barriers to trade and investment flows. The United States has signed Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) with several African countries to protect U.S. investments abroad and promote economic growth. BITs ensure national treatment for U.S. investments, limit expropriations, and enable free repatriation of funds. The goal of BITs is to encourage market-oriented domestic policies in host countries. The United States has signed Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) with African countries to protect investments, limit expropriations, and enable free fund repatriation. These treaties promote international law and trade standards. Congress oversees AGOA, focusing on beneficiary diversification, country eligibility, HIV/AIDS, and U.S. small business participation. Textile and manufacturing industries are growing under AGOA, but imports are still small compared to overall trade. AGOA imports from industries are overshadowed by petroleum and mining sectors. These industries do not offer significant employment opportunities for African workers. AGOA benefits are concentrated in a few countries, with many eligible countries exporting very little under the program. To enhance African economic diversification and export levels, targeted trade capacity building and technical assistance in key sectors like agriculture could be expanded to boost incomes and economic growth. The eligibility standards for AGOA benefits may spark controversy, with some advocating for stricter enforcement to ensure adherence to reforms, while others highlight the investment risk due to the unpredictability of benefits. Suggestions include longer eligibility terms and potential congressional oversight. The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to impact African economies. The HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa destabilizes economies and threatens progress under AGOA by diverting income to treat the disease, reducing life expectancy, and deterring investors due to high medical costs and workforce turnover. Lack of uniform trade effects reporting hinders oversight and tracking of U.S.-Africa trade and investment policy. The AGOA reporting requirement sunsetted in 2008, but Congress may consider reinstating it. Small businesses play a significant role in the U.S. economy, yet they have limited trade with Africa and lack awareness of AGOA. Increasing partnership between U.S. and African small businesses could lead to better participation on both continents. U.S. agencies could do more to raise awareness of AGOA among small businesses and create partnership opportunities. Increased investment in USAID's trade hubs and emphasis on small business entrance into Africa are key for partnership opportunities. Appropriations are needed for greater CS compliance with AGOA goals, such as deploying more CS officers in African countries. Regional Economic Integration among sub-Saharan Africa Nations, like the Southern African Development Community (SADC), aims to reduce economic dependence and promote collaboration among member countries. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) aims to reduce economic dependence and promote collaboration among member countries. The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) was founded in 1982 and includes various member states with the goal of achieving a fully integrated regional economic community. The 1996 Protocol on Trade committed signatories to remove barriers and provide national treatment for each other's goods. The East African Community (EAC) aims to achieve monetary union by 2025 through limited currency convertibility and improved fiscal and monetary policy coordination. Comprised of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, the EAC was reestablished in 1999 to revive historic regional integration arrangements. In 2010, the EAC Common Market was established, allowing for free movement of goods, labor, services, and capital within the region. Partner states agreed to eliminate trade barriers, harmonize standards, implement a common trade policy, and facilitate cross-border activities. The West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) aims to promote economic integration among member countries sharing the CFA franc. They have established a customs union with a common external tariff of 22% and are working towards a full economic union with a common market and investment policy. The WAEMU countries have a common external tariff of 22% and have established a regional stock exchange and banking system framework."
