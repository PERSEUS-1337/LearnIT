    "content": "Public housing costs are divided into capital costs for renovations and operating costs for day-to-day expenses. Operating costs vary based on factors like building age and location. Initially, PHAs covered operating costs with tenant rents, but subsidies were later provided by Congress due to increasing expenses and tenant poverty. The Public Housing Operating Fund was created in response to criticisms of the outdated Performance Funding System. A new formula for distributing funds was developed through negotiated rulemaking involving PHAs and stakeholders. A study was agreed upon to determine the true costs of operating public housing. An interim operating fund formula based on a modified version of the PFS was implemented in 2001. The Harvard Graduate School of Design conducted a public housing operating cost study in 2003. A new formula was developed based on the study results, with a final rule published by HUD in 2005. The new formula took effect in January 2007, providing subsidies to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to cover the gap between operating costs and tenant rent payments. The interim formula for determining a PHA's operating subsidy eligibility used formula expenses and formula income. HUD subtracts formula income from expenses to calculate the subsidy. The new operating fund formula is more complex, with changes in expense calculations. Non-utility expenses include basic operating costs. Under the old formula, non-utility expense levels were set for PHAs in 1975. The Allowable Expense Levels (AELs) for PHAs were initially set in 1975 and updated for inflation. They were modified in 1992 and 2001. The new operating fund formula calculates non-utility expenses based on project expense levels (PELs) from a Harvard study, adjusted for inflation, and tailored to each project within a PHA's portfolio. The HUD developed weighted average project expense levels (WAPELs) for each PHA for CY2007 funding cycle, and individual PELs for CY2008 and beyond. Utility expense levels (UELs) estimate utility costs for public housing units based on consumption levels and rates. The interim formula aimed to promote energy-efficient practices. The final rule maintains the existing formula for calculating UELs, with HUD studying options for future changes. The HUD will convene a committee to develop a new formula for calculating utility costs. The new operating fund formula includes add-ons such as self-sufficiency program costs, asset management fees, information technology fees, and energy costs. Under the new operating fund rule, formula income for public housing was initially calculated based on the average rent charged in 2004 and multiplied by eligible units, with income frozen at 2004 levels until CY2009. This incentivized PHAs to encourage income growth among tenants paying income-based rent. Under the new operating fund rule, formula income for public housing was initially calculated based on the average rent charged in 2004 and multiplied by eligible units, with income frozen at 2004 levels until CY2009. This incentivized PHAs to encourage income growth among tenants paying income-based rent. In 2010, \"unfreezing\" income resulted in an additional $400 million in rental income being accounted for. The new formula led to some PHAs gaining increased funding while others saw a decrease. A HUD analysis showed that 74% of PHAs would have qualified for higher funding under the new formula in 2004, while 26% would have received less. Losses will be phased in to help ease the transition. Under the new operating fund rule, PHAs experienced changes in funding. To ease the transition, losses will be phased in over five years, while gains were phased in over two years. HUD calculated a transition amount for each PHA based on the difference between their 2004 operating subsidy eligibility and what it would have been under the new formula. This amount was adjusted annually and either added to or subtracted from the PHA's eligibility level. For example, if a PHA's eligibility was $500,000 in 2004 but would have been $450,000 under the new formula, it would be considered a decliner with a transition amount of $50,000. Declines are limited to 5% in the first year, with adjustments made accordingly. Under the new operating fund rule, PHAs experienced changes in funding. Losses are phased in over five years, while gains are phased in over two years. PHAs can limit losses by transitioning to asset-based management before the 2011 deadline. Transition amounts are calculated based on the difference between old and new formula eligibility levels. PHAs can mitigate losses by adopting asset-based management, with HUD adding 95% of the transition amount to operating subsidy eligibility each year. HUD directed PHAs to transition to asset-based management and adopt project-based budgeting and accounting by specific deadlines. The operating subsidy a PHA is eligible for may not match the actual funding received from Congress. The operating fund for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) is often insufficient to fully fund them at 100% of their eligibility. Therefore, HUD implements across-the-board cuts to PHAs' operating subsidy levels to stay within the allocated budget. The proration level, which is the percentage of formula eligibility PHAs receive after the cuts, has fluctuated over the years. In CY2010, proration levels exceeded 100% due to the \"unfreezing\" of formula income, resulting in additional funding that did not require subsidy. The Harvard Operating Cost study revealed that government under-funds PHAs' operating costs. HUD's analysis showed that implementing a new formula in 2004 would have made PHAs eligible for an extra $264 million. This would have lowered the proration level below 98% for 2004, resulting in less funding for PHAs."
