    "content": "The concentration of rare earth elements (REEs) production in China raises supply vulnerability concerns for the United States, as REEs are essential for new energy technologies, electronic devices, automobiles, and national security applications. The global supply chain for REEs is complex, and the current U.S. mineral policy aims to ensure a stable and reliable supply for national security and economic well-being by promoting domestic production of critical materials. The United States is heavily reliant on imports of rare earth elements (REEs) and other minerals, which raises supply vulnerability concerns due to China's near-monopoly position. Congress and the Administration are considering federal investments to develop a vertically integrated rare earth supply chain in the U.S. to address this issue. The private sector may achieve lower-cost operations through technology breakthroughs. The United States is highly import-reliant on rare earth elements (REEs) and other minerals, with China's dominance as a supplier raising supply vulnerability concerns. Congress and the Administration are exploring federal investments to establish a domestic rare earth supply chain. The United States is now 100% reliant on imports for rare earth elements (REEs), mainly from China, due to lower-cost operations. There are 17 REEs, with lanthanides being the most common, and the U.S. was once self-reliant in their production. The United States is now 100% reliant on imports for rare earth elements, primarily from China, due to lower-cost operations. Rare earth elements are divided into light rare earth elements (lanthanum through europium) and heavy rare earth elements (gadolinium through lutetium), with yttrium classified as a heavy element. These elements are used in various industries such as automobile catalysts, petroleum refining catalysts, phosphors in electronic devices, permanent magnets, rechargeable batteries, and defense applications. Permanent magnets containing neodymium, gadolinium, dysprosium, and terbium (NdFeB magnets) are used in electrical components and wind turbine generators. The demand for rare earth elements is derived from the production of end-use products like flat panel displays and automobiles. An increase in the demand for these products leads to an increase in demand for rare earth elements. The demand for rare earth elements (REEs) is driven by the production of end-use products like electrical components and wind turbine generators. An increase in the demand for these products results in a higher demand for REEs. The growth in demand for consumer goods, influenced by price and income growth, plays a significant role in determining the demand for REEs. Global demand for REEs was estimated at 136,100 tons in 2010, with production around 133,600 tons annually. By 2015, global demand for REEs is projected to reach 210,000 tons per year. Global demand for rare earth elements (REEs) is projected to reach 210,000 tons per year by 2015. China's annual demand is estimated to increase to 130,000 metric tons by 2015, with an output of around 130,000 tons per year in 2016. Non-China annual output would need to be between 30,000 mt to 80,000 mt to meet global demand for REEs in 2016. New mine production may help make up the difference for some lighter elements. Several forecasts indicate potential shortfalls of light rare earth elements (LREEs) like yttrium and heavier rare earth elements (HREEs) such as dysprosium, terbium, neodymium, and europium. Concerns have been raised in the U.S. Congress due to this potential shortfall. Current production rates at Lynas Corp. Mt. Weld and Molycorp's Mountain Pass are below their stated capacities, with plans for expansion in the future. New mining projects could take 5-10 years for development, but global reserves and undiscovered resources are expected to meet long-term demand. The USGS expects global reserves to meet rising demand for rare earth elements, with projections for growth in various industries. Prices of rare earth oxides and metals fluctuated in recent years. Prices of rare earth oxides and metals have fluctuated in recent years due to Chinese export restrictions and softer demand. The potential for a surge in demand and continued export restrictions may lead to high prices for heavy rare earth elements in the short term. However, prices typically fall back to the industry's marginal cost of production after supply increases. Structural shifts in the global economy, with emerging economies like China, India, and Africa, may impact the rare earth market. Emerging economies like China, India, Africa, and other parts of Asia are expected to drive growth in the rare earth market. The demand for rare earth elements may continue to rise due to the materials-intensive nature of new infrastructure projects in these regions. If producers struggle to keep up with this demand, prices, especially for heavy rare earth elements, could remain high. However, historical trends suggest that supply will eventually adjust to meet demand, potentially leading to a plateau in prices. The long-run supply curve adjusts to meet demand, with increasing costs of mineral extraction due to lower ore grades and rising capital costs. China's production costs are expected to rise as environmental and social costs, labor costs, and domestic demand impact REE production. Higher costs may limit China's ability to drive prices down through increased production. Downstream processing costs could also impact byproduct REEs. Despite rising raw material costs, manufacturing costs of consumer goods containing REEs may continue to decline per unit output. Even with materials efficiencies, there is upward pressure on mineral prices due to overall demand growth and lack of supply capacity for products like cell phones, laptops, flat panel televisions, and iPods. Adequate mine capacity is only part of the solution to any REE supply shortfall; additional processing, refining, and manufacturing capacity is necessary to meet growing demand outside China. Sustained high prices may attract investors, but technology and skills must also be available for the work. Rare earth elements, essential for military technologies, are primarily found in samarium cobalt (SmCo) and neodymium iron boron (NdFeB) magnets. NdFeB magnets are the strongest in the world and used in military weapons systems, while SmCo is ideal for precision-guided missiles and aircraft. These elements are also used in electrical components and wind turbine generators. Rare earth elements, crucial for military technologies, are primarily found in samarium cobalt (SmCo) and neodymium iron boron (NdFeB) magnets used in military weapons systems. These elements are also essential in electrical components and wind turbine generators. Despite their importance, rare earths, except for small amounts of yttrium, have not been included in the national defense strategic materials stockpile. The Strategic Materials Protection Board (SMPB) defines critical materials based on their significance in DOD applications and the potential impact of supply disruptions. Many experts believe certain rare earth metals are critical for U.S. national security and defense applications. The United States Magnet Materials Association (USMMA) has raised concerns about the scarcity of domestic suppliers for rare earth metals and magnets, which are crucial for defense applications. DOD's position assumes there are enough supplier countries to prevent shortages, but USMMA has unveiled a plan to address the potential crisis. The Defense Authorization Act of 2014 would require DOD to assess rare earth supply chain risks. The Defense Authorization Act of 2014, passed by the House on June 14, 2013, would require the DOD to develop rare earth supply chain risk mitigation strategies. Rare earth elements, including lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium, are mainly found in bastnaesite and monazite deposits in countries like the United States, China, Australia, South Africa, Brazil, Malaysia, and India. Rare earth elements are mainly found in bastnaesite ores, with over 90% of the world's economically recoverable REEs in these deposits. Monazite, containing thorium, is no longer a significant source of REEs in the United States due to radioactive hazards and high thorium disposal costs. Bastnaesite, low in thorium and rich in lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium, was previously shipped from Mountain Pass, CA. HREEs make up only 0.4% of the total stock, with monazites produced as a minor byproduct of uranium and niobium processing. REE reserves and resources are found in various states and regions, with HREEs dominating in Quebec-Labrador. China dominates the world's rare earth production, with high-grade deposits in Inner Mongolia and lower-grade deposits in South China. Other attractive areas for REE development include Canada, Burundi, and Tanzania. While China holds 50% of the world's reserves, the United States holds about 13%, with significant REE potential also found in South Africa and Canada. South Africa, Canada, Australia, Brazil, India, Russia, Malaysia, and Malawi have significant rare earth element (REE) potential. Geologists suggest exploring REE mining from phosphorus deposits, titanium, and niobium mines. Canadian, Chinese, and U.S. firms are assessing REE deposits linked to gold, iron ore, and mineral sand projects. Mountain Pass, CA, in the United States, has notable rare earth mine production, with Molycorp operating a mine and separation plant there. They sell rare earth concentrates and refined products from above-ground stocks and new mine production. Key REEs include neodymium, praseodymium, and lanthanum. Molycorp operates a rare earth mine in Mountain Pass, CA, with significant reserves and production capacity. They export rare earth concentrates to Japan and China and are ramping up for full production in 2014. The company aims to become a low-cost producer with new separation facilities in place. U.S. Rare Earth is also involved in exploring rare earth mineral deposits in the United States. Molycorp aims to become a low-cost producer with a grade of 9.2%. U.S. Rare Earth is in the pre-feasibility stage of mine development with large deposits in Idaho, Colorado, and Montana. Canadian deposits contain heavy rare earth elements needed for magnets to operate at high temperatures. Great Western Minerals Group and Avalon Rare Metals have deposits with high content of heavy rare earth elements. Avalon is developing a rare earth deposit at Thor Lake in Canada, considered to have one of the largest REE deposits in the world. GWMG plans to have a refinery near their production sites. Great Western Minerals Group (GWMG) plans to have a refinery near their production sites in Canada and elsewhere, aiming for a vertically integrated operation. Japan Oil, Gas, and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) signed an agreement with Midland Exploration Inc. for the Ytterby project in Quebec, Canada. Lynas Corp. in Australia has potential for light rare earths development, with the Mt. Weld deposit starting new mine production in 2012. A feasibility study is ongoing for the rare earth mine Steenkampskraal (SKK) in South Africa. A study is underway to reopen the rare earth mine Steenkampskraal (SKK) in South Africa, with an agreement in progress between GWMG and Rare Earth Extraction Co. Ltd. Concerns arise over access to a reliable supply to meet current and projected demand due to China's restrictions on rare earth exports. China has significantly reduced its rare earth exports, with plans to further restrict exports in the future. In 2012, rare earth exports were around 13,000 mt due to lower demand. Export allocations were based on meeting environmental standards. China's Ministry of Commerce set export quotas for the first half of 2014 at 15,110 mt, slightly lower than 2013. Production capacity for rare earths is expected to increase in the US, Australia, Canada, and Asia within one to five years. Chinese producers are looking to expand globally, especially in Africa and Australia. Supply constraints are likely due to limited exploration companies and long lead times for refining elements. Supply constraints are likely in the short term for rare earth elements due to long lead times needed for refining. Potential mines that could come on-stream in the next five years include Eastern Coast (Brazil), Nolans bore (Australia), Nechalacor (Canada), Domng Pao (Vietnam), Hoidas Lake (Canada), and Dubbo Zirconia (Australia). The lack of refining, alloying, and fabricating capacity in the United States is a major issue for REE development. Electron Energy Corporation in PA produces samarium cobalt permanent magnets, while Hitachi Metals, Ltd. of Japan produces neodymium iron-boron. Metals, Ltd. of Japan is producing neodymium iron-boron magnets at its China Grove, NC facility. EEC uses gadolinium in its SmCo permanent magnet production. The U.S. is heavily reliant on China for dysprosium and terbium, crucial for high-temperature magnets. Prior to investments by Molycorp, the U.S. lacked supply chain capacity for rare earth elements, leading to near-total import dependence. The United States is heavily reliant on China for rare earth elements, with China producing the majority of raw materials and metals. The U.S. lacks presence in the global supply chain for rare earth elements, leading to near-total import dependence. Even if U.S. production increases, much of the processing and fabrication would still occur in China. Investor analyst Jack Lifton emphasizes the importance of developing a vertically integrated approach for rare earth elements (REE) production. This involves not only mining operations but also refining, metal production, and alloying capacity to manufacture component parts for end-use products. Joint ventures and consortiums could be formed to support production at various stages of the supply chain globally, with equity and offtake commitments from investors and producers. This integrated approach may be necessary to secure investor financing for REE production projects. Investor analyst Jack Lifton emphasizes the importance of developing a vertically integrated approach for rare earth elements (REE) production, involving mining, refining, metal production, and alloying capacity. It is crucial to know where new downstream capacity for processing, refining, and metals alloying is being built globally. Questions for Congress include the timeline for developing the necessary skill set in the United States for downstream production activities and the potential for an international educational exchange program. Molycorp's Mountain Pass mine was a dominant source of rare earth oxides from the mid-1960s to the 1980s. In the 1980s, Molycorp's Mountain Pass mine was the world's top source of rare earth oxides, driven by higher grade, low cost, and rising demand for LREEs like europium and cerium. By 2000, most rare earth oxides were imported from China due to oversupply and lower costs. Molycorp ceased production in 2002 due to environmental and regulatory issues. Since 2008, under new ownership, Molycorp aims to change the rare earth position in the US with a \"mine to magnet\" approach. After Chevron purchased Union Oil Company of California, including the rare earth mine at Mountain Pass, they sold off the non-energy Molycorp asset to investor groups in 2008. The new owners did not inherit environmental liabilities from a pipeline spill, and Chevron continued cleanup efforts. Molycorp's CEO and engineers have focused on minimizing environmental impact during the separation phase of the process by designing a proprietary oxide separation process that uses fewer reagents and recycles waste water. Molycorp broke ground for a new separation facility at the Mountain Pass mine in 2011, aiming to use fewer reagents and recycle waste water. The chloralkali facility is now mechanically complete, allowing for wastewater recycling. Molycorp acquired Santoku America in Tolleson, AZ, renaming it Molycorp Metals and Alloys (MMA) as part of their strategy to become a vertically integrated company. MMA is the sole U.S. producer of NdFeB alloy and intends to modernize and expand its facility. Molycorp acquired a majority interest in AS Silmet, doubling its capacity for rare earth oxide production. They are also exploring ways to improve metal recycling, focusing on magnets and highly valued heavy rare earth elements like dysprosium and terbium. Testing the quality of recyclable materials and evaluating the commercial feasibility of recycling permanent magnets used in consumer goods are key research areas. Molycorp is evaluating opportunities to recycle energy-efficient light bulbs for phosphors and studying new methods to create commercial-grade permanent magnets. Development of downstream activities like refining and manufacturing will require significant financing and a skilled workforce. Recruiting top talent in engineering, science, and finance is a priority for Molycorp to achieve its plans for vertical integration. Molycorp's focus on integration involves investing in the right people and training. Recent developments include acquiring Neo Materials Technology, Inc., with production facilities in China. Critics are concerned about potential Chinese export restrictions on the materials. Molycorp also has a joint venture with Japanese companies Daido Steel and Mitsubishi Corporation. Lynas, in a joint venture with Siemens, manufactures magnets for wind turbine generators using raw materials from their Mt. Weld mine in Australia. The Malaysian processing facility, operational since 2012, faces concerns over thorium disposal. GWMG plans a joint venture with China's Ganzhau Qiandong Rare Earth Group to build an oxide separation facility in South. GWMG is partnering with China's Ganzhau Qiandong Rare Earth Group to establish an oxide separation facility in South Africa, sourcing raw materials from their SKK mine. Frontier Rare Earths and Korea Resources Corp. are forming a joint venture for a similar facility in South Africa, with Frontier Rare Earths owning the Zondkopsdrift mine. State-run labs in China have been researching rare earth elements for over 50 years, with two key labs focusing on separation techniques and resource utilization. China has invested in rare earth research institutions like the Baotou Research Institute of Rare Earths and the General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals. The Bayan Obo iron deposits in Inner Mongolia are a significant source of rare earth elements. China has increased its rare earth production in provinces like Baotao, Shangdong, Jiangxi, and others. Exports rose in the 1990s, leading to a decrease in prices. In 2007, China had numerous neodymium-iron boron magnet producers. In 2007, China had 130 neodymium-iron boron magnet producers with a total capacity of 80,000 tons, growing from 2,600 tons in 1996 to 39,000 tons in 2006. China is increasing production for wind turbines, consumer electronics, and other sectors, driven by economic growth and consumer demand. Safety and environmental issues may raise operational costs. China's rare earth industry is prioritizing domestic consumption. Neodymium magnets are crucial for China's anticipated growth in wind energy from 12 GW in 2009 to 100 GW in 2020. China's policy restricts rare earth exports, especially dysprosium, terbium, thulium, lutetium, and yttrium. China aims to expand its rare earth industry by prioritizing exports of value-added materials, including consumer products, to attract foreign investors. However, concerns about technology sharing and past conflicts with Japan have made some investors hesitant to invest in China. The September 2010 maritime conflict between China and Japan heightened the urgency for buyers to diversify their sources of rare earth materials. Some urged the U.S. Trade Representative to bring a dispute resolution case against China in the WTO over export restrictions on certain raw materials. China claimed the restraints were for environmental conservation. In April 2011, a WTO panel ruled that China's export restraints on raw materials violated WTO rules. President Obama announced in March 2012 that the United States, Japan, and the EU requested formal consultations with China over its limits on rare earth exports. A final decision is expected in early 2014. In March 2011, four U.S. Senators urged the Obama Administration to oppose new financing for rare earth projects in China. The Chinese government announced plans to restructure the rare earth mining industry in 2010. China is consolidating the industry, cleaning up the environment, and building strategic stockpiles of rare earths. South Korea and Japan are also stockpiling rare earths. U.S. rare earth imports from China increased from $42 million in 2005 to $129 million in 2010. The quantity of U.S. rare earth imports from China decreased from 24,239 metric tons in 2006 to 13,907 metric tons in 2010, a 42.6% decline. Japan, which receives 82% of its rare earth elements (REEs) from China, is seeking new non-Chinese supplies due to concerns over Chinese supply embargoes. Japan's primary uses for REEs include polishing, metal alloys, magnets, and catalysts. Japan-based firms and the government are forming joint ventures and partnerships worldwide to secure REE supplies. Japan is seeking new non-Chinese supplies of rare earth elements (REEs) due to concerns over Chinese supply embargoes. Japanese firms and the government are forming joint ventures and partnerships worldwide to secure REE supplies, including partnerships with Kazakhstan, Vietnam, India, and Australia. The Japanese government aims to reduce exploration risk in the mining industry by becoming an exploration partner in potential projects globally and investing in R&D for material use efficiencies and finding substitutes for HREEs in magnets. Additionally, there were discussions about potential investments in the United States and a deal between Sumitomo and Molycorp's Mountain Pass mining operation that did not materialize. The Japanese government and private sector are concerned about China's export controls on ferroalloys containing rare earth elements (REEs) and mining quotas for HREEs. Japan's access to REEs is crucial for its manufacturing industry. Hitachi Metals plans to build a rare earth permanent magnet facility in China Grove, NC. Meetings have been held between Chinese and Japanese officials to address the rare earth situation. The Japanese government is focusing on urban mining and exploring partnerships worldwide to secure REE supplies. Investment in R&D is crucial for developing new technologies to address materials use efficiency, rare earth substitutes, and recycling. Congress could fund a global assessment to identify economically exploitable REE deposits and explore exploitation methods. Investment in R&D is crucial for developing new technologies to address materials use efficiency, rare earth substitutes, and recycling. Supporting greater exploration for REE efforts in various countries could be part of a broad international strategy. Few companies worldwide have the skills and technology for REE development, primarily located in Canada, Australia, China, South Africa, and the United States. Joint ventures or alliances may be formed for R&D and exploration of REE deposits globally. Congress may consider restrictions on these efforts in the United States. Establishing government or private-sector stockpiles for REE supplies could be beneficial. Establishing non-defense economic stockpiles and private-sector stockpiles for rare earth elements (REE) is advocated by some in industry and government to ensure a stable supply for \"green initiatives\" and defense applications. However, creating an economic stockpile could be costly and risky due to changing prices and technology affecting the composition of needed REEs. The Department of Defense (DOD) and USGS are evaluating which REEs are essential for the National Defense Stockpile (NDS), which previously stored materials for wartime use. Some rare earth elements from the NDS were sold off in 1998, but they were never classified as strategic minerals. The National Research Council (NRC) has identified rare earth elements (REEs) as critical materials with high supply risk and potential severe impacts. Questions arise on what materials should be stockpiled, such as rare earth oxides or alloyed magnets containing REEs. The NRC report emphasizes the essential use and supply restrictions of critical minerals. The House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources held a hearing on rare earth elements and critical materials legislation (H.R. 761 and H.R. 1063) on March 21, 2013, to address potential supply risks associated with REEs and other critical materials. The witness testimony covered the impacts of supply disruption, the need for a more efficient regulatory framework, and the role of the U.S. government. On September 18, 2013, the House passed H.R. 761 by a vote of 246-178. The House passed H.R. 761 on September 18, 2013, focusing on permitting timelines for domestic mineral development and meeting critical mineral needs. The FY2014 Budget Request included funding for R&D on rare earth and critical materials, with the DOE proposing funding for a \"Critical Materials Hub\" for R&D on various challenges, including recycling for supply chain disruptions. Past funding supported Materials Science and Engineering Program at Ames National Laboratory and Energy Innovation Hub Program for critical materials R&D. The Department of Energy has various programs focused on critical materials research and development, including an Applied Magnet Research Program at Ames Laboratory and an Alternative Motor Design Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) is conducting research on Batteries for Electric Energy Storage and Substitutes for Rare Earth Magnets. Reports have been issued on critical materials strategy and demand forecasts for rare earths and other elements needed for energy and electronic applications. The USGS provides annual summaries of rare earth activity and mineral resource assessments. The Office of Industrial Policy is reviewing the rare earth mineral supply chain, and the Department of Defense has reviewed its National Defense Stockpile. Congress required the DOD to prepare an assessment and plan for critical rare earth materials. The Department of Defense (DOD) was required by Congress to prepare an \"Assessment and Plan for Critical Rare Earth Materials in Defense Applications\" by July 6, 2011. In August 2011, members of the House Armed Services Committee requested an interim report from DOD. In March 2012, DOD released a report stating that seven rare earth elements met the criteria. The forecast for a domestic supply of key rare earths indicated that by 2012, U.S. production could meet defense procurement needs, except for yttrium. In April 2012, DOD confirmed monitoring rare earth materials market for shortages. Brett Lambert suggested seeking congressional approval to stockpile materials if shortages were projected. Other agencies involved include Department of Commerce and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) has formed an Interagency Working Group on Critical and Strategic Minerals Supply Chains, involving various government departments like Department of Energy, Department of Defense, Department of the Interior, Department of Commerce, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of State, Department of Justice, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Their focus is on establishing critical mineral prioritization, early warning mechanisms for shortages, federal R&D priorities, and reviewing policies related to critical and strategic minerals. H.R. 761, the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013, aims to streamline the federal permitting process for domestic mineral exploration and development. It defines critical and strategic minerals and sets clear mine permitting goals to minimize delays. The review process is limited to 30 months, prioritizing the development of mineral resources while mitigating environmental impacts. S. 1600, Critical Minerals Policy Act of 2013, introduced by Senator Lisa Murkowski, aims to define critical minerals and establish a methodology for identifying them. The bill requires the Secretary of the Interior to maintain a list of up to 20 critical minerals and conduct a resource assessment on federal lands. It also mandates the National Academy of Sciences to update its report on Hardrock Mining on Federal Lands. The Critical Minerals Policy Act of 2013 aims to define critical minerals, establish a methodology for identifying them, and require the National Academy of Sciences to update its report on Hardrock Mining on Federal Lands. The proposed legislation includes measures to facilitate efficient mineral development on federal lands, establish an R&D program for alternatives to critical minerals, and produce an Annual Critical Minerals Outlook report by the Department of the Interior. Minerals Outlook will assess critical mineral requirements for national security, energy, and economic well-being, provide analyses of potential supply shortfalls, projections for recycling and market penetration of alternatives, and international trends. Section 110 proposes greater international cooperation on critical minerals and supply chain issues. If no viable production capacity in the US, activities may occur with allies, led by the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of Labor would lead research on critical minerals and workforce development. Title II recommends mineral-specific action for cobalt, lead, lithium, thorium, and rare earth elements from non-traditional sources. Title III of the bill proposes R&D for cobalt, grants for domestic lithium production, and a study on thorium nuclear fuel cycle. It would repeal previous mineral acts and authorize $60 million. H.R. 981, the RARE Act of 2013, directs the U.S. Geological Survey to assess the need for research on rare earth elements and other minerals. H.R. 1063, National Strategic and Critical Minerals Policy Act of 2013, aims to assess mineral availability on public lands and address import reliance. It authorizes $1 million for the Secretary of the Interior. The Securing Energy Critical Elements and American Jobs Act of 2013, introduced by Representative Eric Swalwell, aims to establish an R&D program within the Department of Energy focused on ensuring a stable supply of energy critical elements for national security and economic development. It also includes provisions for coordinating interagency actions, establishing early warning systems for supply disruptions, evaluating federal energy critical needs, and supporting the private sector in developing a stable supply chain. Additionally, the bill authorizes the Secretary of Energy to make loan guarantee commitments for specified commercial rare earth materials projects. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2014 (H.R. 1960) proposes legislation to give the President more authority to conserve strategic and critical materials, direct the Secretary of Defense to assess supply chain diversification for rare earth substitutes, and grant the Defense Logistics Agency more proactive market engagement. This includes modifying the President's authority to maintain a national defense stockpile and acquiring certain strategic and critical materials. Section 1412 of H.R. 1960 authorizes the acquisition of strategic and critical materials for the National Defense Stockpile, including ferroniobium, dysprosium metal, and yttrium oxide. The House Armed Services Committee requires reports on maintaining secure access to rare earth elements for national security purposes. The DOD is directed to outline a risk mitigation strategy for securing rare earth elements and assess the potential for using non-rare earth materials in components of the Joint Strike Fighter due to supply chain challenges."
