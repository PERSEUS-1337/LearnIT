    "content": "The Act titled \"Backcountry Landing Strip Access Act\" aims to establish a nationwide policy for managing backcountry aviation issues on Federal lands. It highlights the importance of aircraft landing strips for safety, access to remote areas, and various essential purposes like search and rescue operations. SEC. 3. PROCEDURE FOR CONSIDERATION OF ACTIONS AFFECTING AIRCRAFT LANDING STRIPS. The Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture cannot permanently close or render aircraft landing strips unserviceable on Federal land without approval from State aviation departments, publishing notice in the Federal Register, providing a 90-day public comment period, and considering any received comments. The Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture must consider input from State aviation departments and adopt a nationwide policy for managing backcountry aviation issues on Federal land within two years of this Act's enactment. This policy will affect air access to aircraft landing strips on Federal land under their jurisdiction. The policy required by the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture must state that the Federal Aviation Administration has sole authority over aviation and airspace in the United States. They must also seek input from State governments and the public. Additionally, they must consult with State aviation departments and interested parties to ensure that aircraft landing strips on Federal land are maintained in a way that aligns with resource values. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture may enter cooperative agreements for maintaining aircraft landing strips on Federal land. Closure or neglect of landing strips cannot be a condition for Federal property acquisitions. The Act does not authorize new landing strips and defines \"permanently close\" as a lasting closure. The Act applies to established aircraft landing strips on Federal lands and actions that are not final at the enactment date. It does not affect the FAA's authority over aviation or airspace."
