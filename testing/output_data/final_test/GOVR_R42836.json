    "content": "Various water supply shortages and increased demand for water supply due to energy development projects have led to disputes over water resource control in the United States. Hydraulic fracturing, a method used in oil and gas production from shale formations, requires a significant amount of freshwater. The controversy over water use in the Missouri River basin, particularly in the northern plains states, has highlighted tensions between federal and state interests in accessing water for energy development. Lake Sakakawea, a reservoir created by the federal Garrison Dam, has been a focal point in this issue. Lake Sakakawea, a reservoir created by the federal Garrison Dam along the Missouri River in North Dakota, has surplus water that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is considering contracting to industrial and municipal users. State interests oppose the Corps' plan to charge for access to this water, arguing it infringes on state authority over water rights. The Corps' plan to charge for stored surplus water at Missouri River reservoirs raises concerns about infringing on state authority over water rights. This report analyzes the legal authority of the Corps, including relevant constitutional and statutory laws like the Water Supply Act of 1958 and the Flood Control Act of 1944. It also discusses the relationship between federal and state authority in water resource management. The federal government has authorized the Corps to operate federal water projects for various purposes, such as navigation, flood control, hydropower, and irrigation. One example is the Garrison Dam/Lake Sakakawea Project along the Missouri River. The Corps operates Lake Sakakawea for multiple purposes including flood control, navigation, irrigation, hydropower, and recreation. The federal government authorized the Garrison Diversion Unit to compensate North Dakota for land submerged by Lake Sakakawea. In 1986, Congress approved recommendations to scale back irrigation development and improve water availability for municipal, industrial, and rural supplies from the Missouri River. Controversies surrounding water diversion and distribution facilities were resolved in 2000 when Congress approved the changes. In 2000, Congress approved legislation providing additional funding for various M&I water projects, addressing controversies surrounding water diversion and distribution facilities. The Corps has issued reports for mainstem reservoirs on the Missouri River to determine surplus water availability for M&I needs. The Corps has identified 100,000 acre-feet of temporary surplus water in Lake Sakakawea, which can be used over the next 10 years without significantly affecting project purposes. The Corps has surplus water agreements allowing use for M&I purposes but not crop irrigation. Interested parties can contract with the Corps for surplus water stored in Lake Sakakawea for a term of five years, renewable for another five years. Acquisition of legal water rights is required, ensuring no impact on existing water uses. The Corps provides access to project storage, but does not have authority to allocate water to users. Entities must secure water rights from the state to use stored water. Pricing policy for storage agreements will be developed through a rulemaking process with public comment. The Corps' authority for water projects is derived from the Commerce Clause and promoting navigation. The Corps' authority for water projects is derived from the Commerce Clause and promoting navigation throughout the nation's waterways. The Court has recognized the broad authority of the Corps in ensuring the navigability of all navigable streams within the United States, even if it may conflict with a state's water development and conservation program. The constitutional authority of the Corps is as broad as the needs of commerce. The Court has stated that the government's authority over water is broad and includes purposes such as navigation, flood control, watershed development, and cost recovery through power utilization. Congress can control water for commerce purposes, superseding state authority if necessary. Congress has historically deferred to states' authority regarding water allocation. The Corps has statutory authority for specific actions related to M&I water supply at its projects, including permanent storage space and contracting for surplus water use. Congress recognized state primacy in developing M&I supplies in 1958. The Water Supply Act authorizes the Corps of Engineers to include water storage for municipal and industrial use in federal projects, with costs shared by state and local interests. The Water Supply Act allows the Corps of Engineers to share costs with state and local interests for water storage in federal projects. The Act does not override state water rights and authorizes the Corps to enter contracts for surplus water. The Water Supply Act allows the Corps of Engineers to enter contracts for surplus water for domestic and industrial uses from reservoirs under its control. The Corps' authority under Section 6 has been recognized in court challenges, but potential interference with state water rights has not been litigated. States in the Missouri River basin have objected to the Corps' plan to charge a fee for surplus water stored at its reservoirs. States in the Missouri River basin have challenged the Corps' plan to charge for surplus water stored in federal reservoirs, arguing that it violates their legal right to state waters. North Dakota asserts ownership of waters within its boundaries, claiming that charging for access to stored water infringes on their rights. The U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed that states own navigable waters within their borders, subject only to constitutional provisions. The Missouri River basin states may claim ownership of waters within their state boundaries upon achieving statehood, under the equal footing doctrine. However, the federal government's constitutional authority can limit the state's ownership rights. The federal government historically defers to states regarding water allocation, despite its broad regulatory authority. Congress has historically deferred to states' authority on water allocation, recognizing state power to assign water rights. It has acknowledged the competing roles of federal and state governments in water management and required federal compliance with state water laws. For example, the Reclamation Act of 1902 mandates Bureau of Reclamation to conform with state water laws. Section 8 of the Reclamation Act requires compliance with state water laws for water control and distribution by federal projects. Reclamation acquires water rights and contracts with users, while the Corps may not have a similar requirement due to the nature of their projects. Corps projects operate for nonconsumptive uses, replenishing water locally. Reclamation projects are single-purpose in western states, while Corps projects are multi-purpose. Congress may consider requiring the Corps to comply with state water laws to avoid controversial claims. Congress has recognized the states' interests and rights in water utilization and control, particularly in western states, through the 1944 FCA. This includes specific protection for waters in states west of the ninety-eighth meridian, ensuring that the Corps' use of water for navigation does not conflict with beneficial consumptive uses in those states. The 1944 FCA protects water rights in western states to ensure that the Corps' use of water for navigation does not interfere with other beneficial uses, as stated in the WSA. The WSA emphasizes that Congress did not authorize interference with certain water uses at federal projects, highlighting the importance of state water rights administration. The final legislation did not explicitly require the Corps to obtain state water rights for its projects, but the language was amended to clarify that the authority provided under the WSA should not modify existing water rights laws. It remains unclear what the Corps' obligations are regarding state water rights for surplus water at Lake Sakakawea. The Corps has authority from Congress to store water for M&I purposes and charge for surplus water. There is debate over the extent of the Corps' authority over surplus water and the degree of deference to state water uses, especially in western states like North Dakota."
