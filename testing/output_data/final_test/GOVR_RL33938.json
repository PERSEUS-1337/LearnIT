    "content": "Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are the most economically valuable pollinators of agricultural crops worldwide, contributing significantly to the production of high-value fruits, vegetables, nuts, and other specialty crops in the United States. The estimated annual value of honey bees as commercial pollinators in the U.S. ranges from $15 billion to $20 billion, accounting for about one-third of the U.S. diet. The indirect benefits of bee pollination are crucial for seed production in various crops. Honey bee pollination is essential for crops like alfalfa, apples, almonds, citrus, cotton, and soybeans, making up a significant portion of U.S. agricultural production. Certain crops, such as almonds, apples, blueberries, and cherries, are highly dependent (90%-100%) on honey bee pollination. Other specialty crops also rely on honey bee pollination to a lesser extent. In the United States, commercial migratory beekeepers provide pollination services for various crops like apricot, citrus, peaches, grapes, strawberries, and more. Data from the USDA shows that there are about 28,000 operations with 2.9 million bee colonies, with the majority belonging to commercial migratory beekeepers. In the United States, more than 2 million bee colonies are rented for crop pollination each year. The Dakotas, California, and Florida have the highest number of colonies, with Montana, Minnesota, Idaho, and Texas also contributing. Bee colonies are primarily rented for apple and almond production, as well as clover seed, cherries, and pears. These colonies play a crucial role in crop pollination, with commercial value in honey production as well. California's almond industry relies heavily on honey bee colonies for pollination, with an estimated 1.3 million colonies currently used. The demand for colonies is projected to increase to 1.5 million by 2010. Pollination fees have been on the rise, with almond producers paying around $75 per colony in 2005, and recent estimates reaching $150 or more per colony. The demand for honey bee colonies for pollinating almond trees is increasing, with fees reaching $150 per colony or more. Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) has caused unprecedented losses in bee colonies across 35 states, leading to a shortage of bees for pollination. Scientists are conducting research on CCD at various institutions. Researchers from various institutions, including Bee Alert Inc., Pennsylvania State University, and the USDA, are actively involved in studying Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) and honey bee colony losses. The National Research Council (NRC) has reported extensive literature on bee population declines due to pests, parasites, pathogens, and diseases like the vampire mite and tracheal mite. Information on bee health is regularly updated on the Mid-Atlantic Apiculture Research and Extension Consortium (MAAREC) website. The National Research Council (NRC) has reported bee colony declines due to pests, parasites, pathogens, and diseases like Varroa and tracheal mites, as well as the pathogen Paenibacillus larvae. Other factors include interspecific competition, habitat loss, invasive plant species, bee genetics, and pesticides. Varroa mites first appeared in the 1980s, causing large die-offs and eliminating feral bee colonies in the mid-1990s. Varroa parasitism affects worker bees, male larvae, and queen reproduction, leading to colony mortalities within six months to two years if untreated. The pathogen Paenibacillus larvae causes American foulbrood (AFB), a disease of larval honey bees, resulting in large colony losses in the past. Mite and pathogen infestations have increased beekeeper operating costs for treatment and colony replacement. Current colony losses are still unclear if caused by the same factors or new ones. The USDA reports that bee colony losses have averaged 17%-20% per year since the 1990s due to factors like mites, diseases, and management stress. Between 2006/2007 and 2007/2008, losses averaged over 30%, with the first report of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) in November 2006. Large commercial migratory beekeepers reported heavy losses associated with CCD, ranging from 30% to 90% of their colonies. In 2006-2007, beekeepers faced significant colony losses, with an average of 38% reported. This resulted in the potential loss of 651,000 to 875,000 colonies nationwide. The impact was felt in various regions, including California, Florida, Oklahoma, Texas, and internationally in Canada, Europe, South and Central America, and Asia. In 2006-2007, beekeepers faced significant colony losses, with an average of 38% reported, potentially resulting in the loss of 651,000 to 875,000 colonies nationwide. Approximately 25% of beekeepers are believed to have suffered from Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), with more than 50% reporting abnormally heavy losses. Leading causes of losses included pest diseases, with some operations experiencing CCD-like conditions reporting losses of 45% of their managed bee colonies. In 2006-2007, beekeepers faced significant colony losses, with an average of 38% reported. Smaller operations with less than 100 colonies suffered more severe losses. Colony losses were mainly due to disappearance (43%) and overwintering (37%), with mites and disease accounting for 15%. Pesticides were a minor factor, contributing to only 4% of surveyed colony failures. Comparatively, previous estimates showed overall winter losses of about 30% during 2000-2006, mostly due to Varroa mites. The USDA and AIA reported a significant decline in managed honey bee colonies in recent winters, with losses ranging from 28.6% to 35.8%. Colony losses varied widely by region, from 7% to 80%. The main cause of colony losses was bees failing to return to the hive, which is unusual behavior. Symptoms of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) were present in 15% of lost colonies in the 2008/2009 winter, compared to 60% in the previous winter. Despite a possible decrease in colony loss rates, USDA considers the current rate unsustainable. Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is causing rapid losses in bee colonies, with the reason still largely unknown. The condition is not seasonal and manifests throughout the year. CCD symptoms include sudden loss of adult worker bees, few dead bees in the hive, presence of immature bees, and a small cluster of bees with a live queen. The key symptoms of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) include sudden disappearance of adult bees without dead bees accumulating in the hive. The bees leave behind their brood, queen, and a small cluster of adults. The absence of a large number of dead bees makes it difficult to analyze the causes of CCD. In collapsing colonies, there are insufficient adult bees to care for the brood, with the remaining workforce mainly consisting of young adult bees. The queen is present and appears healthy. The remaining workforce in collapsing bee colonies is mainly young adult bees. The queen is healthy but the cluster is not consuming feed provided by beekeepers and foraging is reduced. Research on Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) has focused on pathogens, parasites, environmental stresses, and bee management practices. Some factors like feeding practices and chemicals have been ruled out, but scientists believe they could still contribute to CCD. Stressors like mites, disease, and poor nutrition may be a combination leading to CCD. Some speculate that a combination of stressors like mites, disease, and nutritional stress weakens bee colonies, leading to stress-related pathogens like fungi causing collapse. Miticide resistance and stress from commercial migratory operations may also play a role. Transportation can result in a 10% die-off, with losses of up to 30% possible. Research on Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) has identified various causes, with USDA and university researchers investigating further. Researchers have concluded that Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) may be caused by a combination of factors, including pesticides, new parasites or pathogens, and existing stresses like Varroa mites and poor nutrition. Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) potential causes include varroa mite, poor nutrition, exposure to contaminated water, migratory stress, parasites, mites, disease loads, new pathogens, fungal diseases, lack of genetic diversity, stress in adult bees, chemical residue, and pesticides. The potential causes of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) include exposure to chemicals used by beekeepers to control mites, Varroa mite infestation, new diseases like Nosema ceranae, pesticide exposure, and immune-suppressing stress on bees. Research identified the Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) as a marker of CCD, as it was found in affected bees but not in non-CCD colonies. Researchers have found high levels of bacteria, viruses, and fungi in the guts of dead bees affected by Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Some colonies have recovered after irradiation, indicating a possible pathogen presence. Nosema ceranae and other pathogens have been identified in affected hives, potentially compromising the bees' immune systems and leading to mortalities. Studies suggest that Nosema ceranae infection may be a primary cause of CCD. Scientists are debating whether certain chemicals, like neonicotinoids, could be contributing to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) in bees. These chemicals, found in pesticides, may have sub-lethal effects on bees by impairing their development and behavior. Residues of these chemicals are known to be present in nectar and pollen, which are essential food sources for young bees. Scientists studying CCD have found a broad range of substances in pollen samples, including insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. While these doses are not lethal to bees, there are concerns about potential chronic problems from long-term exposure. Some studies suggest sublethal effects of pesticides on bee behavior, such as impaired foraging abilities. Imidacloprid is a particular focus of concern for its potential impact on complex insect behaviors like flight, navigation, and foraging. However, there is conflicting information about the effects of these pesticides on honey bees. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified certain pesticides as highly toxic to honey bees, leading to colony losses. Some pesticides have been discontinued in Europe due to their effects on pollinators, but colony declines are still observed. Organic beekeeping operations in the U.S. do not experience colony losses, while environmental groups are concerned about the role of pesticides in bee declines. Legal action has been taken to reevaluate the approval of certain pesticides, such as spirotetramat, due to their potential harm to bees. The NRDC and Xerces Society filed a lawsuit against Bayer CropScience for potentially harmful pesticides Movento and Ultor. Legal actions were taken in the U.S. and Germany regarding the connection between pesticides and bee colony declines. Some countries are considering bans on neonicotinoid-based pesticides. Some countries are considering bans on neonicotinoid-based pesticides due to their potential impact on honey bee populations. Other theories include climate changes affecting spring blooms, feed supplements from genetically modified crops, and interference from cell phone transmissions and power lines on bee navigation. Concerns were raised about live bee imports from Australia in late 2008. In late 2008, concerns were raised about the introduction of Asian honey bees carrying mites to the Western Hemisphere. Australia notified APHIS of an incursion of Asian honey bees in Queensland, leading to a temporary halt in honey bee exports to the United States. APHIS then implemented measures requiring honeybee exports to come from colonies at least 100 miles away from any known Asian honey bee finds. Australian shipments of honey bees to the United States have since resumed. Australian shipments of honey bees to the United States have resumed as of late December. Live bees (queens with attendants and package bees) can be imported from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Restrictions apply to the transit of live honey bees, bee byproducts, and bee equipment. Certain items like whole colonies in hives, used beekeeping equipment, and pollen are not allowed for transit. Special treatment is required for beeswax and honey for bee feed. During the 110th Congress, there were three House subcommittee hearings on honey bee colony declines and concerns about CCD. During the 110th Congress, multiple congressional hearings and briefings addressed honey bee colony declines and concerns about CCD. Policy options discussed included increased federal funding for research, monitoring of pollination reserves, and technical support for beekeepers. The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) provided additional funding for research and conservation programs addressing honey bees and pollinators, including options such as expanding crop insurance for beekeepers, improving conservation programs, emphasizing pollinator diversity, and enhancing regulatory enforcement. The 2008 farm bill included provisions for conservation programs focusing on honey bees and pollinators, encouraging habitat development and protection. It broadened USDA's farm conservation programs to include pollinator habitats and required a review of conservation practice standards for managed and native pollinators. The 2008 farm bill prioritized pollinator protection by providing research grants to study bee colony health, investigate pollinator biology, and develop measures to improve pollinator health. It also focused on factors contributing to colony collapse disorder and promoted habitat conservation for honey bees and native pollinators. The 2008 farm bill authorized appropriations for grants to promote honey bee and pollinator health, including addressing colony collapse disorder. Annual appropriations were set at $7.25 million for research on pollinator issues and $2.75 million for honey bee pest surveillance. USDA was directed to increase capacity, infrastructure, and personnel to tackle long-term threats to pollinator health. The 2008 farm bill supported pollinators by providing disaster assistance for honey bee producers through the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA). This program offers relief for losses due to disease, adverse weather, and other conditions. Additionally, provisions in the bill offer contracts for research on insurance policies covering bee loss. The 2008 farm bill provides disaster assistance for honey bee producers through the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) to reduce losses from disease, adverse weather, and other conditions like blizzards and wildfires. Eligible producers must provide documentation of losses due to colony collapse disorder (CCD) from certified experts. Provisions in the bill also support honey production through the National Honey Board and marketing assistance loans for commodities like honey. Additional information is available on USDA's website and at state county FSA offices. USDA's action plan, released in July 2007, focuses on improving coordination and redirecting resources for addressing Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). The plan includes expanding research and diagnostic resources, conducting surveys on bee health, and analyzing bee samples for pests and pathogens. Coordination involves three USDA agencies: Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). This approach aligns with congressional bills and recommendations from industry associations. The USDA's action plan, released in July 2007, focuses on improving coordination and redirecting resources for addressing Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). The plan includes expanding research and diagnostic resources, conducting surveys on bee health, analyzing bee samples for pests and pathogens, conducting controlled experiments to identify factors affecting bee health, and developing best management practices to improve general bee health. Aspects of the plan were presented at a hearing before the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Oceans of the House Committee on Natural Resources in June 2007. In June 2009, USDA published its progress report on ongoing and intended future research efforts related to honeybees and CCD. The progress report on Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) research focuses on examining the hypothesis that CCD may be caused by various factors working together. Future studies will emphasize the combined effects of factors in causing CCD. Funding for honey bee and CCD research at USDA's ARS has increased due to the 2008 farm bill and FY2009 and FY2010 appropriations. More information is available on USDA's CCD website. Total ARS funding for honey bee and CCD research has increased over the years, with additional funding provided by the 2008 farm bill and subsequent appropriations. Funding amounts were $7,675,000 in FY2007, $7,798,000 in FY2008, $8,290,000 in FY2009, and $9,790,000 in FY2010, including a $1.5 million increase for CCD research. USDA's NIFA also received additional funding for research on honey bees, CCD, and bee health, with grants awarded to study the effects of pesticides, pathogens, and miticides on pollinator populations."
