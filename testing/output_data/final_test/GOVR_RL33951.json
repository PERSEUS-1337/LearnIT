    "content": "The United States has a history of using trade incentives to promote specific trade activities, including unilateral trade preference programs. These programs aim to boost developing-country exports while minimizing negative impacts on U.S. producers and workers. Bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements have become more important than preference arrangements, especially in the Caribbean Basin. In 1964, the U.S. government started a preferential tariff program based on production sharing, a cost-reducing strategy that involves manufacturing processes in multiple countries. U.S. firms engage in production sharing by specializing in capital-intensive stages of production and outsourcing lower-skill processing to lower-wage countries. Foreign firms can import U.S. component parts, assemble them into finished products, and re-export them to the U.S. with duties only on the value added abroad. This benefits U.S. firms by requiring the use of their inputs and retaining a portion of the global market, while foreign firms benefit from tariff exemptions, making their products more competitive in the U.S. market. The production sharing program allows U.S. firms to specialize in capital-intensive stages of production and outsource lower-skill processing to lower-wage countries. This benefits both U.S. and foreign firms by reducing duties on value added abroad and making products more competitive in the market. Caribbean Basin, Mexico, and Central America have benefited from lower transportation costs and quicker turnaround times, giving them a competitive edge over Asian competitors in certain niche markets. Many Caribbean countries have developed export processing zones around this program. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) was created under GATT to provide unilateral tariff preferences for selected imports from developing countries. The U.S. GSP program, last reauthorized in 2010, offers limited tariff incentives for certain products. The Caribbean region has utilized both the GSP and production sharing incentives. The tariff preference model evolved in the 1980s to target specific regions for deeper preferences. The Caribbean trade preference program was established in 1983 as a response to the region's economic and political challenges. The Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) was introduced by President Reagan to address these issues and strengthen economic ties with the United States. President Reagan introduced the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) in 1982 to promote economic and political stability in the Caribbean region. Despite facing opposition, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) was passed in 1983, providing modest duty-free treatment for 10% of Caribbean exports. The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) was signed into law by Reagan on August 5, 1983, allowing 27 countries to receive duty-free or reduced-duty access for exports if they meet specific conditions. Designation can be denied if the country fails to meet U.S.-defined eligibility criteria. The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) allows countries to receive duty-free or reduced-duty access for exports if they meet U.S.-defined eligibility criteria. No negotiation is involved, and goods must be wholly from a beneficiary country to enter the U.S. duty-free or at a reduced rate. Exceptions include textile and apparel articles, petroleum products, footwear, handbags, luggage, and more. The rules of origin require 35% of the article's value to originate in a beneficiary country, with some allowance for U.S. origin. The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) allows duty-free or reduced-duty access for exports from beneficiary countries. Special provisions include safeguard measures for Caribbean imports, special treatment for import-sensitive goods like ethanol and sugar, and biennial reports by the USITC on the program's effects. CBERA eligible products grew from 6.7% to 7.4% of total U.S. imports from beneficiary countries in 1984-1985. Under CBERA, textile and apparel products were excluded from tariff reductions despite being a major manufacturing export sector for the region. Textile trade was controlled by quotas under bilateral agreements permitted by the MFA. In 1986, President Reagan established a Special Access Program for apparel from eligible CBERA countries. Under CBERA, textile and apparel products were excluded from tariff reductions despite being a major manufacturing export sector for the region. In 1986, a Special Access Program (SAP) was established for apparel from eligible CBERA countries, allowing duty-free entry for apparel assembled from US fabric. This led to a significant increase in apparel imports from CBI countries due to changes in US textile policy. The demand for Caribbean apparel articles rose due to their low cost, production proximity, and higher quota restrictions on Asian producers. Tariffs on textile and apparel goods from CBI countries remained a barrier until 2000. The SAP ceased after the elimination of world textile quotas in 2005, raising concerns over the effectiveness of CBERA trade preferences. The Caribbean Basin Economic Expansion Act of 1990 (CBI II) aimed to expand trade preferences for Caribbean goods and make them permanent. However, key economic provisions like textiles and apparel were removed from the bill during the legislative process. Despite this, the existing CBI preferences for beneficiary countries were made permanent under Title II of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990. The CBI II made existing preferences permanent for beneficiary countries, with limited tariff reductions for certain products and duty-free treatment for non-textile items assembled from U.S. components. It also provided benefits for ethanol imports and exemptions from AD and CVD cumulation rules. NAFTA's implementation in 1994 sparked a debate on parity issues for U.S. imports under different trade agreements. NAFTA's implementation in 1994 significantly benefited Mexico by reducing tariffs and providing duty-free treatment for imports, particularly in the textile and apparel industry. This led to a 218% increase in trade between the United States and Mexico from 1993 to 2002, potentially impacting apparel production in the Caribbean. The detailed rules of origin under NAFTA limited content to materials made in NAFTA countries, excluding CBI countries and giving Mexico a distinct advantage in apparel production. Mexico's advantage in apparel production due to NAFTA implementation in 1994 posed a threat to Caribbean countries' export sector. The CBI countries lobbied for trade preferences equal to Mexico's, known as the CBI/NAFTA parity issue. Legislation was eventually passed to provide CBI countries with NAFTA-equivalent preferences until they could accede to NAFTA or enter into a similar FTA with the US, accommodating concerns of US manufacturers. The Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) was signed into law in 2000, extending benefits for eight years. Eligibility criteria include meeting trade obligations under the WTO and progressing towards an FTA with the US. The CBTPA provides duty-free and quota-free treatment for certain articles excluded from CBERA but meeting NAFTA rules of origin, including canned tuna, petroleum products, footwear, handbags, luggage, and apparel. Textile and apparel articles assembled in beneficiary countries from U.S. yarns are also eligible for duty-free treatment. Limited amounts of knit apparel using U.S. yarns, certain brassieres, handloomed, handmade, and folklore articles, textile luggage, and articles made from unavailable materials are also given duty-free treatment. The CBTPA provides duty-free treatment for certain articles excluded from CBERA, including apparel made from U.S. yarns. The Trade Act of 2002 modified apparel duty preferences, requiring U.S. fabric garments to be processed in the U.S. CAFTA-DR, implemented in 2006, shifted the trade preference landscape towards nearly full free trade with partner countries. The CAFTA-DR agreement enhances duty-free treatment for textile and apparel imports from the region, with more flexible rules of origin than previous agreements. This allows for duty-free access to the U.S. market if components are sourced from member countries. However, this creates parity issues for producers in the region who cannot meet these flexible rules. The CAFTA-DR agreement allows duty-free access to the U.S. market for textile and apparel imports with flexible rules of origin. Mexico and Central America harmonized rules, benefiting apparel production. Haiti was excluded, leading to separate legislation. CBI countries face disadvantages compared to NAFTA, CAFTA-DR, and Haiti in trade preferences, prompting the passage of HOPE I in response to Haiti's challenges. The Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006 (HOPE I) provided duty-free treatment for select apparel imports made in part from third country yarns and fabrics. The act was enhanced by the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008 (HOPE II), extending tariff preferences through September 30, 2018 and simplifying rules. The HOPE II Act extended tariff preferences through September 30, 2018, simplified rules, expanded duty-free treatment for U.S. apparel imports, allowed direct shipment from Haiti or the Dominican Republic to the U.S., and required Haiti to establish a labor monitoring program. After the 2010 earthquake, the HELP Act amended the HOPE Act to provide more flexible tariff preferences until September 30, 2020, enhancing exports to the U.S. Unlike other trade arrangements, these preferences operate differently. The HOPE Act allows duty-free treatment for apparel imports assembled in Haiti with inputs from third-party countries, encouraging investment in the apparel assembly business to boost output, exports, and employment. This advantage stems from using less expensive inputs from anywhere in the world while still receiving duty-free treatment. The duty preferences for Haitian apparel exports to the United States are crucial as they account for a significant portion of Haiti's foreign exchange earnings. The apparel sector, which makes up over 80% of Haiti's total exports and 94% of exports to the US, offers potential for employment growth. These preferences also benefit textile firms in the Dominican Republic through a co-production arrangement with Haiti. Despite concerns about production diversion, various trade preference programs and free trade agreements have been approved by the US Congress to promote diversified, export-led growth in CBI countries. The US Congress has approved various trade preference programs and free trade agreements to promote diversified, export-led growth in CBI countries. These include CBERA, CBI II, CBTPA, HOPE I, HOPE II, and HELP Act, as well as NAFTA and CAFTA-DR. The implementation of CAFTA-DR has had a significant impact on unilateral preferences like CBTPA, particularly for apparel goods from Central American countries and the Dominican Republic. The US Congress has approved trade preference programs and free trade agreements for CBI countries. The implementation of CAFTA-DR has impacted unilateral preferences like CBTPA, especially for apparel goods from Central American countries and the Dominican Republic. Import data shows a decline in imports under CBTPA, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between different trends in tariff preference programs. The USITC data includes imports from CAFTA-DR countries until the free trade agreement was implemented between 2006 and 2009. Total imports declined as CBI countries implemented CAFTA-DR and were dropped from CBERA or CBTPA programs. Imports are categorized as dutiable or duty-free under various preference programs, showing trends in apparel imports under CBTPA benefits from 2000 to 2006. The dutiable value, calculated duty, and average duty applied to aggregate CBI imports show a downward trend from 2000 to 2006 due to increased CBTPA benefits. The rise in dutiable value in 2004 and 2005 is linked to increased imports of petroleum products from non-beneficiary countries. Total imports' dutiable value has decreased from 35.2% in 2000 to 20.2% in 2006, attributed to the final implementation of WTO commitments shifting imports from CBERA to NTR. The implementation of CBTPA for textile and apparel articles led to a shift in imports from CBERA to NTR duty-free category. The CBTPA program significantly increased U.S. imports of CBI goods from 64.7% in 2000 to nearly 80% in 2006. There were only slight increases in duty-free goods entering under CBERA, GSP, or other duty-free categories, while articles entering under older production sharing rules have decreased. The implementation of CBTPA led to a shift in imports to NTR duty-free category, with a significant increase in U.S. imports of CBI goods. Total imports under CBERA and CBTPA provisions rose from 12.6% in 2000 to nearly 39% in 2006-2007. The trend suggests that the benefits of the program may have peaked. The implementation of CAFTA-DR in 2007 and 2008 led to a significant decline in U.S. imports from CBI countries, with apparel from CAFTA-DR producers no longer eligible for CBTPA preferences. CAFTA-DR countries accounted for 90% of total apparel imports that would have been part of CBI statistics. This trend is reflected in the absolute decline in U.S. imports from CBI countries and the decrease in CBTPA preferences, with a relative increase in the use of NTR. The data in Table 1 shows a noticeable increase in dutiable imports from CBI countries, reflecting a shift in textile and apparel imports from duty-free under CBTPA to now being imported under CAFTA-DR. This reflects amendments to trade preference laws and their effects on beneficiary countries. The data reveals the impact of trade preference laws on beneficiary countries, with the CBTPA being less effective until the implementation of the CBTPA trade. The NTR duty-free category saw an increase in trade from CBI countries not part of CAFTA-DR, raising questions about the effectiveness of preference programs for smaller island economies. Apparel and energy goods accounted for a significant portion of affected CBI exports. In 2000, apparel and energy goods made up 61% of U.S. imports from CBI countries, with knit apparel, woven apparel, and mineral fuels being the top products. By 2008, there was a shift in imports due to CAFTA-DR, with knit and woven apparel declining to 4% of total imports, while mineral fuels rose to 44.8% and inorganic chemicals to 11.2%. The shift in U.S. imports from CBI countries in 2008 saw a significant increase in mineral fuels to 44.8% and inorganic chemicals to 11.2%, reflecting changes in traded goods under CBTPA. Apparel industry trends are crucial as it is a key export industry targeted by CBTPA. The CBTPA targeted the apparel industry, leading to an increase in duty-free goods. However, U.S. imports from CBI countries declined significantly after CAFTA-DR took effect, superseding the benefits of CBERA and CBTPA. After CAFTA-DR was implemented, U.S. imports from CBI countries declined significantly. In 2005, 51% of U.S. imports originated from the top three CBI countries, with Trinidad and Tobago being the top exporter due to mineral fuels exports. By 2008, 81% of U.S. imports came from the top three CBI countries. The top three CBI countries accounted for 96% of total imports, excluding CAFTA-DR countries. Trinidad and Tobago was the top exporter by value due to mineral fuels exports. Haiti benefited from preferences for apparel under the CBTPA and HOPE Act. Imports from CAFTA-DR countries totaled $15.1 billion, representing 44.0% of total U.S. imports from CBI countries. Excluding CAFTA-DR and energy exporting countries, U.S. imports from other CBI beneficiary countries amounted to 7.5% of total imports. Since the implementation of CAFTA-DR, preferences have shifted towards energy-related exports, with Trinidad and Tobago being a key beneficiary. The use of CBERA/CBTPA preferences is declining due to the CAFTA-DR effect and lack of competitiveness in non-CAFTA-DR countries. As NTR duty-free rates decrease and other preference programs are introduced, the benefits from CBI preference programs are diminishing, impacting employment and development goals. Caribbean preference programs, implemented in 1984 to aid export-led development, may no longer meet employment and development goals due to competition from low-cost Asian producers and the US shifting towards reciprocal FTAs. Economists question the effectiveness of trade preferences. Many economists doubt the effectiveness of trade preferences as a development strategy due to design flaws and weak trade effects. Unilateral agreements can be limiting and paternalistic, hindering investors from fully committing to developing economies. Eligibility criteria are often based on foreign policy goals rather than enhancing trade performance. The CBI programs, including CBERA and CBI II, have faced criticisms for their structural limitations and lack of formal input from beneficiary countries in designing tariff preferences. Recipients must comply with various foreign policy and political requirements to maintain eligibility, and have been restricted from exporting key products under preference programs. Despite efforts to improve the programs, such as making CBI II permanent and adding new products under CBTPA, concerns remain about the effectiveness and impact of these trade preferences. Despite efforts to improve the CBI programs by making CBI II permanent and adding new products under CBTPA, critics argue that the trade preferences have not been overwhelmingly successful. Concerns include limited trade effects, the introduction of distortions into recipient countries' economies and the global trading system, and the replacement of tariffs with non-tariff barriers. The rules of origin are complex and costly to implement, requiring the use of higher-cost U.S. inputs, which offsets the benefits of tariff concessions. Additionally, the preferences can lead to trade diversion and bias in industries without a comparative advantage. The United States has provided trade preference programs to Caribbean Basin countries for over 40 years. However, concerns exist regarding the limited trade effects, distortions in economies, and the replacement of tariffs with non-tariff barriers. The preferences can also lead to bias in industries without a comparative advantage. With changing trade relations, evaluating these programs is necessary, especially for smaller and vulnerable Caribbean nations. Trade policy options for Caribbean nations include allowing trade preferences to expire, renewing them with more generous rules, or replacing them with an FTA. The CBTPA was renewed by Congress until 2020, while CBERA is permanent. Caribbean countries express a desire to retain preferences, but allowing them to expire could impact potential FTAs with the US. Another option is redefining the preferences. The trade preference programs for Caribbean nations have evolved over time but face challenges due to eroding preferences and limited export opportunities outside of energy and chemical sectors. Redefining the preferences to benefit CARICOM countries is being considered as an alternative option. The complexities of U.S. rules of origin and Caribbean supply constraints cast doubt on CARICOM countries' ability to significantly expand their exports to the United States. Without further relaxation of apparel rules of origin, Caribbean apparel exports may not be competitive with those from CAFTA-DR or low-cost Asian producers. One proposed solution is to allow 100% duty-free, quota-free treatment for all Caribbean exports, although this may face challenges as not all Eastern Caribbean countries qualify as least developed countries. Adjusting the CBI programs to target specific export sectors of CARICOM countries could be an option, but opportunities may be limited due to the predominantly service sector economies in the region. The CARICOM countries, with largely service sector economies, do not prioritize enhancing U.S. market access for goods like other Western Hemisphere countries. Trinidad and Tobago benefits most from CBTPA due to energy exports and may consider an FTA beneficial. There is interest in revising preference programs to include services exports or exploring a U.S. bilateral FTA with CARICOM, but differences in commitments could be a hindrance. FTAs differ from unilateral trade preferences as they involve mutual obligations and a resolution mechanism for disputes. Preferences are limited and time-bound, while FTAs are comprehensive and permanent. The US has pursued FTAs with countries in the region to promote hemispheric integration. The US has pursued FTAs with countries in the region to promote hemispheric integration, including Mexico, Canada, Central America, Chile, Peru, and potentially Panama and Colombia. However, there is doubt about congressional consensus on pursuing an FTA with CARICOM due to the diverse perspectives on trade policy among its member countries. The more developed economies in CARICOM are more open to an FTA with the US, while others are hesitant to begin negotiations. CARICOM countries have concerns about small economies undertaking FTA obligations without compensatory mechanisms. Major concerns include the need for special treatment, trade capacity building, trade adjustment assistance, high transition costs, regulatory harmonization, and supply-side constraints. The Caribbean countries face supply-side constraints and concerns over U.S. agricultural subsidies, limiting their ability to benefit from market access. Challenges for U.S. trade policy in the region include issues with the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act and reluctance to move towards an FTA without a development component. The Caribbean countries are cautious about entering into a new trade agreement with the United States, despite the potential benefits of market access and increased investment. U.S. trade policy faces challenges in expanding Hemispheric integration and may need to consider new solutions to support the development of small developing countries in the region. The Caribbean countries are hesitant to enter a new trade agreement with the United States. U.S. trade policy focuses on development, regional security, and trade liberalization. Congress is considering a review of existing preference programs like GSP, ATPA, and AGOA. Harmonizing these programs is challenging due to differences in economic features among countries. The differences in economic features among Caribbean countries pose a challenge in harmonizing trade preference programs like CBERA, CBTPA, and CARICOM countries."
