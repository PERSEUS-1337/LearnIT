The \"Electromagnetic Labeling Act of 1993\" mandates uniform labeling requirements for products emitting low-frequency electric and magnetic fields of a certain strength, as determined by the Secretary of Energy. The labeling must include information on the strength of the electromagnetic fields emitted. The \"Electromagnetic Labeling Act of 1993\" requires product labeling to include information on the frequency electromagnetic fields emitted, enable comparisons among products, and be simple and placed on the outside of the product. The Secretary of Energy must consult with relevant parties when establishing labeling requirements. The \"Electromagnetic Labeling Act of 1993\" mandates manufacturers to provide labeled products meeting specific requirements, maintain test data on emitted electromagnetic field strength, and annually submit this data to the Secretary of Energy. Civil penalties are outlined in the Act. The Secretary of Energy can impose civil penalties on manufacturers of products for violations such as failing to provide required labels or maintain necessary data. Penalties may not exceed $100 per violation or per day of violation occurrence. The Secretary of Energy can impose civil penalties on manufacturers for failing to make required submissions.
