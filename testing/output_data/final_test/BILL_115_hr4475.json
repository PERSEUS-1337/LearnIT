    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System Act.\" It defines terms like \"Secretary\" and \"System\" and establishes the National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System. The National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System, established by the Secretary within the United States Geological Survey, aims to monitor and protect citizens from volcanic activity by modernizing and standardizing volcano observatories in the US. The National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System, established by the Secretary within the United States Geological Survey, aims to monitor all volcanoes in the US by upgrading existing networks, installing new networks, and unifying monitoring systems into a single interoperable system. Components include a national volcano watch office operational 24/7 and a national volcano data center. The National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System, established by the Secretary within the United States Geological Survey, includes a national volcano watch office, a national volcano data center, and an external grants program to support research in volcano monitoring science and technology. Modernization activities involve the application of emerging technologies like digital broadband seismometers, real-time GPS receivers, radar interferometry, acoustic pressure sensors, and spectrometry to measure gas emissions. The Secretary is required to submit a 5-year management plan to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The management plan for the National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System includes annual cost estimates, milestones, standards, and recommendations for partnerships. An advisory committee will be established to assist in implementing the System, comprised of representatives from relevant agencies and the scientific community. The Secretary may appoint members of the scientific community and enter into cooperative agreements with institutions of higher education and State agencies for the volcano observatory partners. Coordination with relevant Federal agencies, including the Secretary of Transportation, the FAA Administrator, the NOAA Administrator, and the FEMA Director, is required under this Act. The Secretary will conduct a feasibility study to establish volcano observatories in Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa to monitor volcanic activity in the Pacific Ocean. Consultation with local entities will be done, and if feasible, cooperative agreements may be entered into. The Secretary may enter cooperative agreements with higher education institutions or territorial agencies to establish volcano observatories as part of the National Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System. An annual report describing activities under this Act must be submitted to Congress from 2018 to 2024. SEC. 4. FUNDING.\n\nAuthorization of Appropriations: $15,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2018 to 2024. Supplement, not supplant, other Federal funds for US Geological Survey hazards activities."
