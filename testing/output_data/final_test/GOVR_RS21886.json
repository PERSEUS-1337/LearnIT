    "content": "Airships and aerostats have been historically used for military surveillance and anti-submarine warfare. They are \"lighter-than-air (LTA)\" and typically use helium to stay aloft. There are over 100 commercially available airships and aerostats designed or manufactured by 32 companies in Europe, Asia, and North America. The military's use of LTA platforms has been limited since the disbandment of the Navy's airship unit in 1962, with the Air Force now custodians of a dozen aerostats. Recent developments have drawn increased attention to LTA platforms due to U.S. aerospace dominance in military conflicts and perceived low threats to LTA platforms. The military's demand for persistent surveillance is increasing, making aerostats well-suited for this function. DOD is exploring the use of airships for expeditionary operations and heavy lift vehicles. Budget pressures are driving the study of cost-effective solutions like LTA platforms. Advances in unmanned aerial vehicles suggest future airships may be remotely piloted or autonomous. The Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS) is the most established LTA platform in operation since 1980. The Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS) has been operating since 1980 for surveillance along the southern U.S. border and in the Caribbean, primarily for drug interdiction. It can lift 2,200 lbs of sensors to 12,000 feet, detect targets up to 230 miles away, and stay aloft for months. The Army has deployed smaller aerostats like the Rapidly Elevated Aerostat Platform (REAP) and Rapid Aerostat Initial Development (RAID) system to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kosovo for ground surveillance. The Marine Corps has begun training with RAID, a spinoff of the Army's JLENS program for cruise missile defense. JLENS includes tethered aerostats with radars for surveillance and tracking. Block 2 will have two untethered platforms, and Block 3 aims to combine both radars on a single platform. R&D funding for the program is approximately $432 million. The JLENS program, funded with $432 million in R&D funds, aims to combine both radars on a single platform for cruise missile defense. The program projects $1.8 billion in spending through FY2011 and is part of DOD's network-centric warfare approach. The Missile Defense Agency is also exploring the feasibility of a high altitude airship (HAA) for homeland defense, which would provide over-the-horizon surveillance at high altitudes. The High Altitude Airship (HAA) program aims to develop airships that can operate at high altitudes for extended periods, similar to low-flying satellites. The goal is to have a prototype by 2010 that can fly for 30 days, with future plans for $50 million airships capable of flying for a year. Funding for the HAA program has reached $150.8 million so far. Additionally, the Integrated Sensor Structure (ISIS) program by DARPA aims to develop a stratospheric airship-based sensor for long-term airborne surveillance of air and ground targets. The ISIS program aims to develop technologies for integrating large and lightweight radar antennas into an airship platform to detect air and ground targets at long range. The program faces challenges in developing ultra-lightweight antennas, antenna calibration technologies, power systems, and airships supporting large antennas. Despite being fully funded in FY2007, Senate appropriators recommended cancelling the program. The DARPA program was developing a hybrid airship capable of transporting up to 1,000 tons across international distances before being cancelled in FY2006. Advocates believe airships could carry Army brigades directly to combat zones, overcoming logistical challenges. Airships and hybrids may land on water, benefiting the Navy's sea basing concept. Independent hybrid airship programs exist, but their future is uncertain. The debate centers on whether the operational need for airships outweighs the costs. Lighter-than-air platforms are divided into aerostats, high-altitude airships, and heavy lift airships, with aerostats being the most mature in meeting operational needs. The most mature lighter-than-air platform for persistent surveillance is aerostats, known for low life cycle cost and long dwell time. Operational concerns include vulnerability to weather and enemy ground fire, although they tend not to fail in benign weather. Aircraft and UAVs face accidents due to human error and mechanical failure. The vulnerability of aerostats to enemy ground fire is debated. One potential non-traditional application of aerostats is replacing or augmenting Navy E-2C Hawkeye surveillance aircraft. This could improve surveillance by providing 24-hour coverage of the battle group and increase striking power by making room for more fighter aircraft on carriers. The potential operational uses of High Altitude Airships (HAAs) are not well understood compared to aerostats. Various agencies need time to study their capabilities for long-range surveillance, communication relay, internet services, laser weapon relay, and forest fire warning. HAAs face technological challenges due to the thin atmosphere at 70,000 feet, requiring a large volume of helium for even modest payloads. The High Altitude Airship (HAA) ACTD aims to carry a 500 lb payload, requiring an airship over 500 feet long and holding 5 million cubic feet of helium. This would be the largest airship attempted in 60 years, posing challenges for military applications. Large sensor arrays could be deployed for detecting small targets like cruise missiles, but the weight of radars is a concern. While producing 500-foot airships is feasible, their handling at high altitudes may be challenging. Operating these large airships for extended periods is also a consideration. The High Altitude Airship (HAA) project faces challenges in operating large airships for extended periods due to technological constraints, including power sources, weight, and reliability. The project's schedule has already been delayed, with doubts raised about the feasibility of achieving its goals by 2010. The Air Force Scientific Advisory Board has suggested that long-endurance fixed-wing UAVs may be more promising for surveillance at near-space altitudes. The Republic of Korea has a 10-year HAA program for surveillance from near-space altitudes. Questions arise about DOD's realistic timelines, budgets, and partnerships with researchers in Korea and Japan. Heavy lift airships aim to fill a void between sea lift ships and aircraft, but skeptics question their necessity. Heavy lift airships are seen as filling a gap between sealift ships and airlift aircraft, with advocates claiming they require less infrastructure. However, hybrid airships may still need long runways and loading facilities similar to conventional aircraft. Safety concerns arise regarding engine failures during takeoff for these large airships. The disabled 1,000 ton airship during takeoff could block the airstrip indefinitely, posing logistical challenges for the DOD. Large payloads take longer to consolidate, load, and unload, making delivery scheduling difficult. Airships are more vulnerable to weather conditions than conventional aircraft, raising concerns about their operational feasibility. The operational challenges of a 1,000 ton airship include managing its return to the United States after offloading cargo, vulnerability to attacks due to flying at low altitudes, and the need for protection with fighters, raising questions about costs and feasibility. The life cycle costs for many unmanned LTA concepts could be notably less than manned aircraft, satellites, and potentially UAVs. Budget constraints and competition from traditional aircraft pose challenges to implementing LTA programs."
