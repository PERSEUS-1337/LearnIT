    "content": "Section 7(a)(1) of the FLSA prohibits employers from having employees work more than forty hours a week without receiving compensation at one and a half times their regular rate. The term \"employ\" is defined as \"to suffer or permit to work\" by the FLSA, but the term \"work\" is not defined. In 1944, the Supreme Court clarified the meaning of \"work\" in Tennessee Coal, Iron & Railroad Co. v. Muscoda Local No. 123, a case involving miners commuting to underground iron ore mines. The Supreme Court in Tennessee Coal, Iron & Railroad Co. v. Muscoda Local No. 123 ruled that miners' travel time should be considered as work for the purpose of the FLSA, as it involved physical and mental exertion controlled by the employer. The journey to and from the working face for miners involved continuous physical and mental exertion, not for their convenience but for the benefit of the mining companies. In Armour v. Wantock, the Court clarified that actual physical or mental exertion was not necessary for an activity to constitute work under the FLSA. The Court found in Armour that fire guards entitled to overtime compensation for on-call time, even if provided with amenities by the employer. In Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery, the Court ruled that time spent walking to a work area on the employer's premises after punching a time clock was compensable. Time spent in readiness to serve may be considered a benefit to the employer, and whether it is for the employer's or employee's benefit depends on the circumstances of the case. The Court in Mt. Clemens Pottery ruled that time spent on the employer's premises, on duty, or at a prescribed workplace must be compensated. Activities like putting on aprons and preparing equipment were also compensable. However, a de minimis rule was established for activities involving only a few seconds or minutes beyond scheduled work hours. Congress later passed the Portal-to-Portal Act to address concerns about unexpected financial liabilities for employers. The Portal-to-Portal Act, passed by Congress, abolished claims for unpaid minimum wages and overtime compensation before May 14, 1947. It also exempted employers from liability for travel to and from work or preliminary/postliminary activities. The Act aimed to limit the broad definition of \"work\" established in Tennessee Coal. Despite this, the Court still found certain activities compensable under the FLSA. The Court found that certain activities, such as changing clothes and showering at the beginning and end of a shift, were compensable work time under the FLSA. Walking between changing areas and work areas was also considered compensable time. The question of whether non-exempt workers are entitled to overtime compensation for work activities using a PDA or smartphone beyond a 40-hour workweek will depend on the specific circumstances of each case. The Court's decision in Tennessee Coal provides factors for determining if PDA or smartphone use constitutes compensable work under the FLSA. Factors include physical or mental exertion, employer control, and benefit to the employer. Some PDA or smartphone use may be considered compensable work under the FLSA, even without the need for physical or mental exertion as reconsidered in Armour. The use of PDAs or smartphones by employees may require mental exertion, especially when responding to work emails or reviewing documents. Providing these devices to non-exempt employees without a clear policy on after-hours use may imply employer control. Employers could benefit from employees using these devices outside of regular work hours, suggesting that the use is primarily for the employer's benefit. The absence of significant case law involving the FLSA and PDA or smartphone use makes it difficult to predict how courts will evaluate claims for overtime compensation. Cases involving on-call time could provide insight, as seen in Skidmore v. Swift & Co., where the Court indicated that waiting time could also be considered working time. The availability of overtime pay depends on the agreement between parties, the nature of the service provided, and surrounding circumstances. In Skidmore v. Swift & Co., the Court explained that whether on-call time should be compensable under the FLSA depends on the employee's freedom to engage in personal activities during idle periods and the consecutive hours subject to call without active work. Other courts have found on-call time compensable, such as in Pabst v. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. where electronic technicians responding to alarms were entitled to compensation. The court focused on the burdens placed on technicians due to on-call duties, such as disrupted sleep habits and required response times. In Owens v. Local No. 169, the Ninth Circuit found that an employer's on-call policy was not burdensome enough to warrant overtime compensation for employees. Unlike in Pabst, where technicians were compensated for on-call time, mechanics in Owens were not required to respond to all calls. The courts' focus on an employee's ability to engage in personal activities in on-call cases may be relevant in determining if work-related PDA and smartphone use is compensable under the FLSA. While a court may consider such use as \"work,\" it may find it too minimal to be compensable, aligning with the de minimis rule. Evaluating all circumstances, including the increase in PDA and smartphone use by employees, will be crucial in determining compensability. The increasing use of PDAs and smartphones by employees may lead to more cases of overtime compensation disputes. One ongoing case involves AT&T Mobility employees seeking overtime pay for work done outside regular hours. The employees argue that the company required them to use company-owned smartphones and perform tasks off-duty. A federal court initially found the employees were not similarly situated for a collective action under the FLSA. The court found that the AT&T Mobility employees were not similarly situated for a collective action under the FLSA. However, some plaintiffs may be able to recover uncompensated overtime, leading to the rejection of the company's motion for summary judgment. This case is of interest to both employers and employees who use PDAs and smartphones for work."
