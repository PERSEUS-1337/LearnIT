SEC. 3. RURAL STATES PHYSICIAN RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. The Secretary will establish a Rural States Physician Recruitment and Retention Demonstration Program to address physician shortage in rural areas. The program will last for 10 years and involve consultation with various medical organizations and state authorities. The Secretary will conduct a 10-year demonstration program to address physician shortages in rural areas. The program will involve funding additional residency and fellowship positions, with a waiver of limitations and an increase of up to 15 percent in each medical residency training program in demonstration states. The Secretary will conduct a 10-year demonstration program to address physician shortages in rural areas by funding additional residency and fellowship positions under the Social Security Act. The Secretary will identify and negotiate the creation of these additional positions. The Secretary will negotiate with approved medical residency training programs in demonstration states to create positions supporting the program. Funding for each residency and fellowship position is contingent on the individual accepting the position signing a contract with specified provisions. Upon completion of a residency or fellowship, the individual must practice in the designated state for 1 year for each year of training. This practice period is in addition to any other requirements specified in the contract. The contract requires individuals to practice in a designated state for a specified period after completing residency or fellowship training. The Secretary may not fund positions for more than 5 years and cannot enter into new contracts after 5 years from the establishment of the program. The Secretary will establish a loan repayment and forgiveness program for eligible residency or fellowship graduates, assuming the obligation to repay a qualified loan amount for educational loans approved under specific conditions. The Secretary will repay up to $25,000 per graduate per year on outstanding loans for eligible residency or fellowship graduates practicing in designated areas. The total repayment amount cannot exceed $125,000 per graduate, and the Secretary is limited to repaying or forgiving 30 loans per year in each demonstration State. Contracts with residents and fellows will be established for this purpose. Each eligible residency or fellowship graduate must sign a contract requiring them to practice in a demonstration State while their loan is repaid or forgiven under this section. The fellowship graduate must submit an application to the Secretary for loan repayment, with specific requirements. The program has a 5-year limit for accepting applications. No refunding of loan repayments is allowed. The Secretary can waive Medicare requirements for the demonstration program, including payment limitations. No borrower can receive benefits from both this program and other loan repayment programs. Additional funding is provided for residency and fellowship programs. Appropriations for additional residency and fellowship positions will be funded from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Sums will be appropriated as necessary for the loan repayment and forgiveness program. Establishment of the Health Professions Database. The Secretary will establish a State-specific health professions database to track health professionals in each demonstration State with respect to specialty certifications, practice characteristics, professional licensure, practice types, locations, education, and training. Data will be sourced from existing health workforce files. During the demonstration program, data from the Health Professions Database will be available to the Secretary, each demonstration State, and the public for tracking changes in the health professions workforce, graduate medical education payments, and loan forgiveness. Following the termination of the demonstration program, a demonstration State may choose to maintain the Health Professions Database at its own cost. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out this section. SEC. 5. EVALUATION AND REPORTS.

COGME will submit progress reports to the Secretary and Congress at 1, 5, and 10 years, while MedPAC will submit biennial reports. COGME and MedPAC will submit biennial reports on the progress of the demonstration program to the Secretary and Congress. A final report containing findings, conclusions, and recommendations will be submitted to the President, Congress, and the Secretary within 1 year after the program ends. Appropriations are authorized for COGME to carry out this section. The Secretary may procure temporary and intermittent services under section 3109(b) of title 5, United States Code for the Health Professions Database."
