    "content": "In this work, the authors propose a metric learner that learns a Bregman divergence for one-shot and few-shot learning problems. The learner finds good prototypes for each class that are generalizable to new data samples and classes. The proposed model shows promising results on standard benchmarks like Omniglot and Mini-ImageNet datasets. The model can also be applied to tasks involving metric learning or tasks requiring approximate convexity. Deep learning methods have shown high performance on tasks with large-scale data, but collecting such data is costly. Few-shot learning addresses adapting to new classes with limited examples, where traditional methods fail due to overfitting or inflexibility. Researchers are inspired by humans' ability to recognize new classes with few examples, leading to recent approaches to solve this problem. Recent approaches to few-shot learning involve meta learning to transfer knowledge between classes and tasks for better generalization and adaptivity. Information is stored in the weights initialization, recurrent memory unit, optimization strategy, or embedded space. This work focuses on prototype networks, which learn an embedding of input data and construct prototypes for classes using averages. In contrast to existing methods, this approach focuses on joint embedding and metric learning using Bregman divergences to construct prototypes for classes. The use of Bregman divergences allows for more flexibility compared to traditional methods like relation networks. Bregman divergences offer flexibility in few-shot learning by not requiring symmetry and the triangle inequality. This is demonstrated in a scenario where image similarities do not follow these constraints. The metric learning function of the deep learning model is designed with a convexity constraint. Our deep learning model incorporates a convexity constraint in the metric learning function to calculate the Bregman divergence. The model allows for flexibility in designing the convex function and includes a regularization term for improved generalizability. Empirical testing confirms the convexity of the model, showing promising initial results. Future directions include applying the convex framework to other problem sets and exploring different applications. Meta learning methods, such as MAML, aim to address few-shot learning challenges by learning an initialization over weights for adaptability to new tasks. However, the need for fine-tuning and multiple tasks limits their efficiency. Meta learning methods like MAML address few-shot learning challenges by learning an initialization for adaptability to new tasks. However, the efficiency of these methods is limited by the need for fine-tuning and handling multiple tasks. Different approaches include meta learning by a recurrent memory, optimizer, and embedding, each with their own challenges and benefits. Meta learning by embedding involves learning an embedded space to store relations between samples and classes. This method uses a classifier with a fixed metric, avoiding complexity issues. Examples include Siamese Networks, Matching Networks, Relation Nets, and Prototypical Nets. The approach jointly learns embedding and metric using Bregman divergences. Another few-shot learning approach involves leveraging additional data to prevent overfitting, such as applying learned transformations or generating new data. In meta learning, embedding is used to store relations between samples and classes. The problem setup involves N-way K-shot learning with a training set split into support and query sets. The model's embedding function is denoted as f and subsequent layers as \u03c6. The experiments consider cases where K is 1 or 5 and N is 5. The text discusses Bregman divergences derived from a convex function \u03c6, which are used in a model for representing classes as means in an embedded space. The distance chosen should have the mean as the minimizer within a class, following the Mean Minimization Property. The Mean Minimization Property states that the best representative of a set of points is the mean under any Bregman divergence, identified by a convex function \u03c6. The model consists of two learnable functions: the embedding function f and the metric learning function \u03c6. The embedding function f introduces non-linearity to the framework and is integrated with the metric learning function \u03c6. The metric learning function \u03c6 is a neural network trained with a convexity constraint to output a convex function with respect to the embedded features f(x_i). Convexity is imposed using midpoint convexity characterization with the continuity of f. The problem is expressed as finding the mean of each class in the embedded space induced by f, with x and y representing sample and target pairs. The curr_chunk discusses the integration of a convexity constraint into the framework, using a regularization term to control overfitting and convexity in hard tasks. The formulation includes a clamping function to enforce the convexity inequality, allowing flexibility in architectural design for the convex function. The goal is to achieve an approximately convex network by feeding a sufficient number of samples. The curr_chunk introduces a method to control overfitting and convexity in hard tasks by adjusting the Lipschitz constant of the convex function. It combines L p loss and L r loss with a weighting term and relaxes the constraint inequality. The model is trained using a joint training approach and applied to Omniglot and mini-Imagenet datasets. The Omniglot dataset consists of handwritten letters from 60 alphabets with 28x28 dimensions and 20 samples each. Rotations are applied to increase classes, and the data is divided into training, validation, and test sets. The Mini-Imagenet dataset contains 1000 classes with 600 images each, split into training, validation, and test sets. The model architecture includes 3 convnet blocks for the embedding function, with an embedding layer of 128 dimensions for Omniglot and 512 dimensions for Mini-Imagenet. The network also has 2 fully connected layers with sigmoid activations, followed by a linear layer for output. The Bregman divergence term is used for classification based on distance to class means. We test our model on 1-way 5-shot and 5-way 5-shot problems, comparing with existing algorithms. Using a metavalidation set, we determine the best model for testing. Despite being preliminary, our results are comparable with previous models. We measure convexity by sampling pairs and calculating deviation from the convexity constraint. Results for Omniglot dataset show training accuracy of 8.4x10^-8 \u00b1 2x10^-8 and testing accuracy of 6.7x10^-3 \u00b1 5x10^-1. More tests will be conducted for the convexity measure. In this paper, an alternative method for few-shot learning is proposed based on two learnable functions: a nonlinear embedding function and a metric learning function. The metric function learns a Bregman divergence to approximate a convex function, aiming to make the mean the most representative point for the relevant class. Preliminary results validate the potential of the method, with plans for further investigation and parameter optimization. Different constraints or optimization methods may be used to ensure convexity. The method proposed involves utilizing constraints or optimization methods to ensure convexity, along with alternating training between embedding and metric functions. This approach can be extended to other problems with convexity, such as semi-supervised learning and structured prediction."
