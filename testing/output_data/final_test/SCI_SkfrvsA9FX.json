    "content": "In this work, a novel multi-timescale approach called `Reward Constrained Policy Optimization' (RCPO) is presented for constrained policy optimization in Reinforcement Learning. The approach uses an alternative penalty signal to guide the policy towards satisfying constraints, with proven convergence and empirical evidence of effectiveness. The goal of maximizing accumulated reward in RL often leads to unwanted behavior due to loopholes in the reward signal, making constraints necessary but challenging to implement. In real applications, the reward signal defines the agent's behavior. In the Mujoco domain, tasks involve controlling robotic agents like walking and navigation. For example, in the Humanoid domain, the goal is for the agent to walk forward as far as possible within a set time, with rewards for forward velocity and penalties for energy usage and impact force. Each signal is weighted differently to guide the agent effectively. In constrained optimization, the coefficient for penalty control is crucial but varies across domains, leading to different optimal solutions. Constraints offer a consistent approach to ensure satisfactory behavior without the need for manual coefficient selection. In constrained optimization, the coefficient for penalty control is crucial but varies across domains. Constraints offer a consistent approach to ensure satisfactory behavior without manual coefficient selection. The 'Reward Constrained Policy Optimization' (RCPO) algorithm incorporates the constraint as a penalty signal into the reward function to guide the policy towards a satisfying solution. The RCPO algorithm converges almost surely to a constraint satisfying solution, demonstrating faster convergence and improved stability compared to standard constraint optimization methods. It can tackle general constraints in various domains such as electric grids, networking, robotics, and finance. The RCPO algorithm addresses general constraints, including discounted sum and mean value constraints, without relying on the Bellman equation. It is reward agnostic, does not need prior knowledge, and outperforms standard constraint optimization methods in convergence and stability. The RCPO algorithm addresses general constraints like discounted sum and mean value constraints, without using the Bellman equation. It is reward agnostic, does not require prior knowledge, and performs better than standard constraint optimization methods in terms of convergence and stability. The problem involves maximizing the expectation of the reward-to-go given the initial state distribution \u00b5 in a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) framework. This work focuses on parametrized policies, such as neural networks. In this work, parametrized policies like neural networks are considered, with parameters denoted by \u03b8 and policy as \u03c0 \u03b8. Assumptions are made to ensure convergence to a constraint satisfying policy, with stricter assumptions like convexity not holding in practice. Lagrange relaxation technique is used to solve Constrained MDP's by converting them into an equivalent unconstrained problem with a penalty term for infeasibility. The problem involves finding a saddle point of the Lagrangian with a penalty coefficient \u03bb. A feasible solution of the Constrained MDP satisfies a certain condition. The algorithm for constrained optimization involves projection operators and gradient calculations. Samples are obtained via simulation as access to the MDP is not available. The text discusses the convergence of iterates in Actor-Critic based approaches, such as A3C, TRPO, and PPO. The actor learns a policy while the critic learns the value using temporal-difference learning. The convergence to a fixed point is proven under certain assumptions. The text discusses training the actor and critic in Actor-Critic approaches using a discounted penalty to ensure constraint satisfaction. The discounted penalty is defined, and penalized reward functions are introduced to estimate the penalized value. This approach allows for training with a finite number of samples and convergence to a feasible solution. The text introduces the 'Reward Constrained Policy Optimization' (RCPO) algorithm, which utilizes a three-timescale process for updating the actor, critic, and Lagrange multipliers. The algorithm converges almost surely to a feasible solution. The 'Reward Constrained Policy Optimization' (RCPO) algorithm converges to a fixed point under specific correlation assumptions between the penalty signal and constraint. Testing in various domains shows benefits over standard approaches. The 'Reward Constrained Policy Optimization' (RCPO) algorithm is compared to standard approaches in different domains, showing benefits of an adaptive cost value approach. Discounted sum constraints can be easily incorporated, and comparisons with relevant baselines are made. Details are provided in Appendix B. The rover starts in a safe region and must reach the goal in a stochastic environment. The domain is inspired by the Mars Rover domain with a stochastic transition function. The rover moves with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4 in the selected direction. Rewards are given for reaching the goal state and negative rewards for crashing into rocks. The task is to find parameters that induce a path with a low probability of failure. The A2C algorithm is used due to the discrete action space. The A2C algorithm is used in a domain with a discrete action space. RCPO is compared with direct optimization using Lagrange dual form. Results show RCPO has faster convergence and lower variance. Tasks involve training agents in complex control problems like teaching a humanoid robot to stand up and walk. The robot has n joints with state S \u2208 R n\u00d75. The aim is to prolong the motor life of robots by constraining torque values using PPO BID29. RCPO is compared to reward shaping with varying \u03bb values. Learning curves in FIG3 and final values in TAB2 show the effectiveness of limiting torque levels. RCPO aims to find the best policy within torque constraints, showing superior performance compared to other reward shaping variants. Selecting the right \u03bb value for constraint satisfaction is crucial, with RCPO consistently achieving feasible solutions. The policy must satisfy constraints, which can vary across domains. Reward shaping with a fixed \u03bb value shows that in domains where the agent achieves high values, a larger penalty coefficient is needed for constraint satisfaction. However, in domains with lower values, the same penalty coefficients can lead to sub-optimal solutions. In RL, the value increases as training progresses, indicating that a non-adaptive approach may converge to sub-optimal solutions. Introducing a novel constrained actor-critic approach addresses these challenges. The novel constrained actor-critic approach, named 'Reward Constrained Policy Optimization' (RCPO), uses a multi-timescale approach to converge in a stable and sample efficient manner to a constraint satisfying policy. An exciting extension is combining RCPO with CPO BID0 to solve complex constraints while enjoying feasibility guarantees during training. The original Advantage Actor Critic algorithm is enhanced with penalty functions and learning rates for actor and critic initialization. The MDP is defined with a linearly decaying random restart to address exploration issues. The A2C architecture improves exploration by starting at a random state and gradually moving towards the top left corner. The network is fully-observable and uses ReLU non-linearity between layers. Performance is evaluated every 5120 episodes for 1024 episodes to reduce initial convergence time. The agent is evaluated every 5120 episodes for 1024 episodes, starting \u03bb at 0.6 and using a learning rate of 0.000025. A PyTorch implementation of PPO is used, with a network architecture that includes a DiagGaussian layer for sampling torque. Online performance is reported for 1M samples, starting \u03bb at 0 and using a learning rate of 5e-7 with decay to avoid oscillations. Generalized Advantage Estimation with a coefficient of 0.95 is used for simulations. The simulations utilized Generalized Advantage Estimation with a coefficient of 0.95 and discount factor of 0.99. A brief proof of convergence is provided, with reference to Chapter 6 of BID6 for a full proof. The convergence to a local saddle point of the Lagrangian involves steps for the convergence of \u03b8-recursion and \u03bb-recursion. The text discusses the convergence of \u03bb-recursion and the overall convergence of (\u03b8 k , \u03bb k ) to a local saddle point. Due to timescale separation, \u03bb is assumed constant, leading to an ODE governing the evolution of \u03b8. The process over \u03b8 is a discretization of the ODE. The \u03bb-recursion converges, leading to a local saddle point of L(\u03bb, \u03b8). The proof shows that the \u03bb-recursion converges to the internally chain transitive invariant sets of the ODE. The process converges to a fixed point (\u03b8*(\u03bb*), \u03bb*) for \u03bbmax = \u221e, which is a feasible solution. This three-timescale stochastic approximation scheme extends the previous two-timescale scheme. The proof demonstrates the convergence of the \u03bb-recursion to the invariant sets of the ODE. The process converges to a fixed point for \u03bbmax = \u221e, which is a feasible solution. This stochastic approximation scheme extends the previous two-timescale scheme by considering three timescales. The process converges to a feasible solution as \u03bb max approaches infinity. Gradient descent algorithms may not necessarily converge to feasible solutions. Using the gradient of the objective function may not guide the solution of the problem effectively. A Monte-Carlo approach can be used to approximate gradients, but it lacks the benefits of reduced variance and smaller sample sizes."
