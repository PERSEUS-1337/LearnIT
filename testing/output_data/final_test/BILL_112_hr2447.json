The first Black Marine recruits trained at Camp Montford Point in North Carolina, with Howard P. Perry being the first Black private to arrive. In April 1943, the first African-American Marine Drill Instructors took over as senior Drill Instructors for eight platoons. During World War II, Black Marines played significant roles in various operations, including landing on Iwo Jima and participating in the seizure of Okinawa. The first African-American Marine officer, Frederick C. Branch, was commissioned in 1945. A total of 19,168 Black Marines served in the Marine Corps during the war. In 1965, a reunion of the Men of Montford Point, including Master Sergeant Brooks E. Gray, was organized with around 400 participants. The Montford Point Marine Association Inc. was founded in 1965 by approximately 400 Montford Point Marines to preserve the legacy of the first Black Marines. Today, the association has 36 chapters across the United States. Sergeant Major Edgar R. Huff, one of the first recruits at Montford Point, was the first African-American Marine to retire with the rank of Sergeant Major. Sergeant Major Edgar R. Huff, the first African-American Marine to retire with 30 years of service, saw combat in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. During the Tet Offensive, he received the Bronze Star Medal for valor. Sergeant Major Louis Roundtree, another Montford Pointer, was awarded the Silver Star Medal, four Bronze Star Medals, and three Purple Hearts for his service in the Korean War and Vietnam War. Montford Point was renamed Camp Johnson in honor of Sergeant Major Gilbert \"Hashmark\" Johnson. The Montford Point Marine Association has memorials honoring the first African-American Marines, including scholarships, a museum, an academic facility, and a building named after Master Gunnery Sergeant Gray. In July 1997, Branch Hall at the Officers Candidate School in Quantico, Virginia was named after Captain Frederick Branch.
