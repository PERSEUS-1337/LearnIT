    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature intends for the state's processes for identifying and planning electrical transmission projects to consider the May 2016 Solar Convening Report and the principles of transmission corridor planning. A new section, 399.23, is added to the Public Utilities Code. The Independent System Operator and Energy Commission must consider the May 2016 Solar Convening Report and Garamendi Principles in transmission planning activities. This is part of the San Joaquin Valley Clean Energy and Jobs Act. The Legislature acknowledges the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The San Joaquin Valley faces challenges such as high unemployment, poverty, drought, and poor air quality. California's energy sector is evolving due to changing regulations, renewable energy goals, and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The San Joaquin Valley, despite its clean energy potential, has been left behind in the state's clean energy revolution. Policymakers should prioritize investing in the Valley's renewable energy resources to ensure equitable access to the benefits of a clean energy economy. The San Joaquin Valley needs timely investment and improved transmission access to develop clean energy opportunities, create jobs, and benefit disadvantaged communities. The Governor's office has identified high potential solar energy developments in the region, with a report from the University of California highlighting 470,000 acres of least-conflict land for solar PV development. The project team identified least-conflict lands by convening stakeholder groups including environmental conservation, agricultural farmland conservation, solar industry, and transmission groups. Later, an agricultural rangeland stakeholder group was added. The final result, the composite least-conflict area, was generated using information from the solar industry, environmental conservation, and agricultural farmland conservation stakeholder groups. Solar projects in the San Joaquin Valley can be developed near existing transmission corridors to minimize the need for new transmission. State officials must ensure clean energy investments benefit the environment, economy, and job creation in the region. A new section, 399.23, is added to the Public Utilities Code. The Public Utilities Code now includes section 399.23, which mandates the evaluation of renewable energy projects in the San Joaquin Valley. Priority is given to projects that benefit economically and environmentally by reusing drainage-impaired agricultural lands, retiring such lands, and redirecting surface water supply to productive agricultural land. The commission and the Energy Commission must recommend an amount of electricity from renewable energy resources in the San Joaquin Valley by January 31, 2017, considering specific lands and providing full capacity deliverability status. The commission and the Energy Commission must recommend network transmission upgrades by January 31, 2017, to minimize the need for new transmission and prioritize existing transmission corridors based on the Garamendi Principles of transmission corridor planning."
