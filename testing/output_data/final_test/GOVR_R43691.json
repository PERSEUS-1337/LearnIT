    "content": "Members of Congress have expanded their communication options with constituents, utilizing email, websites, social media, and other electronic platforms in addition to traditional methods. The adoption of new technology, such as Twitter, has increased significantly among Members, with 100% of Senators and 90% of Representatives using it by January 2013. Members of Congress have embraced new electronic communication platforms, with 100% of Senators and 90% of Representatives adopting Twitter by January 2013. Recently, Members have also started using video and picture sharing services like Vine. Vine, owned by Twitter, allows users to create six-second videos that can be shared with followers on Vine, Twitter, and Facebook. The rise of video sharing services like Vine has implications for social media usage. Vine, owned by Twitter, is a platform for sharing short, looping videos or picture compilations. It allows users to post up to 140 characters of text along with their Vines. In June 2014, the Congressional Research Service collected data on Members' adoption and use of Vine by searching for registered Representatives and Senators. This data was used to analyze how Members use Vine. The Congressional Research Service collected data on Members' use of Vine, analyzing 487 individual Vines with a comprehensive set of coding categories. The analysis treats all Member Vines as structurally identical, without distinguishing between those featuring Members or constituents/staff. The rapid changes in technology usage make it difficult to generalize conclusions from the data. The Congressional Research Service analyzed Members' use of Vine, finding that 26.1% of Congress had Vine accounts as of June 25, 2014. The adoption rate was higher among House Republicans, consistent with previous social media platform adoption trends. House Republicans had the highest adoption rate on Vine, with 69 Members on the platform. House Democrats, Senate Democrats, and Senate Republicans had lower adoption rates. Between February 6, 2013, and June 25, 2014, a total of 487 Vines were posted by Representatives and Senators, with an average of 29 Vines per month. House Republicans posted the majority of Vines (51%), followed by House Democrats (24%), Senate Democrats (18%), and Senate Republicans (8%). The proportion of Vines by chamber and party was analyzed, with six major message categories identified for classifying Members' Vines. These categories included position taking, homestyle, official action, personal/family, information, and other. Each Member Vine post was coded into one category based on the primary contents of the message, such as taking a position on a policy issue or highlighting the district in an official capacity. Overall, Vines posted by Representatives and Senators were categorized into six main categories: position-taking, information, homestyle, official action, personal/family, and other. Position-taking Vines were the most common at 33.5%, followed by information at 29.6% and homestyle at 16%. At the early stage of Vine adoption, Members primarily used the platform to provide information, similar to early use of Twitter. Senators Vined most often about information, while Representatives Vined most often about position taking. Members were visible in 53% of Vines overall, with 61% recorded in the District of Columbia. Vine provides an opportunity for Members to be seen directly by followers. Members are using Vine to take positions on specific policy issues, with the most common topics being the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, immigration, unemployment benefits, better wage or minimum wage, the 2013 government shutdown, and jobs. 38 issue areas were mentioned in 163 Vines, with some covering more than one issue. The use of Vine by Members of Congress is an evolving phenomenon, allowing direct communication with constituents and potential influence on issue prioritization, policy decisions, and voting behavior. Vine's emphasis on real-time information sharing through videos and pictures sets it apart from other social media platforms like Twitter. Vine's focus on visual communication sets it apart from text-centric platforms like Twitter. It allows Members of Congress to disseminate messages effectively through pictures or videos, potentially reaching a wider audience. Vine also helps distinguish between Member and staff postings, addressing the issue of authenticity in social media communication. Some offices have Members sign their tweets to show authenticity. Vine is not as popular as Twitter but allows for short video content sharing. Pew Internet Research Project found that 17% of online video consumers use apps like Vine for watching videos on smartphones. The use of video sharing applications like Vine is increasing in popularity, with 17% of online video consumers using these apps. Members of Congress are also utilizing these platforms to disseminate information. Some reports suggest that Members are allocating more staff to handle social media, which could impact other representational functions. Further research on adoption and use of social media by Members is needed. Further research on the adoption and use of social media platforms like Vine by Members of Congress could provide insight into changing approaches to representation, messaging, internal communications, and potential regulations. The impact of video sharing services like Vine compared to text-based services like Twitter is unknown, and potential challengers could use a Member's appearance in a Vine more directly in elections. Electronic communications have the potential to alter a Member's decision on the type of content included in future Vines. The report discusses concerns about adapting existing regulations to new electronic technologies, specifically regarding social media communications. Key differences between electronic communications and franked mail raise questions about the suitability of applying the franking model to social media. The report raises questions about applying the franking model to social media due to the rapidly changing nature of social media platforms. Policy makers may opt for general structures over specific ones to accommodate new technologies like Vine. Members of Congress may choose similar social media platforms to simplify messaging and save staff time."
