    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section title and findings. The Act is titled the \"Medically Underserved Access to Care Act of 2001\" and highlights findings regarding minority individuals in underserved areas facing lower quality healthcare from managed care organizations. Minority physicians are concerned about selective marketing practices and referral processes. Managed care organizations may exclude minority and community-based physicians who serve underserved areas, especially those who are not board certified. Requirement for service to areas with medically underserved populations. A managed care organization offering a managed care plan must establish adequate arrangements with a sufficient number of healthcare professionals and providers to ensure covered items and services are available and accessible to enrollees in various locations, with reasonable promptness and proximity to their residences and workplaces, taking into account diverse needs. The managed care organization must ensure continuity of care and meet the needs of enrollees by having arrangements with healthcare professionals in underserved areas. Enforcement of these requirements applies to group health plans under the Public Health Service Act. The requirements of subsection (a) are to be treated as included in specific parts of various acts such as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This also applies to individual health insurance coverage. The requirements of subsection (a) apply to individual health insurance coverage under title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act, as well as to contracts with Medicare+Choice organizations and Medicaid funding. The Social Security Act requires compliance with applicable requirements for medical assistance provided through payment to a Medicaid managed care organization. The Secretary will establish a grant program in the Office of Minority Health to award competitive grants to nongovernmental agencies for developing outreach programs in medically underserved areas. Grants will inform individuals on accessing managed care organizations and help healthcare professionals enroll as providers. Eligibility criteria and grant amounts will be determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will conduct a study on minority physician participation in managed care organizations, focusing on African-American and other minority physicians. The study aims to identify ways to increase their involvement. A report on the study's findings will be submitted to Congress within a year of the Act's enactment. The Act defines key terms related to managed care plans, including \"enrollee,\" \"health care professional,\" \"health plan,\" and \"managed care organization.\" These definitions clarify the roles and entities involved in the healthcare system. The Act defines a managed care plan as a health plan offered by an entity that provides health care items and services to enrollees through participating professionals and providers, or offers financial incentives to enrollees to use participating professionals. The Act defines terms such as \"medically underserved area,\" \"participating,\" and \"primary care provider\" in relation to health care professionals and providers in managed care plans. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and general definitions from the Public Health Service Act apply unless specified otherwise."
