Homeownership offers advantages like tax deductions and wealth accumulation through price appreciation. However, it also comes with expenses such as real estate agent commissions, home inspection costs, and state fees. Homeowners face the risk of decreasing house prices, making them less mobile than renters. Most homebuyers need to take out a mortgage due to insufficient financial resources. The government plays a significant role in the housing finance system, providing support and regulation. This includes explicit support through agencies like the FHA and implicit support through GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Government support aims to expand access to homeownership for qualified borrowers and promote wealth accumulation through homeownership. The government regulates the housing finance system to balance expanding access to homeownership for qualified borrowers and minimizing risk. Regulation is divided between federal and state levels, with a focus on the federal role in supporting housing finance. The system consists of a primary market where lenders make loans and a secondary market where loans are bought and sold. The primary market involves explaining what a mortgage is and how it is made, while the secondary market is described in the following section. In the primary market, lenders extend loans to borrowers to purchase homes using real estate as collateral, known as a mortgage. The lender evaluates the borrower based on credit history, income, debts, assets, and property value. The underwriting process involves gathering financial documents and can take several weeks. The mortgage application process involves upfront fees for items such as credit reports, appraisal, survey, title search, and lender fees. Borrowers also pay closing costs at the signing of mortgage documents. Lenders provide a standardized form at closing showing itemized closing costs. A mortgage includes the loan amount, term, repayment schedule, and interest rate. A mortgage involves upfront fees for credit reports, appraisal, and closing costs. It includes the loan amount, repayment schedule, and interest rate. Different types of mortgages vary in repayment methods and interest rates. The most common type in the US is the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. After 360 months of monthly payments of $1,264, the mortgage is paid off. Borrowers can pay off a mortgage early by making extra payments, refinancing, or selling the home. The house purchased is pledged as collateral, and the lender can seize it if the borrower fails to pay. When a borrower is unable to pay, the lender can seize the house and sell it to recover the outstanding mortgage amount. To ensure sufficient recovery, a down payment is required, serving as a buffer against falling house prices. A larger down payment results in a lower loan-to-value ratio, reducing the lender's risk. Borrowers can also use mortgage insurance if they cannot afford a 20% down payment. Mortgage insurance can be used instead of a 20% down payment to compensate the lender if the borrower defaults. Borrowers can purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI) or government insurance from agencies like the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which may have lower down payment requirements or no down payment at all. FHA provides mortgage insurance on loans that meet its criteria. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provides mortgage insurance on loans with specific requirements, including a minimum down payment and a maximum principal balance. Borrowers pay premiums to FHA, and if they default, FHA repays the lender the remaining principal amount. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers a guaranty on mortgages for veterans, repaying the lender a portion of the remaining principal if the borrower defaults. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers direct and guaranteed loan programs for low-income borrowers in rural areas. The USDA administers loan programs for low-income borrowers in rural areas, with a guarantee program in place. Borrowers are responsible for making payments, with a mortgage servicer acting as an intermediary between the lender and borrower. The servicer collects payments and forwards them to the lender, and if the borrower defaults, USDA repays a portion of the remaining principal amount owed. The mortgage servicer collects payments from the borrower and forwards them to the lender. If the borrower is delinquent, workout options like loan modifications or repayment plans may be offered. In case of default, the servicer may pursue mortgage liquidation options such as foreclosure or a short sale. The foreclosure process is governed by state law and varies by state. Different procedures are used for selling foreclosed homes, such as auctions or other bidding processes. FHA requires servicers to consider loss mitigation options before foreclosure. Any excess funds from a foreclosure should be returned to the borrower. In foreclosure, excess funds are returned to the borrower, but legal and maintenance costs often prevent this. Mortgages are categorized as government-insured or conventional, with government-insured mortgages having insurance from agencies like FHA. Borrowers are classified as prime or non-prime based on credit history, with prime borrowers receiving better terms. Non-prime borrowers are considered riskier due to credit problems or incomplete documentation. Conventional mortgages are divided into conforming and nonconforming loans, with conforming loans meeting credit thresholds and being eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Nonconforming loans can be categorized based on reasons for not meeting conforming standards, such as exceeding the loan limit. Jumbo loans fall under nonconforming loans above the conforming limit. Jumbo loans are nonconforming loans above the conforming limit. Alt-A loans are for near-prime borrowers with credit or documentation issues. Subprime loans are for the riskiest borrowers with low credit scores. Lenders face credit, prepayment, and funding risks when originating mortgages. Credit risk is the risk of non-repayment, prepayment risk is early pay-off, and funding risk is related to interest rate fluctuations. When interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to refinance their mortgages, leading to prepayment risk for lenders. However, rising interest rates pose funding risk for lenders who borrow short-term to fund long-term investments like 30-year mortgages. Short-term rates are lower than long-term rates, allowing lenders to profit from the spread between them. If interest rates rise, lenders face the risk of borrowing funds at a higher rate while earning the same on mortgages. Profits depend on short-term rates staying below long-term returns. Opportunity costs arise if money is tied up in lower-rate mortgages, missing out on higher returns. The lender can transfer risks to borrowers through adjustable-rate mortgages. Mortgages can be sold to investors in the secondary market. The servicer may change when a mortgage is sold, but the borrower continues making payments. The secondary market plays a crucial role in funding loans from the primary market by allowing lenders to sell mortgages to other entities. This transfer of mortgages helps lenders free up funds to issue new mortgages and transfer lending risks to the buyer. The new mortgage holder can choose to hold the mortgage as a whole loan in their portfolio or securitize it instead. Mortgage securitization involves pooling together multiple mortgages to create mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that are sold to investors. Investors receive payments from the mortgages through a servicer. MBS offers liquidity and the ability to quickly sell at the current price, making them more attractive than holding whole mortgages. Securitization of mortgages through MBS can attract more investors, leading to increased funding for lenders and potentially lower interest rates for borrowers. However, this process also introduces additional participants, increasing costs and potential conflicts of interest in the market. The securitization process can lead to conflicts of interest, such as the principal-agent problem, where participants may act in their own best interest rather than the principal's. Mortgage servicers, for example, may prioritize their own interests over investors when evaluating borrower options. The securitization process involves different categories like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, and private-label securitization. Investors in MBS take on risks like credit and prepayment risk, with exceptions where another entity guarantees the MBS. Investors in Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae MBS do not bear credit risk. During the Great Depression, Congress created Fannie Mae as a government agency to encourage mortgage lending. In 1968, Fannie Mae was divided into two parts: Ginnie Mae and a government-sponsored enterprise named Fannie Mae. Freddie Mac was established in 1970 as part of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase conforming mortgages in the secondary market. The GSEs purchase conforming mortgages and either hold them in their portfolios or pool them into MBS. They guarantee timely payment of principal and interest to investors, transferring credit risk to themselves. In return for this guarantee, they receive a guarantee fee. This support in the secondary market can lead to lower rates for borrowers in the primary market. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are private companies with congressional charters. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, private companies with congressional charters, were placed in voluntary conservatorship by the federal government due to extreme financial difficulty. The conservatorship aims to meet public policy goals, conserve assets, and eventually return control to stockholders or dissolve the enterprises. Congress established Ginnie Mae in 1968 as a separate entity from Fannie Mae. Ginnie Mae, established in 1968, guarantees MBS of government-backed mortgages insured by FHA, VA, USDA, or HUD. It does not purchase or securitize mortgages but guarantees MBS issued by approved issuers. Ginnie Mae increases capital availability for lenders by providing a secondary market for government-backed mortgages. Ginnie Mae guarantees MBS of government-backed mortgages and its employees are government employees. Its guaranty is backed by the U.S. government. PLS involves nonconforming mortgages and lacks a government guarantee, unlike GSE and Ginnie Mae securities. Private-label MBS often use alternative forms of credit enhancement to reduce credit risk for investors, such as purchasing insurance or structuring multiple tranches. Securitizers can create collateralized-debt obligations (CDOs) by pooling different tranches of MBS or CDOs. Investors in MBS, including agency and non-agency MBS, are crucial for funding mortgages in the primary market. They choose MBS based on risk and return preferences. Agency MBS, like GSE and Ginnie Mae MBS, are bought through the TBA market, while non-agency MBS, such as PLS, are purchased differently. Investors purchase MBS through the TBA market, where specific mortgages are unknown at the time of trade agreement. Criteria include issuer, coupon, maturity, price, par amount, and settlement date. The trade may take weeks to settle, with details of the mortgages disclosed two days before settlement. The pool sold must meet the agreed criteria and settlement guidelines. The TBA market, guided by SIFMA settlement guidelines, benefits the housing finance system by boosting MBS demand, lowering interest rates, and reducing uncertainty for sellers. It allows for locking in interest rates early and provides a timeframe for settling trades. Non-agency MBS are sold in a specified-pool market, known for their lower liquidity compared to agency MBS. The lack of a large forward market and absence of government guarantee contribute to this illiquidity."
