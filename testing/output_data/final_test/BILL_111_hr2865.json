    "content": "The Act titled \"Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment Implementation Act of 2009\" is established for the purpose of implementing findings related to Arctic marine shipping. The Congress finds that the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas are becoming more accessible to shipping due to various factors. It is important for the United States to work with Alaska and other Arctic neighbors to ensure safe and environmentally friendly shipping in the region. The United States aims to ensure secure shipping in the Arctic Ocean, protect sovereign and security interests, allow access for research vessels, maintain peaceful relations, and establish international cooperation for reliable shipping. For nearly 500 years, mariners and sea-faring nations have sought national and global benefits from sea routes in the Arctic similar to those provided by the Panama and Suez canals. Expanded shipping in the Arctic presents risks to residents, and coordinated shipping regulations are needed to protect United States interests. Proven models for international cooperation in managing regional waterways exist. The United States has interests in the Arctic region, including joint administration of the St. Lawrence Seaway with Canada and cooperation with Russia for fisheries enforcement. The country's sovereign interests in the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea regions may increase with a claim for an extended continental shelf. Building new icebreakers and establishing coordinated shipping regulations are essential for protecting these interests. The purpose of this Act is to ensure safe, secure, and reliable maritime shipping in the Arctic, including aids to navigation, vessel escorts, spill response capability, and maritime search and rescue. Coordinated shipping regulations and oil spill prevention efforts are crucial for protecting United States interests in the Arctic region. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates will work with the International Maritime Organization to establish agreements for coordinated action in the Arctic region, focusing on aids to navigation, icebreaking capabilities, oil spill prevention, vessel tracking, and search and rescue. Coordination will be overseen by the Committee on the Maritime Transportation System. The Committee on the Maritime Transportation System will coordinate domestic transportation policies in the Arctic. The Secretary may enter agreements or contracts to carry out the Act's purpose. Icebreaking will be used to ensure safe maritime navigation as needed for commerce. The Secretary of Transportation may conduct demonstration projects to reduce emissions from vessels in the Arctic and is authorized to appropriate funds for this purpose. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAuthorized appropriations include $750,000,000 for the construction of two polar capable icebreakers, $5,000,000 for Arctic operations, and $10,000,000 for agreements. Additionally, $5,000,000 is allocated for demonstration projects under section 7.\n\nSEC. 9. ARCTIC DEFINITION. SEC. 9. ARCTIC DEFINITION. The term \"Arctic\" in this Act refers to the definition in the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984."
