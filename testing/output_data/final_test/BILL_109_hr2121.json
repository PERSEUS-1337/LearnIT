The \"Generate Retirement Ownership Through Long-Term Holding Act of 2005\" defers recognition of gain for individuals receiving capital gain dividends from regulated investment companies if reinvested automatically. Definitions and rules apply, with deferred gains recognized upon subsequent stock sale or redemption. Upon a sale or redemption of stock in a distributing company or upon the death of the individual, the taxpayer must recognize the portion of total gain equivalent to the portion of shares sold or redeemed. Upon the taxpayer's death, any unrealized gain not recognized before will be included in their gross income. The holding period for shares acquired through reinvestment of a capital gain dividend is considered one year and a day. In the case of a distribution of a capital gain dividend treated as qualified 5-year gain, the holding period is extended to '5 years and a day'. This rule does not apply to individuals eligible for a deduction under section 151 or to estates or trusts. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for this provision. The Secretary will prescribe regulations necessary for this section. Conforming amendments are made to the Code regarding nonrecognition of gain with reinvested capital gain dividends. The amendments made by this section regarding reinvested capital gain dividends of regulated investment companies apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of this Act."
