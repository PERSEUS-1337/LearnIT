    "content": "President Obama's FY2013 budget request for Energy and Water Development was released in February 2012, totaling $33.7 billion. The House Appropriations Committee reported out H.R. 5325 with $32.2 billion, while the Senate Appropriations Committee funded programs at $33.4 billion. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (P.L. 112-175) signed into law on September 28, continues appropriations until March 27, 2013, with funding slightly above FY2012 levels for Energy and Water Development programs. The FY2013 Defense and Military Construction/VA, Full Year Continuing Resolution (H.R. 933) was passed by the House on March 6, 2013, and signed into law on March 26, 2013 (P.L. 113-6). The act funded Energy and Water Development accounts at the FY2012 enacted level for the rest of FY2013, with some exceptions, and subject to sequestration requirements. The FY2013 funding legislation for Energy and Water Development includes funding for various projects and agencies. The legislation was considered in the context of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which established spending limits for FY2012-FY2021. The Budget Control Act of 2011 triggered automatic spending reductions through sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps starting on January 2, 2013. The process requires across-the-board spending cuts to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA, P.L. 112-240) made significant changes to the Budget Control Act (BCA) procedures for FY2013. The joint committee sequester implementation was delayed to March 1, 2013, with a $24 billion reduction in the sequester amount. Statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2013 and FY2014 were also lowered. President Obama ordered the sequester implementation on March 1, 2013, as per the amended BCA. The OMB report indicated budget authority cancellations for non-exempt funds at the program, project, and activity level within each account. Sequester reductions were calculated annually during a temporary continuing resolution, affecting FY2013 funding. Further guidance from OMB is needed to clarify the impact on agency budgetary resources. P.L. 113-6 maintains FY2012 funding levels for Energy and Water Development programs, with exceptions. In Title I, the Corps of Engineers Construction budget is reduced by $20 million from FY2012. In Title II, Central Utah Project funding is set at $21.0 million instead of $28.7 million. In Title III, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy budget is $1.814 billion, Nuclear Energy budget is $759.0 million, Science budget is $4.8760 billion, Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 Energy funding is $265 million, National Nuclear Security Administration's Weapons program is funded at $7.5573 billion, and Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation program is increased by $110 million over FY2012 level. The Energy and Water Development bill provides funding for the civil program of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with a focus on domestic uranium enrichment R&D. Budget details for various departments and agencies are provided in tables for FY2012-FY2013. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers receives attention for its projects with economic, environmental, and water resource development impacts. Recent changes in appropriations include earmark moratoriums and reductions for some projects. Flooding events in 2011 led to reprogramming of funds and additional appropriations for response and recovery. The President's budget request for the Corps is typically below the enacted appropriation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' funding for FY2012 saw an increase compared to the President's request, with the enacted appropriation being $5.002 billion. The President's FY2013 budget requested $4.731 billion, while the House recommended $4.814 billion and the Senate recommended $5.007 billion for the Corps. Corps funding is part of the debate over earmarks, unlike other federal infrastructure programs. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' funding for FY2012 increased to $5.002 billion, with appropriations directed to specific projects. In FY2012, Congress provided additional funding for broad categories of Corps projects instead of traditional project-based increases. The backlog of authorized Corps projects, estimated to range from $11 billion to over $80 billion, raises policy questions about the disconnect between authorization and appropriations processes and how to prioritize activities. Recent budget requests have included few new studies and construction starts, with enacted appropriations for FY2011 and FY2012 barring funding for these project types. The FY2011 and FY2012 appropriations barred funding for new construction starts and studies. The Administration requested funding for three new construction starts and six new studies for FY2013. Two trust funds, the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and the Inland Waterway Trust Fund, require annual appropriations. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund has a surplus balance, while the Inland Waterway Trust Fund faces a shortfall. The Harbor Maintenance Tax was enacted in 1986 to recover operation and maintenance costs at U.S. harbors. The Harbor Maintenance Tax is levied on importers and domestic shippers using coastal or Great Lakes ports. Revenues go into the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for dredging purposes. Congress increased the tax rate in 1990 to address the federal deficit. Despite increased collections, a surplus has developed in the fund. The maritime industry seeks a \"spending guarantee\" to use up the surplus. The Harbor Maintenance Tax funds dredging of harbor channels, but some channels are not being maintained properly. This leads to issues for ships with deep drafts. The HMTF has a surplus, with the Administration requesting $848 million in FY2013 and the House Appropriations Committee providing $1.0 billion. However, spending more from the HMTF could impact funding for other Energy and Water Development activities under budget caps. Since the 1980s, construction and rehabilitation projects on inland waterways have been cost-shared between the federal government and users through the Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF). There has been a potential shortfall in the IWTF since FY2007, with Congress taking measures to ensure temporary solvency, such as appropriating federal funds beyond the 50% federal requirement or limiting expenditures to current year fuel tax revenues. The IWTF is expected to have a balance of $55 million at the end of FY2012. Without changes to the current system, funding for eligible work is expected to exceed available funding in the future. Users proposed increasing the fuel tax by $0.06-$0.08 per gallon and altering cost-share arrangements for IWTF projects, which has been opposed by the Obama Administration. H.R. 5325 would authorize this proposal, but appropriators have expressed frustration with the lack of action on this issue. The lack of action on funding for inland waterway projects is causing frustration. The Olmsted Lock and Dam project accounts for most IWTF appropriations, with estimates increasing by $872 million to a total of $2.9 billion. The project is expected to continue requiring the majority of IWTF revenues for the next 10 years. The Administration requested limited appropriations for IWTF projects in FY2013, with an additional $80 million in new revenues from an unspecified user fee. The Administration requested limited appropriations for IWTF projects in FY2013, with an additional $80 million in new revenues from an unspecified user fee. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees provided funding for the Olmsted project, with the Senate allocating an extra $72 million for IWTF projects. The Corps' Energy and Water bill typically includes funding for ecosystem restoration projects like the Everglades in South Florida. The Corps has requested reductions for some activities in recent budgets, but funding for ecosystem restoration projects has remained consistent. The Administration requested $511 million for ecosystem restoration projects in FY2013, with the House Appropriations Committee decreasing funding levels for initiatives like Everglades and Missouri River Fish and Wildlife Recovery. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported the Administration's request. The Administration's FY2013 budget requested $24 million in funding for five of the nine Corps Continuing Authorities Programs (CAPs), with a decrease of approximately $19 million from the previous year. The House Appropriations Committee agreed with the overall request but shifted some funding within individual CAPs, while the Senate Appropriations Committee supported the Administration's request for CAPs. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $45 million in funding for eight of the nine CAPs, including the Central Utah Project (CUP) and the Bureau of Reclamation. The total discretionary FY2013 budget request for CUP and Reclamation was $1.034 billion, a decrease of $42 million from FY2012. The Obama Administration requested $21 million for CUP in FY2013, $7 million less than FY2012. The Administration proposed to make Reclamation responsible for CUP oversight, but both House and Senate appropriations committees disagreed. The FY2013 request for the Bureau of Reclamation was $1.013 billion, $34 million less than FY2012. It included an \"offset\" of $39.9 million for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund, resulting in a net discretionary authority of $973 million. Additional funding is expected from permanent and other funds. The Water and Related Resources account, Reclamation's largest, covers various programs like construction, operations, Dam Safety, Water and Energy Management, and Fish and Wildlife Management. The Obama Administration requested $818 million for this account. The Obama Administration requested $818 million for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2013, a reduction of $76 million from FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $834 million in funding, while the Senate Appropriations Committee provided $892.1 million. This includes shifting of funds for Indian water rights settlements and San Joaquin restoration to new accounts. The Bureau of Reclamation manages dams and water diversion projects in the West, providing water for irrigation and other purposes. They oversee over 300 storage reservoirs in 17 states, serving 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. Reclamation is a major water supplier and hydroelectric power producer, also offering flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits. Operations of Reclamation facilities can be controversial due to their impact on fish and wildlife species. The Bureau of Reclamation manages water projects in the West, including the controversial Central Valley Project in California. Limited water deliveries and pumping due to drought and environmental restrictions have led to debates over appropriations and authorizations. The current moratorium affects Congress's ability to allocate funds to specific Reclamation projects. The San Joaquin River Restoration Fund, authorized by the enactment of Title X of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, supports fisheries restoration and water management provisions of a settlement agreement for the Natural Resources Defense Council et al. v. Rodgers lawsuit. The San Joaquin River Restoration Fund is funded through various sources, including reallocated receipts and accelerated payments from water users. Funding for the settlement has been controversial, with proposals to repeal or defund key components. Previous funding included mandatory funds, and for FY2013, Reclamation proposed $12 million in discretionary funding. The Administration proposed $12 million in discretionary funding for San Joaquin River restoration activities in FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee did not provide funding, but the Senate Appropriations Committee supported the request. Efforts are also being made to restore the fisheries in the Klamath Basin through agreements that would cost the federal government $800 million over 15 years. In FY2013, Reclamation proposed $7.1 million in new funding for selected KBRA activities in the Klamath, which was supported by both the House and Senate appropriations committees. Reclamation has combined funding for water conservation programs into the WaterSMART Program as part of an overall effort. Congress must authorize agreements for most restoration actions in the Klamath, including a secretarial determination related to dam removal. The WaterSMART program, part of the Department of the Interior's focus on water conservation, had a FY2013 budget request of $53.9 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $46.9 million, while the Senate agreed with the President's request. Funding levels for WaterSMART programs are detailed in Table 7. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded DOE programs since FY2005, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. The FY2012 appropriations act funded DOE programs at $26.3 billion, with the Obama Administration requesting $27.7 billion for FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $26.1 billion, while the Senate recommended $27.1 billion. President Obama emphasized the importance of energy efficiency and renewable energy in his State of the Union address. In his State of the Union address in February 2012, President Obama emphasized the importance of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. However, Congress has been hesitant to increase funding for these programs. The proposed budget for EERE was reduced from $3.2 billion to $1.8 billion in FY2012. For FY2013, DOE requested $2.267 billion for EERE programs, with the House bill proposing $1.381 billion and the Senate bill suggesting $1.916 billion. Additionally, DOE requested an extra $143.0 million for Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability programs. DOE proposed restructuring subprogram accounts into four areas: Innovations, Emerging Technologies, Systems Integration, and Market Barriers, aligned with technology readiness levels (TRL) from basic research to commercial market penetration. The Innovations subprogram covers applied research at TRL levels 2-3. The House and Senate reports rejected DOE's proposal for a new subprogram account structure, citing its inadequacy for budgeting purposes. For the FY2014 request, the Senate report directed DOE to provide more detail at the program, project, and activity level. The Hydrogen/Fuel Cell Program requested $80 million, with activities being reduced but not eliminated. The House bill would appropriate $82 million, while the Senate bill would allocate $104 million, the FY2012 level. This program aims to foster domestic bioenergy. The program aims to foster a domestic bioenergy industry that produces renewable biofuels, bioproducts, and biopower to reduce oil dependence, greenhouse gas emissions, and stimulate economic development in rural areas. The strategy focuses on converting raw biomass to solid pellets or \"green crude\" oil for easy transport at large scale. The goal is to help cellulosic biofuels reach a wholesale finished-fuel cost under $3 per gallon by 2017. DOE requested $270 million for FY2013 for biomass and biorefinery programs, compared to $199 million appropriated for FY2012. The DOE requested increased funding of $270 million for FY2013 to support biorefinery projects, including cellulosic ethanol and renewable diesel. They also sought authority to transfer $100 million to the Defense Production Act Fund for joint activities with the Department of Defense and Department of Agriculture. The House and Senate bills did not fund the increased activity, with the House bill appropriating $203 million and the Senate bill $200 million. The House Appropriations Committee did not agree to transferring funds to the Defense Production Act Fund, while the Senate Committee approved it. The DOE requested $310 million for the Solar Program, with a focus on research for new data analysis capabilities. The Senate recommended $293 million for the program, supporting the increase for data analysis. The House bill proposed cutting the Solar Program to $155 million, with specified amounts for Innovations in Manufacturing and Photovoltaic Cell Development. For the Wind Program, the DOE requested $95 million, with the Senate recommending the full amount and the House recommending $70 million. The Committee recommended the full amount of the request for offshore wind technology development. For the Geothermal Program, DOE requested $65 million, with much of the increase going to an Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) Field Sites program. The Senate bill would fund the Geothermal Program at the requested level, while the House bill would appropriate $30 million with no funding specified for the EGS program. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees urged DOE to explore low-temperature geothermal sources. For the Water Power Program, DOE requested $20 million, a cut of $38.8 million below FY2012, to support water power technologies utilizing marine, hydrokinetic, and conventional hydropower resources for electricity generation. The budget request allocated $15 million to water power technologies and $5 million to conventional hydropower. The Senate recommended $59 million for water power, with 75% for technologies and 25% for conventional hydropower. The House recommended $25 million for technologies and $20 million for conventional hydropower. The President announced a goal for 1 million electric vehicles by 2015, with a requested increase of $91 million for the Vehicle Technologies Program to support EV development. The EV Challenge aims to ensure U.S. leadership in next-generation electric vehicle technology, focusing on advanced battery technology, power electronics, and charging technology. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not agree on the funding increase, with the House bill proposing $335 million and the Senate bill proposing $330 million. The program aims to reduce building-related energy costs by 50% by 2030 through energy efficiency measures, including improving building components, strengthening market pull, and raising energy efficiency standards for new equipment and buildings. The DOE requested $310 million for FY2013, a $90.8 million increase over FY2012, with a focus on building activities. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees disagreed on the funding increase for FY2013. The House recommended $335 million, while the Senate recommended $330 million. The DOE proposed restructuring the Industrial Technologies Program into an Advanced Manufacturing Office to align with national interests and concerns about jobs. The DOE proposed restructuring the Industrial Technologies Program into an Advanced Manufacturing Office to align with national interests and concerns about jobs. The general goal for AMO programs is to reduce the energy use of manufactured goods by 50% over 10 years. DOE requested $290 million for FY2013, with a focus on Next Generation Manufacturing Processes, Next Generation Materials, and Industrial Technical Assistance. These proposed increases align with the \"Next Generation\" manufacturing initiatives from the FY2012 request. The FY2013 proposals involve less funding but more focus and specifics than FY2012. The increase for Manufacturing Processes aims to develop new ways to reduce steps in industrial processes and discover alternate processes. Public-private partnerships would be expanded through manufacturing demonstration facilities, research/industry manufacturing awards, and manufacturing challenges. Technologies from the Innovative Manufacturing Initiative would advance into this phase, benefiting small- and medium-sized firms. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $150 million for Next Generation Materials, aiming to provide access to specialized technology for small- and medium-sized firms. The Senate report recommended $168.6 million, with both reports agreeing to extend funding for the Critical Materials Hub. FEMP offers expertise and training to help federal agencies achieve energy efficiency goals, with DOE requesting $32 million for FY2013. The DOE requested $164.7 million for a program that funds federal employees, contract support, and operational costs, with the Senate Appropriations Committee recommending the full amount and the House report recommending $115 million. For Strategic Programs, DOE seeks $58.9 million, mainly for joint work with the Office of Science on clean energy research. The International subprogram would receive a $3.5 million increase, with $2 million supporting exports to foreign markets. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $25 million, while the House Appropriations Committee recommended $10 million. The Committee recommended $10 million to address barriers faced by state and local governments in providing home energy services to low-income families. DOE requested $139 million for FY2013, with the Senate Appropriations Committee recommending $145 million. The House Appropriations report suggested $54.6 million, citing unspent prior year funds. This program supports state energy offices with nearly level funding requested by DOE. The Senate recommended $50 million, while the House report suggested $25 million. The Committee recommended $50 million for EDER, with the House report suggesting $25 million. DOE requested $143 million, including $20 million for a new Electricity Systems Hub to address grid accommodation of renewables, electric vehicles, and smart grid equipment. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported the full request, while the House report recommended $123 million with no funds for the Hub. The Obama Administration's FY2013 funding request for nuclear energy research was $770.4 million, $88.3 million below the FY2012 level. In FY2013, funding for safeguards and security at DOE's Idaho facilities was included under the Nuclear Energy account, with proposed reductions in Reactor Concepts (36%), Radiological Facility Management (27%), and Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies (13%). The House Appropriations Committee recommended an increase of $89.9 million for the nuclear energy account, totaling $765.4 million, while the Senate Appropriations recommended a $20.1 million increase for nuclear energy, including Idaho safeguards and security. The Administration's FY2013 nuclear R&D budget request aligns with DOE's Nuclear Energy Research and Development Roadmap, focusing on improving reactor reliability, affordability, sustainable fuel cycles, and minimizing proliferation risks. The Reactor Concepts program area includes the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) demonstration project and research on advanced reactors. The FY2013 funding request for the Reactor Concepts program, which includes the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) project, was $73.7 million, a decrease from FY2012. The House recommended an increase, while the Senate's recommendation matched the request. The NGNP project aims to produce high-temperature heat for electricity generation and other industrial processes, with a funding request of $21.2 million for FY2013. The NGNP project requested $21.2 million for FY2013, down from $40 million in FY2012. DOE decided not to proceed with a demonstration plant but will focus on research. Potential obstacles include low natural gas prices and private-sector unwillingness to share costs. The program will focus on high-temperature reactor fuels, graphite, and licensing issues. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $50 million for NGNP to develop a licensing framework and work with industry. The Senate panel restricted NGNP activities to ongoing fuel-related research and reduced funding for the Advanced Reactor Concepts subprogram from $21.9 million in FY2012 to $12.4 million in FY2013. These advanced reactors, classified as \"Generation IV,\" aim to improve nuclear power performance in sustainability, economics, safety, and proliferation resistance through technologies like fast reactors and various heat-transfer fluids. The House Appropriations Committee recommended an increase of $1.1 million over FY2012 for research on extending the life of existing commercial light water reactors beyond 60 years. The program focuses on analyzing safety margins of aging plants and improving efficiency through measures like increasing plant. The House Appropriations Committee recommended an increase in funding for research on extending the life of existing commercial light water reactors. The focus is on improving efficiency by increasing plant capacity and upgrading instrumentation and control systems. Research on longer-life LWR fuel aims to eliminate radioactive leakage and increase accident tolerance. The Senate panel approved the budget, while interest in small modular reactors is growing due to rising costs of large conventional nuclear reactors. SMRs range from 40 to 350 megawatts and would be installed together to form a power block with a single control room. DOE requested $65 million for FY2013 to provide technical support for licensing small modular LWRs, focusing on LWR designs believed to be deployed in the near term. The program is similar to DOE's support for larger commercial reactor designs under the Nuclear Power 2010 Program, with at least half the costs to be covered by industry partners. The DOE's Small Modular Reactor (SMR) program aims to have industry partners cover at least half of the costs. Two teams of reactor vendors and utilities are being supported to build reactors at specific sites. Funding for the program was recommended at $114 million by the House Appropriations Committee, with an additional $18.5 million requested for SMR advanced concepts R&D. Unlike the SMR licensing support program, the advanced concepts program focuses on innovative SMR technologies. The SMR advanced concepts program focuses on researching technologies for longer-term deployment, with the House Appropriations Committee rejecting a proposed budget reduction while the Senate panel approved it. Small modular reactors differ from the trend of larger reactors in nuclear power technology, as they are economically viable with simpler safety systems and the ability to be constructed in smaller increments. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel, with a FY2013 funding request of $175.4 million. The program studies various fuel cycle technologies, including direct disposal and recycling options. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $138.7 million, while the Senate panel recommended $193.1 million for the program. The Cycle R&D Program will research technology options for managing nuclear waste and used fuel, focusing on near-term recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Commission. The largest subprogram is Used Nuclear Fuel Disposition, with a $59.7 million request for activities such as developing standardized spent fuel containers and studying potential disposal partnerships. The House report reduced funding for the Used Fuel Disposition Program to $38 million, with $15 million allocated for storage and transportation work related to the Yucca Mountain repository. The Senate panel's $17.7 million increase includes funds for a spent fuel storage pilot project. Other research areas in the Fuel Cycle R&D Program focus on advanced fuels for reactors, nuclear waste characteristics, and technology advancements for nuclear fuel. The Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies (NEET) program conducts research and development in technologies supporting new reactor designs and fuel cycle advancements. The DOE requested $65.3 million for the program in FY2013, with proposed cuts in Crosscutting Technology Development. The House recommended $75 million, while the Senate panel supported the DOE's funding request. The proposed cuts are due to the elimination of research on manufacturing methods. The budget justification includes cuts in research on manufacturing methods and nonproliferation risk assessments. Crosscutting research activities focus on innovative materials, automation, sensors, and fuel performance. The Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation requested $24.6 million, slightly above the FY2012 appropriation. The hub aims to create a computer model of an operating reactor for better understanding of nuclear technology. The National Scientific User Facility requested $14.6 million to support partnerships for experiments at specialized facilities. The FY2013 funding will support partnerships for experiments at specialized facilities, focusing on coal with an emphasis on carbon capture and storage technologies. The Carbon Capture sub-program aims to separate CO2 in pre-combustion and post-combustion systems, while the Carbon Storage sub-program focuses on long-term geologic storage of CO2. The Carbon Storage sub-program focuses on long-term geologic storage of CO2 through small- and large-scale injection tests. The Advanced Energy Systems sub-program aims to improve coal-based power system efficiency for CO2 capture, affordability, and environmental standards. The Cross-Cutting Research activity bridges basic and applied research for innovative system development and deployment. The FY2013 budget for Fossil Energy R&D remains at $428.5 million, with a request of $420.6 million and $7.9 million from prior-year balances. The House Committee recommended $554 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development for FY2013, $207.3 million above FY2012 and $133.4 million above the budget request. The recommendation includes $384.3 million for Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) and Power Systems, with allocations for Carbon Capture, Carbon Storage, Advanced Energy Systems, coal-biomass to liquids activities, High Performance Materials, and solid oxide fuel systems research. The Senate Committee recommended $460.6 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development, $40 million more than the budget request. This includes funding for various activities such as coal-biomass to liquids, High Performance Materials, Cross-Cutting Research, NETL Coal Research and Development, Natural Gas Technologies, Program Direction, and a new program in Unconventional Fossil Energy Technologies. The committee also allocated funds for Carbon Capture and Sequestration, including Carbon Capture, Carbon Storage, and Advanced Energy Systems. The Senate Committee recommended $460.6 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development, including funding for activities such as coal-biomass to liquids, High Performance Materials, Carbon Capture, Carbon Storage, Advanced Energy Systems, Cross-Cutting Research, NETL Coal Research and Development, Natural Gas Technologies, Program Direction, and a new program in Unconventional Fossil Energy Technologies. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas and serves as an emergency source of crude oil. Its maximum capacity reached 727 million barrels by early 2010, and the federal government has not purchased oil for the SPR since 1994. The federal government has not purchased oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) since 1994. In 2000, additions to the SPR were made with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil. In 2011, there was an SPR sale of 30.6 million barrels for about $3.3 billion, reducing the inventory to 695.9 million barrels. In FY2013, the administration requested $195.6 million to operate the SPR, an increase from the previous year. The Administration proposed an increase in funding for the operation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to $195.6 million for FY2013. The Department of Energy's Office of Science conducts basic research in various program areas and requested $4.992 billion for FY2013, with the House committee recommending $4.801 billion. The Administration's goal is to double the funding of the Office of Science, with the FY2013 request being 37% more than the FY2006 baseline. The House and Senate committee recommendations are 32% and 35% more than the baseline, respectively. The largest program, basic energy sciences, would receive $1.800 billion, an increase of $111 million from FY2012, mainly for clean energy research. The request for increased funding would support clean energy research, including combustion research, materials and chemistry research, and construction of the Linac Coherent Light Source-II. The House committee recommended $1.657 billion, with reductions in funding for facility operations, energy frontier research centers, and other research activities. The Senate committee recommended $1.712 billion, with a reduction in funding for research activities but full funding for construction projects. Both committees directed DOE not to engage in energy-related activities. The House committee recommended $777 million for high-energy physics, a decrease of $14 million from FY2012. Nonaccelerator physics projects would increase $12 million, including support for the Large-Scale Synoptic Telescope. Funding for facilities at Fermilab would decrease $13 million due to planned upgrades, and accelerator development would decrease $23 million. Construction of the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) would not be funded. The House and Senate committees recommended $16 million for the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE), with offsets in other activities. The request for biological and environmental research is $625 million, with an increase of $16 million from FY2012, mainly for terrestrial ecosystem science. Funding for radiobiology would decrease by $5 million. For nuclear physics, the request is $527 million, down $20 million from FY2012. Funding for the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) upgrade would continue. The House and Senate committees recommended increased funding for facility operations and maintenance, advanced scientific computing research, and research funding. The House committee expressed concern over the lack of a long-term plan for exascale computing. The Senate committee supported the requested amount for advanced scientific computing research. The Senate committee recommended the requested amount for fusion energy sciences, with a decrease in funding for domestic fusion activities and the shutdown of the Alcator C-Mod fusion reactor. The proposed U.S. contribution to ITER would increase by $45 million. The House committee recommended $475 million, including more funding for ITER and the domestic program. The Senate committee recommended $312 million for the Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E) in FY2013, an increase of $75 million from FY2012, as authorized by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. The Administration's FY2013 budget includes no funding for DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM). The DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) had funding until FY2010 for the Yucca Mountain repository, but it was closed due to the Obama Administration's decision that it was not a viable option. The Administration established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to find alternative waste management strategies. The Blue Ribbon Commission issued its final report to the Secretary of Energy on January 26, 2012, recommending a \"consent based\" approach for nuclear waste facilities. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the Administration's nuclear waste policy and allocated $25 million for FY2013 for the Yucca Mountain repository. The Senate Committee authorized a pilot program for consolidated interim storage facilities with consent required from the state governor, local government, Indian tribes, and Congress. DOE was directed to use $2 million for the pilot program from program direction funding and $17.7 million from prior-year appropriations from the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Nuclear Waste Fund license application for the Yucca Mountain repository was filed by DOE in 2008 but a motion to withdraw it was rejected by the NRC in 2010. The NRC Commission deadlocked on the issue in 2011, leaving the licensing panel's decision in place. Funding was not provided in FY2012 or requested for FY2013 for Yucca Mountain licensing activities. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended options for temporary storage. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a \"consent-based\" approach for the storage and disposal of highly radioactive nuclear waste. They proposed the development of consolidated waste facilities and the establishment of a new waste management organization with access to the Nuclear Waste Fund. The DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy has taken over waste management activities from OCRWM and will lead future research on nuclear waste disposal technologies. Substantial funding has been requested for this purpose, with a focus on implementing recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Commission. The House Appropriations Committee cautioned against unilateral policy development on nuclear waste management, while the Senate panel directed DOE to implement a waste storage pilot program in line with the Commission's recommendations. The Senate panel directed DOE to implement a waste storage pilot program in line with the Blue Ribbon Commission's recommendations, following court decisions upholding DOE's obligation to remove waste from nuclear plant sites by a certain deadline. DOE estimates liability payments could exceed $20 billion if waste removal does not begin by 2020. The DOE's Loan Programs Office provides loan guarantees for energy projects and direct loans for vehicle manufacturing technologies. Funding for additional loans and guarantees was not requested for FY2013. $38 million was requested for loan guarantee administrative expenses, offset by fees, and $9 million for vehicle manufacturing loan program expenses. The House approved the loan guarantee program funding, while the Senate approved the full vehicle manufacturing request. The DOE Loan Programs Office offers loan guarantees for innovative clean energy technologies under Section 1703 and renewable energy, electric transmission, and advanced biofuels under Section 1705. The Section 1705 program was a temporary economic stimulus measure established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Unlike Section 1703, Section 1705 includes already-commercialized technologies. The DOE offers loan guarantees for renewable energy and electric transmission technologies. Title XVII allows for up to 80% of construction costs to be covered. DOE has pending loan guarantee commitments totaling $10.33 billion for nuclear projects under Section 1703, and has issued final loan guarantees for 26 projects totaling $16 billion under Section 1705. The program's final rules were issued on October 4, 2007, after facing criticism for limiting guarantees to 90% of a project's debt. The DOE offers loan guarantees for renewable energy and electric transmission technologies, covering up to 80% of construction costs. DOE issued final rules in October 2007, allowing guarantees for 100% of a project's debt. The first loan guarantee under Section 1705 was issued to Solyndra Inc. in September 2009, totaling $535 million. Solyndra's bankruptcy in 2011 led to criticism of the program's management. Title XVII requires upfront coverage of estimated future government costs for defaults on guaranteed loans. Subsidy costs are calculated to cover possible future net costs, but Congressional Budget Office predicts they will be too low by at least 1%. Appropriations bills include a 1% adjustment to loan guarantee authorizations to address this shortfall. The subsidy costs for Section 1703 and 1705 loan guarantees are usually paid by project sponsors. However, ARRA appropriated $6 billion to cover the subsidy costs of Section 1705 loan guarantees, eliminating the need for project sponsors to pay. The total loan guarantee amounts under ARRA depend on the level of subsidy costs charged. $2 billion of Section 1705 subsidy cost appropriation was transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program, and $1.5 billion was rescinded. The Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA) established an initial cap of $4 billion on loan guarantees under the Section 1703 program. The loan guarantee ceiling was increased to $38.5 billion through FY2009, with specific allocations for nuclear power plants and uranium enrichment plants. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act increased DOE's loan guarantee authority under Section 1703 to $47 billion, with allocations for nuclear power, energy efficiency, renewables, coal, carbon capture, and uranium enrichment. The time limits on the loan guarantee authority were eliminated. The FY2011 Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act reduced the loan guarantee authority for non-nuclear technologies to $8.3 billion but added new authority for a total of $9.5 billion. The FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act provided $170 million with no expiration for subsidy costs for renewable energy and efficiency projects under the Section 1703 program, along with authority for up to $1.183 billion in loan guarantees for these projects. This additional funding is available for various technologies, including nuclear power, energy efficiency, renewables, coal, carbon capture, and uranium enrichment. The FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act provided funding for various technologies, including nuclear power, energy efficiency, renewables, coal, carbon capture, and uranium enrichment. The Act allocated $170 million for subsidy costs for renewable energy and efficiency projects under Section 1703, with authority for up to $1.183 billion in loan guarantees. The Act also set ceilings for non-nuclear technologies, nuclear power plants, uranium enrichment plants, and renewable energy projects. The FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act allocated $170 million for subsidy costs for renewable energy and energy efficiency loan guarantees under Section 1703. This funding could support loan guarantees totaling $1.7 billion if subsidy costs averaged 10% of the guarantees. Additionally, $2.5 billion was appropriated for Section 1705 subsidy costs by ARRA, with $1.9 billion used to pay subsidy costs for $16 billion in loan guarantees under Section 1705. The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program was established by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, with $7.5 billion appropriated in FY2009 to issue up to $25 billion in direct loans for eligible automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers. The ATVM Loan Program provides loans to automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers for investments in plant capacity to produce fuel-efficient vehicles. The program is administered by the DOE Loan Programs Office, with $8.4 billion in loans issued so far. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, established in 1994, aims to preserve US nuclear weapons expertise. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), ensures the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. Activities take place at the nuclear weapons complex, including three laboratories and four production sites. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) manages a complex consisting of eight sites, including laboratories and production sites. Despite Cold War reductions, there are ongoing discussions in Congress about further changes to the Complex for increased efficiency, security, and reduced footprint. The Administration plans to invest $80 billion in the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex, with estimated costs for FY2011-FY2020 between $85.4 billion and $86.2 billion. The FY2013 budget requested $7,577.3 million for Weapons Activities, showing a reduction compared to previous estimates. The November 2010 report outlined budget cuts and changes in key programs, leading to controversy in Congress. Senator Jon Kyl criticized the Administration for not keeping its funding commitments, while Representative Michael Turner expressed concern over a potential budget reversal. President Obama is reversing his commitment to request $7.9 billion for the NNSA for FY13, changing the terms of the Senate's ratification of the New START treaty. Representative Turner introduced H.R. 4178 to maintain the commitment, while Representative Markey introduced H.R. 3974 calling for cuts in nuclear weapons programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $7,512.3 million, $65.0 million less than the request, which was rescinded. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the full amount. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (P.L. 112-175) funds Energy and Water Development programs until March 27, 2013, at the requested amount. Questions arise regarding the reduction or delay of key projects in the Weapons Activities budget for FY2013 compared to the 1251 report. The impact of fiscal constraints and credibility issues on Senate consideration is also a concern. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern over NNSA's inadequate project management, citing cost overruns and delays in major construction projects. They directed NNSA to provide regular reports on implementing management recommendations and project updates. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NNSA to provide regular reports on changes to cost, schedule, and scope of projects costing at least $750 million. This includes a study on NNSA's stockpile surveillance program and a report on a comprehensive plutonium strategy involving work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile. Life Extension Programs aim to extend the life of existing warheads through design, certification, manufacture, and component replacement. The FY2012 budget for the W76 warhead for the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile was $257.0 million for the W76 LEP and $223.6 million for the B61 LEP, shifting from a feasibility study to a full LEP. The B61 LEP aims to extend the service life of B61 mods 3, 4, and 7 nuclear bombs by combining them into a new mod, B61 mod 12, for another 30 years. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $278.6 million for the B61 LEP in FY2012 to begin the process, with the first production unit expected in FY2017. The committee recommended $255.0 million for the W76 LEP and $180.0 million for the B61 LEP. The B61 LEP is described as the most ambitious refurbishment of a weapon system to date, incorporating new technologies for safety and security. The final appropriation was $257.0 million for the W76 LEP and $223.6 million for the B61 LEP, with a portion withheld pending a design study. The FY2013 request for the W76 LEP was $174.9 million, lower than the previously stated $255 million annually. The revised plan aimed to meet Navy's operational needs by 2018 but delayed extra W76 production until 2021 to allocate funds for the B61 LEP. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about NNSA's production capabilities and recommended an additional $45.1 million for the W76 LEP. The Senate Appropriations Committee also raised concerns about decreased funding for the W76, considering it a crucial part of the nuclear deterrent. The FY2013 budget allocated funds for the W76 LEP and B61 LEP, with concerns raised about the B61 LEP being behind schedule and inefficient spending. Funds were increased for the W76 LEP and reduced for the B61 LEP, with NNSA accelerating work on the B61 bomb to meet production deadlines. The FY2013 request for the B61 LEP was $369.0 million. The FY2013 request for the B61 LEP was $369.0 million, with concerns raised about inefficient spending. The House Appropriations Committee recommended the amount requested, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction in funds by $30 million and stressed the need for a validated cost, schedule, and scope baseline for the program. The FY2013 request for Stockpile Systems was $590.4 million, a 20% increase over FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $454.2 million for the program, with specific allocations for surveillance and the W78 Stockpile Systems. Additionally, funds were designated for studying the feasibility of a common W78/W88 warhead and a W88 program (\"Alt 370\"). The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding for Stockpile Systems, including the W78 LEP study and W88 Alt 370 program. There is a focus on reducing the stockpile to the lowest level consistent with national security, leading to the need for Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) to dismantle retired warheads and prevent storage issues. The FY2012 and FY2013 requests for Stockpile Services were fully funded, with commendations for completing dismantlements ahead of schedule. Stockpile Services are crucial for the production capability and capacity within the nuclear security enterprise. Stockpile Services play a vital role in base development, production, and logistics for LEPs and dismantlements. The FY2012 request was $928.6 million, with $64.0 million allocated for surveillance. The FY2013 request was $902.7 million, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending $838.5 million, including increases for Production Support and reductions for R&D Certification and Safety. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $892.7 million for annual assessments of the stockpile and investigating warhead problems. They expressed concern about recent increases in Production Support costs and directed NNSA to provide more information on these costs in future budget justifications. These efforts provide scientific knowledge and technical support for the nuclear weapons stockpile, with campaigns focusing on improving warhead performance assessment, readiness for nuclear tests, and maintaining scientific infrastructure. The FY2013 request for nuclear weapons laboratories included five campaigns, with a focus on developing scientific capabilities and infrastructure for assessing nuclear explosives. The request was $350.1 million, with an increase in funding for certain experiments and predictive science capabilities for national security assessments. The House Appropriations Committee recommended additional funding for certain experimental activities related to nuclear weapons assessments, while the Senate Appropriations Committee supported the requested amount. The Engineering Campaign aims to enhance the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. Funding for FY2012 and FY2013 was provided as requested, with a focus on modernizing surety options for Life Extension Programs (LEPs) and weapon changes. The House Appropriations Committee recommended additional funding for experimental activities related to nuclear weapons assessments, while the Senate Appropriations Committee supported the requested amount. The Engineering Campaign aims to enhance the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing, focusing on modernizing surety options for Life Extension Programs (LEPs) and weapon changes. Enhanced Surveillance funding was reduced by $2.6 million, with realigned funding for surety technologies. Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign is developing tools to create high temperatures and pressures for weapons-related research. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) conducts high-energy density physics experiments to validate theoretical models for stockpile stewardship without nuclear testing. NIF, the world's largest laser, achieved thermonuclear burn conditions in the laboratory. Despite initial controversy and technical issues, NIF has made significant progress since its dedication in 2009. In 2011, NIF personnel conducted successful target shots in support of High Energy Density Stockpile Stewardship. The facility received appropriations of $476.3 million in FY2012 and $460.0 million in FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the National Ignition Facility's (NIF) costs and recommended adding funds to mitigate any adverse impacts in FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported the requested amount and directed NNSA to use up to $140 million of Livermore's internal purchasing power to enhance the laboratory's readiness in technical base and facilities. The House Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funds for the National Ignition Facility (NIF) to enhance its readiness in technical base and facilities. They expressed concerns about NIF achieving ignition by FY2012 and directed NNSA to establish an advisory committee on this issue. The Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Campaign plays a crucial role in supporting various activities related to nuclear weapons. Some analysts question the reliability of simulation in providing the confidence needed for weapon behavior determination. Some analysts doubt the reliability of simulation for certifying warhead safety and advocate a return to testing. The FY2013 budget request was reduced to $600.0 million due to various factors, including completion of programs and lower funding for exascale computing. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding, with the Senate allocating $69.0 million for the exascale initiative. The FY2013 budget request for the Readiness Campaign was reduced to $600.0 million. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding, with the Senate allocating $69.0 million for the exascale initiative. The FY2012 request for the campaign was $142.5 million, with a final appropriation of $128.6 million. The FY2013 request was $130.1 million, with the House recommending $120.0 million. The program funds infrastructure and operations at Complex sites, with a final appropriation of $2,009.2 million for FY2012 and a request of $2,239.8 million for FY2013. Operations of Facilities is the largest subprogram under RTBF. The FY2013 budget for the Readiness Campaign was reduced to $600.0 million, with the Senate allocating $69.0 million for the exascale initiative. The Construction budget for FY2013 was $450.1 million, including new sustainment initiatives and addressing infrastructure deficiencies. Two new subprograms for FY2013 are Science, Technology, and Engineering Support ($166.9 million) and Nuclear Operations Capability Support ($203.3 million). The House Appropriations Committee recommended consolidating support activities for nuclear operations into a single subprogram, reallocating funding within different programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported the requested funding amount and directed NNSA to increase transparency in infrastructure maintenance and operations. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility is a controversial activity in the Weapons Activities account. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory, a controversial activity in the Weapons Activities account, has faced cost increases and criticism since 2005. Despite NNSA's request for funding, no construction activities were funded for CMRR in FY2012, and no funds were requested for FY2013. NNSA has determined that existing infrastructure can adequately support plutonium research, physics, and special nuclear materials, leading to a proposal to defer CMRR. NNSA proposes deferring CMRR Nuclear Facility construction for at least five years, opting to maximize use of existing facilities and relocate some nuclear materials. Estimated cost avoidance totals approximately $1.8 billion from FY 2013 to FY 2017. Meanwhile, the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) at the Y-12 National Security Complex will replace old facilities and conduct operations involving enriched uranium for nuclear weapons and naval reactors, as well as downblending of enriched uranium. The UPF budget increased from $160.2 million in FY2012 to $340.0 million requested for FY2013 to accelerate design and construction. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended the amount requested for nuclear nonproliferation efforts. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for CMRR-NF but proposed reallocating $65.0 million for improving the plutonium infrastructure at Los Alamos. This includes accelerating safety-related infrastructure improvements at the existing Los Alamos Plutonium Facility-4 and beginning characterization and cleanout of the PF-4 vault. Additionally, $5.0 million was recommended for the replacement of certain piping at the Device Assembly Facility. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5.0 million for replacing piping at the Device Assembly Facility (DAF) to provide additional storage options for plutonium. They also suggested using $35.0 million to accelerate cleanout of the PF-4 vault and expressed concern about NNSA's lack of alternative plutonium strategy. Weapons Activities includes smaller programs like Secure Transportation Asset for safe transport of nuclear weapons, Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response for responding to nuclear incidents worldwide. Funding for these programs decreased in FY2013 due to deferred production of special vehicles and completion of fleet upgrades. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended the requested amounts. The FY2012 appropriation was $222.1 million, with a FY2013 request of $247.6 million. The increase was for support in responding to nuclear emergencies, non-stockpile nuclear weapons assessments, and developing tools for nuclear threat devices. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $225.4 million, linking activities of the Office of Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation with Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount but expressed concerns about NNSA's strategy alignment with mission goals and funding requirements. The Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program (FIRP) focuses on restoring and revitalizing the physical infrastructure of the nuclear security enterprise by eliminating legacy deferred maintenance. The FY2012 appropriation was $96.4 million, with no funds requested for FY2013 due to program completion. The Capability-Based Facilities and Infrastructure program will continue some of FIRP's work, ensuring infrastructure is in place to execute program workload. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for FIRP but emphasized the importance of maintenance and repair of facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for FIRP but emphasized the importance of reducing deferred maintenance on aging infrastructure within RTBF. Site Stewardship aims to ensure environmental compliance and operational efficiency in the nuclear security enterprise, with a FY2013 request of $90.0 million. Notable increases were seen in Energy Modernization and Investment Program and Corporate Project Management, while a decrease in Nuclear Materials Integration was due to the completion of certain material removal projects. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $79.6 million for nuclear materials removal and radioactive waste disposal at Livermore. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $88.2 million for Energy Modernization and Investment Program, urging NNSA to report on cost savings. Safeguards and Security funding includes Defense Nuclear Security for protection against various threats, with a decrease in FY2013 budget from $698.0 million to $643.3 million. The FY2013 budget for Safeguards and Security funding decreased from $698.0 million to $643.3 million due to removal of nuclear materials at Livermore. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $663.3 million, expressing concerns about proposed reductions in protective forces. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported the requested amount, acknowledging NNSA's cost-saving efforts. Cyber Security also plays a crucial role in providing guidance for security measures. Cyber Security is crucial for ensuring information security in the NNSA enterprise. The FY2013 budget includes $155.0 million for NNSA CIO Activities, with $111.0 million allocated for cyber security. This program aims to consolidate cyber security and information technology programs, including enterprise secure computing and federal unclassified information technology. The latter will support a shift to a cloud-provisioned virtualized desktop-based solution to enhance collaboration, save costs, aid recruiting, and improve efficiency. The House Appropriations Committee recommended renaming NNSA CIO Activities to Information Technology and Security, adding $5.0 million for Technology Application Development. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested funds. Legacy contractor pensions at Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories were affected by the shift from UC to a consortium of contractors. The UC-Los Alamos and UC-Livermore contracts led to legacy costs for the UC pension plan, with a final appropriation of $168.2 million for FY2012. The FY2013 request for this item was $185.0 million, determined by actuarial valuation. An additional $62.0 million was requested for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding for these purposes. NNSA's National Security Applications program focuses on strategic investments. The National Security Applications program, funded at $10.0 million in FY2012 and requested for $18.2 million in FY2013, focuses on strategic investments in national security science and technology. The program includes R&D on detecting highly enriched uranium (HEU) and HEU-based nuclear weapons. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funds for nonproliferation-related activities, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $10.0 million for the program. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) supports U.S. efforts to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation worldwide. Funding for nonproliferation and national security programs was $2,295.9 million in FY2012 and $2,458.6 million in FY2013. The Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program received $354.2 million in FY2012 and requested $548.2 million for FY2013, including a $150 million initiative for domestic uranium enrichment RD&D. The House bill proposed $528.2 million, while the Senate recommended $418.2 million without funding for uranium enrichment. The Senate recommended transferring $150 million from NNSA to fund uranium enrichment in the R&D program. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 added $100 million for this initiative, bringing the total nonproliferation funding above FY2012 levels. The FY2013 request for nonproliferation programs was $150.1 million, with the House recommending $134.5 million and the Senate supporting the requested amount. International Materials Protection and Control focuses on securing Russian weapons. The International Materials Protection and Control (IMP&C) program, aimed at reducing the threat of unsecured Russian weapons, was funded at $569.9 million in FY2012 and requested $311.0 million for FY2013. The decrease in funding was due to the completion of major programs, including the installation of detection equipment in 45 sites. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $368.0 million for IMP&C, objecting to the proposed reduction in Second Line of Defense Activities. The Fissile Materials Disposition (FMD) program focuses on disposing of surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. The U.S. Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to dispose of surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. The program received $701.9 million in funding for FY2010, with plans to collaborate with Russia on a credible disposal program. Construction projects at Savannah River, SC include a facility for MOX reactor fuel fabrication, a pit disassembly and conversion facility, and a waste solidification facility. Controversy arose over the pit disassembly project. The FY2012 request for the Fissile Materials Disposition program was $892.2 million, but the final bill appropriated $685.4 million with no funding for the pit disassembly project due to incomplete studies. The FY2013 request was $921.3 million, with no funding for the pit disassembly facility as existing facilities would be used. The waste solidification facility was completed with no further funding requested. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $764.7 million for the program, fully funding the MOX facility construction but delaying funding for the MOX facility. The Senate bill fully funded ongoing construction of the MOX facility but delays early startup options until costs are better known. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative aims to convert research reactors to non-enriched uranium, dispose of excess nuclear materials, and protect against theft. FY2012 appropriation was $498.0 million, FY2013 request was $466.0 million, House recommended $482.7 million, Senate recommended $539.0 million. Nuclear weapons production has left a legacy of waste and contamination. The Office of Environmental Management was established by the DOE in 1989 to clean up former nuclear weapons production facilities and civilian nuclear energy research sites. Cleanup efforts involve disposing of radioactive and hazardous wastes, managing surplus nuclear materials, remediating soil and groundwater contamination, decontaminating buildings, and safeguarding facilities. The Office of Environmental Management was established by the DOE in 1989 to clean up former nuclear weapons production facilities and civilian nuclear energy research sites. Efforts to clean up the environmental legacy of nuclear weapons production and nuclear energy research represent the largest environmental liability of the United States, exceeding the cleanup liability of Department of Defense facilities. Annual appropriations of several billion dollars are needed for ongoing cleanup efforts at these facilities, raising concerns about the long-term financial liability of the United States. DOE has identified over 100 facilities in 30 locations requiring cleanup. The DOE has identified over 100 facilities in 30 states involved in nuclear weapons production and energy research. Cleanup remedies are in place for most sites, with long-term stewardship managed by the Office of Legacy Management. Some smaller sites were transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers for cleanup under FUSRAP. The DOE has identified numerous facilities involved in nuclear weapons production and energy research across 30 states. Cleanup of these sites is funded by the Corps and once completed, transferred back to DOE for long-term stewardship. The Office of Environmental Management administers 17 facilities in 11 states where cleanup is ongoing, with billions of dollars needed for completion. Hanford site in Washington has the longest cleanup timeframe. The DOE estimates that cleanup of 17 facilities across 11 states could cost between $174 billion and $209 billion, with the Hanford site in Washington having the lengthiest cleanup timeframe possibly extending to 2062. The estimates are subject to change as project baselines and assumptions evolve, with uncertainties in cleanup processes and waste disposal methods impacting costs and time frames. The Office of Environmental Management is funded by three appropriations accounts: Defense Environmental Cleanup, Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup, and the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund. Long-term stewardship costs and uncertainties are not included in cleanup estimates, especially for sites with radioactive waste containment. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund finances cleanup of facilities for national defense and civilian purposes. The Senate recommended $5.74 billion for FY2013, the House recommended $5.54 billion, and Congress enacted $5.71 billion for FY2012. The President requested $5.65 billion, but neither the House nor Senate included the $463 million for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. The President has proposed to resume federal payments for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, contingent upon reauthorization legislation. Table 14 compares FY2013 appropriations for DOE's Office of Environmental Management. The FY2012 enacted amounts for DOE's Office of Environmental Management reflect a $21.2 million contractor pay freeze rescission. The table shows the total program funding level for the three accounts combined, including offsets like prior year balances and federal payments to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. Funding adequacy for compliance with cleanup milestones is a recurring issue in the appropriations debate. Cleanup milestones are used to measure progress at facilities and establish time frames for specific actions. They are legally binding agreements between DOE, EPA, and states, overseen by EPA and states. Meeting deadlines depends on funding availability, technical feasibility, and regulatory issues. The availability of funds is not the sole factor determining DOE's ability to meet cleanup deadlines. The President's FY2013 budget request for the Office of Environmental Management aimed to complete all cleanup milestones within the fiscal year, but the House Appropriations Committee noted challenges in funding availability and realistic schedules in compliance agreements. The committee supports DOE updating estimates for cleanup completion to negotiate a clear path forward at sites where schedules may not be met. Compliance agreements are binding, and revisions are necessary to avoid violations. DOE has revised agreements in the past due to challenges at nuclear weapons facilities. High-level radioactive wastes are to be disposed of in a geologic repository. The availability of a geologic repository for permanent disposal of high-level tank wastes presents challenges that may delay cleanup and affect costs. DOE facilities storing these wastes include Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Laboratory. The Department of Energy (DOE) reports that there are 88 million gallons of high-level wastes stored in tanks at Hanford, Savannah River site, and Idaho National Laboratory. Construction of facilities to process and treat these wastes for permanent disposal is a significant cost driver, with an estimated cost of $14.2 billion. Additional funding and time will be needed to remove and stabilize the wastes for disposal. The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that cleanup of Hanford, Savannah River site, and Idaho National Laboratory will continue for decades due to challenges in stabilizing high-level wastes. Cleanup at Hanford may last until 2062, Savannah River site until 2040, and Idaho National Laboratory until 2044. Long-term stewardship will further extend federal responsibilities at these sites. Funding for cleanup of DOE uranium enrichment facilities is a concern. Funding for the cleanup of DOE uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, KY; Piketon, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN has been a recurring issue in the appropriations debate. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to pay for cleanup costs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $425.5 million for FY2013, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $442.5 million, the same amount requested by the President. These amounts are less than the $472.2 million enacted for the previous year. The funding for cleanup of DOE uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, KY; Piketon, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN for FY2013 is lower than the previous year. The decrease is due to reduced funding for the Portsmouth facility, while funding for Oak Ridge and Paducah facilities would increase. No dedicated funding for reimbursement payments to licensees was included in the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the importance of cleanup for affected communities and the need for progress in remediation. Congress originally authorized financing for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. Congress originally authorized financing for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund to collect special assessments from nuclear utilities and federal payments for cleanup. The authority expired in 2007, leading to a lack of funding for reimbursement payments to licensees in FY2013. The federal payment to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund ceased in FY2012, with no funds provided in P.L. 112-74. The last payment of $33.6 million in FY2011 fulfilled the remaining balance of the required federal contribution as authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Reauthorizing the utility assessments and federal payment remains an ongoing issue. The Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund faces a shortfall in funding for cleanup of federal facilities. The Office of Management and Budget estimates $3.85 billion available for appropriation by Congress in FY2013, but DOE projects an $11.8 billion shortfall by FY2020. The President's FY2013 request includes a proposal to reauthorize appropriations and collection of nuclear utility assessments to increase resources in the Fund. The President's FY2013 request includes a proposal to reauthorize appropriations and collection of nuclear utility assessments to increase resources in the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for cleanup of federal facilities. OMB estimates reauthorization would generate $200 million in revenues in FY2013, with a $463 million request in the Defense Environmental Cleanup account. The debate involves nuclear utilities claiming they have fulfilled their cleanup liability, but funding estimates have changed since the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires DOE to pay for cleanup costs if the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund is depleted. There is a debate on whether nuclear utilities should share the remaining cleanup liability with the federal government. DOE has transferred excess federal uranium inventories to augment the fund for cleanup services. The President's FY2013 request includes a plan to transfer up to 1,750 metric tons of excess uranium in exchange for cleanup services by private parties. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern about the potential impact on uranium markets and reinstating nuclear utility assessments on industry and electricity consumers. The committee questioned the reliability of DOE's estimates for funding needs to complete cleanup at federal uranium enrichment facilities. Concerns were raised about the lack of oversight in transferring excess federal uranium inventories for cleanup services, with a focus on the Portsmouth facility over the Paducah facility. The committee directed DOE to outline potential impacts on the domestic uranium mining industry. The update of the excess federal uranium inventory management plan includes legislation to authorize re-enrichment of depleted uranium for sale, with proceeds going into the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for cleanup purposes. The quantity sold would be limited to minimize impact on domestic markets, and the proceeds would be mandatory funds available directly to DOE. The markup in the First Session on July 27, 2011, would subject the proceeds deposited into the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund to discretionary appropriations before being available for DOE cleanup activities. The Office of Legacy Management oversees long-term stewardship of facilities without a continuing mission, including sites transferred from DOE to the Army Corps of Engineers under the FUSRAP program. After the Corps completes cleanup, initial operation and maintenance are its responsibility for two years before transferring back to DOE's Office of Legacy Management. The Office also manages pensions and retirement benefits for former employees. The Office of Legacy Management oversees long-term stewardship of facilities without a continuing mission, including managing pensions and retirement benefits for former employees. The federal role in managing these pensions and benefits is due to the long-term nature of projects and length of employment at DOE facilities. The office is funded within DOE's Other Defense Activities account, with proposed funding of $173.9 million recommended by the House Appropriations Committee and $177.9 million recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee for FY2013. The Office of Legacy Management's budget request for FY2013 is $177.9 million, an increase from the prior year's budget authority of $181.6 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended using prior year unobligated balances to offset a $4 million decrease in new appropriations. Funding needs are expected to rise as more facilities are cleaned up and transferred to the office for long-term stewardship. The Office of Legacy Management's number of facilities will increase from 91 in FY2011 to 129 in FY2020. In FY2012, they took on stewardship of the Mound site in Ohio and management of records and pensions for the Yucca Mountain project. Estimating long-term funding needs is challenging due to lengthy time horizons involved, with actions needed for decades to maintain cleanup remedies and monitor contaminant levels. Stewardship may continue indefinitely at sites with radioactive waste containment. The United States faces challenges in estimating financial liability for long-term stewardship of sites contaminated from historic nuclear activities. The Department of Energy's Power Marketing Administrations were established to sell power generated by dams. Conservation and management of water resources are also important considerations. The Army Corps of Engineers manages water resources for various purposes, including irrigation and flood control. The Power Marketing Administrations sell power to municipal utilities and cooperatives at low rates. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request for PMAs was $85 million, the same as FY2012. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget continues a change enacted in FY2010 that reclassified receipts from the PMAs from mandatory to discretionary. This change offsets expenses for WAPA, SWPA, and SEPA. SWPA requests $11.8 million and WAPA requests $96.1 million in discretionary funding. SEPA's receipts are expected to cover all operating costs in FY2011. Additionally, $220,000 is requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding PMAs at the requested amount, excluding $23 million collections from Colorado River basins. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) operates under authority granted by various acts and receives no appropriations. It funds activities through borrowing authority with the Treasury, which was increased in FY2003. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) further increased BPA's borrowing authority. Additionally, ARRA provided borrowing authority for the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) for building new transmission lines. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $1.053 billion for FY2013, with major activities including safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended small changes from the budget request. NRC's budget request includes $264.8 million for new reactor activities, similar to the FY2012 level. Until 2007, no new commercial reactor construction applications had been submitted to NRC since the 1970s. However, volatile fossil fuel prices, carbon emission controls, and incentives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 led to applications for 30 new reactors. NRC issued licenses for four new reactors in Georgia and South Carolina in 2012. The FY2013 budget does not include funds for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, as the Obama Administration aims to cancel the project. The House Appropriations Committee directed NRC to resume consideration of the Yucca Mountain application with prior-year funds and cut $3.4 million for NRC's Waste Confidence Rulemaking. The FY2012 funding bill included a provision prohibiting the NRC chairman from terminating any program without a majority vote. NRC's FY2013 budget request includes $545.1 million for regulation of operating reactors. NRC's FY2013 budget request of $545.1 million includes activities such as reactor safety inspections, license renewals, and oversight of security exercises. The Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan led to increased concerns about U.S. nuclear power plant safety. NRC established a task force to review its regulatory system after the accident. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees, with exceptions for certain expenditures. The FY2013 request would result in a net appropriation of $128.5 million. The FY2013 budget request for NRC includes reactor safety inspections, license renewals, and oversight. The offsets in the request would result in a net appropriation of $128.5 million, nearly the same as the FY2012 enacted level."
