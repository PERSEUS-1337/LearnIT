    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"High-Performance Buildings Act of 2005\" and includes sustainable development in housing strategy. The \"High-Performance Buildings Act of 2005\" includes sustainable development in housing strategy by amending Section 105(b) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 to describe strategies for encouraging sustainable development for affordable housing, focusing on energy efficiency, resource conservation, infrastructure use, and other criteria determined by the Secretary. The \"High-Performance Buildings Act of 2005\" amends the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act to promote sustainable low-income community development capacity through a grant program. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may grant funds to nonprofit organizations for training, supporting, and advising eligible community development organizations in improving energy efficiency and resource conservation in low-income communities. This includes providing financial assistance for energy efficiency improvements and infrastructure use in affordable housing and economic development activities. Other purposes may be determined by the Secretary. Nonprofit organizations seeking grants must submit an application to the Secretary, including details on funding sources. The grant amount cannot exceed what the organization certifies it will provide from non-governmental sources. Definitions for \"nonprofit organization\" and \"eligible community development organization\" are provided in this section. The term \"eligible community development organization\" includes a unit of general local government, a community housing development organization, or a tribal government. A \"low-income community\" is defined as a census tract where 50% or more of households have an income less than 80% of the area median gross income. The Secretary is authorized to appropriate $10,000,000 annually from 2007 to 2011 to carry out this section, based on the median gross income of the state where the census tract is located. SEC. 4. SUSTAINABLE BUILDING INSTITUTE. The National Science Foundation Act of 1950 is amended to include a new section establishing the Sustainable Building Institute. The Sustainable Building Institute (referred to as the `Institute') is established within the Foundation. Its duties include conducting research on indoor environmental quality, human health, and energy efficiency technologies for buildings. This involves research, development, and application of technologies such as water heating systems, lighting systems, and building insulation. The Sustainable Building Institute will conduct research on indoor environmental quality, human health, and energy efficiency technologies for buildings, including water heating systems, lighting systems, and building insulation. The Institute will also focus on improving the cost effectiveness of fuel cells and reducing the installation costs of solar photovoltaic energy systems."
