    "content": "Agricultural conservation has evolved significantly since the 1981 farm bill, with the 2014 farm bill highlighting various policy issues. Prior to the 1985 farm bill, there were few conservation programs, but by 2014, there were over 20 programs with annual spending exceeding $5 billion, leading to confusion about their purpose and policies. Efforts were made to simplify or consolidate these programs. The 2014 farm bill included measures to consolidate conservation programs, repeal 12 programs, create 2 new ones, and merge 2 programs. Federal policies traditionally offer voluntary incentives for resource-conserving practices on private lands. The 1985 farm bill introduced conservation compliance with sodbuster and swampbuster provisions, which remain significant today. The 2014 farm bill added federal crop insurance subsidies to the list of program benefits that could be lost if a producer is out of compliance with conservation requirements on highly erodible land and wetlands. Land retirement programs like the Conservation Reserve Program were also discussed. Land retirement programs like the Conservation Reserve Program provide financial incentives for producers to temporarily remove environmentally sensitive land from production. Working lands programs, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, offer incentives for adopting resource-conserving practices while keeping land in production. Farm bill conservation policy has shifted towards working lands programs due to factors like high commodity prices and new technologies. This shift was evident in the 2014 farm bill, with a decrease in funding for land retirement programs in favor of working lands programs. Most conservation organizations support both land retirement and working lands programs, but debate the appropriate mix. Some prefer shorter-term land retirement programs like CRP, while others advocate for longer-term easement programs like wetland reserve easements under ACEP. Easement programs impose permanent land-use restrictions for government payments, seen as a cost-effective investment in sustainable ecosystems. Short-term land retirement programs offer increased flexibility for broader participation. Interest is growing in programs that partner with state and local entities. The 2014 farm bill replaced several partnership programs with the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), which allows local organizations to collaborate with USDA to address specific resource concerns. Partners must contribute a significant portion of the project's cost. The Conservation title accounts for 6% of the total farm bill spending, totaling $58 billion out of $956 billion in 10-year mandatory funding. Discussions on the farm bill were influenced by the need for conservation programs. The 2014 farm bill reduced Conservation funding by $3.97 billion over 10 years, driven by budget reduction needs. Sequestration had already been factored into the baseline, resulting in the official CBO score. Other budgetary dynamics may impact future farm bill conservation programs. Since the 1996 farm bill, mandatory funding for conservation programs has grown significantly, with current levels roughly five times higher than discretionary spending. Appropriators have placed limits on mandatory spending, known as CHIMPS, for conservation programs authorized in the farm bill. Reductions in conservation spending have been requested by both the Bush and Obama Administrations, with varying impacts on different programs. Conservation programs funding has remained around $5 billion annually for the past five years, with some programs like CRP unaffected by reductions while others like EQIP have been repeatedly cut. Concerns exist that future CHIMPS could deepen cuts from potential sequestration and the 2014 farm bill. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized, repealed, consolidated, and amended various conservation programs, categorized into working land, land retirement, easement, compliance, and other programs. Most conservation programs receive mandatory funding and have authorities expiring at the end of FY2018. Other types of programs have permanent authorities and receive annual appropriations through the discretionary process. The 2014 farm bill made amendments to some programs, with general programmatic changes discussed in the report. The Appendix provides tables comparing changes in the 2014 farm bill to prior law. The 2014 farm bill included program consolidation measures, repealing 12 programs and creating two new ones. Working lands conservation programs focus on private land production with conservation practices. Participants receive technical assistance and federal financial support for implementing practices. The 2014 farm bill consolidated programs, creating new ones like EQIP and CSP for working lands conservation. Other programs like WHIP and AWEP were repealed or incorporated. AMA program funding is split between crop insurance and conservation. Amendments to AMA were proposed but not adopted in the conference agreement. EQIP was reauthorized and amended with $8 billion allocated between FY2014 and FY2018 for financial and technical support. The EQIP program provides financial and technical assistance to producers and landowners for conservation practices on eligible lands, with a total funding of $8 billion between FY2014 and FY2018. Eligible producers enter into contracts to receive payment for implementing conservation practices, with funding levels increasing annually from $1.35 billion in FY2014 to $1.75 billion in FY2018. However, EQIP funding has been reduced in the annual appropriations process since 2003 and has never received its full authorized level of funding. The 2014 farm bill incorporated the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program (WHIP) into the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), focusing on improving wildlife habitat. WHIP was repealed, and EQIP now requires 5% of payments to benefit wildlife habitat. Additionally, 60% of EQIP payments must benefit livestock, and consulting with State Technical Committees annually is required to determine eligible wildlife habitat practices. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized and amended the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), providing financial and technical assistance to producers for conservation activities. Participants must meet stewardship thresholds for priority resource concerns and receive annual payments based on conservation performance. Enrollment is continuous, limited by acres available each fiscal year. The 2014 farm bill amended the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) by reorganizing the statutory language and focusing on generating additional conservation benefits. Participants now have to address priority resource concerns upon entry and meet specific requirements by the end of the contract. The entry bar for participants was raised, and there are flexible transition options for land coming out of CRP. The 10% limitation on nonindustrial private forest land was lifted, and enrollable acres were reduced. The 2014 farm bill reduced enrollable acres for the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) from 12.769 million to 10 million annually, resulting in $2.272 billion in savings over 10 years. The program faced reductions in FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013, slowing its growth. By the end of FY2013, 59 million acres were enrolled in CSP. Land retirement programs provide federal payments to landowners for temporary land use changes to achieve environmental benefits. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a federal land retirement program in the United States, spending over $2 billion annually to compensate landowners for removing land from agricultural production for soil and water quality improvement and wildlife habitat. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized CRP with a reduced enrollment cap of 24 million acres in FY2018, down from 32 million acres. Enrollment has declined from 36.8 million acres in FY2007 to 25.6 million acres in FY2013. The 2014 farm bill reduced the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) enrollment cap to 24 million acres in FY2018 from 32 million acres, down from its peak of 36.8 million acres in FY2007. The reduction in enrollment was driven by high commodity prices, low rental rates, and declining interest in retiring land from production. The bill allowed for emergency harvesting, grazing, and other activities without a reduction in rental rate, saving an estimated $3.3 billion over 10 years. Conservation and wildlife groups are concerned about the impact on critical species habitat and soil and water quality. The 2014 farm bill repealed the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) and incorporated grassland contracts into CRP. Participants can terminate CRP contracts early after five years. Conservation easement programs were replaced by the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP). The 2014 farm bill repealed the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) and incorporated grassland contracts into CRP. Conservation easement programs were replaced by the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), which provides permanent baseline funding. Funding became an issue when the 2008 farm bill was not reauthorized, leaving programs like WRP and GRP without baseline funding. The 2014 farm bill repealed the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) and incorporated grassland contracts into CRP. Conservation easement programs were replaced by the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), which provides permanent baseline funding. ACEP retains most of the program provisions in the repealed easement programs by establishing two types of easements: agricultural land easements and wetland reserve easements. Total funding for the three repealed programs was higher in the previous five years than the total authorized level for ACEP for the next five years. ACEP requires partnership agreements with eligible entities to purchase agricultural land easements, with priority given to expiring CRP acres. Agreements are with certified entities for a minimum of five years, with review every three years. Non-certified entities have agreements of three to five years. Easements allow production to continue while prohibiting nonagricultural uses. Funding is provided for easement purchases through eligible entities, with technical assistance for easement plans. The federal share of an agricultural land easement may not exceed 50% of the fair market value, with the nonfederal share provided by the eligible entity. Up to 50% of the nonfederal share can be a charitable donation from the landowner. Cost-share requirements may be waived for grasslands of special environmental significance, allowing the federal share to be up to 75%. Easements are permanent or for the maximum duration allowed by state law. Wetland reserve easements are used to restore wetlands through 30-year or permanent easements. The USDA offers landowners the opportunity to restore, protect, and enhance wetlands through 30-year contracts or permanent easements. Landowners must submit an offer based on conservation benefits and cost effectiveness. If selected, they agree to maintain the wetland according to an approved plan, receiving technical and financial assistance from USDA. Compensation is based on fair market value and the length of the easement. USDA can delegate management responsibilities to another authority. Comparisons between old and new program provisions are available. The 2014 farm bill consolidated various conservation programs into the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), which focuses on water quantity and quality concerns. RCPP includes activities from programs like AWEP, CCPI, CBWP, and GLBP to leverage federal funding for specific areas and resource concerns. The RCPP, AWEP, CCPI, CBWP, and GLBP are conservation programs that focus on specific areas and resource concerns. The GLBP, unlike the others, did not receive mandatory funding and was last funded in FY2010. RCPP uses 7% of available conservation program funds and $100 million annually in mandatory funding to address natural resource concerns in selected project areas through partnership agreements. Partners in the RCPP must contribute a significant portion of project costs, leveraging federal funding with their own. Funds are directed through critical conservation areas selected by USDA. Producers in these areas are eligible for RCPP contracts and can choose to work with partners or directly with USDA. RCPP contracts follow existing program rules (EQIP, CSP, ACEP, HFRP) and alternative funding arrangements are allowed. The Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) program, a sub-program of EQIP, aims to stimulate innovative conservation approaches and technology transfer in environmental protection, agriculture, and forest management. It was reauthorized in the 2014 farm bill through FY2018 with unspecified funding levels. The program supports producers in implementing practices for air quality improvement through CIG payments. The 2014 farm bill reduced the annual funding for the air quality component of the Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) program from $37.5 million to $25 million. A reporting requirement was added to submit a report to Congress every two years on CIG funding, project results, and technology transfer efforts. The 1985 farm bill included conservation provisions like highly erodible land conservation and wetland conservation, collectively known as conservation compliance. The 2014 farm bill added federal crop insurance premium subsidies to conservation compliance requirements, which include maintaining conservation on highly erodible land and not converting wetlands to crop production. Compliance violations and loss of subsidies are now addressed separately. The highly erodible land conservation provision applies to newly broken land and any highly erodible land in production after 1990. The 2014 farm bill added federal crop insurance premium subsidies to conservation compliance requirements, including maintaining conservation on highly erodible land and not converting wetlands to crop production. Land meeting this classification is eligible for USDA program benefits with an approved conservation plan. Producers risk losing benefits if found out of compliance with the sodbuster provision, which now includes federal crop insurance premium subsidies. The 2014 farm bill added federal crop insurance premium subsidies to conservation compliance requirements, including maintaining conservation on highly erodible land and not converting wetlands to crop production. Producers risk losing benefits if found out of compliance with the sodbuster provision, which now includes federal crop insurance premium subsidies. Producers with compliance violations have a limited time to develop and comply with a conservation plan before losing the subsidies. The \"swampbuster\" provision extends the sodbuster concept to wetland areas. The 2014 farm bill added federal crop insurance premium subsidies to conservation compliance requirements, including maintaining conservation on highly erodible land and not converting wetlands to crop production. Producers risk losing benefits if found out of compliance with the wetlands compliance provision, which includes activities like draining, dredging, filling, or leveling wetlands to make agricultural commodity production possible. The provision also includes exemptions and amendments to extend the list of compliance violators, allowing additional time for producers to remedy violations. The 2014 farm bill added federal crop insurance premium subsidies to conservation compliance requirements, including maintaining conservation on highly erodible land and not converting wetlands to crop production. Producers risk losing benefits if found out of compliance with the wetlands provision, with options for violators to remedy violations before losing subsidies. Producers must self-certify compliance with sodbuster and swampbuster provisions, with USDA responsible for reviewing certifications in a timely manner. Non-compliant producers must contribute to a wetland restoration fund, not exceeding the subsidy amount. USDA retains sole responsibility for implementing conservation compliance provisions, with options for violators to mitigate violations through wetland restoration, enhancement, or creation. The 2014 farm bill included federal crop insurance premium subsidies for conservation compliance, which prohibits converting wetlands to crop production. Producers must self-certify compliance with sodbuster and swampbuster provisions, with USDA reviewing certifications. Non-compliant producers may have to contribute to a wetland restoration fund. The debate over wetland mitigation requirements focused on the acreage ratio, with the House bill limiting it to 1-to-1 and the Senate bill calling for a study on mitigation impacts. The final agreement provided $10 million for mitigation banking efforts. The 2014 farm bill included provisions for wetland mitigation banking efforts, with a focus on the acreage ratio not exceeding 1-to-1. The bill also expanded the sodsaver provision under the Crop Insurance title, but ultimately no governors opted to participate in the program. The 2014 farm bill amended and expanded the sodsaver provision, which now applies to native sod in six states without an opt-in requirement. Crop insurance premium subsidies will be reduced by 50 percentage points for production on native sod during the first four years of planting, with reduced benefits under NAP. The bill clarified that native sod may include untilled land, affecting crop yield guarantees for insurance policies. The 2014 farm bill introduced the concept of \"transition yield\" (T-yield) for determining crop yield when actual production history (APH) data is unavailable. The T-yield is based on a percentage of the 10-year average county yields for the crop, with a lower factor for production on native sod. Yield substitution is not allowed, meaning low farm yields must be used in the APH instead of potentially higher T-yields. This change aims to reduce the incentive to produce on native sod. The bill also includes tables related to Title II of the Agricultural Act of 2014. The 2014 farm bill introduced the concept of \"transition yield\" (T-yield) for determining crop yield when actual production history (APH) data is unavailable. Funding for most Title II programs is covered in the \"Funding and Administration\" subtitle."
