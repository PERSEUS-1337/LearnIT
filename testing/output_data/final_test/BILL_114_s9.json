The Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2016 amends Section 520 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to regulate over-the-counter hearing aids for adults with mild to moderate hearing impairment. The Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2016 allows for over-the-counter hearing aids to compensate for mild to moderate hearing impairment. These aids include tools for user control and customization, may use wireless technology, and can be obtained without a prescription. The Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2016 allows for over-the-counter hearing aids to compensate for mild to moderate hearing impairment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to establish regulations for a category of over-the-counter hearing aids within 3 years of the Act's enactment. The Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2016 mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue final regulations for over-the-counter hearing aids. The regulations must include safety and efficacy requirements, allowing the sale of these aids without the supervision of a licensed person. The Secretary will also make premarket notifications to determine the aids' compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2016 requires final regulations for over-the-counter hearing aids to ensure safety and efficacy. State and local governments are prohibited from imposing additional regulations on the manufacturing and sale of these aids. The Secretary shall not use the draft guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services for premarket review under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act until new final guidance is issued. The draft guidance titled \"Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Regulatory Requirements for Hearing Aid Devices and Personal Sound Amplification Products\" issued on February 25, 2009, will be in effect until new final regulations are issued. The Secretary will update this guidance to clarify which products meet the definition of a device or a personal sound amplification product based on their marketing claims or labeling material."
