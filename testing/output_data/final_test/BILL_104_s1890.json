    "content": "The Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 may be cited as the official title of this Act. The Congress finds that arson and vandalism of places of religious worship, especially those serving African-American congregations, pose a serious national problem. Damage to religious property based on religious, racial, or ethnic characteristics hinders interstate commerce by impeding the movement of targeted groups and preventing them from engaging in commerce. Changes in Federal law are necessary to address the serious and widespread problem of arson and vandalism targeting places of religious worship, especially those serving African-American congregations. This destructive behavior disrupts communities, hinders interstate commerce, and is often tied to groups operating nationwide. Local responses have been insufficient, warranting Federal intervention. Congress has the authority to make acts of destruction or damage to religious property a violation of Federal law under the Commerce clause and the 13th amendment. This includes arson or vandalism of places of religious worship, especially those serving African-American congregations. Congress has the authority under the 14th amendment to criminalize violent interference with a citizen's religious worship by damaging religious property. Prohibition of violent interference with religious worship is mandated by the 14th amendment, allowing for criminalization of damaging religious property. Section 247 of title 18 of the United States Code is amended to include protections against religious, racial, or ethnic interference. The circumstances for criminalization include offenses affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or involving travel or use of interstate or foreign commerce facilities. The amendment to Section 247 of title 18 of the United States Code criminalizes intentional defacement, damage, or destruction of religious property based on race, color, or ethnic characteristics. Penalties are specified in subsection (d) and (f) of the section. The amendment to Section 247 of title 18 of the United States Code criminalizes intentional defacement, damage, or destruction of religious property based on race, color, or ethnic characteristics. A new subsection is added stating that no person shall be prosecuted for a noncapital offense under this section unless within 7 years of the offense being committed. SEC. 4. LOAN GUARANTEE RECOVERY FUND. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may use up to $5,000,000 for guaranteed loans to assist organizations affected by arson or terrorism. The loan guarantee program will be administered by the Federal Housing Administration. Amounts for guarantees may be transferred as needed. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development can use up to $5,000,000 for guaranteed loans to help organizations impacted by arson or terrorism. The loan guarantee program will be managed by the Federal Housing Administration, with funds available for total loan principal not exceeding $10,000,000. The Secretary will establish terms and conditions for providing guarantees to financial institutions. The decision to provide a guarantee to a financial institution is independent of the purpose or identity of the organization receiving the loan. Authorization for additional personnel to assist state and local law enforcement by increasing personnel, investigators, and technical support to investigate, prevent, and respond to potential violations of specific laws directed towards religious real property. These personnel will also train and empower State and local law enforcement in the investigation and prevention of suspicious fires. SEC. 6 of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act is amended to remove specific years for reporting hate crimes statistics, making it applicable for each calendar year. SEC. 7 expresses the Senate's sentiment. SEC. 7 of the bill commends those who have provided funds for rebuilding places of worship affected by arson and encourages continued support from the private sector. SEC. 8 ensures that if any part of the Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest remains unaffected."
