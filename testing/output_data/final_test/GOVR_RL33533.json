    "content": "The kingdom of Saudi Arabia's relations with the United States, stability, and future trajectory are of congressional interest. Leadership transitions, global oil prices, budget pressures, terrorist threats, foreign policies, and tensions with Iran have fueled recent discussions. U.S.-Saudi security cooperation and energy supplies remain key in bilateral relations. The Trump Administration's efforts to strengthen ties have sparked debate, following differences with the Obama Administration on Iran and conflicts in the region. Since 2017, US-Saudi ties have been defined by arms sales, security cooperation in Yemen, and shared concerns about Iran, Al Qaeda, and ISIS. Proposed defense sales to Saudi Arabia under the Obama Administration totaled over $45 billion from 2012 to 2016. President Trump and Saudi officials agreed on a package potentially worth over $110 billion in 2017, addressing Saudi needs for security improvements, air force training, cybersecurity upgrades, missile defenses, and counterterrorism measures. King Salman bin Abd al Aziz Al Saud succeeded King Abdullah bin Abd al Aziz in 2015, making significant changes to succession arrangements. He appointed Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as Crown Prince and Prince Mohammed bin Salman as Deputy Crown Prince and Defense Minister. In 2017, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was replaced by Prince Mohammed bin Salman as Crown Prince. Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, age 33, has consolidated authority in Saudi Arabia, succeeding his father King Salman. He has taken on a prominent role in shaping national security and economic policies, leading to a more assertive foreign policy, including military operations in Yemen and countering Iranian initiatives. Saudi leaders launched military operations in Yemen in 2015 to reverse Houthi gains and compel them to negotiate with U.N.-recognized leaders. Concerns about civilian deaths, humanitarian conditions, and gains by extremist groups have led to calls for a prompt settlement. President Obama reduced U.S. personnel support in 2016 but maintained logistical assistance for Saudi operations in Yemen. In 2015, Saudi leaders launched military operations in Yemen to reverse Houthi gains. President Obama reduced U.S. personnel support in 2016 but maintained logistical assistance for Saudi operations. President Trump proceeded with precision guided munition technology sales in Yemen, drawing attention to congressionally reviewed arms sales. U.S. State Department issued a travel advisory warning about rebel groups targeting Saudi Arabia with long-range missiles and artillery. Congress scrutinized proposed arms sales in the 114th Congress. In the 115th Congress, legislation was enacted to prohibit the use of U.S. funds for in-flight refueling operations of Saudi and Saudi-led coalition aircraft under certain conditions. This provision is subject to an Administration national security waiver. Additionally, a measure was introduced to place conditions on the transfer of air-to-ground munitions to Saudi Arabia. In the 115th Congress, legislation was enacted to prohibit the use of U.S. funds for in-flight refueling operations of Saudi and Saudi-led coalition aircraft under certain conditions. This provision is subject to an Administration national security waiver. Additionally, resolutions have been considered to end U.S. military support for Saudi operations in Yemen unless specifically authorized by Congress. Arrests of Islamic State supporters have continued in Saudi Arabia since 2014, with reported disrupted attacks on government targets in 2017 and 34 terrorist attacks in 2016. Since 2011, there have been significant political and economic changes in the Middle East, leading to increased focus on Saudi domestic policy issues and sparking social and political debates among Saudis. The U.S. State Department travel advisory for Saudi Arabia warns of ongoing terrorist threats, with groups plotting possible attacks and the potential for attacks with little warning. Ongoing economic, social, and political changes in Saudi Arabia may bring sensitive issues like political reform, unemployment, education, human rights, corruption, religious freedom, and extremism to the forefront of U.S.-Saudi relations. Recent joint diplomatic efforts aim to strengthen ties through economic and educational initiatives, particularly focusing on the kingdom's youth. Some observers suggest reevaluating the relationship due to concerns about human rights and the kingdom's military campaign in Yemen. U.S. officials express concerns about human rights conditions in Saudi Arabia and the relationship between religious proselytization and violent extremism. Saudi leaders have shown displeasure with U.S. policies in the Middle East, particularly regarding Egypt, Israel, Bahrain, Iraq, Syria, and Iran. Saudi officials also opposed changes to U.S. sovereign immunity laws. Saudi officials opposed changes to U.S. sovereign immunity laws made by the 114th Congress. They initially had a neutral response to the JCPOA nuclear agreement with Iran but eventually endorsed it. However, King Salman later called for the agreement to be reexamined and welcomed President Trump's decision to withdraw from it. Saudi officials have been in talks for civil nuclear cooperation with the United States and other countries since 2017. The Trump Administration and Saudi officials prioritize continuity in their strategic partnership for regional security and global stability. A new Strategic Partnership was announced in 2017, reflecting the importance of the U.S.-Saudi security relationship amidst leadership changes in Saudi Arabia and ongoing turmoil in the Middle East. The Trump Administration has partnered with Saudi Arabia on various policy initiatives in the Middle East region. The success or failure of these initiatives could impact the bilateral relationship and international security. Saudi Arabia is a monarchy governed by the Hanbali school of Sunni Islamic law, with limited oversight from a national Shura Council and municipal councils. In Saudi Arabia, political decision-making has shifted towards centralization under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with the approval of the king. The conservative Salafist Sunni religious establishment has influenced government decisions, with some members supporting rapid social policy changes. Efforts to combat corruption among elites may also be consolidating power under the Crown Prince. The centralization of power under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia has led to rumored discontent among other royal family members. Efforts to manage demands for economic opportunities and limited political participation from the young population are balanced with the kingdom's conservative Islamic traditions and security threats. Security forces tightly control political and social activism in the country. Relations between the Shia minority population and the government in Saudi Arabia remain tense due to anti-Shia terrorism, official discrimination, and concerns about Iranian influence. The country experienced significant fiscal surpluses from 2005 to 2014, leading to sizeable foreign reserves and low levels of official debt. After 2011, the government initiated social spending programs to improve housing. After 2011, Saudi Arabia launched social spending programs to improve housing and infrastructure, raise public sector wages, and ease unemployment burdens. This spending increased fiscal burdens as state oil revenues declined. Currently, Saudi leaders are managing fiscal consolidation and economic transformation initiatives amidst complex questions about political consent, economic performance, and social reform. Power is transitioning from the sons to the grandsons of King Abd al Aziz bin Abd al Rahman al Saud. The monarchy's leaders must successfully navigate relationships with each other and competing domestic interest groups. The Al Saud family's management of leadership transitions and succession decisions is crucial for Saudi Arabia's future stability and regional security. The Allegiance Council, composed of senior family members, has endorsed recent succession changes, including those following King Abdullah's death in 2015. King Salman has played a key role in these decisions. In 2015 and June 2017, King Salman made succession changes in the Al Saud family, elevating Prince Mohammed bin Nayef and Prince Mohammed bin Salman. This new generation faces uncertainty in governance and succession due to complex family ties and potential competition for influence. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef became Crown Prince and retained his role as Minister of Interior, while Prince Mohammed bin Salman assumed leadership in political and security affairs. In June 2017, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was replaced as Crown Prince by Mohammed bin Salman, who became next in line for the throne. The kingdom's Basic Law was amended to prevent successors from the same maternal line, possibly to address concerns about power consolidation. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is taking on a prominent national leadership role, sparking international speculation about potential rivalry within the royal family. Concerns have been raised about his decision to detain and investigate some family members on corruption charges. The family's intrafamily dynamics have historically been shielded from public view, but tensions may be escalating. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has detained and investigated royal family members on corruption charges, removing Prince Miteb bin Abdullah from his position. This marks a shift from the consensus-based approach among senior royal family members. The Crown Prince is leading economic transformation initiatives and restructuring government bodies as part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 plan to reduce oil dependence. Authorities in Saudi Arabia are implementing fiscal measures to reshape the economy and reduce dependence on oil revenue. The IMF has praised the reform goals outlined in Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Plan, emphasizing the need for structural reforms to promote private sector growth and enhance employment opportunities. Policymakers face challenges in balancing reforms with concerns for security, social stability, and cultural values. IMF officials suggest a more gradual implementation of changes to allow for smoother transitions. The IMF has commended Saudi Arabia's progress in implementing fiscal reforms to balance the budget by 2023. The kingdom's fiscal position shifted from surpluses to deficits due to lower oil prices and increased spending on domestic needs. The IMF advises gradual implementation of changes to allow for smoother transitions. Saudi Arabia implemented initiatives to meet economic and social demands from 2011 to 2015, with record-high budgets and increased financial support for citizens. As oil prices dropped from 2014 to 2017, the kingdom resorted to borrowing, deficit spending, and reduced oil production. Over this period, more than $235 billion was drawn from state reserves, and national debt rose from 5.8% to 17.2% of GDP. Higher oil prices since mid-2017 have eased fiscal burdens, but the IMF recommends continued fiscal discipline and planning for various oil revenue scenarios. Saudi Arabia has implemented economic reforms to address the impact of fluctuating oil prices. The IMF advises maintaining fiscal discipline and planning for different revenue scenarios. The government is focusing on stimulating the economy through private sector growth, reducing subsidies, implementing a value-added tax system, and restructuring economic ministries. Previous cuts to public sector salaries were reversed in 2017 due to improved fiscal performance. According to the U.S. State Department's 2017 report on human rights in Saudi Arabia, the government strictly limits freedoms such as assembly, expression, religion, and the press. Saudi Arabia remains an absolute monarchy with no elections, political parties, or opposition groups allowed. The Specialized Criminal Court handles terrorism cases, including those related to political activity and public expression. The government's Human Rights Commission monitors human rights conditions and addresses complaints of violations. Saudi authorities monitor human rights conditions, field complaints, refer violations for investigation, and engage with foreign entities on human rights issues. While some social and entertainment activities have been allowed, restrictions have increased for groups advocating political change. Individuals criticizing the government on social media have been arrested, and plans to prosecute cybercrime offenders have been announced. King Salman has followed King Abdullah in tightening restrictions. King Salman has redefined the powers of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (CPVPV), limiting their arrest powers and requiring personnel to meet educational standards. The CPVPV, known as the \"religious police,\" continues to operate in cooperation with security forces, but its role in society is now less visible and subject to debate. Periodic incidents involving CPVPV personnel and the government's embrace of entertainment and social gatherings shape ongoing discussions. Critics highlight Saudi authorities' periodic detention of individuals associated with protests or advocacy campaigns, including women's rights activists. Since 2016, detentions are often justified by concerns about activists' foreign relations. Saudi officials reject international calls for action on human rights cases. In recent years, Saudi Arabia has faced international scrutiny for arrests and public punishments of human rights advocates, including prominent activists like Mohammed al Qahtani, Abdullah al Hamid, and blogger Raif Badawi. International calls for action on human rights cases have been rejected by Saudi officials, who view them as attempts to undermine the kingdom's sovereignty and judicial procedures. The Badawi family, including Raif and Samar, have faced persecution in Saudi Arabia due to their human rights advocacy. This has strained Saudi Arabia's relationships with Canada and some European countries. In response to calls for their release, Saudi Arabia expelled Canadian diplomats, recalled its own ambassador, and suspended investments and student programs. The Saudi government criticized these actions as interference in its domestic affairs. The Saudi government criticized Canada for interference in its domestic affairs, prompting the U.S. State Department to call for a diplomatic resolution. Several religious figures critical of the government have been detained, including Salman al Awda and Safar al Hawali. Several prominent Saudi religious figures critical of the government, including Safar al Hawali and Ali al Omari, are facing potential death penalty for their ties to the International Union of Muslim Scholars, labeled a terrorist organization by Saudi Arabia due to its connections with Qatar. The detainees have significant global media presence and social media followings, which could lead to public backlash. Women's rights issues in Saudi Arabia, such as travel and employment restrictions, continue to be debated domestically and internationally. The 2017 U.S. State Department report highlighted significant discrimination against women in Saudi Arabia, with restrictions on travel and employment, and male guardianship rules limiting women's autonomy. Despite gender discrimination, women have slowly increased participation in political life, with the late King Abdullah granting women the right to vote and stand as candidates in municipal council elections. The 2015 elections saw the inclusion of 30 women in the Shura Council and expanded elected membership. In 2015, Saudi Arabia allowed women to vote and run for office, with female candidates winning seats. King Salman ordered a review of guardianship rules restricting women's access to services, leading to changes. Women's right to drive was recognized in 2018, signaling limited political and social reforms. Despite progress, some prominent women have been detained. Saudi authorities have detained some prominent female proponents, alleging inappropriate ties to foreign entities. Shia Muslim minority communities in Saudi Arabia have historically faced discrimination and violence, with recent terrorist attacks and unrest in the Eastern Province creating strains on stability. Authorities are pursuing young Shia individuals connected to ongoing protests and clashes with security forces. In the Eastern Province, clashes escalated after the 2016 execution of Shia cleric Nimr al Nimr, leading to arson and shooting attacks targeting Shia-populated areas. Saudi courts have imposed harsh penalties on Shia protestors and activists, citing incitement to treason. Anti-Shia terrorist attacks and perceptions of discrimination by some Saudi Shia further fuel tensions. In May 2017, Saudi security forces clashed with armed individuals in Nimr's village of Al Awamiya, resulting in the death of a Saudi soldier. Explosions and gunfire have continued to pose risks to security officers in the region since mid-2017. The destruction of parts of Al Awamiya in August 2017 led to ongoing government reconstruction efforts. U.S. travel advisories caution against visiting the Eastern Province due to tensions and potential violence. Saudi Arabia considers Al Qaeda, ISIS, and other extremist groups as threats to national security. The U.S. government views Saudi Arabia as a key ally in regional security and counterterrorism efforts. The Saudi government is seen as a strong partner in regional security and counterterrorism efforts. They have taken increased action since 2014 to prevent Saudis from supporting extremist groups. In 2016, the Saudi Ministry of Interior reported 2,093 Saudis fighting with terrorist organizations, with a majority in Syria. The Islamic State and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are considered ongoing terrorist threats to the kingdom. The aggressive expansion of the Islamic State in neighboring countries and attacks inside Saudi Arabia have raised concerns. In January 2016, the Saudi government executed dozens of convicted AQAP suspects, including prominent ideologues. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri condemned Saudi Arabia and called for revenge after the government executed dozens of convicted AQAP suspects. Concerns have been raised about the strengthening of AQAP during the conflict in Yemen, leading Saudi officials to seek stronger partnerships with the United States and regional allies to counter terrorist threats and Iranian influence in Yemen. Saudi leaders have also announced plans to contribute to stabilization efforts in Syria and engage with Iraqi leaders in line with U.S. preferences. Since 2014, IS supporters have claimed responsibility for attacks in Saudi Arabia, including on security officers and Shia civilians. Attacks have been carried out by IS-affiliated \"provinces\" in the Najd and Hijaz regions. Incidents include a suicide bombing in Kuwait, an attack on a Shia mosque in Al Ahsa, and bombings in Riyadh, Jeddah, Medina, and the Eastern Province. Over 1,600 suspected IS supporters have been arrested by Saudi officials. Saudi officials have arrested over 1,600 suspected IS supporters, including 400 in July 2015, and claim to have thwarted planned attacks. The Islamic State poses a political threat to Saudi Arabia by challenging the legitimacy of the Al Saud family. IS dismisses state-backed clerics as apostates and challenges Saudi leaders' credentials. IS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi has aggressively challenged Saudi leaders' credentials as defenders of Islam and implementers of Salafist Sunni principles, accusing them of being \"slaves of the Crusaders and allies of the Jews\" and abandoning Sunni Palestinians, Syrians, Iraqis, and others. He urged supporters in the Arabian Peninsula to reject Saudi state-aligned scholars and resist Westernization efforts, drawing on the writings of Mohammed Ibn Abd al Wahhab. Islamic State propaganda also justifies the assassination of prominent Saudi clerics. IS ideologues, influenced by Mohammed Ibn Abd al Wahhab, criticize the Al Saud family and state-aligned clerics in Saudi Arabia. Some Saudis may sympathize with IS critiques due to disagreements with government policies or involvement in conflicts. Saudi leaders argue that IS lacks legitimacy, comparing their ideology to past violent groups. Financial support for terrorism from Saudi individuals remains a threat, despite the government's commitment to combat it. The Saudi government has reaffirmed its commitment to countering terrorist financing in the Kingdom and the Gulf region. The US now credits Saudi counterparts for taking terrorism threats seriously and praises Saudi cooperation in counterterrorism initiatives. Despite strict supervision of the banking sector and penalties for financing terrorism, some funds are allegedly collected in secret and illicitly transferred out of the country. The Saudi government has taken steps to counter bulk cash smuggling and prevent funds from being transferred out of the country illicitly. Efforts have been made to disrupt funding streams to terrorist organizations, including forbidding citizens from traveling to Syria to fight and imposing prison sentences for those found to have joined extremist groups abroad. In March 2014, new counterterrorism regulations were released in Saudi Arabia, outlawing support for terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. The regulations faced criticism from human rights advocates concerned about civil liberties. The Grand Mufti declared extremism and terrorism as enemies of Muslims, emphasizing the need to combat these groups. The government's crackdown on clerics deviating from the antiterrorism messaging signals a desire to undermine claims by extremist groups. Saudi Arabia's efforts to combat support for extremist groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda include arresting suspected cells and receiving U.S. security support. The country's ability to fund its own security programs limits Congress's influence on cooperation. Saudi Arabia also benefits from discounted training through International Military Education and Training assistance. The Bush and Obama Administrations requested limited IMET funding for Saudi Arabia to support military-to-military relationships. President Trump's FY2018 budget requested $10,000 in IMET, but FY2019 did not specify the funds. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $10,000 in IMET assistance for Saudi Arabia. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $10,000 in IMET assistance for Saudi Arabia, despite past prohibitions on foreign assistance to the kingdom. Saudi officials prefer to avoid public debate over U.S. assistance and rely on U.S. arms sales and training for their armed forces. Saudi Arabia's armed forces have long depended on U.S. arms sales, training, and support. Congress generally supports these sales to maintain Israel's military edge and deter Iran. Some concerns have been raised about arms races in the region and Saudi use of U.S. weapons in Yemen. Congressional majorities currently favor continued sales to Gulf partners like Saudi Arabia for interoperability and deterring Iran. The United States Military Training Mission (USMTM) and the Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization Program (PM-SANG) oversee these efforts. The Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization Program (PM-SANG) and the United States Military Training Mission (USMTM) oversee U.S. defense cooperation with Saudi Arabia. Recent leadership changes in the Saudi military and national-guard forces may impact U.S. weapons acquisition and training. High-value U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia have been ongoing since 2009, including the reconstitution and expansion of the Royal Saudi Air Force with advanced F-15 aircraft. President Trump signaled a deepening of bilateral defense cooperation in 2017. During his visit to Riyadh, President Trump announced completed and proposed defense sales worth over $110 billion, including cases developed under the Obama Administration and new sales. These sales are expected to enhance Saudi military capabilities and symbolize cooperation during regional turmoil. Saudi Arabia's military coalition in Yemen has been engaged in operations against the Ansar Allah/Houthi movement since 2015. The United States supports the Saudi-led coalition's military operations in Yemen to counter Iranian interference, while urging for improved humanitarian access and efforts to prevent civilian casualties. This support includes intelligence sharing, aerial refueling, and deployment of advisers for border security and anti-ballistic missile purposes. President Trump informed Congress about ongoing U.S. counterterrorism operations in Yemen. The Department of Defense provides military advice and support to regional forces combatting the Houthi insurgency in Yemen. U.S. in-flight refueling to Saudi Arabia and the UAE is conducted under bilateral agreements. Sales of defense articles continue under established procedures. In response to a Saudi airstrike in Yemen that killed children, U.S. officials advised the Saudi-led coalition to investigate. The coalition admitted to causing civilian casualties unintentionally but disputed some reports. The Joint Incident Assessment Team (JIAT) evaluates allegations of civilian casualties in coalition strikes in Yemen. Saudi leaders justify the military campaign as self-defense against Yemeni attacks. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo certified Saudi Arabia and the UAE's efforts to reduce harm to civilians in military operations, but some Members of Congress criticized the certification. U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism and security cooperation has expanded since 2008, with ongoing programs despite changes in leadership in the Ministry of Interior. The Office of the Program Manager-Ministry of Interior (OPM-MOI) embeds U.S. advisors in key Saudi government offices focused on critical infrastructure protection. The U.S. and Saudi government collaborate on cybersecurity and counterterrorism efforts, with U.S. agencies aiding Saudi Arabia in enhancing its ability to prevent and respond to terrorist threats. The U.S. Army oversees Saudi-funded security assistance programs, including protection for critical infrastructure like the Abqaiq petroleum facility. Sales agreements worth $262 million have been reached to support Saudi Ministry of Interior programs since FY2009. In FY2009, sales agreements worth $262 million have supported Saudi Ministry of Interior programs. Saudi Arabia was the largest U.S. trading partner in the Middle East in 2017, with exports to the U.S. valued at over $18.8 billion. U.S. exports to Saudi Arabia were valued at more than $16.3 billion in 2017, driven by imports of hydrocarbons and exports of weapons, machinery, and vehicles. Fluctuations in oil trade volume and global prices have impacted the value of Saudi exports to the U.S. Saudi Arabia's domestic oil production significantly influenced the value of its exports to the United States. As of September 2018, Saudi Arabia was the second-largest source of U.S. crude oil imports, providing an average of 948 thousand barrels per day out of 7.6 million barrels per day. The kingdom holds the second largest proven oil reserves globally and was the largest exporter of crude oil and petroleum products in 2016. Saudi Arabia produces over 10 million barrels per day of its 12 million barrels per day capacity. In 2016, 69% of Saudi crude oil exports went to Asia, with Japan, China, South Korea, and India as the top consumers. The reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran has raised concerns about Saudi Arabia's oil production capacity. The reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran has raised questions about Saudi Arabia's ability to increase oil output and exports. Saudi leaders aim to boost production, but analysts are divided on the sustainability of this strategy. To address challenges, Saudi Arabia implemented a three-track strategy including negotiating output agreements with other oil producers, raising domestic energy prices, and planning to offer public shares in Saudi Aramco. Negotiations with Producers. Mutual reliance on oil export revenues creates parallel interests and competition for market share between Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran, and Iraq. Saudi Arabia convinced OPEC members to embrace production cuts and reached an agreement with Russia to stabilize prices. Joint cuts extended through 2018. In response to unrest in Venezuela and U.S. sanctions on Iran, Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to extend joint cuts through 2018 and planned to increase production in June 2018. Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a bilateral energy cooperation agreement to support a balanced market with reliable supply. Saudi Arabia's domestic energy policy included declining energy use since 2016 due to government-imposed price increases to curb consumption and prevent exceeding oil exports by 2030. Price hikes aimed to attract investors to the kingdom's energy producers for higher revenue potential from exports. Saudi Aramco IPO plans delayed, potential valuation debated at $1-1.5 trillion with proceeds of $50-100 billion for PIF. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ensures government control over oil reserves and production decisions. The Saudi government aims to diversify the economy by investing in nuclear energy, with plans to build multiple reactors by 2040 to reduce reliance on oil and gas for electricity production. Saudi Aramco may sell bonds to purchase the PIF's stake in SABIC. Saudi Arabia plans to build nuclear reactors to reduce reliance on oil and gas for electricity production. The reactors could provide 15-20% of the country's electricity needs, currently met by oil and natural gas. The government intends to solicit bids for the construction of two nuclear power reactors with a total capacity between 2 GW and 3.2 GW by 2018, aiming for delivery by 2027. This move is seen as a way to address the fiscal tradeoff of using domestically produced oil for power generation, potentially impacting export revenue. Saudi Arabia planned to evaluate submissions from firms in various countries for the construction of nuclear reactors by 2027. The winning firm was expected to enter a joint venture with the Saudi government in 2019. Additionally, a separate process with South Korean partners to study the use of small SMART reactors for electricity generation in remote areas is underway. Saudi Arabia has engaged in agreements for civil nuclear cooperation with multiple countries. Saudi nuclear facilities in Saudi Arabia are subject to IAEA safeguards, hindering the development of nuclear weapons. Saudi Arabia has not agreed to an Additional Protocol or accepted changes to its Small Quantities Protocol. Rescinding the SQP would be necessary for Saudi Arabia to build nuclear weapons. Saudi Arabia has not accepted the modified text regarding nuclear cooperation with the United States. Discussions are underway for a nuclear cooperation agreement, with the Trump Administration expediting regulatory approvals for U.S. firms to provide information to Saudi officials. In September 2018, U.S. companies proposed nuclear reactor construction to Saudi authorities. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and Minister of Energy Khalid al Falih discussed U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear engagement and Small Modular Reactors. The Trump Administration may propose a nuclear cooperation agreement for Congress under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act. The Trump Administration may propose a nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act. Whether a U.S.-Saudi 123 agreement can enter into force by the end of 2018 depends on various factors, including negotiations between the governments and the adjournment of the 115th Congress. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about potential U.S.-Saudi nuclear cooperation without a firm Saudi commitment to refrain from uranium enrichment and fuel reprocessing technologies. In the 115th Congress, H.R. 5357 would amend procedures related to nuclear exports. In the 115th Congress, H.R. 5357 proposed amending procedures for nuclear exports to require congressional approval of agreements not prohibiting uranium enrichment and reprocessing. The Senate considered S.Res. 541, urging future U.S.-Saudi nuclear agreements to ban enrichment and plutonium separation in Saudi Arabia, and to implement the Additional Protocol with the IAEA. The Trump Administration seeks a gold-standard Section 123 Agreement with Saudi Arabia, prohibiting enrichment. Failure to reach an agreement may signal a lack of commitment to nonproliferation. Saudi Arabia's nuclear energy pursuits are for peaceful purposes, but officials have stated they would pursue nuclear weapons if Iran does. The 2008 U.S.-Saudi MOU on nuclear cooperation aims to rely on international markets for nuclear fuel services instead of enrichment. Saudi Arabian officials have not publicly stated that they will reject prohibitions on uranium enrichment and fuel reprocessing if required for a nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States. They have expressed intent to use domestic resources for their nuclear program and preserve the option for uranium enrichment. Saudi Energy Minister has emphasized localization of the nuclear energy value chain while complying with international agreements. Saudi Arabia aims to comply with international agreements while accessing natural resources and localizing the industry. Close U.S.-Saudi security cooperation continues despite differences on regional security threats. Tensions between U.S. and Saudi leaders have been reported on key issues such as Syria, Iran's nuclear program, and U.S. policy toward Egypt. These issues, along with developments in Yemen and campaigns against violent extremists, remain prominent on the U.S.-Saudi policy agenda. During President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017, a \"Strategic Partnership for the 21st Century\" was agreed upon with King Salman bin Abd al Aziz. This partnership was further solidified with a \"Joint Strategic Vision for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States of America.\" Additionally, plans were made for a \"Strategic Joint Consultative Group\" to meet annually between the two countries. King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman have been actively pursuing Saudi interests in the Middle East, including challenging Iran, engaging with Iraq, isolating Qatar, and involvement in the conflict in Yemen. Saudi Arabia's regional activism, including dialogue with Iraq, isolating Qatar, and involvement in Yemen, raises questions for the Trump Administration. Concerns about Iran's influence in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon persist, with Saudi leaders viewing Iran's policies as sectarian and expansionist. Saudi Arabia remains wary of Iranian nuclear activities and called for strict enforcement of the Iran-P5+1 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Saudi Arabia supported the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA and backed reimposition of sanctions on Iran. Ongoing defense cooperation with the U.S. may enhance Saudi Arabia's military advantage over Iran. Proxy competitions between the two regional contenders could intensify. The intensification of proxy competitions between regional contenders like Saudi Arabia and Iran could complicate U.S. national security objectives in the Middle East, particularly in countries such as Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. Saudi Arabia has taken steps to normalize relations with Iraq, including reopening diplomatic offices and strengthening ties through official visits, but has not provided significant economic or security assistance to stabilize the country. Saudi Arabia is concerned about Iran-linked Shia militia groups in Iraq and the impact of a new government following the 2018 elections. They support a negotiated settlement in Syria to transition away from the Iran-aligned government of Bashar al Asad. Saudi efforts to align Syrian opposition factions have had some success, and they have pledged $100 million for stabilization efforts in Syria. Saudi Arabia has pledged $100 million for stabilization efforts in Yemen, where the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Saleh have taken control of the capital, Sana'a, in 2014. Saudi officials are concerned about the situation in Yemen and have been involved in security interventions in the country. In 2014, Houthi forces took control of the capital, Sana'a, leading to a crisis with the Hadi government. Houthi leaders announced a new governance plan in 2015 and launched an offensive against pro-Hadi forces. Saudi Arabia led a coalition in airstrikes to support President Hadi against the Houthi militia. Since April 2015, U.N. Security Council Resolution 2216 has demanded that the Houthis immediately end their use of violence, withdraw their forces from seized areas, relinquish seized arms, cease actions exclusive to the Yemeni government, and refrain from provocation towards neighbors. Houthi fighters have attacked Saudi border areas, prompting Saudi military strikes across Yemen. Iranian support for the Houthis has been noted. Saudi forces have intercepted missile attacks from Yemen, including a missile attack on Riyadh in November 2017. Reports of civilian casualties, displacement, shortages, advances by AQAP forces, Islamic State attacks, and persistence by the Houthis have fueled international criticism of Saudi policy. U.N. officials estimated that 6,660 civilians have been killed in the conflict since March 2015, with most direct civilian casualties attributed to coalition airstrikes. Eminent Experts on Yemen attributed most civilian casualties to coalition airstrikes based on U.N. data. Humanitarian conditions worsened significantly in Yemen in 2017 due to Saudi coalition-enforced limits on access. Periodic coalition strikes causing civilian casualties continue, with Saudi officials acknowledging some shortcomings in their operations. Saudi officials accuse Houthi forces of conspiring to restrict humanitarian goods and profiting from their diversion and sale. Saudi officials view the Houthis as a hostile minority movement benefiting from Iranian support, leading to criticism of coalition actions. The US provides limited military support to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, with efforts to improve humanitarian access and military targeting. Congressional criticism has led to proposals to condition or reduce US assistance, while successive administrations emphasize the need for a non-military solution to the conflict. Ending the conflict in Yemen is a national security priority for the US. The US considers ending the conflict in Yemen a national security priority. The Administration certified to Congress that Saudi and Emirati governments are working to reduce harm to civilians, resolve the conflict diplomatically, and address the humanitarian crisis. Some Members of Congress criticize the Administration's decision to certify the coalition's actions and may propose new legislation related to US operations in Yemen. Saudi-Qatari disputes have flared over the last 20-plus years, with Saudi Arabia taking issue with Qatar's independent foreign policy and ties to Iran. Both countries have been involved in shaping regional uprisings since 2011, with tensions escalating in 2017. Ambassadors were withdrawn in 2014 but returned in November of the same year. In 2017, Saudi Arabia abruptly severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism and interfering in the internal affairs of Arab states. This followed a period of escalating tensions and mutual recriminations between the two countries. Qatar rejects accusations of supporting terrorism and interfering in Arab states' affairs by Saudi Arabia. Both countries seek US support in their dispute, with the US maintaining defense cooperation with both. Saudi Arabia has kept isolation measures in place, while Qatar has rejected some demands but aims to resolve the confrontation through negotiation. Limitations on travel and transit to Qatar by Saudi Arabia could impact U.S. nationals and businesses. Saudi Arabia has historically been critical of Israeli policies and supports the Palestinians. Shared concerns about Iran and terrorism have not led to tangible cooperation. In recent years, there have been some new contacts between Saudis and Israeli officials, sparking speculation about potential bilateral engagement. President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017 included discussions about peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The U.S.-Saudi joint statement emphasized the importance of achieving comprehensive peace in the region. King Salman has reaffirmed commitment to the 2002 Arab League peace initiative, calling for Arab normalization with Israel in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from 1967 territories, establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and resolution of the Palestinian refugee issue. In January 2018, King Salman reiterated Saudi Arabia's support for the Palestinian cause and their right to an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital. Saudi officials have consulted with other Arab states on joint responses to the Trump Administration's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and U.S. decisions to reduce contributions to U.N. relief efforts for Palestinian refugees. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al Jubeir emphasized the Kingdom's commitment to the Palestinian cause and the establishment of an independent state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Hamas have grown strained since 2017, amid the deteriorating relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Hamas have grown strained since 2017, with Saudi authorities criticizing Israeli conduct during the Gaza war in 2014 and calling on Qatar to stop supporting groups like Hamas. Saudi Arabia has close defense and security ties with the United States, including military training programs, weapons sales, infrastructure security cooperation, and counterterrorism initiatives. These joint security ties would be difficult and costly for either side to fully break or replace. Saudi Arabia and the United States have close defense and security ties, including military training programs and weapons sales. Differences in tactics may complicate coordination on regional security issues. U.S. engagement with emerging Saudi leaders during challenging times has deepened the relationship. Saudi Arabia's pursuit of an independent and assertive course on regional security issues, ambitious plans to transform the kingdom's economy, and fiscal base have tested U.S.-Saudi relations. Both countries have attempted to articulate a shared \"strategic vision\" beyond defense and counterterrorism partnership. Commercial ties and investment opportunities may strengthen the bond between Saudis and Americans, despite U.S. firms facing challenges in the increasingly open Saudi market. Former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia visited in June 2017. In June 2017, former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Joseph Westphal identified education and judicial reform as potential areas for expanded U.S.-Saudi cooperation. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's economic and social reform proposals could overturn decades of precedent, with steps taken against high-profile individuals accused of corruption and abuse of power. The changes unfolding may eliminate uncertainty about the consolidation of power among the next generation of Saudi leaders. The U.S. has cultivated ties with different royal actors in Saudi Arabia to build a partnership. Consolidated control could impact U.S.-Saudi cooperation, especially in military equipment purchases. If Crown Prince's initiatives fail, it could lead to a more volatile period in the kingdom and relations with the U.S. Congress may shape bilateral relations through oversight. The modern kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the third state established in the Arabian Peninsula since the end of the 18th century based on the hereditary rule of members of the Al Saud family. An alliance developed between the Al Saud and a puritanical Sunni Islamic religious movement led by Mohammed ibn Abd Al Wahhab, resulting in the formation of two states in the Arabian Peninsula. These states eventually collapsed due to external pressures and internal rivalries. Abd al Aziz ibn Abd al Rahman Al Saud played a significant role in the early 20th century in establishing the current kingdom. In the early 20th century, Abd al Aziz ibn Abd al Rahman Al Saud unified much of the Arabian Peninsula under the Al Saud state with the support of the Ikhwan and British backing. By 1932, he established the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has since been ruled by six of his sons. The era has been marked by the development and export of the kingdom's oil resources, leading to socioeconomic transformation and religious debates. The Al Saud rulers have maintained a consensus-based governance system, balancing various interests since the 1940s with strong U.S. security commitment. This commitment was based on shared economic interests and opposition to Communism, surviving Cold War conflicts and post-Cold War terrorism strains. New arms sales to Saudi Arabia continue as the country transitions to a new generation of leadership and faces economic evolution and instability. The report highlights the alleged role of Saudi Arabia in supporting terrorism, specifically in relation to the September 11 attacks. The 900-page congressional Joint Inquiry report, released in December 2002, raised concerns about foreign support for the hijackers, with a significant portion redacted for national security reasons. The congressional Joint Inquiry's report raised concerns about alleged foreign support for the hijackers, with some information remaining under investigation. Speculation focused on potential Saudi involvement in the September 11 attacks. The congressional Joint Inquiry's report raised concerns about alleged foreign support for the hijackers, with speculation on potential Saudi involvement in the September 11 attacks. In 2016, efforts were made to review and release redacted sections of the report regarding Saudi nationals' links to the attackers. President Obama requested the review, leading to the release of declassified portions of the report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The 2016 Joint Inquiry report raised concerns about potential Saudi involvement in supporting the September 11 hijackers. The report revealed that some hijackers had contact with individuals connected to the Saudi Government, including alleged Saudi intelligence officers. The Intelligence Community also has information on this matter. The Intelligence Community has information indicating individuals associated with the Saudi Government in the United States may have ties to terrorist groups. The 2002 report discussed allegations, not investigatory conclusions. The 2005 FBI-CIA report found no evidence of Saudi government support for the 9/11 attacks but noted official Saudi entities provided support to terrorist groups. The Saudi Government and its agencies have been infiltrated by individuals linked to terrorism. The 2004 9/11 Commission found no evidence of direct Saudi government funding for Al Qaeda but noted that charities with Saudi government sponsorship may have diverted funds to the group. Saudi Foreign Minister argued that the release of information cleared Saudi Arabia of involvement. In 2016, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al Jubeir stated that the release of the 28 pages exonerated the Saudi government from allegations of supporting the September 11 attacks. The Saudi Embassy in Washington, DC, has consistently responded to reports by citing later investigations and the dismissal of lawsuits against the kingdom. In the 114th Congress, there were efforts to delay a proposed sale of precision guided munitions to Saudi Arabia. In November 2015, Senate Foreign Relations Committee leaders requested advance notification of shipments to Congress. No resolutions of disapproval were introduced during the 30-day consideration period. In April 2016, legislation was proposed to place conditions on future sales or transfers of precision guided munitions (PGMs) to Saudi Arabia. Proposed amendments to defense legislation aimed to add similar conditions or prohibit the transfer of cluster munitions to Saudi Arabia. The Senate did not consider the PGM amendment. In June 2016, the House narrowly defeated a Saudi cluster munitions prohibition amendment. Saudi use of U.S. cluster munitions in Yemen has been reported, leading to a hold on further transfers by the Obama Administration. In August 2016, a proposed sale of M1A2S tanks to Saudi Arabia was notified to Congress, sparking concerns about Yemen. Joint resolutions of disapproval of the tank sale were introduced in September 2016. Since 2006, Saudi M1 series tanks have been upgraded to the M1A2S standard. In September 2016, the Senate voted on a motion regarding U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia after a deadly airstrike. The Obama Administration halted a planned sale of precision guided munitions technology in December 2016. The Trump Administration has sought to balance its stance on the conflict in Yemen. The Trump Administration has tried to address the conflict in Yemen by condemning the Houthis and urging the coalition to ease restrictions, limit civilian casualties, and pursue negotiations. Congress has debated the impact of U.S. arms sales to the coalition on humanitarian law violations and civilian casualties. Some lawmakers have proposed legislation to restrict defense sales to Saudi Arabia and conditions on future transfers of precision guided munitions technology. The 115th Congress introduced resolutions seeking to condition the sale of munitions on certifications regarding Saudi government actions. These resolutions influenced legislation requiring certifications for defense funding used for refueling support to Saudi and coalition aircraft in Yemen. President Trump proceeded with proposed direct commercial sales of precision guided munitions. The Trump administration notified Congress of proposed direct commercial sales of precision guided munitions technology previously deferred by the Obama Administration. The proposed sales include equipment and services related to JDAMs, Paveway laser-guided munitions kits, and programmable bomb fuzes. Legislation was introduced in the House and Senate to disapprove of the sales, but the Senate rejected a motion to discharge the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from further consideration. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee considered a joint resolution to remove U.S. forces from hostilities in Yemen, except for counterterrorism operations. Another resolution would prohibit U.S. funds for in-flight refueling of Saudi-led coalition aircraft without certain certifications. The Secretary of State could waive the certification requirement for national security reasons with justification. The Secretary provides an unclassified explanatory justification to the appropriate committees regarding U.S. objectives in Yemen and a strategy to achieve them. The Senate Armed Services Committee incorporated these provisions into the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act. Restrictions on U.S. funds for in-flight refueling of coalition aircraft do not apply to certain operations related to Al Qaeda, the Islamic State, or countering ballistic threats. The modified version requires the Administration to certify that Saudi and Emirati governments are making efforts to end the civil war in Yemen, alleviate the humanitarian crisis, and reduce harm to civilians from military operations. Compliance with defense agreements and laws is also necessary. The Administration must certify that Saudi Arabia is reducing delays in shipments and taking steps to avoid harm to civilians and infrastructure. Reporting and strategy submission requirements are also included. Senator Menendez has raised concerns about the certification process. Senator Menendez, the Ranking Member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has blocked formal congressional notification of a potential U.S. sale of precision guided munitions to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. He expressed concerns that the weapons sales may not be used strategically to address Iran's actions in Yemen or alleviate humanitarian suffering, and that current policies are perpetuating the conflict. Additionally, an amendment was submitted to the FY2019 Defense Department appropriations act to prohibit funds from supporting the Saudi-led coalition operations. The amendment to the FY2019 Defense Department appropriations act aimed to restrict the use of funds for the Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen unless certified by the Secretary of Defense that civilian protection rules were followed. The provision excluded support for counterterrorism operations. However, the amendment was not considered due to an objection on the Senate floor."
