    "content": "The \"Health Care OverUse Reform Today Act (HealthCOURT Act) of 2009\" establishes performance-based quality measures for physicians' services under the Medicare program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a proposal for these measures by January 1, 2010, in agreement with the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement. An affirmative defense is provided based on compliance with best practice guidelines. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will select and issue best practice guidelines for treatment of medical conditions in accordance with the Health Care OverUse Reform Today Act. A qualified physician consensus-building organization will develop these guidelines within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The organization must consider endorsed quality measures and submit best practice guidelines within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will issue guidelines within 2 years, approved by a qualified physician consensus-building organization. The Secretary will disseminate guidelines broadly issued by a qualified physician consensus-building organization. In health care lawsuits, limitations on noneconomic and punitive damages are imposed for treatments within the guidelines. Guidelines for medical treatment must be approved by a qualified organization and recognized as safe and effective by experts. These guidelines cannot be used as evidence of negligence in a civil action unless introduced by the defendant, and there is no presumption of negligence if a physician does not adhere to them. The section allows states to replace current medical malpractice rules with guidelines that rely on a healthcare provider's compliance. States can also add additional guidelines or safe-harbors in addition to the issued guidelines. State grants are available to create administrative health care tribunals under Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act. This allows states to establish guidelines for medical malpractice cases based on healthcare provider compliance, with the option to add extra guidelines or safe-harbors. The Secretary may award grants to States for the development, implementation, and evaluation of administrative health care tribunals for resolving disputes related to injuries caused by health care providers. States receiving grants must allow legal representation for all parties involved in disputes before the tribunal. Prior to submitting disputes to an administrative health care tribunal, allegations of injuries caused by health care providers must be reviewed by an expert panel appointed by the State agency responsible for health. The expert panel must consist of at least 3 members, with half being medical experts. Legal representation is allowed during the review process and before the tribunal. Each physician or health care professional appointed to an expert panel must be licensed and experienced in delivering health care services relevant to the review. They should not have any material familial ties to ensure independence. Each physician or health care professional appointed to an expert panel must be licensed and experienced in delivering relevant health care services. They should not have a material familial, financial, or professional relationship with a party involved in the dispute, nor have a conflict of interest. An exception allows individuals with staff privileges at the institution where the treatment was provided to serve on the panel if disclosed and not objected to by either party. In a dispute before an expert panel involving treatment, the medical experts must be practicing physicians of the same specialty as the physician providing the treatment. In disputes involving treatment, medical experts on the panel must be practicing physicians of the same specialty as the treating physician. In disputes involving treatment, medical experts on the panel must be practicing physicians of the same specialty as the treating physician. The term 'practicing' means providing health care services to individual patients at least 2 days a week. In cases involving children, at least 1 medical expert on the panel must have expertise in pediatrics for making liability determinations. An expert panel determines liability and compensation in disputes. If parties accept the panel's decision, compensation is paid, and further action is waived. If not accepted, the matter goes to an administrative health care tribunal. The parties have the right to request a hearing on liability or compensation from an administrative health care tribunal established by the State. The tribunal must be presided over by judges with health care expertise, have authority to make binding rulings on standards of care, causation, and compensation, and establish gross negligence as the legal standard. The administrative health care tribunal established by the State allows for the admission of expert panel recommendations and provides an appeals process for review by State courts. If dissatisfied with tribunal determinations, parties have the right to file claims in a State court, forfeiting any compensation awards received from the tribunal. The determinations of the expert panel and administrative health care tribunal in State court proceedings are admissible as evidence. The term 'health care provider' is defined as in part A of title VII. Appropriations are authorized for grants to States under this section. Congress believes health insurance issuers should be liable for harm caused by their decisions on medically necessary care."
