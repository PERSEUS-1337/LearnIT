    "content": "President Bush signed the FY2006 Department of Defense appropriations bill into law, which included a provision rescinding one percent of non-emergency federal discretionary funding for FY2006. Additionally, $2.8 billion in supplemental funding was provided to the Department of Transportation for response to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. Another bill signed into law provided $60.7 billion in net budgetary resources for the Department of Transportation, slightly more than the FY2005 enacted level. The FY2006 budget allocations included a reduction in the suballocation for the House Appropriations Committee Transportation-Treasury-HUD-The Judiciary-DC Subcommittee. The discretionary budget authority was $65.9 billion, $1 billion less than the previous suballocation. Some transportation funding comes from discretionary funds, including aviation, transit, and rail (including Amtrak). The Senate passed H.R. 3058 for FY2006 Department of Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and Urban Development, The Judiciary, District of Columbia. The Senate provided $64.2 billion for the Department of Transportation in the FY2006 appropriations bill, which was $4.2 billion over the previous year's level. The bill also included $1.45 billion for Amtrak, despite the Administration's request for no funding. Additionally, P.L. 109-59 was signed into law, reauthorizing federal surface transportation programs. The Department of Transportation's funding comes from trust funds and is mainly used for formula programs. The budget figures may differ due to rescissions and emergency appropriations. Funding trends show an increase from FY2000 to FY2006. The United States House of Representatives, Committee on Appropriations, provided Comparative Statement of Budget Authority tables from fiscal years 1999 through 2006 for the Department of Transportation appropriations. Figures were adjusted for comparison by excluding certain agencies and adding the Maritime Administration. Rescissions were applied in FY2001, FY2003, FY2004, and FY2005, but not in FY2006. The Department of Transportation appropriations totaled $2.8 billion, with figures reflecting across-the-board rescissions and additional funding for the Essential Air Service program. The FY2006 figure did not include the across-the-board rescission or the $2.8 billion supplemental. The FY2006 DOT budget proposal of $58.3 billion was $1.4 billion below FY2005's enacted level. Major funding changes included reductions for Amtrak and the FAA's Airport Improvement Program. The budget request aligned with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century and reflected changes proposed in the Administration's reauthorization proposal. The FY2006 budget reflects a statutory change creating two new operating administrations in place of the former Research and Special Programs Administration. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $62.8 billion with increases for various transportation administrations. Amendments were made to increase funding for Amtrak and strike a provision barring federal funding for certain Amtrak routes. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $104 million for the EAS program, slightly up from $102 million enacted for FY2005. The Administration proposed reducing the size of the EAS program to $50 million in FY2006. The EAS program was established in 1978 to preserve air service to small communities by subsidizing airlines. The program receives funding from user fees collected from foreign aircraft overflights. The House initially recommended $104 million, which was reduced to $50 million during House floor consideration. The Senate approved $110 million, which was the final conference agreement. The EAS program, established in 1978 to support air service to small communities, receives funding from foreign aircraft overflights. The annual authorized funding level is $50 million, with additional funding provided by Congress to serve more airports. The Bush Administration's FY2006 request was $13.9 billion, with reduced funding for the Airport Improvement Program. The proposed cut would have put the program below the level guaranteed in the Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act. The Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (Vision 100, P.L.108-176) would have caused disruption to the AIP program at the proposed funding level. The House Committee recommended $14.4 billion for the FAA, while the Senate approved $13.6 billion. The final conference agreement provided $13.8 billion, $266 million more than FY2005 enacted level. The majority of FAA funding comes from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. The general fund has historically contributed to the FAA's budget, with varying amounts over the years. In FY2002, there was a $1.1 billion contribution, but this has been declining since then, with an estimated $1.6 billion in the Administration's FY2006 request. The trust fund/general fund split has been a significant part of the annual FAA budget debate. The public benefits from aviation, even if not using the system. Trust fund revenues are below projections, leading to tapping into the low uncommitted balance. The proposed FY2006 budget saw an increase to $8.2 billion, with slight variations in recommendations and approvals from different committees. The Senate approved $8.2 billion in funding for the FAA, with a focus on salaries for air traffic control personnel and addressing the need to hire more controllers due to upcoming retirements. The request included $25 million to hire 1,249 controllers in FY2006, aiming for a net gain of around 604 controllers. In FY2006, 645 controllers are expected to leave through attrition. The Administration requested $2.4 billion for Facilities and Equipment (F&E), slightly down from the previous year. The House approved $3.1 billion, the Senate approved $2.4 billion, and the conference agreement provided $2.5 billion for F&E. Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) funding was set at $138 million, with a focus on safety and air traffic control. The conference agreement allocated $138 million for RE&D activities focused on safety/air traffic control. The Bush Administration did not propose significant new initiatives in the FAA budget. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides grants for airport planning, development, and capacity expansion. The proposed FY2006 budget for AIP was $3.0 billion, $500 million lower than FY2005. Some Members of Congress questioned the cuts in AIP funding, especially as aviation traffic was increasing. Construction of new runways was seen as a solution to airport congestion. The proposed funding level for FY2006 was $600 million below the \"guaranteed\" level. The FY2006 proposal for the AIP and F&E programs is $5.45 billion, $1.2 billion below their authorized level of $6.65 billion. The proposed AIP funding of $3 billion is below the $3.2 billion threshold, potentially cutting AIP formula distributions in half. The Administration defended the reduction citing previous funding increases and airport capital development. The Administration proposed reducing AIP funding to $3 billion, below the authorized level of $3.6 billion for FY2006. They suggested airports could make up the difference by increasing passenger facility charges. Congress approved $3.55 billion for AIP funding. Some members questioned raising fees on struggling airlines. The Senate approved $3.5 billion for the FHWA budget, while the conference agreement provided $3.55 billion. The FHWA budget funds the Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP), which includes major highway programs like the National Highway System (NHS) and Interstate Maintenance (IM). Funding for these core programs is apportioned annually by formula. Additionally, there are \"allocated\" programs under direct control of FHWA or other entities, such as the Federal Lands Highway Program. The FHWA budget funds various highway programs, including the Federal Lands Highway Program and other small programs. Congress reauthorized surface transportation programs with the passage of SAFETEA-LU in August 2005. The President's FY2006 budget requested $35.4 billion for FHWA, slightly less than the previous year. The FHWA budget for FY2006 was less than the authorized levels proposed by the House and Senate. The House recommended $37.0 billion, while the Senate recommended $38.7 billion, with the final conference bill providing $36.8 billion for FHWA after a $2 billion rescission. The FHWA appropriations were scored at $34.7 billion for budgetary purposes. FMCSA issues and enforces regulations for commercial truck and bus operations. FMCSA administers grants and programs for truck and bus safety enforcement, conducts inspections of Mexican-domiciled drivers and vehicles entering the US, and reviews carriers annually. Funding for FMCSA activities comes from the Highway Trust Fund. The FY2006 Administration request for FMCSA is $465 million, with the House and Senate recommending $501 million and $490 million respectively. The FMCSA appropriation for FY2006 was $495 million, 11% above the FY2005 enacted level. It includes funds for administrative expenses, operations, research, and financial assistance to states for truck and bus safety programs. The President's budget request for administrative and operations expenses was $233 million, with the conference bill providing $213 million. This account also covers research and technology activities, enforcement efforts to reduce unsafe carriers and drivers, and funding for a medical review board to assist FMCSA. The FMCSA appropriation for FY2006 includes funds for administrative expenses, personnel compensation, outreach efforts, and grants to states. The House Committee recommended $286 million, the Senate recommended $279 million, and the conference bill provided $282 million for these activities. The conference bill allocated $282 million for the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP), which provides grants to states for enforcing commercial vehicle safety regulations. The program involves 9,000 state and local law enforcement officers conducting over 2.9 million roadside inspections annually. NHTSA funding supports various traffic safety programs aimed at reducing impaired driving, enhancing occupant protection, improving emergency medical responses to crashes, and ensuring compliance with federal vehicle safety regulations. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) requested $696 million for FY2006 to carry out its mission, with $465 million designated for general traffic safety and incentive grants to states. The remaining $231 million was for NHTSA's operations and research activities to reduce highway fatalities and prevent injuries due to traffic crashes. The funds would be used for research, analysis, and activities to improve vehicle performance and occupant protection measures. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) requested $696 million for FY2006 for various safety programs, including crash statistics collection, highway safety initiatives, safety assurance testing, and crash avoidance testing. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $782 million, the Senate recommended $779 million, and the final conference bill provided $815 million for FY2006. The Administration requested $552 million for the Federal Railroad Administration for FY2006, significantly lower than the $1.4 billion received in FY2005. The House recommended $732 million, while the Senate recommended $1.7 billion. The final conference bill provided $815 million, with additional funding for Amtrak. The FY2006 budget for the Federal Railroad Administration includes $146 million for safety programs, $9 million more than FY2005. Increased railroad traffic poses safety risks. The focus is on Amtrak funding, Next Generation High-Speed Rail program, and state initiatives for high-speed rail. The FY2006 budget for the Federal Railroad Administration includes $146 million for safety programs, $9 million above FY2005 levels. The funds support goals of reducing rail accidents, grade-crossing accidents, and hazardous materials incidents. The railroad safety statute was last reauthorized in 1994, with funding authority expiring in FY1998. Hearings have not resulted in agreement on reauthorization or changes to existing safety compliance activities. The FY2006 budget for the Federal Railroad Administration includes $146 million for safety programs, supporting goals of reducing rail accidents and hazardous materials incidents. The Administration did not request funding for the Next Generation High-Speed Rail R&D program, Amtrak requested $1.8 billion but received $1.2 billion in funding. Amtrak received $1.2 billion in FY2005 and expects to end FY2005 with little or no cash on hand. The Administration requested $360 million for the Surface Transportation Board to administer Amtrak operations. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $550 million for Amtrak for FY2006, with $50 million for capital grants for repairs to the Northeast Corridor. The Committee allocated $20 million for the Surface Transportation Board in case Amtrak ceases operations, and $10 million for the discontinuation of Amtrak's mail and express service. Routes with federal subsidies over $30 per passenger may lose federal support, with states urged to fund them. The Committee emphasized the importance of sustaining viable passenger rail service in geographic regions. The Committee's bill provides $550 million for Amtrak, which falls short of the $1.4 to $1.5 billion needed according to the DOT IG. There is a suggestion that eliminating Amtrak's long-distance trains could help with funding issues, but it's important to note that these routes serve rural areas. The funding problem for Amtrak is significant, with potential savings of around $300 million by eliminating long-distance trains. However, this would lead to $1.4 billion in severance payments to employees over three years, making it impossible for Amtrak to meet its financial obligations and potentially leading to a shutdown. The bill would make it impossible for Amtrak to operate even a limited number of routes due to mandatory debt and labor payments. An amendment was introduced to increase Amtrak's funding by $626 million, offset by reductions in other areas. The House proposed increased funding for Amtrak in FY2005, offset by reductions in other accounts. An amendment passed to allow federal funding for Amtrak routes needing more than $30 per passenger in subsidy. The Senate recommended $1.45 billion for Amtrak, with provisions to restrict certain services and require a new accounting system. The Senate recommended requiring Amtrak to adopt a managerial accounting system to identify costs, allowing surcharges on tickets for capital improvements, and imposing fees on commuter rail operations. The Senate approved funding levels but deleted some provisions, leading to a veto threat from the White House. The conference bill provided $1.315 billion to Amtrak, a 9% increase over the FY2005 enacted level, with provisions for more control over Amtrak's finances by Congress since FY2003. This included funding provided quarterly through the grant-making process and requirements for Amtrak to submit a five-year business plan to Congress. Amtrak submitted a five-year business plan to Congress in April 2003, requesting $1.6 billion annually for maintenance and addressing backlogged needs. Congress has not supported the funding levels requested, and efforts to reauthorize Amtrak have been stalled due to disagreements over federal passenger rail policy. Legislation to reauthorize Amtrak at $2 billion annually for FY2006-FY2009 has been proposed but has not seen further action. Legislation has been introduced to restructure Amtrak and transfer responsibility for passenger rail service to states, but has not been supported. The Senate passed an Amtrak reauthorization bill as an amendment to the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005. The bill was similar to the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2005. The Amtrak reauthorization section was not included in the conference. In October 2005, changes were made by the DOT and Amtrak Board independently. The Board created a subsidiary for the Northeast Corridor and dismissed Amtrak's president. Following a critical GAO report on Amtrak's finances, the DOT imposed additional limits on Amtrak's autonomy, requiring financial improvement plans and annual progress reports to Congress. President Bush's FY2006 budget request for FTA was $7.8 billion, slightly higher than the previous year. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $8.5 billion for FY2006. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended funding amounts for FY2006 in the surface transportation reauthorization bill. The guaranteed authorization level for FTA in FY2006 was set at $8.6 billion, with proposed changes to FTA's program structure. The President's request for FY2006 included new proposals such as the New Freedom Initiative program for persons with disabilities, an Intermodal Passenger Facilities Program, and a National Parks Legacy Project. The FTA's largest transit programs are the Capital Investment Grants Program and the Urbanized Area Formula Grants Program, along with smaller formula and discretionary programs. The Capital Investment Grants Program has three components supporting new transit infrastructure. The Administration requested $1.53 billion for the transit New Starts program and $1.3 billion for the fixed guideway modernization component in FY2006. No funding was requested for the bus and bus facilities discretionary component. The House Committee on Appropriation recommended changes to the program's structure. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended funding increases for the New Starts program, fixed guideway modernization, and buses and bus facilities in FY2006. The authorized levels for FY2006 are $1.5 billion for New Starts, $1.4 billion for fixed guideway modernization, and $822 million for buses and bus facilities. The conference bill funded the overall FTA authorized level for FY2006, transferring $47.8 million from the fixed guideway modernization program to the New Starts account. The Area Formula Program (Section 5307) provides capital and operating funds for urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more. Eligible activities include bus purchases, maintenance facilities, fixed guideway modernization, new systems, planning, and operating assistance. Funding is apportioned based on population and transit service data. For FY2006, the proposed budget was $3.7 billion, with the House proposing $3.98 billion and the Senate recommending $3.7 billion. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $3.7 billion for the Area Formula Program (Section 5307) in FY2006. The authorized level under SAFETEA-LU is $3.8 billion, with new formulas for small transit-intensive urbanized areas and fast-growing states. Operating assistance funding was eliminated for urbanized areas with populations over 200,000, but preventive maintenance is now eligible as a capital expense. Urbanized areas under 200,000 population and non-urbanized areas can use formula funds for capital or operating purposes. The Job Access and Reverse Commute Program received a proposed $164 million in FY2006, up from $125 million in FY2005. MARAD's mission is to promote the development and maintenance of a U.S. merchant marine. The program funding for FY2006 was recommended at $138 million, with the President requesting $294 million for MARAD. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $291 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $323 million for the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program, while the conference bill provided $301 million. The program offers guaranteed loans for purchasing ships from U.S. shipyards and modernizing them to promote growth. The Administration requested $4 million for existing loan administration, with the House and Senate supporting this amount. Conferees agreed on $4 million for administrative expenses. In FY2005, funding for operations and training was agreed upon at $122 million, with most going to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and MARAD operations. The Maritime Security Program (MSP) received $156 million, supporting a fleet of U.S. flag commercial vessels for national defense in emergencies. The Administration requested funding to increase the fleet size from 47 to 60 vessels in support of the Department of Defense during a national emergency. $21 million was requested for the disposal of obsolete vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, with concerns raised about environmental hazards. MARAD has until 2006 to dispose of surplus ships, mainly located in Virginia and California. No funding was requested for the National Defense Tanker Vessel Construction program, with a rescission of $74 million from FY2005. The National Defense Tanker Vessel Construction program was authorized under the Maritime Security Act of 2003. It provides funding for the construction of commercial tank vessels in U.S. shipyards, capable of carrying militarily useful petroleum products for military use in times of war. Funding for FY2006 was not approved, and there was no rescission of the FY2005 appropriation. The National Defense Tanker Vessel Construction program aims to reduce the military's reliance on foreign-flag oil tankers by funding the construction of ships in U.S. shipyards. Controversy surrounds the allowance of up to 10% foreign construction on vessels. PHMSA, created in 2004, ensures the safety of the Nation's pipeline transportation system and hazardous materials. The PHMSA requested $117 million for FY2006 to maintain safety in hazardous material transportation. The House and Senate Committees recommended $116 million with a $14 million limitation on obligations. Conferees agreed on the same funding. RITA, a branch of the former Research and Special Programs Administration, focuses on transportation research, development, and statistics. RITA, a branch of the former Research and Special Programs Administration, conducts transportation-related research and provides training to professionals in safety methods and technologies. The FY2006 budget requested $6.3 million for RITA, with the House and Senate Committees recommending $4.3 million. Conferees agreed on $5.8 million in funding. The legislation ARAA: Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-134) and ATSA: Aviation and Transportation Security Act (P.L. 107-71) created various transportation programs and agencies within the DOT, including BRR, BTS, CMAQ, EAS, F&E, FAA, FAHP, FHWA, FMCSA, FRA, FTA, Hazmat, HPP, HTF, IM, ITS, and MCSAP. The curr_chunk includes various transportation programs and agencies within the DOT, such as New Starts, NHS, NHTSA, NMCSA, O&M, OIG, OST, PHMSA, RABA, RITA, RD&T, RE&D, RSPA, and SAFETEA-LU. SAFETEA-LU: Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (P.L. 109-59) enacted in 2005, included programs like SCASD, Small Starts, STB, STP, TCSP, TEA-21, TIFIA, TSA, and Vision 100. The Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (P.L. 108-176) was enacted in 2003 as part of the transportation budget. Funding for the Department of Transportation (DOT) comes from various sources, with the majority from transportation trust funds and the rest from federal Treasury general funds. Trust funds, like the highway trust fund and airport trust fund, are funded by specific taxes. In FY2005, trust funds made up three-fourths of federal transportation spending, with highway and transit programs receiving the most funding. The DOT appropriations are primarily funded through contract authority linked to the highway trust fund, which allows for funds to be automatically available at the start of each fiscal year. This differs from other federal programs that require new budget authority, as transportation appropriators already have the authority to spend on their largest programs. The Federal Aviation Administration's budget is mainly funded by the airport and airway trust fund, supported by user fees and excise taxes. This fund covers programs like the Airport Improvement Program and Facilities and Equipment program. The Operations and Maintenance component is funded partially by the aviation trust fund and partially by Treasury general fund revenues, which can be controversial. The aviation trust fund is used for capital and research components of the FAA budget, while general tax revenues support Operations and Maintenance (O&M). Economic difficulties have decreased trust fund revenues, leading to a decline in the uncommitted balance since 2001. The GAO reported a decrease from $7.3 billion in 2001 to $4.8 billion in 2002, with a continued annual decrease of $1 billion due to declining revenues since 1999. The aviation trust fund has seen a decline in revenues since 1999, leading to expenditures exceeding revenues since FY2001. Increased spending under authorization bills like AIR21 and Vision 100 has contributed to this trend. GAO warns that even small revenue declines could deplete the trust fund's balances. AIR21 established a budgetary system closely tied to trust fund availability, mandating funds be used solely for aviation purposes. The Aviation Trust Fund must be used for aviation purposes and fully fund FAA's capital programs at authorized levels. Legislation that spends trust fund revenues for non-aviation purposes is out of order. Funding for FAA's Operations and Maintenance and Research budgets is contingent on funding the Airport Improvement Program and Facilities and Equipment program at authorized levels. This budgetary regime may face constraints if trust fund revenues decline significantly. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, legislation changed relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century linked highway program spending to revenue collections, creating a \"firewall\" around highway and transit funding. Additional highway funds can be provided annually through Revenue Aligned Budget Authority. Funding for FAA's programs is contingent on trust fund revenues. The Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) mechanism accrues funds to the trust fund from increased revenues. In FY2003, the RABA adjustment would have caused a drop in highway funding, but Congress set it to $0. TEA-21 changed the role of appropriations committees in determining spending levels for highway and transit programs. RABA was not included in FY2004 and FY2005 appropriations. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU/P.L. 109-59) legislation, enacted in 2005, maintained the general program structure of TEA-21. It guaranteed authorized funding levels and reduced the discretion of House and Senate appropriators by converting discretionary grant programs to formula programs. The transportation budgeting process involves contract authority for trust fund-financed programs like the federal-aid highway program. Prior to TEA-21, changes in spending were controlled through limitations on obligations to align with congressional budget agreements. Contract authority does not involve entering into a contract but ensures funds are available to states as authorized by Title 23 U.S.C. TEA-21 amended the transportation budgeting process by authorizing funds for states without the need for appropriations legislation. It limited the role of appropriations in highway and transit programs by setting obligations levels for FY1999 through FY2003. Highway and transit grant programs operate on a reimbursable basis, with states paying upfront for projects and receiving federal payments only upon completion. Trust fund balances may appear high due to obligated funds not being subtracted from balances. Trust fund balances appear high because funds must remain available to cover future commitments. Both highway and transit accounts have short- and long-term obligations, including payments for current projects and outstanding obligations for future projects. Apportionments are funds distributed to states for formula-driven programs, while allocated funds are distributed administratively. Allocated funds are distributed on an administrative basis to programs under direct federal control, such as the federal lands highway program. The allocation can be to another federal agency, a state, an Indian tribe, or another governmental entity. These terms do not refer to the federal budget process but provide a frame of reference for highway program recipients."
