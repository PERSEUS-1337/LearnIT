    "content": "The \"Financial Security Credit Act of 2013\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Congress finds that the personal savings rate reached historic lows in the past decade, contributing to the severity of the 2007-2009 recession. Many households lack savings or structures to meet their short and long-term needs, with low participation in retirement plans and a significant number of unbanked households in the United States. Approximately 10 million households in the United States are unbanked, meaning they lack checking or savings accounts. 29.3 percent of households do not have a savings account. More than 1 in 4 American households live in \"asset poverty\", lacking savings to cover basic expenses for three months in case of income loss. Up to 4 in 10 households live in \"liquid asset poverty\", lacking cash savings to survive at the poverty line for three months. Savings are crucial for families to be resilient to financial shocks and move up the economic ladder. Even small savings of $2,000 or less can reduce negative outcomes like inadequate nutrition. Children of low-income, high-saving parents have a 71% chance of moving up economically compared to 50% for low-saving parents. Successful pilot programs have been implemented in various cities across the United States. Pilot programs in New York, San Antonio, and Tulsa have shown that low-income tax filers can save money with the right incentives. Promoting savings among all members of society is in the economic interests of the United States. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section, SEC. 36D, which introduces the Financial Security Credit. This credit aims to promote savings among low-income tax filers, as demonstrated in pilot programs in New York, San Antonio, and Tulsa. The Financial Security Credit allows a tax credit for deposits into designated savings products, limited to $500 or 50% of the total amount deposited. Taxpayers must designate the credit for deposit into these savings products on their tax return. The Financial Security Credit provides a tax credit for deposits into designated savings products. The credit amount is reduced based on adjusted gross income, with threshold amounts set for joint returns and individuals. The Financial Security Credit offers a tax credit for deposits into designated savings products, with reduced amounts based on income levels and marital status. Designated savings products include qualified retirement plans, tuition programs, Coverdell accounts, US savings bonds, and certificates of deposit. The Financial Security Credit provides a tax credit for deposits into designated savings products, including certificates of deposit with a duration of at least 8 months, savings accounts, and other approved savings products. Tax refunds designated for deposit into a designated savings product are treated as deposited in the current taxable year. The Financial Security Credit allows tax credits for deposits into designated savings products, which must remain for at least 8 continuous months. Deposits or contributions are reduced by distributions from designated savings products during the testing period. The testing period for the Financial Security Credit includes the taxable year, the 2 preceding years, and the period after the taxable year before the tax return filing deadline. Inflation adjustments for the Financial Security Credit include increasing the dollar amount in subsection (a)(1) for taxable years after 2023 based on the cost-of-living adjustment. No double benefit is allowed under section 25B, and the credit should be taken into account after other refundable credits. The cost-of-living adjustment for taxable years after 2013 increases dollar amounts in subsection (b)(2)(B). The cost-of-living adjustment for taxable years after 2013 increases dollar amounts in subsection (b)(2)(B). Regulations will be issued within 12 months to ensure appropriate reporting requirements for designated savings products. Rounding rules apply for increases in credit limits and AGI thresholds. The curr_chunk discusses reporting of contributions, end of year balances, and earnings from designated savings products. It also mentions provisions for maintenance of deposits and prevention of avoidance. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013. Opening of accounts on federal income tax returns to facilitate savings. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue notifies individuals eligible for a credit under section 36D of the Internal Revenue Code about the option of electronic direct deposit and the financial security credit if they deposit their refund in a designated savings product. Notification is done through a public awareness program by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue, will establish a program to electronically deposit tax refunds into designated accounts held by depository institutions to minimize non-electronic refund delivery. This program will include provisions for refunds to be deposited into a designated account. The program established by the Secretary of the Treasury will allow tax refunds to be deposited into designated accounts with specific parameters and access requirements. Taxpayers can open these accounts with their Federal income tax refunds through insured financial service providers. The program under subsection (b) will be effective for Federal income tax returns starting after December 31, 2013."
