    "content": "The \"Fair Campus Act of 2015\" is a new law that amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to address the treatment of allegations of sexual violence on college campuses. It sets requirements for institutions of higher education to protect victims of sexual violence and investigate and adjudicate allegations of sexual violence. The requirements of the \"Fair Campus Act of 2015\" apply to institutions of higher education receiving Federal financial assistance, excluding foreign institutions. Definitions include \"covered allegation\" for sexual violence acts and \"institutional disciplinary proceeding\" for the process. The \"Fair Campus Act of 2015\" applies to higher education institutions receiving Federal funding. It defines \"institutional disciplinary proceeding\" as the process for investigating and sanctioning covered allegations, including sexual violence acts like aggravated sexual abuse, assault, battery, and rape. The \"Fair Campus Act of 2015\" applies to higher education institutions receiving Federal funding and defines sexual violence acts like rape, sexual abuse, and sexual assault under applicable criminal laws. SEC. 162 outlines education, reporting, and student care strategies for preventing sexual violence in higher education institutions receiving Federal funding. Each institution of higher education subject to this part is encouraged to provide education programs addressing sexual violence, including training on reporting allegations, bystander intervention, and healthy relationships. Access to these programs should be provided to all students annually, with new students promptly informed and able to access the programs upon starting their studies. Each institution of higher education subject to this part should allocate resources for supporting students affected by sexual violence. They are prohibited from designating adult volunteer advisors or employees of student organizations as campus security authorities. Additionally, they cannot deny recognition to a student organization based on the advisor's status as a campus security authority. Each institution of higher education subject to this part must provide annual training on the requirements of this part to campus security personnel, disciplinary committee members, and relevant institutional personnel. Resident advisors in housing facilities supervised by the institution must also participate in this training. SEC. 163. DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS FOR INSTITUTIONAL DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS. SEC. 163 outlines due process rights for institutional disciplinary proceedings, stating that sanctions can only be imposed after a formal hearing or similar adjudicatory proceeding. The institution must provide written notice of the allegation to all parties involved at least 2 weeks prior to the hearing, including details of rights and responsibilities. The institution must provide all relevant details of the allegation, sanctions that may be imposed, and ensure a meaningful opportunity for the accused to admit or contest the allegation. All parties must have access to material evidence, including inculpatory and exculpatory evidence, before any formal hearing. This evidence can include complainant statements, witness statements, electronic data, written communications, social media posts, and demonstrative evidence. Each party must be permitted to participate in the proceedings. The institution must allow parties to be represented by an attorney or advocate at their own expense throughout the proceeding, including the investigation and preliminary stages. Parties must also be able to confront witnesses in a safe manner, including submitting written questions to be asked by the adjudicator during any formal hearing. The institution must ensure that the proceeding is free from conflicts of interest by avoiding commingling of administrative or adjudicative roles, such as victim counselor and victim advocate. In institutional disciplinary proceedings, roles such as victim counselor, investigator, prosecutor, adjudicator, and appellate adjudicator are involved. The institution can set its standard of proof for adjudications. Individuals can challenge sanctions through a civil action in a US district court within one year of receiving the final decision. In a civil action challenging institutional disciplinary sanctions, the court can only rule in favor of the plaintiff if the sanction was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. The institution must provide the administrative record to the court promptly. The prevailing party may receive compensatory damages and court costs. In a civil action challenging institutional disciplinary sanctions, the court can rule in favor of the plaintiff if the sanction was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. The prevailing party may receive compensatory damages, court costs, attorney fees, and any other relief deemed appropriate. Each institution of higher education subject to this part must annually publish procedures for disciplinary proceedings in the Student Handbook. No right to a paid advocate is provided under this section. \"SEC. 164. SPECIAL RULES FOR IMPOSITION OF INTERIM SANCTIONS.\" SEC. 164. SPECIAL RULES FOR IMPOSITION OF INTERIM SANCTIONS. An institution may impose interim sanctions such as temporary suspensions, no contact orders, adjustments of class schedules, or changes in housing assignments to promote campus safety and student well-being. Temporary suspensions for students can be imposed for a specified period. An institution may impose temporary suspensions for students for up to 15 days initially, with the possibility of extensions up to 30 days each if the student is deemed to pose an immediate threat to campus safety. For student organizations, temporary suspensions of up to 10 days can be imposed on their operations. The institution can impose interim sanctions on organizations if they pose a significant risk to campus safety, not for punitive reasons. The interim sanction will end when proceedings are concluded. The institution cannot impose interim sanctions if requested by the alleged victim and law enforcement. The institution can defer to a law enforcement investigation at the request of law enforcement personnel, without violating title IX or any related policies. An institution of higher education cannot punish a student who is a victim or witness of sexual violence for violating the code of conduct if the conduct was reported in good faith. This does not limit the ability to seek civil remedies for such allegations. SEC. 165 preserves single-sex exemption for student organizations. Congress reaffirms the importance of Title IX in providing equal access to higher education. The exemption for single-sex organizations is crucial for offering diverse enrichment opportunities to students. Institutions must not undermine this exemption. Institutions of higher education cannot require single-sex student organizations to waive Title IX protections, including limiting membership based on sex or admitting individuals who do not meet membership requirements. They also cannot compel single-sex organizations to accept organizations or individuals that do not meet membership qualifications. The amendments made by this section prohibit institutions of higher education from requiring single-sex student organizations to waive Title IX protections, including membership limitations based on sex or admitting unqualified individuals. Effective with allegations made after one year from the enactment of this Act."
