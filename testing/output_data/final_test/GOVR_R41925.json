    "content": "The U.S. aerospace industry is crucial to the economy, with President Obama and Congress recognizing its importance. In 2010, aerospace industry shipments were valued at $171 billion, with civil aircraft accounting for half. Boeing is the only U.S. manufacturer of large civil aircraft, while General Electric and Safran produce civil aircraft engines. The U.S. aerospace industry is a significant contributor to the economy, with a trade surplus of $43.6 billion in 2010. It employed 477,000 workers, with a focus on aircraft and engine manufacturing. The industry faces challenges in maintaining its leading position against foreign competition. The U.S. aerospace industry holds a preeminent position in aerospace, with foreign manufacturers aiming to enter the small commercial jet aircraft segment by 2016. Boeing and Airbus face new competitors challenging their market share in small commercial jets. Boeing's CEO acknowledges the need to prepare for increasing global competition in the industry. Several countries are challenging Boeing and Airbus for market share in the commercial airplane industry. Emerging competitors from Brazil, Canada, China, Russia, and Japan are entering the 90-220 seat aircraft segment, signaling the end of the duopoly between Boeing and Airbus. The CEO of Airbus also acknowledges the shift in competition in the 100 to 150 seat aircraft segment. The small commercial jet segment is seeing new entrants challenging the duopoly of Boeing and Airbus. Enders doubts there is room for six competitors and predicts consolidation. Boeing and Airbus dominate the large aircraft market, with Boeing delivering 462 aircraft in 2010, mostly 737s, and Airbus delivering 510 aircraft, mostly A320s. Airbus delivered 510 aircraft in 2010, with 79% being A320s. They booked 416 net orders for the A320 Family and had an order backlog of 2,418 A320 airplanes. Boeing and Airbus face competition in the 90\u2013220 seat range, but new competitors have yet to build planes to rival them. Boeing and Airbus acknowledge the potential for new manufacturers to challenge the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families. The global aircraft manufacturing industry faces potential disruption from new competitors entering the market, particularly in the narrow-body commercial transport aircraft segment dominated by Boeing and Airbus. Bombardier and Embraer lead in regional jets, but may also face increased competition. New entrants will encounter challenges that will determine their success in the large commercial aircraft manufacturing sector. New competitors are entering the large commercial aircraft manufacturing sector, challenging industry leaders Boeing and Airbus. State-owned companies like Russia's United Aircraft Corporation and China's Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China may prioritize government funding over commercial considerations during development. The demand for new narrow-body and RJ aircraft is being driven by rapid market growth in Asia and Latin America, as well as the retirement of current narrow-body fleet airplanes. Additional manufacturers are entering the market, especially in China and potentially India, with plans to build larger aircraft in the future to compete with Boeing and Airbus. New aircraft manufacturers are entering the narrow-body and RJ markets to compete with Boeing and Airbus. Established firms like Bombardier, Embraer, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries are joined by new players like United Aircraft Corporation and Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China. These new entrants aim to create viable international competitors in the aerospace industry. New aircraft manufacturers like UAC and COMAC are partnering with Western suppliers to produce RJs and narrow-body aircraft, posing potential competition to major producers like Boeing and Airbus. Bombardier and COMAC are developing non-overlapping narrow-body airplanes, targeting the fast-growing Chinese market. Embraer is also exploring market opportunities in the aerospace industry. Embraer is considering developing a larger narrow-body airplane to compete in the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. The decision may depend on Boeing's plans for a replacement aircraft for the 737. Narrow-body jets are projected to account for a significant portion of sales and revenues in the coming years. The projected demand for narrow-body airplanes through 2030 suggests that Boeing and Airbus need to stay ahead of competition by upgrading their current models. Boeing announced it would re-engine the 737 by 2020, while Airbus plans to upgrade the A320 family by 2015. Both companies are aware of potential competition and are focused on meeting customer demands. Boeing and Airbus, leading commercial aircraft builders, face high risks in developing new airplanes. Access to latest aerospace technologies allows them to learn from newcomers without compromising safety or competitiveness. Various risks include accessing capital markets, meeting performance requirements, delivering on time, and attracting customer demand to recover costs. Boeing and Airbus face high risks in developing new airplanes, requiring large capital investments to bring a new plane to market. The overall risks associated with launching a new airplane are high enough to be described as \"betting the company.\" For example, Boeing's development costs for its 747 program in 1966 were estimated at $1.2 billion, more than triple its total capitalization at that time. Failure could have brought the company down. Airlines and aircraft leasing companies face similar risks when purchasing new airplanes, as they need to either borrow or lease the aircraft. They do not want to be the sole operator of a plane that is a commercial failure. Fleet complexity for airlines increases costs due to the need for additional parts inventories and training programs. Fleet complexity can arise from design or mergers. Fleet complexity in airlines can arise from design or mergers, leading to a mix of different aircraft types. Legacy carriers often outsource parts of their network to regional carriers using RJs. Bankruptcies and mergers have also contributed to fleet complexity. This complexity is necessary to support various domestic and international operations but can be a weakness during changing business conditions like fuel costs fluctuations or passenger decreases due to economic downturns. After airline deregulation, competition for high density routes led to overcapacity, low passenger yields, and poor financial results. This resulted in airlines abandoning unprofitable routes, leaving some communities with limited service. Low-cost carriers have since emerged with a focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Low-cost carriers like Southwest, AirTran, JetBlue, and Ryan Air have found success by operating fleets of only one or two types of aircraft. This strategy has allowed them to expand into territories once dominated by larger legacy carriers. The complexity of airline fleets has implications for aircraft manufacturers, who compete for business by offering a variety of airplane models to meet customer needs. This competition can lead to bidding wars and unrealistically low prices for launch customers. Aircraft makers often offer airplanes at low prices to launch customers, leading to the need to sell more planes to break even. Airlines that focus on one manufacturer/type of aircraft create a network effect, locking out competitors. Southwest Airlines' strategy with Boeing's 737 has been successful, but the current generation is reaching the end of its product life cycle in terms of technological advancements and efficiency gains. Boeing faced pressure to replace the 737 due to technological advancements and efficiency gains. Southwest Airlines, Boeing's largest customer, pushed for a newer plane sooner. The success of the A320neo added to the pressure. American Airlines ordered 430 narrow-body jets from both Airbus and Boeing, citing the need for rapid acquisition. To acquire planes rapidly, multiple manufacturers from various countries face the challenge of producing a superior commercial product to compete with Airbus and Boeing. The need for efficient planes and a reliable support network is crucial for airlines to generate revenue. Russian and Chinese aircraft manufacturers are improving their reputation for service and parts supply through joint ventures with European or North American partners. A potential partnership between Bombardier and COMAC may help the Chinese manufacturer enter foreign markets. Reputational risk is a concern for manufacturers trying to compete with Airbus and Boeing. It is unlikely for major U.S. or European airlines to purchase expensive aircraft from manufacturers with limited track records and poor after-sales support. Passenger airlines buying Russian-built airplanes may risk alienating customers due to concerns about service quality compared to Boeing and Airbus. Solid service and support from reputable operators are needed to convince airlines and customers of the aircraft's reliability. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to major Russian aircraft manufacturers struggling to compete with Boeing and Airbus. By 2005, the Russian aircraft industry was only producing an average of 10 commercial airplanes per year. Poor after-sales support and maintenance by airlines operating Russian planes were identified as key issues. In 2006, the Russian government reorganized the industry under the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), with significant government ownership. The Russian aircraft industry, supported by the government, is developing new airplanes to compete with Airbus and Boeing. However, there are concerns about the sector's outlook due to aging aircraft needing replacement. Boeing forecasts that the Commonwealth of Independent States will acquire 960 new commercial airplanes by 2029. The Commonwealth of Independent States (C.I.S.) is projected to acquire 960 new commercial airplanes by 2029, valued at $90 billion in 2009 dollars. Most of these deliveries will replace older equipment. Russian manufacturers will face competition from Boeing and Airbus in non-C.I.S. markets. In contrast, China's demand for new aircraft is expected to be 4,330 planes with a market value of $480 billion in 2009 dollars. Russian-owned UAC and Chinese-owned COMAC are seeking international joint venture partners to enhance credibility and reduce risk for airlines purchasing their commercial aircraft. These partnerships aim to establish a reputation for safety, performance, quality, comfort, and price competitiveness. As the new aircraft firms grow in confidence and market share, Russian and Chinese companies may seek higher levels of national support. Russian and Chinese companies are aiming to increase national competency and competitiveness in advanced technologies for commercial aircraft. COMAC, the Chinese state-owned company, emphasizes political superiority, commercial independence, and intellectual property rights in developing narrow-body aircraft. This could lead to a captive domestic market where Chinese airlines purchase COMAC planes, even if they are not as competitive as Western products. The Chinese commercial aircraft industry is forming complex partnerships with foreign companies to enhance domestic capabilities. COMAC's principles suggest a vision of economic independence for China's aircraft industry, promoting domestic production and potentially hindering foreign market access. The Chinese government can pressure airlines to buy domestically produced aircraft, creating a protected market that supports scale economies for local producers. The Chinese market may protect its narrow-body and regional jet aircraft while importing wide-body aircraft. Airbus and Boeing may face challenges in competing without retaliation. Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 dominate the narrow-body market, providing the bulk of orders and earnings for both companies. Boeing and Airbus are the main competitors in the large commercial aircraft market. Boeing is the only U.S. producer of such aircraft, while Airbus is known for producing a complete range of mainline commercial aircraft. Embraer also competes with smaller narrow-body planes. Large civil aircraft can be used for over 25 years before being sold to other carriers. The DC-9 and Boeing 737 have been in U.S. airline fleets for up to 40 years. Manufacturers must consider the entire life-cycle of the plane and the market demand to cover development costs. Airlines incur various operating costs like salaries, fuel, maintenance, and rentals, with changes in expenses driven by capacity. Southwest Airlines' annual report highlights the impact of operating expenses on airlines. The demand for commercial aircraft changed due to exogenous events like 9/11 and the 2008 recession, leading to increased fuel costs. Volatility in fuel prices since 2008 has caused significant problems for airlines, prompting them to increase load factors by reducing available capacity. Airlines responded to increased fuel costs by reducing capacity, retiring older planes, increasing ticket prices, and imposing ancillary fees. Load factors rose from 73.5% to 82.1% between 2003 and 2010, the highest levels ever achieved. The airline industry has seen improved outlook with consolidation and increased revenues from fees. Maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) spending is essential for long-lasting assets like airframes and engines. Engines account for 46% of MRO spending, while airframes make up the rest. Global MRO spending was $42.6 billion in 2010, with many older airliners being retired. The economics of regional jets have changed due to high fuel prices, leading airlines to shift to larger aircraft. Figure 3 shows the average stage length and operating cost per ASM of narrow-body mainline jets and wide-body jets. Older planes like the DC-9 and \"737 Classic\" series have higher operating costs per available seat mile. The FAA and major aircraft companies produce annual 20-year forecasts for the aviation industry. The aviation industry relies on forecasts that consider various factors affecting the market for commercial aircraft. These forecasts guide investment decisions in aircraft production, infrastructure development, and regulation. Boeing and Airbus offer a range of narrow-body models to suit different fleet needs. During the 2000-2010 period, over 11,000 narrow-body units were delivered or on backlog by Boeing and Airbus. Production of narrow-body airplanes remained strong during the 2008-2009 recession due to high demand. Boeing 737 orders averaged 395 per year, with a record 376 deliveries in 2010. Boeing's 737 program plans to increase production rates to 42 planes per month by the first half of 2014. Boeing had 2,101 backorders as of May 31, 2011, requiring nearly 5.6 years to fulfill at current rates. Airbus also had a significant backlog at that time. Airbus had backorders of 2,420 A320 family aircraft at the end of May 2011 and planned to increase production to 42 per month. Demand for new planes is expected to double by 2029, with 56% supporting air service expansion in growing markets and 44% replacing older planes. Boeing projects 85% of the fleet will be delivered after 2010. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines may increase production levels by 20 planes a month. Boeing, Airbus, and Embraer forecasts vary significantly for aircraft deliveries. Airbus projects 1,740 deliveries of very large jets (A380s and 747s) compared to Boeing's 720. The additional sales by Airbus and Boeing for very large aircraft could amount to about $300 billion. Boeing projects that large aircraft sales will amount to $220 million. Airbus, Boeing, Embraer, and Bombardier all project strong demand in the single-aisle, narrow-body category, with Boeing forecasting a significant increase in the number of narrow-body aircraft from 12,100 to 27,750 by 2030. Boeing estimates that the market value of narrow-body aircraft sales will reach $1.95 trillion by 2030, accounting for 48% of the total commercial aircraft market. The single-aisle, narrow-body aircraft segment is influenced by larger and smaller aircraft programs, impacting investment decisions and competition among manufacturers. Manufacturers prioritize projects based on available resources and competitive edge, with a focus on ongoing or potential programs of competitors like Airbus. In the Boeing/Airbus rivalry, both companies pursue strategic goals to outflank market segments by taking on multiple projects to maintain parity or gain a competitive edge. This strategy is not new, as past competition led to oversupply of similar aircraft. With the arrival of Airbus, Boeing faced a stronger European challenger with government support. An intense competition between Boeing and Airbus in large wide-body aircraft absorbed significant resources, driven by rising fuel prices and demand for more efficient, quieter, and less polluting aircraft. Some airlines have urged Boeing to develop a 737 replacement with advanced technologies. Boeing and Airbus are facing challenges with production delays, cost overruns, and technical issues in their 737 and A320 programs. Both companies are hesitant to rush into developing replacement planes despite the need for more fuel-efficient and advanced technology. Airbus has raised concerns about the cost of adapting these technologies to smaller planes. Boeing plans to re-engine the A319, A320, and A321 by the end of 2015 at a cost of $3 billion. CEO James McNerny defended the decision, stating that pursuing a new engine approach without a replacement airplane delivering greater efficiencies would not make sense. However, sales momentum shifted in favor of the re-engined Airbus A320neo. After strong sales of the Airbus A320neo, Boeing faced pressure to offer a re-engined 737. American Airlines negotiated with both Airbus and Boeing for a fleet replacement, ultimately splitting their order between the two manufacturers. Boeing agreed to deliver a re-engined 737 with CFM International LEAP-X engines. The $40 billion order includes 130 A320s, 130 A320neos, 100 737NGs, and 100 737REs. Deliveries will include current generation models. American Airlines split their $40 billion fleet replacement order between Airbus and Boeing, receiving deliveries of A320s, A320neos, 737NGs, and 737REs starting in 2013. Airbus will deliver A320neos from 2017 to 2022, while Boeing's schedule for the re-engined 737 is pending. AA secured $13 billion in financing from manufacturers for the first 230 deliveries, maximizing balance sheet flexibility. CEO Gerald Arpey stated that splitting the order was necessary due to the large number of aircraft needed in a short timeframe. Boeing's decision to re-engine the 737 was influenced by negotiations with American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, who are both expected to place large orders for narrow-body jets. This move will lead to an increase in production capacity for the A320 and 737, potentially extending production into the 2020s. The new entrants in narrow-body production believe their products will have advantages over Boeing/Airbus. High demand for the A320neo at the Paris Air Show and orders from American Airlines and expected from Delta Air Lines suggest a wait-and-see approach by many carriers towards new competitors. The Boeing/Airbus competition has created a perception that current narrow-body offerings are outdated. The 737-700/800/900 series and Airbus A320/A321 models offer larger capacity and greater range. Boeing and Airbus have continuously improved their narrow-body aircraft, such as the 737-800 and A320, with upgrades to engines, wings, cockpits, and interiors. These improvements have allowed for a reduction in cost per available seat mile. The market for 100-149-seat jet aircraft is perceived to be abandoned by Boeing and Airbus, creating an opportunity for new entrants like Bombardier and Embraer. There is a debate on the need for such aircraft in emerging markets, with Chinese companies also potentially entering the market. The market for 100-149-seat jet aircraft is perceived to be abandoned by Boeing and Airbus, creating an opportunity for new entrants like Bombardier and Embraer. Chinese companies are interested in using their C919 as an entry point to build larger, wide-body civil aircraft. The profitability of new, smaller narrow-body aircraft may depend on jet fuel prices, while larger, more efficient turboprops like the Bombardier Q Series and ATR 72 can operate efficiently on short-haul flights. The demand for smaller Boeing and Airbus narrow-body jets has declined as airlines shift towards more efficient models like the Boeing 737-800 and 737-900ER, and Airbus A320s and A321s. Embraer and Bombardier have also entered the market with their E-Jet series and CSeries jet, offering seating capacities ranging from 94 to 145 passengers. The Chinese and Russian narrow-body jets will not compete in the 100-150 seat market but will directly compete against the largest narrow-body jets in the 737 and A320 series. The Chinese COMAC C919 will have 156-190 seats and the Russian UAC/Irkut MS-21 will have 150-212 seats. The entry of Chinese, Russian, Canadian, and Brazilian competitors into the narrow-body segment has forced Airbus and Boeing to respond to increased competition. Airbus is re-engining the A320 to sell a more fuel-efficient airplane before COMAC and UAC/Irkut deliver their first narrow-body jets. Airbus led the way in re-engining the A320 for greater fuel efficiency, securing new orders at the Paris Air Show. Bombardier and Sukhoi gained some orders, while COMAC partnered with Ryanair. Embraer's CEO highlighted the importance of staying competitive in the market. Embraer's CEO, Frederico Curado, acknowledges the challenges of competing with Boeing and Airbus in the narrow-body aircraft market due to their size, existing product line, and quick response capabilities. The decision by Airbus and Boeing to re-engine their A320/737 families has maintained their market dominance and deterred potential challengers. Both Boeing and Airbus are hesitant to take risks in manufacturing more efficient aircraft than their current models. Boeing and Airbus have protected their market dominance by re-engineering their aircraft models. The Chinese market is projected to drive demand for new planes, with single-aisle jets accounting for the majority of deliveries. The Chinese fleet is expected to significantly increase by 2029. The Asia Pacific region is expected to account for a third of new plane deliveries in the next 20 years, with a fleet growth rate of 5.6%. Western aircraft manufacturers are concerned about access to the Chinese market due to intellectual property protection issues. Some Western aircraft manufacturers face challenges in accessing the Chinese market due to intellectual property concerns. Despite the potential boost in sales from joint ventures, like Embraer's partnership with Harbin to manufacture regional jets in China, conflicts can arise with government-owned airlines following directives on purchases. Embraer's attempt to sell its larger E-Jet in China was blocked by AVIC, which saw it as competition to their ARJ21 regional jet. Bombardier and COMAC have signed an agreement to cooperate on future plane development, marketing, and customer support, including sharing parts between the CSeries and the C919. The collaboration aims to increase market share in emerging and mature markets by leveraging their respective expertise and products. The Bombardier CSeries jet targets the 100-149 seat market, with plans for the CS100 and CS300 models. Bombardier forecasts 7,000 deliveries in the next 20 years, aiming to challenge Boeing and Airbus in the market. Bombardier's CSeries jet aims to compete in the 100-149 seat market, with plans for the CS100 and CS300 models. The total fleet of 100-149 seat jets is projected to grow from 5,200 units in 2010 to 9,200 by 2030. Competitors in this segment include Airbus and Embraer. The COMAC C919 is compared to the Airbus A320 and has partnerships with U.S. and European suppliers for critical components. The COMAC C919, developed in a joint venture with AVIC, faces uncertainties regarding its promised efficiencies due to reported weight issues. Major Chinese airlines like China Southern, Air China, and China Eastern have limited their orders, with each committing to purchasing only five C919s. Central-government owned airlines are hesitant to buy from a state-owned company like COMAC, citing the program as risky. General Electric's leasing arm and China Development Bank's leasing subsidiary have ordered 10 planes each. The UAC/Irkut MS-21 aircraft, with three versions ranging from 150 to 210 seats, is Russia's hope for reviving its civil aircraft industry. Costing $6.3 billion to develop, the MS-21 is set to enter service in 2016. The Russian government is funding 40% of the development costs, with the rest covered by loans and UAC. The aircraft will have 40% composite content, weigh 15% less, and be 25% more fuel-efficient than comparable Boeing or Airbus planes. Pratt & Whitney engines will power the MS-21, as well as the A320neo, Bombardier CSeries, and Mitsubishi Regional Jet. The Embraer E-Jets, including the E190 and E195, were designed to fill a gap in the 70-120 seat jet market. They represented a departure from regional jets and beat Bombardier to market with a product that upstaged similar-sized planes. By the end of 2010, 266 orders had been placed for the Embraer E-Jets. Embraer's E-Jets, the E190 and E195, surpassed regional jets in the 70-120 seat market. By the end of 2010, 266 E-190s and 61 E-195s were delivered. Bombardier's CRJ-1000, a competitor, had 9 deliveries and 40 firm orders. The Sukhoi Superjet 100, with a capacity of 86-103 passengers, was delivered to Armavia in April 2011. The Sukhoi Superjet 100, with a capacity of 86-103 passengers, was delivered to Armavia in April 2011 and immediately placed in service. After-sales support for the SJ100 will be provided by SuperJet International, a joint venture formed by Sukhoi and the Italian firm Alenia Aeronautica. Alenia owns 51% and Sukhoi 49% of the joint venture, which aims to provide in-service support for airlines through pilot and technical training, as well as spare parts warehouses. Aviation Week and Space Technology noted skepticism from customers regarding the program's promised in-service support. The COMAC ARJ21, a new Chinese regional jet, is a 90-seat RJ manufactured in partnership with Bombardier. Major subsystems sourced from North American and European suppliers. Project experienced delays with delivery slipping from 2010 to 2011. Originally an AVIC project, transferred to COMAC. Uncertain if regional jets will remain a focus for COMAC due to limited growth in Chinese RJ market. Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), a 70-90 seat plane, aimed at Bombardier/Embraer RJ duopoly. Airbus and Boeing upgrading products with new high efficiency engines. The competition in the commercial aviation industry is primarily between Boeing and Airbus, with Bombardier, COMAC, and Irkut working on new narrow-body planes. While Bombardier and Embraer have proven success, the Chinese and Russians are aiming to compete with Boeing and Airbus. The success of the newcomers remains uncertain, and many airlines may stick with what they know for now. The commercial aviation industry is dominated by Boeing and Airbus, with Bombardier, COMAC, and Irkut entering the narrow-body plane market. The challengers believe success in this segment is crucial for their aerospace industries. The aerospace sector is seen as strategically important by various countries."
