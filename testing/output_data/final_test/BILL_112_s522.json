The Spectrum Relocation Improvement Act of 2011, also known as the act, outlines the rights and responsibilities of Federal entities in the spectrum relocation process. Eligible Federal entities operating government stations on eligible frequencies may receive payment for relocation costs incurred due to frequency reallocation from Federal to non-Federal use, subject to compliance with OMB requirements. Federal agencies exempted under subsection (c)(4) can receive payment for relocating from frequencies designated for reallocation. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act is amended to include public information on relocation plans. NTIA will post detailed transition plans on its website for eligible Federal entities to relocate spectrum use, safeguarding classified information. Plans will include current spectrum use, geographic locations, and steps for relocation. The transition plan for eligible Federal entities will include specific details such as timelines for geographic locations, interactions with NTIA, responsible personnel for relocation efforts, and plans for spectrum use relocation. The Federal entity's plans for using relocation funds from the Spectrum Relocation Fund, procuring equipment and personnel, field-testing new equipment, and risk factors affecting the transition plan must be submitted to NTIA at least 90 days prior to eligibility for payment. The transition plan must be submitted to NTIA at least 90 days prior to being made public on its website. Each plan will be evaluated by a 3-member Technical Panel within 30 days of submission. The transition plan must be evaluated by a 3-member Technical Panel appointed by key officials, including a radio engineer or technical expert, to assess the reasonableness of proposed information, timelines, and relocation costs. NTIA will establish regulations for the Technical Panel's operations after public input and OMB approval. The Technical Panel members will be appointed within 180 days of the Spectrum Relocation Improvement Act of 2011 enactment. No member can serve for more than 3 years. If any required information is classified, the transition plan must explain the exclusion, provide non-classified information, and discuss the risk of classified information. The Spectrum Relocation Improvement Act of 2011 requires NTIA, in consultation with OMB and the Department of Defense, to adopt regulations within 180 days to ensure public information released contains no sensitive or classified information. Additionally, the Act amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to evaluate shared access of spectrum between commercial licensees and federal entities during relocation transition. The Spectrum Relocation Improvement Act of 2011 requires NTIA, in consultation with OMB and the Department of Defense, to adopt regulations within 180 days to ensure public information released contains no sensitive or classified information. The Act also amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to evaluate shared access of spectrum between commercial licensees and federal entities during relocation transition. The amendment includes conditions to define shared access and eligibility for payment of relocation costs. The Spectrum Relocation Improvement Act of 2011 mandates regulations to prevent sensitive information release. It also evaluates shared spectrum access between commercial licensees and federal entities during relocation, defining conditions for eligibility for relocation cost payments. During the transition period, commercial licensees are presumed to use eligible frequencies in areas where federal entities do not. The federal entity must be available for negotiation with licensees and provide classified information to assist in the relocation process. The Federal entity must assist commercial licensees in relocating their spectrum uses within 1 year to be eligible for payment from the Spectrum Relocation Fund. The Technical Panel may allow for a different relocation timeline if necessary. The Federal entity must receive approval from OMB and the Technical Panel to post its transition plan publicly. It must also provide an update to NTIA halfway through the transition period. Critical communications related to the entity's mission are not affected by these requirements. Payments for relocation costs from the Spectrum Relocation Fund to eligible Federal entities must be made within 30 days after the grant of the first license following an auction. A dispute resolution process involving a 3-member board can be initiated if disputes arise over the execution, timing, or cost of a Federal entity's transition plan during the spectrum relocation process. The Spectrum Relocation Fund must make payments to eligible Federal entities within 30 days after the first license grant. Disputes over transition plans can be resolved by a 3-member board within 30 days. The board is assisted by a Technical Panel and appeals can be made to the United States Court of Appeals. NTIA will establish regulations for the board within 180 days of the Spectrum Relocation Improvement Act of 2011. The Spectrum Relocation Fund must make payments to eligible Federal entities within 30 days after the first license grant. Disputes over transition plans can be resolved by a 3-member board within 30 days. Appeals can be made to the United States Court of Appeals within 30 days after a decision is made. Each party is responsible for their own costs and expenses for any litigation related to this process. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on spectrum management capabilities of the NTIA and other Federal agencies, including budget and coordination of resources. The report must be submitted to specific congressional committees by December 31, 2011."
