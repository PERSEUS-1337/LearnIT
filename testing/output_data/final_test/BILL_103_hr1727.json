Congress finds that arson is a serious problem in the United States, responsible for 25% of all fires, leading to 700 deaths annually, and causing $2 billion in property losses. Arson is underreported due to lack of participation in reporting systems. There is a need for expanded training programs for arson investigators. Improved training programs for volunteer firefighters are necessary to detect and preserve evidence of arson crimes. Only a third of suspicious fires are confirmed as arson, highlighting the need for better arson investigator training to identify and prosecute arson offenses effectively. SEC. 25.

A report identifying grants and grantees must be submitted to Congress within 18 months of enactment.
