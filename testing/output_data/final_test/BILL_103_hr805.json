    "content": "The Act titled \"Maritime Navigation Technology and Research Act of 1993\" is also known as the \"Short Title\". It includes findings related to maritime navigation technology and research. The Congress aims to establish a vessel traffic control system equivalent to the air traffic control system. Technology like real-time electronic charts and global positioning system satellites can enhance vessel navigation accuracy. Laser navigation technology can improve harbor safety by providing early warnings to vessels. Improved vessel traffic control systems are needed in United States harbors to enhance safety and protect the marine environment. Real-time tidal and current measurements combined with technology could further improve navigation safety. SEC. 3. RULES REQUIRING STATE-OF-THE-ART VESSEL TRAFFIC CONTROL EQUIPMENT. The Secretary of Transportation must issue rules within 180 days of the Act's enactment, mandating vessels in US harbors to have advanced navigation, communication, and collision avoidance equipment compatible with Coast Guard systems. Certain vessel classes must use traffic control and collision avoidance equipment meeting specified performance standards, including accurate vessel positioning and real-time display of location, speed, track, and projected course. The rules require vessels to have advanced navigation and collision avoidance equipment, including transponders for transmitting data on position, speed, and direction. The Secretary of Transportation will upgrade vessel traffic control systems. The Secretary of Transportation will upgrade vessel traffic control systems to be compatible with required technologies. SEC. 4. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. The Secretary of Transportation is required to conduct research on vessel navigation technologies, including advanced GPS systems, electronic charting, vessel tracking, collision avoidance, and human factors analysis related to vessel accidents and maritime safety. The Secretary of Transportation is mandated to conduct research on vessel navigation technologies, including advanced GPS systems, electronic charting, vessel tracking, collision avoidance, and human factors analysis of hazards associated with new technologies in maritime traffic control. Within one year of the enactment of this Act, a national research plan must be submitted to Congress and implemented to ensure continued advancement in navigation technology for safety over a 5-year period. The Research Advisory Committee is established as per Section 5 of the Act, to oversee research on vessel navigation technologies and ensure continued advancement in navigation technology for safety over a 5-year period. The Maritime Navigation Research Advisory Committee is established by the Secretary of Transportation to provide advice and recommendations on research plans and programs related to maritime navigation. The committee will consist of up to 20 members appointed by the Secretary. The Maritime Navigation Research Advisory Committee, appointed by the Secretary of Transportation, will consist of up to 20 members who are specially qualified individuals not employed by the Department of Transportation. Members will represent various entities such as schools, universities, public port authorities, corporations, associations, labor unions, consumers, and government agencies."
