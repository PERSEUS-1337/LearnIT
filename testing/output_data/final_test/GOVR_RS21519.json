    "content": "The federal government's outstanding debt is subject to a statutory limit codified in Title 31 of the United States Code. Adjustments to the debt limit are typically made by amending the code, often by suspending the limit through a certain date and increasing it administratively. The annual budget resolution sets levels for public debt, revenues, spending, and the deficit, but subsequent legislation is needed for implementation. Subsequent legislation is necessary to implement budget resolution policies, including changes to the statutory limit on public debt. Congress may adjust the debt limit outside the budget resolution process, using various legislative procedures. The Budget Act of 1974 established special procedures for congressional disapproval of debt limit adjustments authorized by certain statutes. Most debt limit legislation originates in the House, with the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee having jurisdiction. Congress finds it challenging to influence fiscal policy through debt limit adjustments. The consideration of debt limit legislation is often controversial and marked by political difficulties, hindering House and Senate action. Ways in which debt limit legislation can be originated and considered in Congress are discussed briefly. The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee can adjust the debt limit at any time. The Senate may originate debt limit legislation, and special rules in the House expedite consideration. In the Senate, debt limit measures are not subject to expedited procedures. In 2009, an adjustment to the public debt limit was considered as part of the economic stimulus legislation. The House and Senate agreed to increase the debt limit through the budget reconciliation process, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009. The budget reconciliation process allows for expedited consideration of legislation that implements budget policies, including changes to the debt limit. Reconciliation legislation in the Senate limits debate, requires germane amendments, and prohibits extraneous matter. Four measures have adjusted the debt limit through reconciliation, such as the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-509). The debt limit has been adjusted through various acts, including the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, 1990, 1993, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The Senate and House have rules regarding the consideration of budget reconciliation bills that affect the debt limit. The Gephardt rule, repealed in the 112th Congress, allowed for automatic engrossment of a House joint resolution changing the statutory limit on public debt after completing action on the congressional budget resolution. The Senate did not have a comparable procedure and would consider such resolutions through the regular legislative process, allowing for nongermane amendments and lengthy debate unless cloture or other limitations were agreed upon. The Senate has historically amended debt limit measures, such as adding budget enforcement procedures in 1985 and \"pay-as-you-go\" enforcement procedures in 2010 to House-originated bills. The House then voted on the Senate-amended measures, as seen in the examples provided. The House-originated debt limit legislation required a vote on Senate-amended bills before reaching the President. Between 1980 and 2010, 20 joint resolutions were initiated under this procedure, with 15 enacted into law. The Gephardt rule was suspended or repealed in 11 years due to legislative changes not being necessary. In four years, both the House and Senate did not complete action on a budget resolution. In the past six years, legislation adjusting the debt limit twice has included congressional disapproval procedures, providing Congress with a second opportunity to consider the adjustment to the debt limit. The Budget Control Act of 2011 authorized increases to the debt limit by at least $2.1 trillion in three installments. If Congress did not enact a joint resolution of disapproval within 50 days, the debt limit would be increased by an additional $500 billion. After the debt limit had been increased by the first $900 billion, Congress had 15 days to enact a joint resolution of disapproval to prevent the third automatic increase in the debt limit. If Congress had enacted the resolution, the Office of Management and Budget would have been required to sequester budgetary resources. The debt limit was increased by $1.2 trillion after Congress failed to pass a resolution to prevent it. The House adopted a disapproval resolution, but the Senate rejected it, leading to the automatic increase. The debt limit increase of $1.2 trillion was not subject to congressional disapproval, but subsequent increases of $500 billion and $1.2 trillion were. Expedited procedures were established for Congress to disapprove the increases, requiring supermajority support to prevent them. In 2013, Congress had 22 days to enact legislation disapproving the suspension and adjustment to the debt limit authorized by the Default Prevention Act of 2013. The House passed a resolution disapproving the suspension, but the Senate rejected a motion to proceed with its own disapproval resolution, effectively halting further congressional action. Since 1940, a total of 96 debt limit measures have been enacted into law, with the number of laws fluctuating over the decades. In the 1990s, 13 laws were enacted, with six being temporary extensions during a budget summit. The 2000s saw nine debt limit laws, and six have been enacted in the current decade. Debt limit legislation has been developed through regular legislative procedures in both chambers, including the House's Gephardt rule and the budget reconciliation process. Out of the 96 measures, 77 were considered under regular legislative procedures. Since 1940, 96 debt limit measures have been enacted into law. In the 1990s, 13 laws were enacted, with six being temporary extensions during a budget summit. The 2000s saw nine debt limit laws, and six have been enacted in the current decade. Debt limit legislation has been developed through regular legislative procedures in both chambers, including the Gephardt rule and the budget reconciliation process. Table 1 provides information on the 28 measures adjusting the public debt limit enacted since 1990, with various procedures used for enactment."
