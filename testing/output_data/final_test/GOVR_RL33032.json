    "content": "The No Child Left Behind Act statute emphasizes three general categories of AYP models for schools or LEAs: group status, successive group improvement, and individual/cohort growth. Critics have focused on the third model, which is the main topic of the report. \"Group\" refers to a collection of pupils identified by grade level and demographic characteristics. The group status model in education refers to a fixed annual measurable objective (AMO) for all pupil groups, schools, and LEAs statewide, with no consideration of changes over time. In contrast, the successive group improvement model focuses on the rate of change in achievement. The successive group improvement model focuses on the rate of change in achievement among groups of pupils in a grade level at a school or LEA. The individual/cohort growth model focuses on the rate of change over time in the level of achievement among cohorts of the same pupils, tracking their progress through K-12 education careers. The group status model of AYP under NCLB sets threshold levels for proficiency in reading and math, while growth models track individual or group progress over time in achieving proficiency. The group status model of AYP under NCLB sets threshold levels for proficiency in reading and math, with AMOs having a starting point and increasing towards a goal of 100% proficiency. AMOs are specific to each grade level and subject, focusing on current year performance of all pupil groups without comparisons to previous years. Under the NCLB, year performance does not play a role in AYP determinations. The \"safe harbor\" model focuses on improvement from the previous year for each assessed group. If a demographic group fails to meet AYP criteria, the school can still meet standards if the percentage of pupils scoring below proficient level decreases by 10% compared to the previous year. The primary focus is on comparing achievement changes from the previous year within specific demographic groups. An individual/cohort growth model tracks the performance of pupils with similar demographic characteristics over multiple years. The change in scores for this cohort is compared to expected growth standards, which can be data-driven or policy-driven. The AYP requirements for schools or LEAs involve measuring the achievement growth of each demographic group of pupils to meet expected levels. Value-added models may include statistical controls to estimate the impact of teachers, schools, or LEAs on pupil achievement. These models focus on factors under the control of teachers, such as background characteristics and past learning. The Tennessee Value-Added Assessment System (TVAAS) is a growth model that focuses on estimating the effects of schools, districts, teachers, or programs on pupil achievement by using statistical controls. The primary model of Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) under the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act is a group status model that sets threshold levels of performance based on the percentage of pupils scoring proficient or higher on state assessments. These thresholds must be met by schools or LEAs overall and for all relevant pupil subgroups to make AYP. The Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) under the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act sets threshold levels of achievement for schools based on the percentage of pupils scoring proficient or higher on state assessments. These thresholds must be met by schools or LEAs overall and for all relevant pupil subgroups to make AYP. The \"uniform bar\" for AYP is determined by the percentage of pupils at the proficient or advanced level of achievement in reading and math, with separate thresholds for each level of K-12 education. The Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) under the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act sets threshold levels of achievement for schools based on the percentage of pupils scoring proficient or higher on state assessments. The \"uniform bar\" must be raised every three years and emphasizes meeting minimum levels of achievement for all pupil groups. The secondary model of AYP is the \"safe harbor\" provision, allowing schools to still make AYP under certain conditions if they fail to meet the usual requirements. The \"safe harbor\" provision allows schools to still make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) under the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act if certain conditions are met. This includes a 10% decrease in the percentage of pupils not at proficient level and progress on at least one other academic indicator. For example, if a school fails to meet AYP due to one pupil group, they can still make AYP if the percentage of that group scoring proficient or higher increases by at least 7%. During the debates over the adoption of NCLB in 2001, the focus was on successive group improvement models of AYP, with little attention given to individual/cohort growth models. The group status model adopted under NCLB resembled the pre-NCLB AYP definition used in Texas. Individual/cohort growth models were not widely used by states at the time to meet accountability requirements. The focus during the debates over NCLB in 2001 was on group improvement models of AYP, with little attention given to individual/cohort growth models. States struggled to meet accountability requirements due to the complexity and lack of resources for annual pupil assessments throughout K-12 education. The report will mainly discuss individual/cohort growth models versus group status models under NCLB. The focus during the debates over NCLB in 2001 was on group improvement models of AYP, with little attention given to individual/cohort growth models. Some analysts argue that the \"safe harbor\" provision is used infrequently because it sets a challenging standard, especially for pupil groups at low proficiency levels. Increased attention has been devoted to the possible use of growth models of AYP under NCLB in recent years. Analysts and administrators are exploring growth models of AYP under NCLB, which may violate certain statutory provisions. In 2005, a growth model pilot program was announced, allowing up to 10 states to use growth models for AYP determinations. In 2007, the cap on participating states was lifted, and regulations in 2008 incorporated this expanded policy. The regulations published in October 2008 incorporate an expanded policy for growth models of AYP under NCLB. States' proposed models must meet specific criteria, including setting an ultimate goal of all pupils reaching proficiency by 2013-2014, reducing achievement gaps among pupil groups, and tracking individual student progress within a state data system. The progress of individual students must be tracked within a state data system for growth models of AYP under NCLB. States must have their annual assessments for grades 3-8 approved by ED and in place for at least one year prior to implementing the models. ED published peer review guidance in January 2006 emphasizing that pupil growth targets should not consider factors like race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Growth targets should be based on achievement standards, and states must have a longitudinal pupil data system to track students across schools and LEAs. The growth models of AYP under NCLB require states to track individual student progress using approved annual assessments for grades 3-8 and one high school year. Models must focus on individual student performance, not demographic groups, and states must have a longitudinal pupil data system in place. According to ED, 20 states have applied to use growth models for AYP determinations under NCLB. North Carolina and Tennessee were approved for the 2005-2006 school year, with 13 more states joining later. Alaska's growth model includes a trajectory towards proficiency within 3 years for grades 4-9 and 2 years for grade 10. Alaska's growth model includes a trajectory towards proficiency within 3 years for grades 4-9 and 2 years for grade 10. In Arizona, the growth model applies to grades 4-8, with pupils in 3rd grade measured based on status only. Pupils with disabilities taking alternate assessments are not included in the growth model in Alaska, but they are included in Arizona. In Arizona, pupils taking the state's alternate assessment will be included in the growth model. AYP in Arkansas will be calculated based on statutory provisions and the state's growth model, with schools meeting AYP standards using either method. Colorado's growth model applies to grades 4-10, excluding pupils with disabilities taking alternate assessments. Proficiency in the growth model is determined by a trajectory towards proficiency by grade 8 or within three years of grade 10. The Delaware growth model calculates AYP each year based on statutory provisions and state's growth model. Schools meet AYP standards if they qualify using either method. Individual pupil performance is tracked annually, with points awarded for changes towards proficiency but not beyond. Average growth scores for schools and LEAs increase steadily to meet AYP standards. The Florida and Iowa models for AYP standards focus on individual pupil subgroups in schools or LEAs, with a growth model determining AYP. Florida's model includes proficient pupils on an individual path towards proficiency within three years. Iowa's model categorizes pupil test scores below proficient into three categories. In Iowa, pupil test scores below proficient are divided into three categories: Hi Marginal, Lo Marginal, and Weak. Students must show Adequate Yearly Growth by moving up a level. Those not meeting AYP will be added to proficient scores to determine if the school makes AYP. Weak students must reach proficiency in three years, Lo Marginal in two years, and Hi Marginal in one year. The growth model will no longer be used by 2014, and all students must achieve proficiency. In Michigan, students are deemed proficient if their test scores are at a proficient or advanced level, or within two standard errors of measurement of the proficiency cut point. The growth model includes a category of students \"on trajectory\" toward proficiency, with sub-levels within each proficiency level. The model does not cover high school students. In Minnesota, students are assessed for proficiency using both statutory models of AYP and a growth model. AYP will be achieved if students meet either criteria. The growth model includes a \"value table\" that gives partial credit for growth below proficient levels, with greater credit for greater achievement growth. The calculations are converted to a scale consistent with standard achievement levels to determine proficiency. In Missouri, students scoring below proficient levels will be considered proficient if they are on track to reach proficiency within four years or by 8th grade. Grades 3 and 8 will be evaluated using the status model and \"safe harbor\" only, without confidence intervals. AYP determinations for grades 9-12 will be based on the current status and safe harbor models. Students with disabilities, including those taking alternate assessments, will be included in the assessment process. The North Carolina policy adds a projection component to the current group status model for students with severe cognitive disabilities. Trajectory calculations will determine if non-proficient pupils are on track to proficiency within four years. Ohio has adopted a similar approach to North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Florida models, where students failing to meet AYP will be evaluated based on their trajectory towards proficiency. Pennsylvania's proficiency requirements for students involve tracking their progress towards meeting the target grade level. If students are projected to fall below proficiency by the target grade, they will not be considered proficient. The growth model will be used if AYP is not met, projecting proficiency within one to three years for each student. If a currently proficient student is projected to score below proficient, they will be considered non-proficient. In Tennessee and Texas, schools have options to meet AYP standards using projection models. Pupils are considered proficient if their test scores are projected to be at proficient levels in the future. High schools in Tennessee are exempt from the projection model. Texas adds a projection component to the group status model for non-proficient pupils projected to reach proficiency by the next \"high stakes grade.\" In Tennessee and Texas, schools use projection models to meet AYP standards. Pupils are considered proficient if their test scores are projected to reach proficient levels in the future. The growth models approved by ED involve supplementing the number of pupils scoring proficiently with those projected to reach proficiency within a limited time frame. In Tennessee and Texas, schools use projection models to meet AYP standards by considering proficient pupils as those projected to reach proficiency in the future. Eleven states follow this approach, with some combining currently proficient pupils with those \"on track\" towards proficiency, while others only consider projected proficiency levels for all pupils. Some states focus on awarding credit for movement among achievement categories up to proficiency. In the 2005-2006 school year, North Carolina and Tennessee used growth models for AYP determinations, with minimal impact on results. Growth models are seen as fairer and more accurate than status or improvement models, as they consider varying levels of achievement among pupil groups. Growth models recognize varying levels of achievement among pupil groups and track progress from different starting points. They attribute pupil achievement to their current school and measure the specific effectiveness of schools and teachers over time. The ability to focus on the specific effectiveness of schools and teachers with pupils they have taught for multiple years, adjusting for non-school influences on achievement and reducing errors due to student mobility. Proponents of growth models argue that status models of AYP make schools and LEAs less accountable for pupil achievement gains. In the short run, schools may prioritize students just below proficient level over the most disadvantaged ones. AYP status model lacks credit for advancing students beyond proficient level. Growth models may set lower expectations for certain groups or schools. Most growth models do not align with NCLB's goal of all students at proficient level by 2013-2014. The current provisions of NCLB may more directly meet the purpose of determining school success in raising achievement levels for all pupil groups compared to growth model alternatives. Pupil mobility among schools and LEAs is significant and impacts all models of AYP. Growth models of AYP offer advantages in tracking pupils through longitudinal data systems, but they may disperse accountability for highly mobile pupils among schools and LEAs. The impact of highly mobile pupils on AYP determinations is limited by NCLB provisions. These models can be valuable for diagnosing pupil needs, educational research, and assessing the impact of teachers and resources on pupil achievement. The advantages of growth models of AYP include tracking pupils through longitudinal data systems, diagnosing pupil needs, educational research, and assessing the impact of teachers and resources on pupil achievement. Current law allows the use of growth models as a separate accountability tool from NCLB requirements, although separate state and federal accountability systems are discouraged but not prohibited. Growth models of AYP are considered more demanding than status or improvement models due to data requirements and analytical capacity needed for a longitudinal data system. States would require specific student data systems to support a growth model, including a unique student identifier, vertically-scaled assessments, enrollment demographics, graduation data, and an audit system. Availability of state data systems is insufficient to determine how many states could currently implement such models. The ED program aims to assist states in developing statewide data systems for growth models. Funding of $24.8 million in FY2005, $24.6 million in FY2006 and FY2007, and $48.3 million in FY2008 has been allocated. 27 states have received awards, with an additional $250 million appropriated for FY2009. The program aims to assist states in developing statewide data systems for growth models through cooperative agreements. States with limited ability to collect, analyze, and report student achievement data will have priority. The program helps states meet NCLB requirements and conduct value-added research while emphasizing data sharing and data security. The growth model pilot program aims to assist states in developing data systems for student achievement, prioritizing states with limited data capabilities. The models approved under the program meet the ultimate goal of all pupils reaching proficiency by 2013-2014, incorporating data-driven or policy-driven growth targets. The growth model pilot program aims to help states develop data systems for student achievement, prioritizing those with limited data capabilities. It is assumed that widespread use of growth models would lead to fewer schools and LEAs failing to meet AYP standards due to differing starting points for student cohorts. The implementation of growth models of AYP may initially result in lower performance thresholds for disadvantaged pupil cohorts, leading to fewer schools failing to meet AYP standards. However, any reduction in failures would likely be temporary as the ultimate goal of all pupils reaching proficiency levels by 2013-2014 must be met. The assumption that growth models improve school productivity by enhancing motivation or providing better support is also considered. The implementation of growth models of AYP may lead to lower performance thresholds for disadvantaged pupil cohorts, potentially reducing the number of schools failing to meet AYP standards. However, there is no direct proof of this occurring. The value of growth models is dependent on valid information on pupil achievement levels, making it challenging to implement them across the K-12 grade span as required by NCLB. Implementing growth models of AYP across the K-12 grade span, as required by NCLB, may face challenges due to variations in curriculum and assessments for senior high school students."
